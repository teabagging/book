Brite (just a little)...Caitlin R. Kiernan's &quot;Silk&quot; is an astounding piece of surrealistic supernatural fiction. Kiernan's debut puts her right up there with the best! So far, I've read &quot;Silk&quot; three times and it keeps getting better. Her exquisite prose (somewhat reminiscent of Kathe Koja) and skillful characterization make this a thoughtful and satisfying novel. I bought &quot;Silk&quot; after reading Charles deLint's review in &quot;Fantasy and Science Fiction.&quot; He wrote that every now and then a book comes along that restores his faith in the genre and that &quot;Silk&quot; was one of those rare books. I couldn't have said it better!"},{"Title":"Silk","review":"Silk was the best horror novel I read in 1998 (and I read *everything*). I became a fan of Caitlin Kiernan's work through reading The Dreaming (her comic) and her short stories. Silk is everything I would have expected from her first novel and more!"},{"Title":"Silk","review":"I've gotten kind of jaded about books that have recommendations on the cover from other authors - they rarely ever deliver. Silk is a definite exception. I picked it up because I'd read some of Kiernan's short stories and liked them and although I was intrigued by quotes on the cover by Clive Barker, Neil Gaiman, and Peter Straub, it was standing in the bookstore reading the prologue that hooked me. Kiernan's prose is fabulous, her characters real. Silk is a very, very scary book (especially if you're afraid of spiders...), but it's also a thought-provoking look at subcultures and life in the modern South, as well (I used to live in Atlanta). You absolutely won't be disappointed by this book!"},{"Title":"Silk","review":"Before posting a review in which you claim that a book is disappointing, you should bother to learn how to spell disappointing...Or, at the very least, be consistent in your misspelling, if you're going to use the word twice.But, anyway, SILK is a marvelous novel and has been receiving numerous awards and accolades from the dark fantasy community. So far, the novel has garnered the B&amp;N Maiden Voyage Award for Best First Novel *and* the International Horror Guild Award for Best First Novel, as well as tying for second place in LOCUS' online reader's poll for best horror novel of the year. It has also been nominated, in the best first novel category, for the Bram Stoker Award. Glowing reviews have appeared in LOCUS, F&amp;SF, FANGORIA, CARPE NOCTEM, and many other zines and newspapers. This is not a book or an author to be dismissed lightly.A skillful blend of an older style of &quot;ghost&quot; story (there are echoes of such masters as M. R. James, H. P. Lovecraft, and Algernon Blackwood) and a distinctly modern prose (think William Faulkner or William Burroughs), this is an exceptionally creepy and touching book (even if you aren't afraid of spiders!)."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"Silk is a story centering around a group of younger adults whose lives take a turn toward the supernatural side after something inhabbiting the mind/body of a troubled shop store owner Spyder Baxter begins to come out into reality and cause dark, terrible occurences towards the people around her. The book carrys a very dark dreamlike feel throughout it's entirety, and has a great cast of characters highly relateable towards the more underground music lifesyle. While sometimes confusing in the supernatural aspect as to what is actually happening and what's due to the characters' drug use(hallucinagens and heroin to be precise}, the book's characterization and originality more than make up for it. While I am a big fan of Caitlin's work on The Dreaming from Vertigo comics, Silk is a solid novel that stands on its own and is well worth the read."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"This would have to be one of the few truly Southern Gothic books that Ive read. Unlike some books that try to obtain a sense of fractured reality through semi-poetic verse and allegory, this one manages to keep the story cohesive. The story, however, is not the obvious one that it appears at first. At first Silk seems to follow the paths of a handful of young people in the underground southern scene, but by turns becomes the story of one woman's apparent insanity. The catch is the other characters are being dragged into whatever she is experiencing. Ms. Kiernan manages to create some rather troubling late night reading material with this."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"Silk is one of those novels that takes you away from your everyday life and forces you to fall in love with the characters so much that you will actually miss them when you have finished the last page. And more than that it is a brilliant literary work that places Kiernan in the august company of Poe, Lovecraft, Rice and King. The ragtag group of twentysomethings that populate this book are not a Generation X cliche but reflections of real people with real lives. That is until they stumble into a supernatural world of rage and sorrow that change them forever. It will change you as well."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"There are very few authors today capable of conveying the sort of dread and subtle creepiness that make SILK such an amazing and utterly outstanding novel. I am astounded at Kiernan's ability to draw the reader into her nightmarish world, one that is at once everyday and bizarre. SILK really does transcend the genre; while this is certainly one of the &quot;spookiest&quot; novels I've read in years (think Ray Bradbury meets Mark Childress), there's a lot more here than simple ghosts and goblins."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"This book is fantastic, especially if you're into writers like William Burroughs, Thomas Tessier, Kathe Koja, Poppy Z. Brite, Thomas Ligotti, Katherine Dunn, Douglas Coupland, or Jonathan Carroll. Silk hits you in the head and the gut like a chunk of concrete wrapped in velveteen. It's smart, brutal, and beautiful. From start to finish, Kiernan draws us into a surreal (or hyperreal) world, and if the ending seems inconclusive, you probably weren't paying close enough attention - Kiernan is one of the powerful voices of her generation!"},{"Title":"Silk","review":"Even though I don't usually read horror, I thought this was a really brilliant novel. It deserves a much wider audience, in my opinion, than the people who are likely to be lured to it by the cover blurbs from Clive Barker and Peter Straub. Caitlin Kiernan's writing is almost word perfect, and I give this book two thumbs (and both big toes!) up."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"Caitlin Kiernan's novel Silk paints a vivid portrait of the punk and goth scenes in a post-industrial Southern city. That should be intriguing enough for any reader, but it gets better. And better. And better. Silk weaves a disturbing and subtle tapestry of psychological and not-so-psychological horror and mystery, in what has to be one of the most intelligent horror novels I've read in a long, long time. I don't often fall this in love with an author. I did with Ray Bradbury, and Kathe Koja, and Thomas Ligotti. William Burroughs and Angela Carter. That's the sort of impact that Silk has had on me. Caitlin Kiernan's greatest strength is the sheer beauty and raw power of her prose, and her knack for inventing characters as alive as her language. This is a dark novel, and silver linings are few and far between, but it's also a breathtakingly honest novel. One of the best books I've ever read, truly."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"Rev'd by Paul J. LegerskiAfter reading a bunch of Caitlin's short fiction, it was with great anticipation upon opening her first published novel, SILK. I was not disappointed. SILK centers around a charismatic female leader named Spyder. Her fledglings worship the ground she walks on because she has told them stories...stories about why they are all meant to be together. It has to do with a war in heaven and the angels that were kicked out. Spyder is then turned on by her friends and befriends another group of musicians and hangers-on. The most stunning of these people, is Nikki Ky. She is on a trip running away from her past and parents, not to mention a lovers suicide. One of the most symbolic scenes is Nikki taking out her left nipple ring and wading into the ocean to &quot;cleanse&quot; her soul. She almost drowns and is saved by a mysterious woman. Theirs also a rock band named Stiff Kitten that plays a large part in this book. I must say that the first 200 or so pages may be the best I've read in 5 years. The prose is crisp, the plots have an underbelly of the grotesque and the characters are so fleshed out that I felt the stinging of the saltwater ocean burning Nikki's piercing. Not to mention that Caitlin can write so well that she makes coffee making interesting. The only problem I had with the novel was the ending. The whole fabric of the plot is weaved into this story about the war in heaven but we never get to see or hear the entire story and its ramifications. And what happens to Spyder didn't hold true for me. Sorry if I'm not giving any detail, but to tell more will spoil the book. For those that need comparisons, mix Poppy Z. Brite's characters with an equal dose of Kathe Koja prose(without the punctuations). But that does not do Caitlin's novel justice. Highly original and just touching what she can do in a novel-length work. More is highly anticipated. Highest recommendation."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"I don't know if I would have ever read this book had I not read Alabaster last year -- that was so good that when Silk popped up on my recommended reads list I didn't hesitate to buy it. But when I read it it was obviously a debut novel -- the writing was a bit choppy and lacking in the confidence I was familiar with from her later work -- but it still had enough of a hook in it for me to keep reading all the way to the bitter end. Luckily, I didn't have to wait 10 years for the sequel (as did everyone who read Silk when it first came out in 1999), and I read that last week as well -- it's much better than Silk -- but you have to read both of them to get a taste of what's really happening, to invest yourself in the characters.If you haven't read any Kiernan, I would recommend that as you read this book you keep in mind that she has a whole fantasy world developed in her head, and is only allowing you to see snippets of that world as you go along. Keep reading her work, and more will be revealed. And, bonus points, she gets better as a writer along the way. [Not to say that the writing in Silk is bad -- far from it; it's just not as good as Kiernan's later work]."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"You would think that there would be a lot of horror novels written for the goth subculture, but except for an endless stream of cheesy vampire novels there isn't much of a literary side to it. Fortunately Caitlin R. Kiernan appears to be a genuine goth writer and not too much of a vampire freak. \\"Silk\\" makes many insider references to goth music and even weaves a goth band into the narrative. Although that is primarily why I read this book it did not disappoint as a horror novel. I liked the mainly psychological nature of the horror but suggesting that peyote can unleash such horror is just amusing."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"I simply loved this book. It was imaginative and very detailed and the character of Spyder Baxter was amazing. This book and Lost Souls make for a perfect pairing with their damaged characters and sense of lost and longing. Wonderful."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"This book has multiple excellent qualities all working brilliantly together for a brilliant whole. It's got complex and interesting characters, a wonderful atmosphere, and pure, good, fantastic ideas. Like all great fantasy fiction, Silk crawls under the skin and feels around. It does the wonderful trick of having you look at the face of something monstrous and alien and seeing something human. A brilliant book by a brilliant author."},{"Title":"Silk","review":"Caitlin Kiernan's Silk is a book about the darknes and corruption that exists just below the surface, perhaps just below all surfaces, just out of sight. The basement of a dilapidated old house, the skin of our bodies, trapdoors that have been nailed shut, repressed memories, the subconcious mind - all these are merely a mask drawn over a terrifying, half-suspected reality. No doubt, Kiernan has one of the strongest, most distinct voices in weird and horror fiction today and, more importantly, she has the skill to back it up. Silk is a deliciously-written book, an absolute word-storm. I'm not used to discovering fantasy and horror authors who are willing to go beyond telling the same old, scary stories, the same safe, predicatble rubbish of vampires and murderous psychos, and chart new territories of the bizarre. But that's what Silk does. This is not a book to miss. Five stars!!"},{"Title":"Silk","review":"Almost everything about this book is surprising. From its rich and inventive use of language to the depth of its characters, from the sublty of its terrors to the author's ability to describe goth and punk subculture without romanticizing. It's hard to believe this is a first novel. It's not hard to believe it's an award-winning first novel. Silk is a dark wonder. I recommend it very strongly!"},{"Title":"The Art of Alice in Wonderland","review":"What a dissapointment this book was, having bought it online, I was unable to flip through it's pages first. If you want to seriously study the various illustrators of Alice, don't bother with this book.First, none of the illustrations are captioned and you have to look up the credits in the back. Yet the foldout page with pictures of Alice from many illustrators is not credited at all, including a lovely image by Mabel Lucie Attwell (who's images do not appear any where else in the book.)Even the cover credits is missing one of the illustrators.Secondly, one gets the feeling that many if not most of the images are cropped (many times in odd ways) for the sake of their precious layout. Others have touted the design of the book as being reflective of Alice's quirky world. I rather suspect the designer was trying to be trendy, with grunge-like fonts, color overlays on many of the illustrations and some used behind the text as backdrops. It just makes for difficult reading. I didn't even like the uncoated paper it was printed on.And lastly, don't expect any discussion about the illustrations or the illustrators that created them. Even the great Tenniel himself was only alotted a paragraph or two. The only other discussion is on pages 80-81. Arthur Rackham was allowed a paragraph (and only one image) as well as Barry Moser, yet none of Moser's work was included in the book! Go figure.If you really want to look at some lovely Alice images, you'd be better of with &quot;Alice's Adventures in Wonderland -A Classic Illustrated Edition&quot; compiled by Cooper Edens. At least you get to see the whole image the way it was intended."},{"Title":"The Art of Alice in Wonderland","review":"It is always a surprise to learn how many artists apart from John Teniel have illustrated Lewis Carroll's ALICE stories: an effort to put some of them together in a single volume is welcome. But regrettably, THE ART OF ALICE IN WONDERLAND represents a nifty idea gone wrong -- indeed, run amuck! The book's overblown, frenetic, garish, incoherent, irrational design is a severe irritant and makes it extremely difficult to follow and read the text, which, itself, is not bad. The quality of the color reproductions of the ALICE art is really dreadful: they're fuzzy and washed out. Furthermore, it's necessary to consult notes (thorough and well done) at the back of the book in order to identify particular artists -- always an irksome process. For the reasons cited, I have to give the work an F: only the most dedicated ALICE groupies need bother with it. This poor effort is uncharacteristic of Smithmark, which generally issues carefully executed, well-produded titles on unusual topics at very attractive prices."},{"Title":"The Art of Alice in Wonderland","review":"It is not for those who have not read the book itself nor watched the movie. It is a book for those who question the 'queer ways' of Lewis Carroll's masterpiece. Alice in Wonderland has been one of those classic books that most took for granted, but it is not really just for kids who'd be amused by the cheshire cat and all the other interesting characters. The book, The Art of Alice in Wonderland, rekindles what the real sense of this wonderful story is: It is written by an adult to let kids see and understand the humor of the ways of adults. The book analyzes the representation that Lewis Carroll gave to each of the events and the characters. It is a not as fictitious as most think. There are events in the book that are actually seen in our lives, often unconciously by most of us. The author shows how the conversations between Alice and the other characters and the way Carroll manipulated words were not only used as ornaments but as priceless lessons taught by a marvelous teacher. It also explains how the author came up with such a colorful world and how he built a world for children that adults should come to know about and eventually learn from. I must admit though that it is quite a disadvantage for the reader to be confused by the book's artistic layout. Although the layout was very much in line with the book's imaginary, chaotic and unique setting, it prevents more serious readers and ones who have difficulty to follow mazes, to read what I can say is but just a small and yet important part of what Lewis Carroll really wanted to convey. The Art of Alice in Wonderland is not just a book for those who'd like to see the different ways Alice has been interpreted by artists. It shows the art of the writer, Lewis Carroll himself, in revealing to us in a satirical and very queer way that sometimes the personalities that pass us by are sometimes nothing but a pack of cards."},{"Title":"The Art of Alice in Wonderland","review":"I was disappointed as soon as I saw this book. I have just now, after several months, begun to look at it more closely.At first, I thought that the art that was included in the book was from some kinds of modern cartoonish sources that didn't show the variety of assays made at this subject over the years. On second look, these are many many different applications, including advertising, which is interesting after all.Also, I was disappointed to see that the book was filled with a breathy essay that was, as far as I could see, a superficial rehash of things I have read many times already. But, I see that it is more a discussion of the many venues that have taken the character images in &quot;Alice&quot; for inspiration. Still, the copy is very difficult to read because of graphic issues. I think this book might be a paean to Madison Avenue, etc. Not the usual voice one hears discussing our &quot;beloved&quot; Alice, but potentially a fresh angle.But, in closing, the final disappointment, though the title of the book gives the art first billing (and the ruminations of our author no mention at all), all attributions as to the sources of the different representations are not captioned, nor are they in the body of the essay, but are in an appendix at the back of the book. Tacky."},{"Title":"The Art of Alice in Wonderland","review":"This is the most stimulating, and fun book about Alice and her art that I have seen. Alice's topsy-turvy world and it's inhabitants are vividly depicted in a book layout that is similar to the shifting, colorful, and unexpected aspects of the art and the stories. I found it to be very informative and entertaining, and enjoyed the rich variety of interpretations different artists bring to these amazing stories."},{"Title":"The Art of Alice in Wonderland","review":"Personally I own and particuarly enjoy this title. It displays an array of Alice-art and text in a graphically overwhelming sense that I believe is very close to the nature of the story itself, very anti-logically yet pleasingly."},{"Title":"Edward Albee: A Singular Journey: A Biography","review":"This summer I have been in an acting workshop.

There is the real Albee, a nasty little fellow with nothing worthwhile to say in real life. There is the other Albee, an invention of publicists and reviewers whose name is on several plays that now seem insignificant .

Wrong! It was Zoe Caldwell who won. One wonders if he makes a mistake like this if there are a lot more errors. Check your facts man."},{"Title":"Edward Albee: A Singular Journey: A Biography","review":"Gussow seems more intent on showing how pleased with himself he is for befriending the playwright decades ago than in composing a serious biography here. Albee's various flaws and ups and downs are all neutralized in the name of friendship. A disappointing bore of a book."},{"Title":"Edward Albee: A Singular Journey: A Biography","review":"Gussow admires and likes Albee and one supposes that is a good thing, but one wonders if that is enough to recommend this author for the job of writing Edward Albee's biography. Many will say so, of course, because of Gussow's credentials as a theater buff. If you see playwriting as a branch of the show biz trade, then surely Gussow is your man, but if prefer to speak of Ibsen and Chekhov in the same breath as Zola and Turgenev, that is, if one sees plays as part of literature, and wishes to speak of the theater beyond box office receipts and stardom, then maybe this star-gazing journalist could be bettered. I got tired of Gussow's praise for Albee's so-called political consciousness coupled with his admiration for Albee's talent for making real estate deals. Hypocritical radical chic seems so very yesterday. Albee's career follows more or less the course of Tennessee Williams and Noel Coward; early fame was followed by years of critical scorn and popular indifference. Unlike them, Albee has had a late-term come back. Revivals open annually as do new works. Yet, what somebody has to do is evaluate their worth. Saying it is all wonderful simply will not do."},{"Title":"Edward Albee: A Singular Journey: A Biography","review":"Gussow's biography of Edward Albee is a more-than-fair depiction of the playwright. It is a concise overview of the creative mind behind the American Absurdist movement. It steadily charts Albee's childhood, schooling, and progress in the theater. Gussow goes to great lengths to cite the history of Albee's works, their reception, and the performers who acted in them. It balances criticism with accolades while shying away from any type of theoretical correlation between Albee and his works (as most literary biographies lend themselves via the Formalistic approach). Though incomplete (Albee is still writing steadily), it is a great introduction into the life of one of the foremost playwrights in American theater."},{"Title":"Edward Albee: A Singular Journey: A Biography","review":"This is a competent rather than inspired biography. It offers much useful detail about Albee's plays and is especially good at tracking what critics, friends, cast members, and Albee himself have written about each one. This amalgam of views best illumates \\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf.\\" Unfortuantely, the book offers little detail about Albee's lovers or the texture of his sexual and emotional life. For instance, in mid-career, he lived for years with Bill Pennington. We learn only that this man was an interior decorator. We never learn about his looks, background, personality, or influence on Albee; there's not even a photograph. Lacking such physicality, the book often seems arid. Instead of amassing such details, Mel Gussow often prefers to quote long letters. I wish he had gone deeper into Albee's sexuality, to understand how it helped determine the style and force and distinction of Albee's work.Gussow has assembled excellent materials and extensively interviewed his subject (between 1994 and 1999), but I did not come away from his biography with a sharp or abiding sense of the playwright. Strangely, secondary figures such as composer William Flanagan and director Alan Schneider emerge as more luminous than Edward Albee."},{"Title":"Edward Albee: A Singular Journey: A Biography","review":"I found Mr. Gussow's book to be illuminating, inspiring and enjoyable, a deep investigation of one of America's greatest playwrights. The author's longstanding personal relationship with Albee takes the reader to levels another biographer would not be privy to. Mr. Gussow's access to Albee and his contemporaries combined with his vast background as a theatre critic have contributed to this multi-dimensional portrait of Albee both as man and artist, and the relationship between these two facets of Albee's personality. As a playwright, I was particularly fascinated by the details of each play, the writing process and production history. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in Albee and the American theatre, its past and its future."},{"Title":"Edward Albee: A Singular Journey: A Biography","review":"I took Engineering English at the University of Michigan when the movie Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? was playing in an Ann Arbor theater, so I saw it as an assignment, but one of the guys in the class said he did not go to see the movie because it had dirty words. This book on Edward Albee calls W. D. Maxwell, vice president and editor of the Chicago Tribune, a self-styled censor for thinking the play was filthy. Maxwell was on the Pulitzer Prize advisory board, and the vote of the fourteen members was split. Culture had become extreme, and I was taking it in as a new reality nobody wanted to fall into. The book is astounded:The advisory board's decisionwas a shocking disregard ofthe advise of its expert juryand also a radical attack on the theater.. . . some board members had voted against the play without seeing it.Albee's play was a shocker,especially because it was on Broadway,an arena known more for its timidity than its temerity.The play was censored in Boston . . ."},{"Title":"Edward Albee: A Singular Journey: A Biography","review":"A compelling and insightful look at the Pulitzer-winning playwright who has gone through periods of acclaim and dismissal. Mel Gussow's book shows how Albee's family history informs many of his plays. Gussow gives us a clear-eyed appraisal of Albee's successes and failures, both personal and professional. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Edward Albee: A Singular Journey: A Biography","review":"Indeed this kow-towing book seems to have been written merely to please Albee's friends in the Hamptons, his family (what there is of it), and Albee himself. I sure hope Mr. Gussow got a party out of it."},{"Title":"Edward Albee: A Singular Journey: A Biography","review":"I have to agree with the first reader that this so-called biography lets theater-lovers down. Albeem surely a fascinating and complex man, is presented here as a sort of middle-of-the-road human being, content in his golden years the way gray-haired folks are in Geritol commercials. Truly an insult not only to the reader, but to Albee himself."},{"Title":"Edward Albee: A Singular Journey: A Biography","review":"This stilted recreation of a volatile and rich life is at odds with itself from the get-go. Albee, one of our greatest theatrical talents, deserves better. This attempt won't create interest in him for future generations. This is the sort of book that kills off spontaneity and learning."},{"Title":"Edward Albee: A Singular Journey: A Biography","review":"I'm amazed at some of the one star reviews for this book. (Well, maybe not that amazed. Anyone concerned over whether Elaine Stritch or Carol Burnett won a Tony might best spend their time under a hairdryer reading Cosmo rather than a serious book like this.) Gussow, courtesy of his friendship with Albee, provides priceless insights into the source of many of his works, how they spring from his life, his relationship with his mother. He is even handed in evaluating Albee's plays, carefully explaining why many of his plays failed to please critics and audiences. Albee has been candid with Gussow, and his candor is of great value to aspiring writers. We see the links between personal life and artistic creation. This is a MAJOR study of an important playwright, required reading for all serious theatre folks. The one complaint: Gussow's closeness with Albee, while never seriously compromising the book, does make one sense kid gloves being used from time to time. That aside, this is a riveting look at one writer's life."},{"Title":"Edward Albee: A Singular Journey: A Biography","review":"Albee, the playwright of \\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?,\\" and other plays, is given a deluxe biographical treatment here from a writer who has known him for almost forty years...and sometimes worships him a little too much.Albee was adopted by a wealthy, yet emotionless set of parents. His father, Reed, was absent, and his mother, Frankie, was cool and detached. This upbringing, where he was seen more as a possession than a family member, would of course affect his writings. Constantly kicked out of schools, and never graduating from college, Albee turned to writing, his first success being \\"Zoo Story.\\"\\"Zoo Story,\\" a short play about a fateful meeting of two men in a park, received mixed notices from assorted playwrights and critics. Here, biographer Gussow overextends his protection of his subject too much. He dismisses the honest critiques of two playwriting giants- Thornton Wilder and William Inge, because they did not understand or like Albee's works. However, a bland positive response by Samuel Beckett is treated like a Dead Sea Scroll, to be picked apart and treasured. I have read \\"Zoo Story,\\" and it is wordy and preachy.Albee's next big success was \\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?,\\" which was turned into a powerhouse film by Mike Nichols. Again, Gussow is flagrant in his criticism of someone involved with the film in order to placate Albee, and here, Nichols. The film's screenwriter, Ernest Lehman, is harshly criticized for opening the play slightly, yet just copying Albee's play. The bio's author, and Albee, make a point of needling Lehman's screenwriting credit on the film. Yet, Elaine May copied the French film \\"La Cage Aux Folles\\" word for word, adding what could be described as copious scenes at best, then took a big giant screenwriting credit for Nichols' \\"The Birdcage.\\" Watch both films back to back sometime, it is eye opening.Gussow also fumbles in his outline of Albee's life. In Albee's less successful years, he is writing weird experimental plays with subjects like a man with three arms, and one play where two of the characters are sea creatures. After mounting all of these failures, Albee is defended endlessly by Gussow, who suddenly contributes an entire chapter about Albee's alcoholism. The alcohol is both a reason his plays were not celebrated, and a defense of the brilliant man.The entire beginning of the book chronicles the complete lack of love Albee's parents had for him, yet the death of Albee's father is glossed over, barely mentioned. I had to reread the sentence a few times, since no followup is made about Albee's reaction. A whole chapter is devoted to his mother's demise, and her revenge on her own son in her will. More is written about one of his former lovers and honest critics, a frustrated musician. This \\"A Star is Born\\" redux is written about nicely.Gussow does do well in describing Albee's assorted forays into theater, as playwright and director. Dirt about Donald Sutherland and Frank Langella is dished around. The bio's author is honest in Albee's lacking skills as a director, coming to the theater as a playwright and not an actor.Albee, who prefers to be called a writer who is gay, as opposed to a gay writer, also has kind words for his longtime partner of over twenty years. Albee says a gay writer writes about being gay, whether the work is good or not is moot, since the writer knows the subject and is putting in the final word. A writer who is gay is not tied down to just homosexual topics, and is free to explore society without audiences looking for gay subtexts that do not exist. \\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\\" is a seering look at two heterosexual couples, the sexuality of the playwright is nonessential in light of his characters and their actions.Gussow wisely keeps talk of Albee's lesser known plays, and the ones readers probably have not read anyway, to a minimum. Albee's triumphant comeback play, \\"Three Tall Women,\\" is covered extensively. The play is about his mother, and so much more.Reading this biography will make you curious to seek out some of Albee's other plays, just to see what makes him tick. Over seventy now, he is definitely an interesting man, and Gussow does catch that fact better than anything.I recommend this book to theater lovers, and any writer who needs a little inspiration."},{"Title":"Edward Albee: A Singular Journey: A Biography","review":"With all due respect to Tennessee Williams, Arthur Miller, Lillian Hellman and William Inge, Edward Albee is the most important American playwright to emerge since Eugene O'Neill. I don't say best because \\"best\\" is too subjective a term to be applied to the arts. Albee is important because of the influence his work has had on playwrights such as Arthur Kopit, Sam Shepard, John Guare and David Mamet. Mel Gussow has produced an indelible portrait of this artist. One revels in Albee's current success - The Tony Award for \\"The Goat or Who is Sylvia?\\" and a Pulitzer Prize for \\"Three Tall Women.\\" However, what Mr. Gussow's biography illustrates brilliantly is that Albee hasn't staged a \\"comeback.\\" Indeed, Albee never went anywhere - it was the audience and the critics that abandoned Albee. Throughout the past forty years Albee has continued to produce masterful plays - award winning plays - \\"A Delicate Balance,\\" \\"All Over,\\" \\"Seascape\\" and \\"The Lady from Dubuque\\" - plays which are finally gaining the recognition and stature they deserve.The personal story is here as well. Albee was adopted and raised by people who were emotionally aloof to the needs of a gay adolescent. The relationships with Terrence McNally and Jonathan Thomas (his companion for the past thirty years), friendships with John and Elaine Steinbeck, Carson McCullers, William Flanagan, Alan Schneider and all those leading ladies from Uta Hagen, Colleen Dewhurst, Jessica Tandy and Irene Worth to Marian Seldes, Rosemary Harris, Elaine Stritch and Maggie Smith. The story of how the Pulitzer Prize board denied him the honor for \\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\\" even after the prize jury had voted unanimously for the play. It's all here - warts and all - best of all is the happy ending."},{"Title":"Edward Albee: A Singular Journey: A Biography","review":"The primary strength of the book is that the author has known Albee since _Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?_ opened on Broadway. This isn't written by someone who just decided to do a book but by someone who has been preparing to write it for years without knowing it. There's depth here, insight into the plays and the man behind them."},{"Title":"Edward Albee: A Singular Journey: A Biography","review":"Mel Gussow takes the reader on a singularly intelligent, yet emotionally astute journey into Edward Albee's works and life. He also evokes the New York scene in which Mr. Albee began his career. A beautifully balanced biography of a major figure in the American theatre. I loved it."},{"Title":"Edward Albee: A Singular Journey: A Biography","review":"Mel Gussow's abilities as a journalist and his personal friendship with Edward Albee allow him to make this the definitive biography of a great American playwright. I came to read this as I prepared for attending a performance of The Goat or Who is Sylvia?. The theater company had recommended this as the best biography they had found.Chronicling the life of someone who has become an icon of the American theater is difficult, but Mel Gussow is able to combine the personal, literary, and show business details in a dramatic narrative that does justice to Edward Albee. I was intrigued to discover that among Albee's partners was one of my other favorite playwrights, Terence McNally, but the biography highlights all of Albee's relationships and the importance of each to him and his friends. The difficulties Albee encountered as an adopted child were keen and exacerbated by parents who combined a daunting distance from their son with an attitude that was colder than most New England winters.His precocity and early development of an inscrutable individuality did not serve him well in the several schools that he more visited than occupied in his youth and it took the combination of Greenwich Village in the fifties and some tentative literary efforts with friends including William Flanagan and McNally among others to bring him to the point of his first success, The Zoo Story. He never looked back and within what would be an amazingly short time for a dramatist of lesser genius he was conquering Broadway with Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?. The rest of the story includes successful dramas (A Delicate Balance, Three Tall Women and others); yet there was not always the appreciation his work warranted or he deserved. Published in 1999, Gussow's biography does not include the past decade and Albee's most recent successes as he has achieved the status of America's greatest living playwright, but it provides a rich and rewarding panorama of Albee's ascent to the apex of American literature."},{"Title":"Edward Albee: A Singular Journey: A Biography","review":"I have not finished, but am completely enjoying the life story of one of America's finest playwrights. I became intrigued by something on the internet and then purchased this book. Before long I needed to read someof his plays. I began with his Pulitzer Prize winning \\"Who's Afraid ofVirginia Woolf?\\" I am really getting a deep picture of Edward Albee andhighly recommend \\"A Singular Journey\\" for anyone who loves the whole process of writing and sharing our life stories. This book was written byMel Gussow, thanks to him and the wonderful Edward Albee, readers willtravel for a time through the life and mind of one incredibly brilliantindividual."},{"Title":"Edward Albee: A Singular Journey: A Biography","review":"I received this book as a gift from the author's son and daughter-in-law. It's simply an amazing story, perhaps the only thing more amazing than Gussow's writing is the man that he writes about. Gussow captures Albee's natural speaking wit and amazing story in an absolutely brilliant way."},{"Title":"Edward Albee: A Singular Journey: A Biography","review":"Albee is without doubt my favorite living playwright, so I'm a little biased, but I read and enjoyed this book, and felt like I got to know Albee a lot better in the process, without losing any of my respect for him.Since his plays are so much about family and the pursuit of \\"success\\", it's worthwhile to know about how Albee--who was adopted--grew up. I recommend this to anyone who admires Albee's plays, and also to sceptics who want more insight on the ideas and the man behind them."},{"Title":"Edward Albee: A Singular Journey: A Biography","review":"This is a very good biography of Albee, and the best book available on the great playwright, but for those who consider 'The Zoo Story' and 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf' to be his sole significant works should look for lighter reading. The book refuses to be salacious, sticks to the facts and offers very to-the-point criticism on Albee's plays. Albee emerges as a figure of some mystery and extraordinary talent. The book does not find any powerful new insight as in, for example, Tom: The Unknown Tennessee Williams, but the book does move along nicely and is highly informative.Overall, a good read for Albee's fans.(By the way, what's up with all of the short 1-star reviews of the book, does someone have a personal vendetta against the author?)"},{"Title":"The Darkest Knight","review":"This book was exciting from start to finish. The heroine was a breath of fresh air in that she was not impossibly feisty, but not annoyingly timid either. She was a sheltered daughter of a lord with a slight physical impairment and some emotional issues who, during the course of her journey with the aide of a noble knight, blossomed into a courageous woman. The romance between her and the monk/knight seemed to grow gradually, as did their trust for one another, so it didn't seemed forced, but came so naturally between a man and a woman being in close proximity for long periods, and the many trials they faced drew them even closer. Reynold, the knight/monk, was also a character you couldn't help liking. He was a man who willed himself to make right choices, though sometimes they were wrong or not the best choice. His treatment of Katherine the heroine was so gallant and chivarous, not to mention gentle, he was through and through her loyal servant. He inspired Katherine by believing in her and her mission, and proving it by giving it due importance and help. Katherine's character was able to grow and develop and mature because of the support and devotion of her helping knight. The romance was also powerful in its development, but also frought with conflict as Katherine was already betrothed, and them both being religious, they inwardly had to grapple with sin and love. This book was difficult to put down. It's a great book to escape from the real world."},{"Title":"The Darkest Knight","review":"Envisioning the cover stud as Reynold in the story made me cheer that he chose not to make the church his vocation in the end. It would have been such a waste! Reynold's honor, and struggle to do what was right really touched a chord in me.There was one too many gratuitous \\"almost-rape\\" scenes but the clever way Reynold had of saving Katherine from the first villain was inspired writing.The mystery, betrayal, distrust and struggle to maintain vows to church and to her betrothed all wove together to make a compelling novel. The historical elements were good too. I have re-read this many times and highly recommend it to others."},{"Title":"The Darkest Knight","review":"The DARKEST KNIGHT is a great read with a heroine who overcomes a lousy childhood and learns to trust herself and her man. In the end, there's nothing she won't do to save Reynold. The thing I liked best was that she WAS A WOMAN OF HER TIME, who learned to be strong.Gayle Callen is a rising star in the romance genre. Her style is lyrical and flowing and she truly captured the Medieval period. I can't wait for more!"},{"Title":"The Darkest Knight","review":"I got this book because it was a highly reviewed medieval romance by a new author. Unfortunately, it's a dud. I just couldn't get into it &amp; found myself skimming a lot just to finish it. The author kept harping about Katherine's 'weak arm' but didn't provide enough different 'views' of how badly crippled she really was. I first thought the previous reviewer used too strong a word to describe our heroine. Admittedly I found her klutziness VERY TIRESOME as she ALWAYS tripped over her own gown &amp; stumbled on EVERY rock on the road to freedom. But when added to her thoughtless, hypocritical actions &amp; watering-pot personality, I'd have to agree--SHE'S A COMPLETE DITZ! I also can't understand how she could cower away from Reynold 'in revulsion' (perhaps in remorse but definitely not in revulsion!) when he'd just shown her what joy/beauty there is in lovemaking. PUH-LLLEASE! I want to read about heroines who have some spine, who find their inner strength instead of just crying about every little thing wrong in their life, &amp; waiting for the man-in-her-life to solve things for 'em!"},{"Title":"The Darkest Knight","review":"A great debut by a new author --- charming and delightful.

She distrust monks and at first in her mind, Brother Reynold is no better than the monks she has known. It does not take her long however to discover Reynolds true self behind his imense guilt.

Reynold is a wonderful hero, strong but sensitive and very sexy. The plot was really interesting since I love anything medieval. But the heroine made me want to scream. She's weak, she cries, she takes stupid risks even after she's been abducted twice. In doing so, she's almost raped. And Reynold always rescues her. Can't understand why he finds her so appealing. She appears to do nothing intelligent and is always tearfully contrite when she realizes she's been dumb. I'm sorry, but I expect more of a heroine than a ditz with free-flowing tears.

This is the best. It is the most profound, sensitive, deeply involving series of novels, set iun England from about 1920 through the mid-1960s, against the background of the small town where the barrister grew up, the university he attended and became a fellow, the world of nuclear physics during W.W.II (in which his brother is a scientist) and the related worlds of espionage involving nuclear secrets, Cabinet politics, and high business.Snow's interests are many: obsessive love, the gaining and holding of power over others (politics in all sorts of worlds), manners, psychological infirmity. He is fascinated by the development and shredding of character and power. Warning: these books take about 150 pages to get into, so it does require patience. Once you are into the series, there is no satisfaction to be gained from any other book until the series is done. (My reaction when reading others is &quot;why won't the author REALLY tell us what is happening in this scene?&quot;).These books are truly great and truly under-appreciated. (The poor, overly reductive television series in the mid-1980s or early 1990s didn't help)."},{"Title":"Strangers and Brothers","review":"This is the first book in a series of wonderful novels by C.P.Snow.Snow was a molecular physicist in England in the 1930-1940's. During world war II he became a civil servant, engaged in recruiting scientists to the war efforts, especially the development of the atomic bomb.His books contain detailed observation of all levels of life in this setting; pre-world war II England (Strangers and Brothers), academic politics in Cambridge (The Masters), Whitehall politics (Corridors of Power) and the discovery of atomic power and the dread of its consequences (The New Men). All his books are woven with sensitive descriptions of his personal life and that of his friends. His first wife, suffering froms schizophrenia, had almost crippled him emotionally (Homecomings, A Time of Hope) untill he met his second wife who taught him to experience love and friendship.His work as Civil Servant Commissioner and industry earned him a knighthood in 1957.Stangers and Brothers is the first book, telling the story of Lewis Eliot (CP Snow's literary identity) and his encounter with George Passant between 1925-1933, who brought together a group of young people in an idealistic search for personal, social, and sexual freedom. It is a fascinating decription of social ideas typical of pre-world war II England, yet universal to young adulthood's search for independence.I enjoyed almost all of Snow's books and I certainly recommend this one too. I sincerely wish all his books were available, but unfortunately many are out of press."},{"Title":"Strangers and Brothers","review":"Set in a provincial English village, Strangers and Brothers was written in 1940 and is the first of a series featuring the protagonist Lewis Eliot. The main cast is a group of poor young college students who are mentored by one of their law professors, George Passant, a man of remarkable gifts who exerts a crucial influence on the lives of the young people he has gathered around himself.Passant attracts the devotion of the group, and helps them with advice, lending them money and generally persuading them of their worth and motivating them to go on to greater things. He also parties with them. Eliot is one of the group who goes on to become a solicitor (lawyer).Passant is a passionate, scrupulously honest idealist who is endlessly optimistic about human value and worth; a penchant that leads him into quixotic ventures, and eventually into trouble with the law on a fraud accusation, from which Lewis Elliot eventually extricates him.The story is entirely about complex human motivations and relationships, with no violence, explicit sex, high speed auto chases or any of the other devices deemed so necessary by modern fiction writers. Yet it is fascinating, full of tension, and holds the reader's interest to the end.C.P. Snow is also the author of The Search, The Affair, Homecoming and several other best selling novels of his day. This as a story that caught and held my interest.Joseph H Pierre"},{"Title":"Strangers and Brothers","review":"I would join C. I. Wilson in his opinion about this volume. I also found it plodding and tedious. I finally gave up.Somewhere this was recommended for me to read, but can't remember where. But I approached it with interest and was disappointed with the stories. My field is nuclear physics and the little bit of detail about the bomb development was interesting and helped me appreciate the conflicting emotions about it, especially the tragedy of its development and use over Japan. And the descriptive style of C. P. Snow is very good writing, but again, it just didn't grab my attention that other good novels have."},{"Title":"Strangers and Brothers","review":"First book written in the series, written in 1940, but second in chronological order, \\"Time of Hope\\" being the first, starting in 1914, when Lewis Eliot is almost 9 years old. I started with \\"Time of Hope\\", thinking that since it was first in time, I should read it first. Perhaps that was a mistake, since I do not think \\"Strangers and Brothers\\" can hold a candle to \\"Time of Hope\\", written in 1949. That was a masterpeice, pure and simple. In \\"Strangers and Brothers\\" the narrative seems plodding, heavy, and at times downright preachy. And because I already knew that it was due mainly to George Passant alone that Lewis becomes the barrister he was, and the success that he was, the characterization of George by his trial lawyer as a man who has wasted his life seemed just plain wrong. No man who gives another man a chance he would never have had otherwise has wasted his life. He helped Lewis rise from his lower middle class beginnings with his prodding, encouragement, and most of all money, money that he had to take from those funds with which he regularly helped his parents. None of this is brought out in \\"Strangers and Brothers\\". But here too, as in \\"Time of Hope\\" is still that vagueness about what exactly George and Jack and Olive did that such a fuss was made about. All is implied; there are no scenes which take place telling us what happened. This did not hold me at all, and I found it tedious in spots. To be fair, I already knew that the three would be acquited from \\"Time of Hope\\", and maybe that colored my reading to some extent. Although to set the facts straight, Lewis was not the one who got George off; it was Getliff, his first employer when he was a young barrister."},{"Title":"Aircraft Monograph 4 - Focke Wulf Fw 190 A/F/G/S, Part 1","review":"This is a MUST HAVE reference for any serious student of the FW-190. The format is less flashy, but similar to the Squadron/Signal, &quot;Aircraft in Action&quot; Series. The title isn't catchy and most of the photos are black &amp; white; but what this volume lacks in glitz, it makes up for in technical merit. With the Author's proximity to the former Marienburg FW-190 production facilities, he has compiled a very nice collection of detailed photos that I've never seen anywhere else. The accompanying narrative is thorough and includes appropriate German technical phrases/abbreviations with accurate translations. Also included are numerous line drawings of essentially all of the radial engine (BMW-801) powered FW-190 variants. This work covers the history for the FW-190 from initial design concepts, pre-production prototypes, A-Series fighters, F-Series close air support, torpedo and precision guided weapon fighter-bombers, G-Series night/long-range, fighter-bombers, thru the (School) S-Series two seat trainers. There are several pages of color plates illustrating various camouflage and tactical unit marking schemes. FW-190 A/F/G/S Part II, the in-line engine (Junkers JUMO) powered FW-190 D/ TA152 and two volumes on WWII Luftwaffe camouflage and markings are listed as forthcomining titles.

It can be a force for understanding between the Middle East and the West, but primarily it is a force against established power, whether eastern or western. It is a natural product of the young, who do not yet have much power, but who will indeed have power in the future. So I am in sympathy with LeVine's enthusiasm; however as young people become older and take on the responsibilities of their societies and weld the power, will they not become the satirized?One of the points Levine makes early in this ambitious book is that the narrow-minded, fundamentalist culture of e.g., Kansas, is similar to the narrow-minded, fundamentalist culture of the jihadis. In a broad sense the fundamentalist Christians of America and the fundamentalist Muslims of the Middle East are just opposite sides of the same intolerant, ignorant coin. They both believe that they have the one real God on their side, and regard people who believe differently as going to straight to hell.Consequently, LeVine's conclusion that \\"they\\" don't hate \\"us\\" because there really is no monolithic \\"they\\" or \\"us\\" is technically correct. Generalizations that pigeonhole people are always wrong except as handy ways to talk. The so-called \\"culture\\" of the West with its McFoods, its NASCAR races, its mindless TV, its \\"football,\\" its Hollywood movies and its gross commercialization is really just the commercial culture of America. The real culture of America is much more complex and includes a plethora of subcultures from blue blooded New Englanders living on inherited wealth to Spanish-speaking illegal aliens who work in our fields and kitchens. It includes Harvard graduates and burger-flippers; blue states and red; people who believe in democracy and the separation of church and state, and evangelicals who are waiting anxiously for the Rapture. It includes the legacy of Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin, Mark Twain and Al Capone, John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan, atheists and true believers, Nobel Prize winners and Paris Hilton. It includes millions of Muslims as well as Christians of every stripe, Buddhists and Hindus, Midwesterners, Southerners, Californians and people who have never left North Dakota.American culture, as crass as it often is, is not the villain. The use of military power exclusively for perceived American interests, and the economic exploitation of less developed nations is what is causing a lot of pain in the world today, and is what justifiably could cause others to hate us. Invading Iraq and causing the death of tens of thousands of Iraqis and the suffering of millions more, is what fosters hatred. Artificially supporting our rich and massive agribusinesses so that Third World farmers can't compete also engenders hatred.But a lot of the hatred is a legacy of colonialism. Only time will heal those wounds.Still, there are cultural differences in the aggregate that must be understood and appreciated before the twain of the Middle East and the West can harmoniously meet. Education in the West and particularly in the US is based not on the Qu'ran, as it is in Muslim countries (nor on the Bible), but upon secular histories and the authority not of religious leaders who interpret holy books, but on scientific authority. There is separation of church and state in the West while in Muslim countries typically it is believed that political power comes properly from God and not from the people. While in the West we may be persuaded to think of the Middle East as backward and even evil, that is not part of the classroom instruction. However, a denigration of Western ideas and institutions is part and parcel of Islamic education where the focus is tightly on the teaching of the Qu'ran. We only have that sort of narrow focus in our more conservative religious schools.These are real cultural differences. When everyone in Saudi Arabia has as much chance to secure a decent living as a Saudi prince, when Iranians can listen without fear to Western music, when Palestinians are represented by politicians that are really working for their benefit instead of playing out revenge scenarios, when the oil profits benefit the people as a whole and not just the ruling classes (or special interests in the West)--in short when everybody has a greater stake in the societies, there will be a lot less hatred, and cultural differences will be seen in a more benign light.One final thing: LeVine wants the US to declare a truce with Muslim countries. (See page 330 and following.) But even though I agree that the US's \\"war on terror\\" is at best a misnomer and at worse a crusade, I don't think declaring a truce makes any sense at all. We are not at war with Islam or Muslims or Muslim countries. To declare a truce would falsely say that we were. Also a declaration that we have sinned in the past (colonialism, etc.) and now apologize is of limited value. We can apologize for the slaughter of Native Americans, for enslaving Africans, even for killing of the Neanderthal if we like. And I suppose Muslims could apologize for forcing innumerable peoples to embrace Islam or else. I don't like any of that sort of thing because I, in particular, enslaved nobody and killed nary a Native American. I cannot apologize for those who did.What is needed is a declaration of intent to not exploit others or otherwise do nasty things to them. That's what LeVine ought to be calling for."},{"Title":"Why They Don't Hate Us: Lifting the Veil on the Axis of Evil","review":"Globalization is a very popular topic these days and innumerable publications have appeared which either celebrate it as nothing short of a revolution which produces wealth and brings people closer together or, at the other end of the spectrum, demonize it as a destructive monster which burns everything in its path. Levine takes on this controversial topic in a book which consists of three parts. The first is mainly devoted to setting up the stage for the rest of book and to placing it into the current often ideological discourse about globalization.In the second part the author analyzes the deep historical roots of globalization, especially its relations to what he calls the modernity matrix (modernity, imperialism/colonialism, capitalism and nationalism), which puts the phenomenon in perspective within the broader historical theater. LeVine chooses a holistic approach which does not reduce globalization to a mere economic phenomenon, but, rather, illuminates its cultural and political as well as its economic components. It shows, based on official data by organizations like the IMF and the World Bank, that even the self-proclaimed successes of globalizations actually benefit both a minority of countries and minorities within those countries themselves.The author's ability to connect the dots between long time historical processes and their daily life micro-manifestations, especially in Middle Eastern and North African countries confers the book a 'humanity' which does usually not characterize academic analyses. A humanity which is also at the core of LeVine's courageous approach to the topic and its many implications.The third and last part of the book is devoted to the global peace and justice movement and culminates in a manifesto of its goals and strategies (according to the author) for a successful future. The author's point of view and perspective is never concealed throughout the book and, even though the author certainly takes a side, its historical analysis remains sober and matter-of-factual.The book is written in a fluid and pleasant style and is a must read for both supporters and opponents of globalization alike."},{"Title":"Why They Don't Hate Us: Lifting the Veil on the Axis of Evil","review":"This book gives a very different view from the one we get in a lot of the media - and everyone should read it, especially journalists!

He cites the Pentagon's Defense Science Board, which contradicted Bush by saying, \\"they do not hate our freedom, they hate our policies.\\" He sees that chaos is not an accidental by-product of occupying foreign countries but assists the occupiers' strategic goals - profits, oil and repression - and he recognises that occupations are brutal, corrupt and incompetent.He cites a World Bank study that concluded, \\"faster growth among the poor may indeed be obtained at the expense of slower growth among the rich\\", that there is \`no evidence ... of mutually beneficial policies' and \\"At least in the short run, globalization appears to increase poverty and inequality.\\" He also notes a United Nations Development Programme Report that summed up, \\"Trade openness (liberalisation) increased poverty and inequality ... Those countries liberalising most rapidly fared worst.\\"Yet after all this evidence, LeVine claims that culture not economics drives capitalism. So he claims, \\"Only building bridges between cultures can provide the chance to overcome both occupation and the violence it breeds.\\" This bridge-building, he writes, gives the leading role to intellectuals - a little self-serving, one might think. He goes on, \\"if we can ... compose a truly world music - we can break down (\`deconstruct', as some philosophers might say) the \`iron cage' of neoliberalism\\". This is utopian drivel.The \`global peace and justice movement' pretends that working classes' struggles to seize state power from capitalist classes are old-fashioned, chauvinist and unnecessary. Yet he had cited World Bank President James Wolfensohn's praise of Cuba in 2001: \\"Cuba has done a great job on education and health.\\" Cuba has continued to progress because its policies, based on class and nation, are the opposite of the Bank's policies and also of the movement's policies.What success has the movement ever had that justifies rejecting the successful Cuban method of class struggle and revolution? By contrast, as LeVine admits, quoting voices like Susan George - \\"We haven't actually won anything\\" and Naomi Klein - \\"We have in no way reversed the flow towards privatization, let alone stopped it\\", the movement has never succeeded anywhere.The main conflict in the world is not Islam against the West, but neither is it neoliberalism against the \`global peace and justice movement'; it is class against class, within each nation, and each nation must solve its own problems.The \`global peace and justice movement' is a diversion, a waste of time and energy. Its members need to get jobs, if they haven't already, and join their trade union. Workers, including white-collar workers, are the majority in every country, and only the working class can defeat capitalism."},{"Title":"Why They Don't Hate Us: Lifting the Veil on the Axis of Evil","review":"I guess 9/11 was their way of saying \\"Hi, How are you?\\"He suggests that fundamental Christians are the same as fundamental muslims in that they both believe in their religion, their god and all others are going to hell.Well, unless I'm not paying attention, I haven't really noticed devout christians strapping bombs onto their children and sending them onto a crowded bus. Christian schools also don't teach their children growing up that killing jews and muslims will send them to heaven.He also suggests that America call for a truce with the Muslim countries. This could be an idea, however, we have truces with Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt to name a few and that doesn't seem to stop any of these terrorists. Most of the 9/11 hijackers were from Saudi Arabia.

At one point they had a theologan on. The host asked him what 12 books of the Bible he would bring if he were stranded on a desert island. \\"Well, I certainly wouldn't bring Leviticus,\\" was the theologan's reply. That is the case with many Christians. To them, many of the Old Testament books \\"just aren't important,\\" but they ALL are still the word of God.George Knight gives us a very readable and practical commentary on the book of Leviticus (a manuel for Israel's priests and a \\"Holiness Code\\"--moral commands--for the people). The book consists of a half-chapter (give or take) of Scripture followed by Knight's commentary. Knight often gives some very insightful commentary showing what this type of animal sacrifice shows about God's personality or explaining why the people could only have one type of crop in a given field.Although Knight succeeds in making a normally dull book (especialy when compared with Genesis, Joshua, 2 Samuel, the Gospels, etc) seem exciting, there do exist some faults with the book. One chapter in Leviticus deals with rules agains homosexuality. Instead of coming right out and saying what he believes Leviticus says about the subject, Knight tip-toes and tap-dances so much, I'm still not really quite sure WHAT he believes about it. I'm not sure if he's delicately trying to say that God is wrong about gay folk or if he's just a little afraid to actually condemn homosexual practices.There are other places in the commentary where Knight does a similar tap-dance routine, but overall, this is an extremely good commentary that really aided in my understanding of Leviticus."},{"Title":"DAILY STUDY BIBLE: LEVITICUS","review":"This book provides an in-depth analysis of Leviticus with reflections on our times and our issues.In many cases we read Genesis and Exodus then run right to the New Testament failing to understand Leviticus and are uncomfortable defending the Word of God as expressed in the images of a B.C. nomadic people; their rituals; and their sacrifices.As you read each of these pages the images become clearer to us as the same images are seen in our world today and God's Word and its meaning becomes clearer.Read this book and then move on through the Word of God without lingering doubts and know His Word truly holds the answers to our life.Thank you George Knight for such an illuminating book."},{"Title":"Beethoven (Pelican books)","review":"This is not going to get many postive feedbacks.. HOWEVER.. this is just a note to say THIS REALLY and truly is a BRILLIANT BOOK.... and for anyone wanting to dive straight into the deep end as to what Beethoven and ART and Classical Music par se is and the mind of a composer and the struggle of a life between Art, creativity, God and love and genius is all about this is the one book to get. Yet, surprisingly not only all made very understandable but then clarity and inspiration and feel good factor was never made so good in a book on a composer, also made so enjoyable. A true and real learning journey in this book.Priceless. I felt myself on tour with the writer and the works and mind of life of Beethoven as though the man was his art and his work. Out of MUCH self taught reading on classical music. This book truly remains my ALL TIME FAVOURITE book about any single composer. Supremely well written and written with clarity and passages I underlined endlessly. It is one of those books. Just well researched, well written and written about from angles and insights that you really DID want to know and not written anywhere else and never realised you did want to know and it is a real journey. If you feel a journey with Beethoven\`s music this is the best book ever written to get into his mind , and his art and the music and his life as one.... A real cherished classic. I hate the phrase. This book is one of 20-30 that I look back really does come under the heading \\"life changer\\" and can give a truer real insight into the mind of genius and ART in capital letters and an artist\`s intention and the working of a mind and spirit..and it explains the music so well in relation to his life and genius. A seriously great gem , where every page is a page turning inspiration and delight. Seriously 5+ Not a normal book. Exceedingly well done... This book is special. Class of it\`s own and essential reading on Beethoven. Trust me. And write your own review. I challenge anyone not to adore this book and give it a 5 having read it. I\`m serious. Think about it compared to all the others on Beethoven and dull ill written biographies and over detailed stuff. This book really hits the spot and is very very well writen in style and content and theme and insight....and is concise. : ) I.e not only readable but also exciting and a a book to learn from not just factually but with real thinking and a journey and highly enjoyable read. The world it takes one too to the mind of the composer and the music and the journey it takes one too is first class. A really enjoyable mind expanding insight. Seriously good. i.e Great."},{"Title":"Beethoven (Pelican books)","review":"After over 30 years since my first reading of this book, it remains one of the most important in my life. Sullivan was a science writer, not a musicologist and this is no academic treatise. After 3 chapters examining the various meanings and definitions of music and making a case for music as communication of non verbal reality, Sullivan looks at Beethoven's life as it developed and how it developed from the young power playing virtuoso to an artist who has probably gone farther in spiritual development than any other. Keys include the fact that his music got better and better as he aged, as his life developed as an organic whole, being absolutely true to his own experience."},{"Title":"Beethoven (Pelican books)","review":"Sullivan's book has remained in print for over 70 years, despite not being a definitive source book for facts about Beethoven's life and work. Sullivan's achievement is different. Sullivan wrote one of the very few biographies, about Beethoven or anybody else, that captures and understands the level of \\"depth of life\\" that results from identifying one's life with the search for the meaning of life and of the universe, if there is any such meaning. Beethoven lived on this level and the particular path Beethoveen pursued and expressed in his music is uniquely understood by Sullivan. This biography is a masterpiece in its own right."},{"Title":"Beethoven (Pelican books)","review":"Sullivan was a mathematician, scientist and philosopher, but music had a high priority in his life. And Beethoven was at the top of his list of greats. He says: &quot;Perhaps even Shakespeare never reached that final stage of illumination that is expressed in some of Beethoven's late music.&quot;As the title says, this is not a biography so much as a description of Beethoven's &quot;spiritual development. If you love Beethoven. You must read this book.And you might ask yourself the question: Why has this book remained in print for 73 years?"},{"Title":"Beethoven (Pelican books)","review":"This book profoundly deepened my experience of music. It opened doors of appreciation for both listening to music and expressing myself musically. It inspires one to put the whole of themselves with ever increasing passion into their creative endeavors and by extension their lives. As Beethoven said, \\"There is no loftier mission than to approach the Godhead nearer than other people, and to disseminate the divine rays among humanity.\\" Read this book. You will not regret it."},{"Title":"Beethoven (Pelican books)","review":"This short masterpiece was written in 1927, probably to mark the centennial of Beethoven's death. It's an extraordinary book that gets inside the mind of Beethoven and requires no technical knowledge of music or anything else for one to profit from its considerable insights. In fact it was the first book I ever read on the composer, back when I was a classical music neophyte, and it really helped me appreciate the music I subsequently heard. Saying you're dealing with a book that \\"gets into the mind\\" of the subject is hardly unusual...after all, Maynard Solomon is always professing to do this. But this book *does.* The author says nothing radical about the personality of his subject, but he does a thorough job of exploring Beethoven's mind and explaining why his greatest masterpieces are just that. Written at a time when Beethoven was widely considered THE greatest composer (a view I hold as well), the book has no problems with absolute statements about the relative values of different elements and aspects of music, and what Sullivan (and many others of the time) valued about Beethoven was his constant growth, growth to higher and more refined realms of consciousness. We are not so comfortable with pronouncements like this today in this more relativistic age. And Mozart is today considered at least Beethoven's equal and more often his superior, often by people unfamiliar with both composers beyond a superficial take or else publishers/performers all to eager to jump on the public's \\"Moe-zart is divine\\" bandwagon for reasons having more to do with box office than any true conviction. Here Sullivan, who is a truly gifted writer when it comes to music, demonstrates the inexorable artistic growth of his subject and how that growth changed all Western music forever, causing us to really understand and value the content of the middle and late string quartets, the Missa Solemnis, the Hammerklavier, and Op. 111. We live in an era where we've, for sociological reasons, shied away from extra-musical meaning in music. Fortunately, Sullivan was born long before such concerns came to be, and so he isn't afraid to tell us the Op. 131 string quartet contains a more refined level of music thought--in the way Beethoven *organically* organizes his material, chooses harmonic presentation over the stormy conflict of his second period works (5th symphony, 3rd piano concerto, etc.), and breaks the expected bounds of four movements and certain key structures. Beethoven's earlier music has roots in Haydn, Mozart and just the general Viennese music of its day, but as Sullivan points out, his late period is sui generis. It has no precedent, although arguably with it he gave birth to the avant-garde, for better or worse. Really, is there another composer who journeyed so far and changed his musical approach, his way of solving musical problems so much, who never stopped developing (many say in his very last works they hear the buddings of a \\"fourth period\\" that was cut short by illness) as Beethoven?Sullivan makes us aware--it seems obvious but it is often overlooked in books about the composer today--how Beethoven was the first to envision the whole work as an organic organism. While Mozart may have given us a Jupiter Symphony, for example, and as magnificent as it is, only the last movement is truly \\"Jupiter,\\" the other movements *could* be excised and attached to other works with the same key flow without harm. Even early Beethoven functions this way. By Beethoven's second period, organic elements begin to dictate form and content--starting essentially with the Eroica symphony and continuing with the 5th, where the real interest is not with the famous da-da-da-duum first movement but rather the scherzo-finale transition. This type of organic logic was a precursor, Sullivan shows, to the unity of the three Galitzin quartets of the late period, which he rightly considers three of the greatest if not *the* greatest creations in Western music.To be sure the book isn't without flaws. His suggestion that Beethoven was perhaps unique among artists (not just composers, but artists) for his continuous and organic spiritual growth till his death, and that he channeled this growth into his work, had me wondering if he'd perhaps like to also consider Rembrandt. The author glosses over Beethoven's personality shortcomings in an effort to show the artist is as sublime as the art (widely believed in those days...but this was before we saw newsreels of Hitler and Goebbels listening to the Ode to Joy). His circular reasoning (on p. 128) involving Beethoven's dealings with his publishers regarding the Missa Solemnis would be hilarious if Sullivan weren't completely sincere. And he gave me a chuckle when the commented early on that advances in modern (1927) society will likely soon mean that people know little of personal suffering that afflicted the artists of Beethoven's time, or words to that effect. But overall this is a superb study of why Beethoven *matters,* why his sacrifice, life and illnesses contributed to the advance of the art of composing, and why it was very conscientious on the composer's part. Rereading this work (I originally bought this book on impulse when I was in 9th grade and hadn't read it since), I gained an even deeper insight into works I thought I knew well. He shows how the light-to-darkness transition that marks the 5th symphony is superseded by a much more mature understanding of suffering and the outcome of that suffering in later works such as (the first three movements of) the 9th symphony and the B-flat Major late quartet (with the Grosse Fugue included). He gives a convincing argument that despite the 6th being Beethoven's \\"Pastorale\\" symphony, it's the 7th that's really his hymn to nature. And his interpretation of the events that transpire in the 4th symphony are very eye-opening and interesting, even if you think you know that work by heart. Considering he was writing in an era before recordings of these works (Schnabel and Weingartner had not even made their earliest Beethoven discs) and that he had to become familiar with all these pieces--and the late ones were not so often played at the time, a mass public not yet being ready for them--either by concert performance or by score, assuming he could read scores. The fact that this music was far less available in his day makes me think that more of those who were lucky enough to hear it listened actively, and thought more about what they heard.There are a few musical lapses. With the exception of the Hammerklavier, which gets a whole chapter, he short-changes the late sonatas somewhat. (No mention of Op. 101 or Opp. 109-110.) Another mature masterpiece, the Archduke Trio, gets only a brief nod. And the Diabellis and Bagatelles are ignored when discussing Beethoven's late period masterpieces. Still, this is an impressive book overall, giving more insight into Beethoven in 170 tight pages than many a tome five times its length. This book should be on every Beethoven-lover's bookshelf, even if you think you already have read everything you need to about the composer and his greatest masterworks. Highly highly recommended."},{"Title":"Beethoven (Pelican books)","review":"Amateurs tread upon the musicologist's turf always at their peril - a tendency doubled in the case of one amateur reviewing another. J.W.N. Sullivan was one of the most gifted popularizers of science (i.e., THE LIMITATIONS OF SCIENCE) between the world wars, conveying in clear, polished prose the main lines of scientific development tailing Einstein's once-in-a-lifetime comet. When he turned his hand to music, as in this short appraisal of the inner development of Beethoven as it found expression in his work, he brought to the task his customary literary gifts, and the result is a joy to read. Sullivan spends a fair amount of throat-clearing time early in his book in discussing the capacity of music to convey deep, extralinguistic truth (a topic ground to dust by every would-be philosopher since at least as far back as the pre-Socratics). The remainder of the book highlights the unending round of struggles - physical, material, emotional - faced by the composer, and the ways in which he strove to express and overcome them in his music. Especially from the vantage of today, with the wealth of fine scholarship at their disposal, Beethoven specialists may quarrel throughout with Sullivan's pet notions. But general readers, who have claims of their own, will be hard put to find a more moving or better-written short attempt at conveying what stirs us still in the life and work of a composer who, to paraphrase the great musicologist Sir Donald Tovey, will always occupy a central place in a sound musical mind."},{"Title":"Beethoven (Pelican books)","review":"This book is essential reading for all who appreciate Beethoven's music. It would be futile to try and review it here; indeed, the book needs no review. It will be appreciated by all who know, after listening to Beethoven, that this is not merely music for entertainment, but music that uplifts, in the very real sense of the word."},{"Title":"Beethoven (Pelican books)","review":"I recommend the book not only for its intertwined information about the composer's life and works, but for its demonstration of Beethoven's inward evolution. My one criticism is that the author tends to see in some of Beethoven's clearly neurotic behavior (e.g., his obsession with his nephew; his incredible personal messiness; his narcissistic rages at certain colleagues) an overabundance of some sort of energy--which may indeed be the case at a very deep level, but hey, misbehavior is misbehavior. Nevertheless, an excellent Beethoven resource."},{"Title":"Beethoven (Pelican books)","review":"Artists of all persuasions have a story to tell. Artistic genius is the manifestation of the artists journey from despair to hope. The journey is never easy and so the struggle is usually momentous. Recently, I reviewed biographies by Denton Snider, who, as it seems, was a contemporary of J.W.Sullivan. Perhaps it was in the spirit of the day to talk about spiritual awakenings and their manifestations in the creations of geniuses; like Beethoven, Lincoln, Dante, Shakespeare, to name a few. It is an inner yearning to be free that propels the spirit to transcend its limitations and reach for the Divine. Whether in remarkable accomplishments such as in music, or literature, or poetry, or politics, we get to glimpse into the abyss before we recognize where truth, beauty, and art intersect. Read this biography by Sullivan or better yet, listen to the music his biography is based on. No doubt you will agree, that, truth and beauty are better than fiction."},{"Title":"Beethoven (Pelican books)","review":"This is the best book about music that I have read, and my recent (fourth in 35 years) reading solidified this opinion.The reviews here offer many insights, so I just want to emphasize that this is unlike any other music biography you will read. It is not a linear life history, nor does it focus primarily on musical quotations. It digs deeply into Beethoven's spirit and tries to grasp what made him so special. That is a fundamental bias of the book, so if you find Beethoven less a genius than Bach or Mozart or Mahler or Wagner, then you probably won't agree with Sullivan's conclusions. But, as a mathematician, he approached his subject without the standard musicologist biases, and that shines through in a work that is accessible to anyone who wants to think deeply about the ultimate meaning of great music, and how one person could create what Beethoven poured forth in his life."},{"Title":"Beethoven (Pelican books)","review":"Sullivan examines Beethoven's spiritual development and how that development was reflected in the composer's music.

The organic feature of his works shows the timeless conflict between the will and the fate ; the horizontality of the destiny and the verticality of the irrevocable and untamed human character .Ernest Newman has said : \\" The peculiarity of Beethoven imagination is that it raises over and over to heights since we can do a new appraisement , not only of all the music but the life , the emotions and the ideas\\".Think in the Final of the last variation of his Third Symphony and will understand the message ; you have to fight always without expecting anything in change ; because the hero attitude is to make not to think .

I found it to be downright funny at times, but most of all simply written and and containing just about all the information an aspiring medical transcriptionist would need to get started in his/her new career. The author even included his e-mail address in the book. I e-mailed him a question about schooling, and he very kindly replied by the following day with very good advice for me."},{"Title":"Boogaloo On Second Avenue : A Novel Of Pastry,Guilt,And Music","review":"On at least three occasions during my reading of this novel, I found myself in tears. Not from sadness, but from joy at the beauty of Kurlansky's writing. I can't really explain this reaction, except to say that it is a perfect depiction of Manhattan's lower east side, and its inhabitants, at the end of its role as the melting pot of immigrant culture, and the beginning of what it is today- the melting pot of American yuppy transplant culture.The time frame of this novel is the late Reagan period, when drug sales were an engine of economic development for many striving Caribbean immigrants, and something affecting the previous generation of Jewish immigrants' scions. But this is merely one aspect of this multi-faceted mini-saga. Ultimately, this is, in the Seinfeldian sense, a novel about \\"nothing\\". But it's a vastly entertaining and engrossing \\"nothing\\".Not being conversant with Kurlansky's other works, I was slightly shocked at his post-conclusion chapter of recipes for dishes mentioned in the plot. I would normally avoid food-themed novels like the plague. However this one could work with or without the recipes or the loving (and lustful) depictions of pastry-making in the \\"plot\\". Foodies can consider this aspect as a lagniappe- non-foodies can stop there, and not miss a thing."},{"Title":"Boogaloo On Second Avenue : A Novel Of Pastry,Guilt,And Music","review":"I read this book and was pleased to find a fantastic jumble of characters, philosophies, and pathos. Each character, even the \\"bad\\" ones, is treated humanely by the author. The last moment of the simpatico culture of this New York neighborhood in the late 1980's is captured joyfully."},{"Title":"Boogaloo On Second Avenue : A Novel Of Pastry,Guilt,And Music","review":"Mark Kurlansky, author of best-selling non-fiction niche histories about Cod, Oysters, and Salt, tackled this fiction work, that integrates his Lower East Side upbringing and love of pastry, early on in his career. My version was an audio rendition, narrated by a Broadway actor whose name I can't recall, who really provided color and atmosphere to the reading.The story revolves around a middle-aged Jewish man and his family, who have lived in the neighborhood for several generations. It's hard to say exactly what the plot is; as I reflect on it, it seems mostly to deal with the man's guilt-ridden affair with a German baker's daughter. Also prevalent, plot-wise, are: a dilemma about selling the family business as the neighborhood grows and becomes more expensive; the travails of a Dominican (or is it Puerto Rican?) trying to get out of the drug business; a murderer stalking the local ATM machines; an uncle's search for the German baker's nazi past; and more.I was impressed with Kurlansky's intimate knowledge about the neighborhood's ethnic cultures and characters, many of whom must have been far removed from his own American/European background. I lived in the neighborhood during the same period, and he brought forth here vivid details about people who I saw but interacted with only superficially. This seems to me to be the triumph of this book: its wonderland mix of ethnicity, whose unique apsects Kurlansky makes vivid. Stamaty's chaotic cover really nails this aspect of book, and the virtuoso narrator's uncanny & subtle characterizations in the audio version make it a listerner's delight.Unfortunately, this may be the book's downfall too, as there are so many characters that I became confused... and with all the plot lines, the book loses any natural trajectory it might have had if Kurlansky had focused on fewer characters and plots. I might not have finished the book had I not gotten the audio version. Still, I enjoyed it, thought it illuminating and interesting, and certainly an accurate and heartfelt portrayal of a neighborhood that has, sadly, greatly changed since the 1980s."},{"Title":"Boogaloo On Second Avenue : A Novel Of Pastry,Guilt,And Music","review":"From Publishers WeeklyThe bestselling author of 1968, Salt and Cod makes an uneven transition to fiction in his first novel, an erratic snapshot of the East Village's ethnic melting pot set during the late 1980s. The story opens with a bang when a Jewish restaurant owner is murdered in the first chapter, a tragedy that sends protagonist Nathan Seltzer into spasms of anxiety as he wonders if he should cash in, sell his lucrative property (the Meshugaloo Copy Shop) and leave his drug-riddled neighborhood. But Kurlansky ditches that promising subplot to track Nathan's erotic, pastry-obsessed affair with the daughter of a German baker. Nathan's brother Harry also enters the picture as he engineers his own affair with a hefty, African-American prostitute and junkie named Florence. Unfortunately, there isn't much rhyme or reason to the rest of the novel, which consists mostly of scattershot introductions of wacky secondary characters, including a Latin drug dealer who becomes a successful restaurant owner, a therapist who tries to help Nathan conquer his claustrophobia while passionately rooting for the Mets, and a singer named Chow Mein Vega who incorporates Yiddish influences into his lone dance hit. Occasionally the scenes are funky and entertaining, but the lack of a story line eventually wins out over Kurlansky's obvious love of the neighborhood.Copyright Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This can often make the student forget that it is the product of very creative and and often interesting people. Dunham's historical narrative adds this extra dimension. This has the benefit of holding the readers attention and therefore improving learning for those students who are not captivated by the patterns exposed through the power of reason (unfortunately many students). Because these are great theorems, it implants a good bedrock.A good read even for the mathematical among us. A definite buy."},{"Title":"Journey Through Genius: The Great Theorems of Mathematics","review":"This book came as a surprise for me, I was under the impression it would be a typical popular science book; that is, a book that would basically go from the premise that the reader despises math and that if maybe, just maybe, they water down the content enough, they might convince the reader math isn't so bad after all. I was definitely wrong, and I am happy I was. The book knows exactly what it wants to do, and it does so with excellence.The structure is simple, we are given some historical background, then we get to know the mathematician behind the propositions and theorems, their work itself, and an epilogue commenting on the general content of the chapter. Everything flows beautifully, there is no abrupt change between one focus and the next.About the theorems: many steps are taken to get to the conclusion, the explanation is clear, we are given pictures and diagrams aplenty to always have a visual reference, and amazingly enough, the tone is not condescending.Besides knowledge I took best from this book a better apreciation of the significance and intrinsic beauty of the propositions and theorems presented, as well as an appreciation for the mathematician behind the work himself; and inspiration to further pursue my studies in math and, hopefully, become myself a mathematician."},{"Title":"Journey Through Genius: The Great Theorems of Mathematics","review":"This book is easy to understand, and a great introduction to many mathematical proofs. I used it as a springboard to many other books. This is the perfect place to start, and to open your mind (or the mind of someone you know) to the fun of mathematics!"},{"Title":"Journey Through Genius: The Great Theorems of Mathematics","review":"I read this book freshman year of college and since then I've been in love with the subject of mathematics. It opened up a new world for me and I will be forever grateful to William Dunham for sparking this interest and curiosity of mathematics.It's a great book and easy to understand."},{"Title":"Journey Through Genius: The Great Theorems of Mathematics","review":"In the considerably crowded field of popular science/math writing, this book really stands out. William Dunham guides the reader through twelve great topics in mathematical history and actually provides serious (but accessible!) mathematical exposition on those topics. As such, it's probably necessary to have some mathematical background (but no more than what one covers in a typical high school curriculum) to fully appreciate this book, although there is also a fair amount of non-mathematical content as well. Mathematically interested adults and talented middle or high school students are probably the ideal audience for this book.The actual mathematics in the book is of the highest quality - after all, Dunham selects some of the greatest ideas in all of mathematical history to cover. Fortunately, the exposition is also of superb quality. While there is a lot of real math in the book, Dunham does a great job in guiding the reader from step to step and explaining the general strategy behind the approach to each mathematical problem. Actually, even if you don't have a great mathematical background, a lot of this book can still be read profitably, and may actually inspire you to brush up on math or talk to people more experienced in mathematics.This book isn't like most popular books in science or mathematics, in that it contains actual mathematical arguments. Since the author is trying to make this book accessible to a wide audience, certain great topics in mathematical history need to be omitted since they would require too many mathematical pre-requisites. For example, do not expect anything about 20th century mathematics (which is by and large far too technical for a book like this), despite the fact that many great theorems have been proven in the 20th century (and the first decade of the 21st!). Nevertheless, the math in this book is truly of the first-order and the author does a superb job of communicating it to his audience. If you have any interest in seeing some of the actual great ideas from mathematics, you can't go wrong with this book."},{"Title":"Journey Through Genius: The Great Theorems of Mathematics","review":"I am unsurprised by all the glowing reviews - they really are well-deserved. I read a large piece of this book in the hospital, recovering from a surprise major surgery. It held me spellbound despite the fact that I was often in considerable pain and sometimes on medications that robbed me of the ability to focus.Dunham is a master explicator: patient, wise, and quick with new angles that will help you see. Moreover, this is not one of those \\"popular\\" math books where the author suddenly pulls out all the stops and mysteriously renders the comprehension curve vertical. Despite the high level of sophistication of much of the material, Dunham does not abandon the reader but guides him or her gently towards comprehension. He makes you feel smart, which is a neat trick, I think! Finally, he includes just enough historical context to give the material zest ... and knows just when to stop and get on with the show.This is top-notch writing. I am working on getting my math back after years of neglect, and this is an absolutely delightful place to start."},{"Title":"Journey Through Genius: The Great Theorems of Mathematics","review":"Many histories of mathematics emphasis biography rather than mathematics. This book emphasizes the mathematics by showing the proofs used by key thinkers in the history of mathematics. You learn about the thought processes of the great minds of mathematics. Well written and aimed at those who have a good high school mathematics background, the author analyzes how each key thinker derived his famous mathematical proof. A good supplimental reading for students who are required to do proofs."},{"Title":"Journey Through Genius: The Great Theorems of Mathematics","review":"This book talks some of the most intriguing of classical math problems, and I can not tell you enough about how much of a pleasure it is to read.It forces us to put some thought over some of the mathematical results that we take for granted today, such as pythagorean theorum, the infinitude of the prime numbers, etc. I read it in just 2 sittings, and have read it over once again after that.If you have any inclination towards mathematics and its beauty, you will be a different person after you have read through this highly motivating and pleasurable read.The only thing I wished the book had more was the number of problems it covered :) I seriously wish that William Dunham sets out to write many more such books covering many many more such mathematical problems in his beautiful style! Wish you all the best, William!"},{"Title":"Journey Through Genius: The Great Theorems of Mathematics","review":"I came to this book after reading : Uncle Petros and Goldbach's Conjecture , and Fermat's Last Theorem: Unlocking the Secret of an Ancient Mathematical Problem. Both books were great ,but were lacking the Math itself. This book combines the history of the greatest mathematicians plus enabling the reader to face some of the most beautiful theorems and proofs. It is just a beautiful journey !"},{"Title":"Journey Through Genius: The Great Theorems of Mathematics","review":"I don't know too many math authors who have consistently written &quot;five-star&quot; books. I had the pleasure of having Dr. Dunham at Muhlenberg (not Muhlendorf!) College for a class on Landmarks of Modern Mathematics. With Dunham's sharp lectures, I hardly needed the book, but with his brilliant book, I hardly needed the lectures. The key, however, is that I wanted both, and couldn't get enough of either. Graduation and reaching the back cover does that...Others have already described what's in the book, but what I must stress is that everything - every single thing - in the book is written in a clear and captivating fashion. You feel like you're sitting right there with the mathematcian under review, solving the problems for the first time with their hints. You wonder if Dunham has a time machine hidden somewhere. What this book adds to the experience is that you get a hint not just about the mathemacians' genius, but also about the personalities of the mathematicians. For example, Cardano is probably one of the humorously psychotic mathematcians that lived.This book is good for anybody who has had half of a high school education all the way up to people who think in numbers. This isn't a &quot;skim over the math&quot; book like those of many of Dunham's contemporaries - and you wouldn't want to do that anyway. Buy it for yourself and then give it to a budding math student - or heck, buy two!"},{"Title":"Journey Through Genius: The Great Theorems of Mathematics","review":"I have gotten through the first 3 chapters, and the author does an excellent job of relating the historical context of the mathematics studied at the time. A very easy read, proofs are those of the historical figure.

I have always been impressed by these mathematicians work. The author really gives you a window into the restrictions that they faced in terms of the limited \\"notation\\", and their ability to accomplish some extraordinary theorems using just a straight edge and a compass.

What a treat! I would read it on the bus to and from work (5-odd years since graduating in pure mathematics I became nostalgic), making my 25-minute ride (one way) pass in no time...To write on any subject, one obviously needs the knowledge of it. However, to write a MASTERPIECE (about masterpieces in the chosen field), I think, requires two more ingredients: passion for the subject, in this case mathematics and its history, and the talent for writing about it in an engaging way. William Dunham undoubtedly demonstrated both.A MUST READ FOR A MATHEMATICIAN!"},{"Title":"Journey Through Genius: The Great Theorems of Mathematics","review":"William Dunham is an author who obviously loves his subject matter, and writes about it intelligently and clearly.

I hope William Dunham sticks to his task of transmitting the thread of how certain mathematical ideas evolved from previously unrelated sources.I will be re-reading this particularly in terms subjects such as the connection between the binomial theorem and the developmentof calculus and other explanations you do not find or cannot follow in textbooks. Long live William Dunham."},{"Title":"Journey Through Genius: The Great Theorems of Mathematics","review":"Well I couldn't fit the entire title I wanted. Add the words \\"made enjoyable to read\\" to the title. I'm not a mathematician by any stretch of the imagination, but I do enjoy the subject. The author picked what seemed to me to be some of the most significant mathematics over a 2300 year period and put it in a form that made it very enjoyable to read. I wish there was a course version of this offered during my college years. I think a student would get a lot out of it and also enjoy going to class."},{"Title":"Journey Through Genius: The Great Theorems of Mathematics","review":"Rarely is it properly appreciated that mathematics is one of the arts, and --- like all the other arts --- has created monuments of surpassing beauty through the centuries. Dunham does a wonderful job in this whirlwind tour of the past two thousand years of mathematics. He presents math as a story of triumph after triumph. Each chapter highlights one &quot;great&quot; theorem, and in every chapter he makes clear the context of the theorem by discussing preceding work, the life of the mathematician who proved the theorem, and the applications it opened up. He is masterful at mentioning tidbits in historical context that will be logically necessary to understand a few chapters further. No advanced knowledge of math is necessary, but I will caution: one must be at least reasonably fluent in both geometry and second year algebra in order to get the most out of this book. The more rusty one's algebra skills are, the more burdensome the proofs will be. For someone comfortable with that level of math, the book is breathtaking in the panoply of intellectual vistas it opens up. For anyone doing any kind of work in any technical field, I simply cannot recommend this book highly enough."},{"Title":"Journey Through Genius: The Great Theorems of Mathematics","review":"This book is fabulous.

The chapter on the non-denumerability of the continuum, and especially the section on Cantor's efforts to subjugate the concept 'infinity, takes your breath away.

This book strikes a perfect balance between the nitty-gritty of math and the historical context of its great discoveries.

More human history than just history of ideas. Even, if it does not talk enough about 19 et 20 th century (that's the maths i like best) it is very nice. May be another book for the more recent mathematicians???"},{"Title":"Journey Through Genius: The Great Theorems of Mathematics","review":"This is indeed a thrilling book to read. As the title claims, it is about the great theorems of mathematics that we have probably already read about. The book provides not only the description of the great theorems, but also it provides a historical account of the great mathematicians invloved in creating the art of mathematics. These historical accounts or biographies are very well written, and easy to read and most of all enjoy. There is one drawbaack to the text and that is the &quot;Fermat's last theorem&quot;, where the author states it is the greates unsolved problem, where the problem has been solved by A. Wiles. However, this is the problem of the time that the book is published.

It is clear and doable for anybody with an interest and motivation in mathematics. Two things I had to find outside the book: 1.) The proof by contradiction and infinite descent by Hipparchus that the sqrt(2) is irrational can be found in Newman's &quot;The World of Mathematics&quot; and in various places on the internet; and 2.) on p. 226 Dunham states that a certain formula was known to Euler to be an integer when p was prime. It took me awhile but the terms of this formula are p-choose-k (the combinations of p things chosen k at a time) divided by p ... with a little manipulation one can see that for 1&lt;=k&lt;p and for p prime and with an understanding of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic (basically every integer has a unique prime factorization), that every term is an integer of the form p-choose-k where p has been factored out (and p is prime).Everything else is there to take a ride from 300BC to 1900AD. Keep paper and pencil handy! And enjoy!"},{"Title":"Journey Through Genius: The Great Theorems of Mathematics","review":"The author does a good job of exploring the history of math by looking at 12 great theorems. He does a fairly good job explaining the math. But even if a lot of the math goes over your head it is still interesting because the author explains why the theorems are important in the historical context and also the personalities and politics involved. I think the book is also interesting as a look at western civilization. Much was done by the Greeks but then there is a big gap until the enlightment. Overall highly recommended given that you have some interest in math to start."},{"Title":"Journey Through Genius: The Great Theorems of Mathematics","review":"With tremendous story telling skills as well as an understanding and appreciation of math, Dunham brings to life great personalities in the field. As much a fascinating biography of each mathematician as an exploration of their contributions, the book is colorful and informative. A page turner for the mathematically or historically inclined reader."},{"Title":"Journey Through Genius: The Great Theorems of Mathematics","review":"This book gave some stories of the lives of famous mathematicians, as well as outlines of their most important work. I had been reading the encyclopediac \\"history of mathematics\\" by Carl Boyer (revised by Uta Merzbach) when the mood strikes. My knowledge of the basis and history of mathematics has always been pretty dim. In my unenlightened youth, I always saw mathematics as a tool to do physics. Now a days, I consider it a thing of beauty in its own right. Reading the history of the subject has been a way of my remedying my ignorance of some of the great pure theorems of mathematics. And of course, the characters who have thought them up are priceless. This book was fairly modern and chatty compared to the Boyer work and most others you will find in this \\"pop mathematics\\" field.One thing which made by blood boil was the authors insistance on applying small-minded modern bias against \\"sexist language\\" to, for example, the motto of the Pythagorean academy, \\"let no man ignorant of geometry enter here.\\" The author makes himself look the gnat he is in tossing his beer bottle of modern fashion in morality at the giants of the past. To say nothing of the irony that the Pythagoreans were probably the origin of the idea that women had brains worth teaching, and they treated women as equals more than, say, the 21st century Harvard mathematics faculty apparently does. Perhaps I overreact to such (relatively gentle) treatment, but such pusillanimity in the face of cement-headed moralistic ignorance should be shown for what it is.On the other hand, I quite enjoyed his treatments of renaissance man, Cardano, and his solution to the cubic equation. His stories of the smarmy and competetive Bernoiuli brothers were most chuckleworthy. Until I read this, I really had no idea how Newtons life progressed, beyond the fact that he was often interested in silly occultism, like alchemy, and the plain fact of his Genius. Euler, I had known a thing or two about, but I was quite impressed by the breadth and magnitude of his acheivements. Dunham's treatment of Cantors theorems actually filled me with awe; it was poetic enough I almost forgot his other childish complaints that the giants were not up to late 20th century fashions in upper middle class morality.In fact, I would never have purchased this book, had a colleague not recommended the book for its beautiful treatment of Cantors theorem. The book is a much more colorful and lively treatment of the subject matter than the Boyer and Mertzbach book, though it is much more limited in scope."},{"Title":"Journey Through Genius: The Great Theorems of Mathematics","review":"When were algebraic equations formulated with symbols? When were decimal expansions introduced? These questions are answered in readable form, along with examples of some simple and very interesting calculations made by Newton.

Without those contributions, neither calculus nor classical mechanics could have been discovered by him."},{"Title":"Journey Through Genius: The Great Theorems of Mathematics","review":"Either a solid highschool math background or a college algera course makes this book worthwhile. The author has his favorites, but he puts a real face on mathematicians who have changed history. It's a great resource book for teachers and an inspiration for those like mathematics and also the first book I've read that included the converse of the \\"P\\" Theorem. The story of the solution to cubic equations was fun. Fermat aside, the great theorems, which often seem quite simple, are a result of focused dedicated effort. The book is a keeper."},{"Title":"Journey Through Genius: The Great Theorems of Mathematics","review":"This is the first review that I've ever written, but after reading this book, I could only think that this should be a must read for all high school students (especially those who think math boring).

It sheds light on the human story behind evolving of mathematics. There are no dry mathematical theorems. Rather, these theorems and proofs are written in a way that fascinates and inspires the reader. This lucidly written book inspires to study more about the subject and number of polymaths it refers to.Note on how to read: The book refers to many great human minds, throughout. I had little knowledge about Cicero or Leibniz. So, I usually google and read about them. It is a little digression and slows you down; but you learn much more. Similarly, a theorem or topic of interest, briefly discussed in epilogue of each chapter, can be studied in more detail, as you go along."},{"Title":"Journey Through Genius: The Great Theorems of Mathematics","review":"First things first: You have to really like maths to appreciate this book. If you have ever wondered how to prove Pythagoras' theorem geometrically, or would like to find out how Archimedes estimated pi, this is the book for you. If not, buy another.The book has a good mix of stories, explanations and mathematical proofs. It actually answered questions I have been wondering about for a long time (proving Pythagoras' theorem and finding the formula for solving second order equations), but even if you are not the nerd I am, there is a big chance you will find this book fascinating."},{"Title":"Journey Through Genius: The Great Theorems of Mathematics","review":"This is a great book for a math nerd. My daughter is pursuing her advanced degree in mathematics and this was a special request from her. She loves it!"},{"Title":"Journey Through Genius: The Great Theorems of Mathematics","review":"Some books, such as Ball's and Beiler's seem to have sparked a life-long love of mathematics in practically everyone who reads them. &quot;Journey Through Genius&quot; should be another such book.In the Preface, the author comments that it is common practice to teach appreciation for art through a study of the great masterpieces. Art history students study not only the great works, but also the lives of the great artists, and it is hard to imagine how one could learn the subject any other way. Why then do we neglect to teach the Great Theorems of mathematics, and the lives of their creators? Dunham sets out to do just this, and succeeds beyond all expectations.Each chapter consists of a biography of the main character interwoven with an exposition of one of the Great Theorems. Also included are enough additional theorems and proofs to support each of the main topics so that Dunham essentially moves from the origins of mathematical proof to modern axiomatic set theory with no prerequisites. Admittedly it will help if the reader has taken a couple of high school algebra classes, but if not, it should not be a barrier to appreciating the book. Each chapter concludes with an epilogue that traces the evolution of the central ideas forward in time through the history of mathematics, placing each theorem in context.The journey begins with Hippocrates of Chios who demonstrated how to construct a square with area equal to a particular curved shape called a Lune. This &quot;Quadrature of the Lune&quot; is believed to be the earliest proof in mathematics, and in Dunham's capable hands, we see it for the gem of mathematics that it is. The epilogue discusses the infamous problem of \\"squaring the circle\\", which mathematicians tried to solve for over 2000 years before Lindeman proved that it is impossible.In chapters 2 and 3 we get a healthy dose of Euclid. Dunham briefly covers all 13 books of &quot;The Elements&quot;, discussing the general contents and importance of each. He selects several propositions directly from Euclid and proves them in full using Euclid's arguments paraphrased in modern language. The diagrams are excellent, and very helpful in understanding the proofs. If you've ever tried to read Euclid in a direct translation, you should truly appreciate Dunham's exposition: the mathematics is at once elementary, intricate, and beautiful, but Dunham is vastly easier to read than Euclid. The Great Theorems of these chapters are Euclid's proof of the Pythagorean theorem and The Infinitude of Primes, which rests at the heart of modern number theory. Dunham obviously loves Euclid, and his enthusiasm is infectious. After reading this, it is easy to see why &quot;The Elements&quot; is the second most analyzed text in history (after The Bible).Archimedes is the subject of chapter 4, and he was a true Greek Hero. Even if most of the stories of Archimedes' life are apocryphal, they still make very interesting reading. However the core of the chapter is the Great Theorem, Archimedes' Determination of Circular Area. His method anticipated the integral calculus by some 1800 years, and also introduced the world to the wonderful and ubiquitous number pi. The epilogue traces attempts to approximate pi all the way up to the incomparable Indian mathematician of the 20th century, Ramanujan.Chapter 5 concerns Heron's formula for the area of a triangle. The proof is extremely convoluted and intricate, with a great surprise ending. It is well worth the effort to follow it through to the end. Chapter 6 is about Cardano's solution to the general cubic equation of algebra. Cardono is certainly one of the strangest characters in the history of mathematics, and Dunham does a great job telling the story. The epilogue discusses the problem of solving the general quintic or higher degree equation, and Neils Abel's shocking 1824 proof that such a solution is impossible.Sir Isaac Newton is the topic of chapter 7. Rather than go into the calculus deeply, Dunham gives us Newton's Binomial Theorem, which he didn't really prove, but nevertheless showed how it could be put to great use in the Great Theorem of this chapter, namely the approximation of pi. Chapter 8 breezes through the Bernoulli brothers' proof that the Harmonic Series does not converge, with lots of very interesting historical biography thrown in for good measure.Chapters 9 and 10 discuss the incredible genius of Leonard Euler, who contributed very significant results to virtually every field of mathematics, and seems to have been a decent human being to boot. Chapter 10, &quot;A Sampler of Euler's Number Theory&quot;, is my favorite in the book. A large portion of his work in number theory came from proving (or disproving) propositions due to Fermat, which were passed on to him by his friend Goldbach. This chapter gives complete proofs of several of these wonderful theorems including Fermat's Little Theorem, all of which lead up to the gem of the chapter. Taken as a whole it is the kind of number theory detective work that has lured so many people into the field over the years. Chapter 10 is a mathematical tour de force.The last 2 chapters handle Cantor's work in the &quot;transfinite realm&quot;, and should certainly serve to expand the mind of any reader. By the time you finish, you'll have an idea about the twentieth century crisis in mathematics, and its resolution, and what sorts of concepts are capable of making modern mathematicians squirm in their seats. Dunham does a beautiful job of demonstrating Cantor's proof of the non-denumerability of the continuum. At this altitude of intellectual mountain-climbing the air is thin, but it is well worth the climb!In brief, &quot;Journey Through Genius&quot; might almost be considered a genius work of mathematical exposition. I can think of few authors more capable of conveying the excitement and beauty of mathematics, as well as an appreciation for the sheer enormity of the achievements of the human mind and spirit."},{"Title":"Journey Through Genius: The Great Theorems of Mathematics","review":"William Dunham has brought life to a subject that almost everyone considers dull, boring and dead. Dunham investigates and explains, in easy-to-understand language and simple algebra, some of the most famous theorems of mathematics. But what sets this book apart is his descriptions of the mathemeticians themselves, and their lives. It becomes easier to understand their thinking process, and thus to understand their theorems.I am a layman with a computer science degree, and a layman's understanding of mathematics, so I am no expert! But I loved this book.I found Dunham's description of Archimedes' life and his reasoning for finding the area of a circle and volume of a cylinder to be (almost!) riveting.Dunham's decription of Cantor and his reasoning regarding the cardinality of infinite sets was fascinating to me. But most of all, I loved his chapter on Leonhard Euler. Having in high school been fascinated by Euler's derivation of e^(i*PI) = -1, I was even more amazed at the scope of this man's genius, and Dunham's description of his life.The chapter on Isaac Newton is an especially good one as well.Dunham smartly weaves these important theorems of mathematics into the history of mathematics, making this book even more understandable, and, dare I say it, actually entertaining!This book is a gem, and for anyone interested in mathematics, it is not to be missed."},{"Title":"Journey Through Genius: The Great Theorems of Mathematics","review":"Dunham has done an excellent job of taking us through the history of mathematics providing a context with the civilization of the time. He shapes his production around what he considers to be the great theorems of mathematics.The order of presentation is chronological. Early on we see great admiration for Euclid and his \\"Elements\\" as two of Euclid's theorems appear on the list, a proof of the Pythagorean theorem and the proof that there are infinitely many primes. Euler and Cantor are also honored with two theorems included among the collection.However there is more to Dunham's presentation than just the proofs. We find other related results by these masters and other great mathematicians that were their contemporaries. He shows reverence for Newton. Gauss and Weierstrass and others are mentioned but none of their theorems are highlighted.It is not his intention to slight these great mathematicians. Rather, Dunham's criteria seems to be to present the theorems that have simple and elegant proofs but often surprising results. His coverage of Cantor is particularly good. It seems that he is most knowledgeable about Cantor's mathematics of transfinite numbers and the related axiomatic set theory.For a detailed description of the chapters in this work, look at the detailed review by Shard here at Amazon. I found this book to be well written and authoritative and learned a few things about Euler and number theory that I hadn't known from my undergraduate and graduate training in mathematics. Yet I did not give the book five stars.There are a couple of omissions that I find reduce it to a four star rating. My main objection is the slighting of Evariste Galois. Galois was the great French mathematician who died in a duel at the early age of 21 in the year 1832. Yet, in his short life he developed a theory of abstract algebra seemingly unrelated to the great unsolved questions about constructions with straight edge and compass due to the Greeks and yet his theory resolved many of these questions. I was very impressed in graduate school when I learned the Galois theory and came to realize that problems such as a solution to the general 5th degree equation by radicals and the trisection of an arbitrary angle with straight edge and compass were impossible.Now, Galois theory is certainly beyond the scope of this book but so is non-Euclidean geometry and aspects of number theory and set theory that Dunham chooses to mention. He spends a great deal of time on Euclid's work and the various possible constructions with straight edge and compass.Also, in the chapter on Cardano's proof of the general solution to the cubic, he also presents the solution to the quartic and refers to Abel's result on the impossibility of the general solution to the quintic equation. This would have been the perfect place to introduce Galois who independently and at the same time in history proved the impossibility of solving the general quintic equation by radicals. Oddly Galois is never once mentioned in the entire book.In discussing number theory and Euler's contributions, the theorems and conjectures of Fermat are mentioned. This book was written in 1991 and it presents Fermat's last theorem as an unproven conjecture.Andrew Wiles presented a proof of Fermat's last theorem to the mathematical community in 1993 and after some needed patchwork to the proof, it is now agreed that Fermat's last theorem is true. There are a number of books written on Fermat's last theorem including an excellent book by Simon Singh. It seems that Dunham's book is popular and has been reprinted at least 10 times since the original printing in 1991. It would have been appropriate to modify the discussion of Fermat's last theorem in one of these reprintings."},{"Title":"Journey Through Genius: The Great Theorems of Mathematics","review":"As a high school math teacher, I found Dunham's book perfectfor filling what is sadly lacking in math textbooks--the idea thatreal people have contributed to the progress of mathematics. Dunham makes it clear that mathematics is not simply calculation, but an exciting journey of discovery. I have included the book in my Advanced Mathematics courses for several years now, and my students always name it as one of the best parts of the class. The other day, one of my calc students corrected an underclassman's pronunciation of Euler, commenting, &quot;he was great enough that we should pronounce his name correctly.&quot; Journey Through Genius is where he encountered Euler's greatness."},{"Title":"Journey Through Genius: The Great Theorems of Mathematics","review":"Absolutely fantastically written. Dunham takes unfamiliar mathematical theorems and makes sense out of the whole works. Plus, he gives detailed (and extremely interesting) accounts of the people and times of certain mathematics.

The beauty of it is, you don't even need to be a great mathematician to enjoy and understand this wonderful book."},{"Title":"Journey Through Genius: The Great Theorems of Mathematics","review":"The author puts interesting and revolutionary mathematical theorems into their historical context.

I also the lives of mathematicians intereting.Dunham's book fits the bill for excellent reading in mathematics. It has just enough meat to it so that I can get insights into various mathematical theories. However he never gets so technical that I fall asleep reading the material.The best parts of the book are the discussions of the various mathematician's and the importance of the mathematical in question. Both form the bulk of the book and are witty and informative. After reading this book, you get the impression that the history of mathematics is filled with a collection of absentminded and colourful men. These parts of the book can be read and enjoyed with absolutely no understanding of the mathematics involved. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to get some basic knowledge of mathematics and its history."},{"Title":"Journey Through Genius: The Great Theorems of Mathematics","review":"I am a recent college graduate with a BS in Math. I went through college simply as I could. I chose math because it was typically easy to me, but I never really tried to get any true grasp on it. I only began to understand the most basic concepts in math when I taught Algebra I for a semester to high school freshmen. That experience motivated me to develop a better understanding of the most basic concepts in math. Jump forward a year, and I am now about to enter grad school for applied math. After reading this book and soaking it in, I feel like I have the tools to be very successful now. I will take classes with a very different mind set. I am very excited to get started next week. I tell you that I am motivated so much that I am going to retake a few undergraduate math courses for my own sanity. Maybe I'm crazy. I have never been so excited about math or viewed it as a beautiful art. It is pure. Euclid's proof of the Pythagorean Theorem truly humbled me. I had viewed it before, but had never been motivated to try to understand it. That is where Dunham steps in. He creates such an excitement about it that it forces the reader to read and reread the proof. I have actually worked it out 3 times for myself to ensure that I truly get it. It feels powerful. Furthermore, I'm only about half way through the book. It is going to take me a while though. I have to convince myself that I can reproduce everything before I move on to the next chapter. Maybe I'm being hard on myself. For those of you who seem to suggest that if you took high school algebra and geometry everything is peaches and cream.... I don't get it. To read this book and really soak it in, one has to have the foundations of a true understanding of high school algebra and geometry. That is a different animal. It is easily attainable with the proper focus though.

Yeah, I'm talking about those funny stupid books which keeps talking about math for 400 pages but shy away from putting one real equation or proof. Well, this book is different and if you ask me, it's the best book on mathematics I've came across so far. It's the collection of some of the cleverest not-too-obvious theorems derived from the scratch with really fluid explanation and plenty of diagrams. One of the coolest thing about this book is that it first gives you a historical preview of the problem which is usually gets really interesting and pretty fun to read, specially all those tid-bits about the people involved. So by the time you reach to the proof, you know why it was a hard to do thing and you can fully appreciate the clever twists and turns in the proof. You can literally enjoy it like some murder mystery thriller. The book is written with loads and loads of infectious passion for mathematics.

However, those who are not interested in the details can skip them without compromising their enjoyment of the book. William Dunham seamlessly weaves a story of these wonderful mathematical geniuses, the times they lived in, their motivations and last but not least, their theorems.

I have used this book as a supplementary text as a high school teacher, and though my students could not follow the proofs, they enjoyed reading the stories (advanced high school students could probably follow them). Readers who have a basic background in mathematics should be able to follow most of the proofs with patience.

It certainly does cover enough of the history and personality to set the context, but the book is really about the mathematical proofs. It clearly conveys the essence of what a mathematical proof is -- both in general, and specifically in the twelve examples presented in this book.Dunham's own genius, I think, is in being able to do this without resorting to higher mathematics. It uses only high school math; there's nary a derivative or integral symbol anywhere in the book, even though most of the original proofs he covers involved some pretty sophisticated mathematics.If \\"proof\\" for you is something that raises dim and possibly uncomfortable memories of high school geometry, I think this book will open your eyes, and mind. People tend to think of a proof as something arid and stuffy. Actually, the great mathematical proofs are among the most creative achievements of the human mind, and Dunham allows you to re-live the \\"rush\\" the mathematician must have felt when the pieces of the puzzle finally clicked into place.You'll likely find, as I did, that this is not a book to speed read or complete at one sitting.

It is a well-written sampling intended to be readable by people whose background in mathematics may be relatively limited and in fact it requires a command of the mathematics of only about halfway through high school to understand.The only thing that should be understood is that some of the theorems (such as Heron's formula for the area of a triangle) while requiring no more mathematics than a high school sophomore geometry class, require you to follow a rather long chain of reasoning, which may lose some of the less-mathematical readers. But if you're willing to apply yourself, you can get a lot out of this book."},{"Title":"Journey Through Genius: The Great Theorems of Mathematics","review":"JTG is a terrific piece of popular mathematics (and mathematics history).

Last semester, I had to take a Math History class. Before I started the class, I read Journey Through Genius (I chewed through it on my off-time). The book required for my class ended up being Math Through the Ages. It did not take me long to realize that my teacher had made a terrible choice in texts. Ages is terribly disjointed and redundant. And worse, it is dry and dull. Journey, on the other hand, was an extremely entertaining telling of the history of mathematics. I have always been good at math, and had made it through Calculus 3 before reading Journey, and yet I still learned so much about basic mathematical concepts from this outstanding book. On top of that, I actually ENJOYED reading Journey. I don't know how many times my husband called me \\"geek\\" and \\"nerd\\" as I chuckled my way through the different mathematicians (especially Cardano). I recommend this book to all math students and math lovers. I think it would be a great addition to a high school math student's education as well."},{"Title":"Journey Through Genius: The Great Theorems of Mathematics","review":"When reading the historical context of the mathematicians discussed, I really got the feeling of being there. I particularly enjoyed the story of Cardano. Some day there will be a documentary made of his life.I liked the math presented, but I found a little annoying the way it was done. Too often, it was hard to see where the discussion was leading. There was not enough motivation provided. A series of preliminary results was presented and the final result suddenly appears as if from nowhere. I gave up on the proof of Heron's Theorem. Dunham tells us to be patient, that the result was finally coming, but it was too much for me.In the proof of Fermat's Little Theorem, I do not understand why it was not shown why (a+1)^p - (a^p +1) is divisible by p, where p is a prime. The proof is pretty simple. Using the Binomial Theorem, previously discussed in the book, what we have is the expansion of (a+1)^p minus the first and last terms, that is, the sum of p!/((k!(p-k)!) a^k for 0 &lt; k &lt; p. We know this is an integer, so the terms in the denominator cancel with those in the numerator. Since all the terms in the denominator are less than the prime p, none of them cancel the p in the numerator, so each term, and hence the sum of them, is divisible by p. More formally, we could say that C(p,k) = p!/(k!(p-k)!), p!=C(p,k)k!(p-k)!, and get the same result from the fact that both sides are divisible by p.A presentation of the formula for geometric series could have been put to good use. It would have made it easy to prove the connection between Mersenne primes (geometric series) and perfect numbers. It would also have made clearer the work behind Euler's factorization technique for Fermat numbers.Even with these caveats, I still recommend the book. If the book is ever rewritten, with a little work a very good book could be turned into a great book."},{"Title":"Journey Through Genius: The Great Theorems of Mathematics","review":"+++++A highlight of this easy-to-read book, by Dr. William Dunham, is that it explores twelve \\"great theorems of mathematics\\" that have occurred throughout history. (A theorem is a statement or proposition that is proved by logical reasoning from given facts and justifiable assumptions.) Dunham calls the theorems he explores \\"mathematical masterpieces\\" or \\"mathematical landmarks.\\" He tries to get the reader to appreciate the \\"creativity\\" evident in them.Four of the theorems presented were formulated in very ancient times. (For example, two were formulated circa 300 BC.) One was formulated in the first century, another was formulated in the sixteenth century, and two each were formulated in the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries respectively.What factors influenced Dunham to choose his particular theorems that \\"represent the best of mathematics\\" or what he calls the \\"Mona Lisas or Hamlets of mathematics?\\" Answer: (1) the theorems had to be insightful (2) they had to be formulated from history's leading mathematicians and (3) they had to be important (that is they had to resolve long-standing problems in mathematics or generate even more profound future questions).The theorems themselves come from different branches of mathematics, that is, a variety are presented. As Dunham states: \\"The propositions of [this] book come from the realms of plane geometry, algebra, number theory, analysis, and [set theory].\\"In general, to understand these theorems requires high school algebra and geometry. Some trigonometry and elementary integral calculus would also be useful.However, this book is much more than just theorems. It details the history of important events in mathematics and puts these theorems in historical context. As well biographical information is given not only of those who created these \\"great theorems\\" but of other significant geniuses whose mathematical insight was essential to the development of these theorems. At the end of each chapter is an \\"Epilogue,\\" usually addressing an issue raised by a great theorem.A main feature of this book is that some of the actual writings of those who created the theorems are included or the actual writings of those who observed these geniuses are included. Here is one of my favorites from an observer:\\"He always kept close to his studyes, very rarely went a visiting, & had a few Visiters...I never knew him [to] take any Recreation or Pastime, either in Riding out or to take ye Air, Walking, Bowling, or any other Exercise whatever, Thinking of Hours lost, that was not spent in his studyes...He very rarely went to Dine in ye Hall...& then, if He has not been minded, would go very carelessly, with Shoes down at Heels, Stockins untiy'd...& his Head scarcely comb'd.\\"Illustrations can be found throughout this book. They greatly aid the discussion.Finally, mathematician and philosopher Bertrand Russell once said:\\"Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty-a beauty cold and austere, like that of sculpture, without appeal to any part of our weaker nature, without the...trappings of painting or music, yet sublimely pure, and capable of stern perfection such as the greatest art can show.\\"This was my reaction to the great theorems in this book. I also experienced a sense of personal satisfaction that I could comprehend the works of these masters!(first published 1990; preface; acknowledgements; 12 chapters; main narrative of 285 pages; afterword; notes; references; index)+++++"},{"Title":"Journey Through Genius: The Great Theorems of Mathematics","review":"This book is an important read for a layman trying to get a better grasp on the actual historical building blocks of math. Because Dunham goes through the actual problems and solutions of great mathemeticians the book moves beyond a simple narrative. A deceptively relevant book for anyone trying to understand intellectual history.Its nice to finally see the beauty of what the dullards back in math class were trying to teach us. The reviewers are right that the personalities of some of the mathemeticians do come alive here. But that has been done elsewhere (in more detail as well).The discovery and refinement of mathematics is a central component of civilization, and this is a wonderful way to see its actual historical footings."},{"Title":"Journey Through Genius: The Great Theorems of Mathematics","review":"Mathematical truths possess a beauty quite unlike any other work known to man, and the ability to appreciate that beauty should not be limited to expert mathematicians. In the preface to his book, Journey Through Genius, William Dunham notes that there are books on the great works of art, literature, and music, but that discussions on the mathematical \`\`classics'' are scarce. His excellent, thoroughly enjoyable, and articulate book fills that void. Most importantly, the book is written for the layperson, requiring only a familiarity with high school geometry and algebra.A simple elucidation of the greatest mathematical discoveries would be interesting in its own right, but this book goes far beyond that. It also presents fascinating glimpses into the lives of the mathematicians themselves and the cultures in which they worked. For example, we discover that academic positions during the Renaissance were not guaranteed by tenure, but were rather bolstered by successes in public, intellectual \`\`duels''. As a result, mathematicians kept their discoveries secret, sometimes revealing them only on their deathbeds. We also learn of the ongoing sibling rivalry between the mathematical brothers Jakob and Johann Bernoulli. And we feel sympathy for Georg Cantor, whose counter-intuitive results were widely criticized, driving him to several bouts of mental illness. What emerges overall is an engrossing patchwork presentation of the history of mathematics and of humanity in general.The book is divided into 12 chapters, each describing and proving a \`\`great'' theorem. These theorems have been chosen to represent discoveries spanning both time (with the notable exception of the first through 16th centuries) and a diverse range of mathematical disciplines. Each chapter sets the historical scene for a great theorem to be proven, and gives short biographies of the mathematicians contributing to its discovery. Moreover, each chapter presents (and proves) many other results, and each concludes with an enlightening epilogue section. These epilogues usually discuss later developments regarding the theorem, and often relate the result to other theorems in the book.The journey begins in the 4th century B.C. with the ancient Greeks. They pondered the problem of quadrature, that is, the use of only a straight-edge and compass to construct a square having the same area of some given figure. The ultimate goal of the Greeks was to \`\`square'' the circle. Dunham shows us how to easily \`\`square'' figures such as rectangles, triangles, and arbitrary polygons composed entirely of straight line segments. He concludes with Hippocrates' theorem that a figure composed of curved lines---namely, the lune---can be squared. This gave the Greeks a false hope that the circle could be squared also; later mathematicians showed that the task is impossible.A full two chapters are devoted to Euclid and his famous work, The Elements. The first chapter focuses on Euclid's contributions to geometry, culminating in his proof of the Pythagorean Theorem and its converse. The emphasis here is on Euclid's method, and the epilogue delves into a discussion of non-Euclidean geometry. The second chapter on Euclid describes his lesser-known results in number theory, that branch of mathematics dealing with properties of whole numbers. Euclid used an ingenious argument to show that there are an infinite number of prime numbers, those numbers divisible only by one and themselves.We are next introduced to the brilliant mathematician and engineer Archimedes, who is probably best known for discovering the law of buoyancy. Although he was the mind behind the practical inventions forming the \`\`one-man army'' that long kept the Romans from conquering Syracuse, Archimedes was happiest doing abstract mathematics. His \`\`great theorem'' concerns the value Pi, defined to be the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, and his discovery that it also plays a role in the formula for a circle's area. Archimedes also gave the first means of computing Pi to arbitrary precision. The book revisits this topic in its discussion of Isaac Newton's invention of the calculus.The middle ages brought a blight to mathematics and to human innovation in general. The journey continues at the dawn of the Renaissance with the tale of Gerolamo Cardano, a flamboyant and idiosyncratic Italian mathematician. Cardano is known for his discovery of the closed-form solution to the cubic equation A x^3 + B x^2 + C x + D = 0. This is perhaps the most enjoyable story in the book, filled as it is with intrigue, secrecy, tragedy, and brilliant ingenuity.Later chapters deal with results in algebra, number theory, and set theory, including the rather surprising discovery by the Bernoulli brothers that the infinite sum 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + ... diverges. Also highlighted is the genius of Leonhard Euler and his amazing result that the similarly appearing infinite sum 1/1 + 1/4 + 1/9 + 1/16 + ..., the sum of the reciprocals of squares, converges to the improbable value (Pi^2) / 6. Another chapter highlights results from number theory by Euler and Carl Freidrich Gauss. The book concludes with two astounding results by Georg Cantor demonstrating the infinite hierarchy of orders of infinity.The presentation of material throughout the book is consistently clear. Not only is the book well-organized and well-written, but it also contains scores of illuminating figures. Some of these figures are even taken directly from the original publications. To preserve the historical objective of the presentation, Dunham has stayed as closely as possible to the original notation and proofs. His effort pays off handsomely: the historic flavor of the descriptions goes a long way toward conveying the intuition contributing to each discovery.Overall, Journey Through Genius is an excellent survey of truly great and beautiful discoveries in mathematics. The theorems it discusses are indeed \`\`great'': they are all ground-breaking and surprising, without having complicated proofs. Moreover, the book's fascinating presentation of historical nuances shows the human side of the story, and it helps us to appreciate the true genius of the mathematicians involved. One cannot help but feel a sense of awe for both the mathematicians and the discoveries themselves. I highly recommend this immensely rewarding book...."},{"Title":"Journey Through Genius: The Great Theorems of Mathematics","review":"Mr. Dunham is to be commended for presenting mathematical theory and history in a way that is both engrossing and informative. While not a mathematician, I found the book easily readable and true to the technical content. The sections on Newton, Euler, and the Bernoullis were personal favorites and Dunham can even make the Greeks and geometry a page-turner. After rereading this book several times, I re-opened those dusty math textbooks on my shelf with a better appreciation. Highest ecommendations for this book!"},{"Title":"Journey Through Genius: The Great Theorems of Mathematics","review":"The author modestly refers to the journey as that of others. In fact, writing his book was an expression of his own genius. True, he chronicled great mathematicians' works, but to weave things together as he did required a spirit kindred to their own. The book looks at the lives and works of several mathematicians. Results are put into sharp perspective. Unlike anything that I had read before, Dunham describes the reasons that things were of interest, rather than merely saying what the results were. Instead of only giving the result, he derives it, so that the reader has a visceral grasp of what's going on. I'm waiting for the sequel."},{"Title":"Journey Through Genius: The Great Theorems of Mathematics","review":"This is a wonderful book. People with a basic grasp of math who are open to the idea that math might be beautiful will be rewarded. But I have a PhD in math and thoroughly enjoyed it, and learned some things along the way. (Because math is taught very ahistorically, Chapter 1 was entirely unfamiliar to me).These are *not* \\"*The* Great Theorems of Mathematics,\\" as the subtitle suggests, but they certainly are \\"Great Theorems of Mathematics.\\" Most \\"Great Theorems\\" are too technical to be presented in a book of this sort, but Mr. Dunham has done a wonderful job selecting theorems that can be proved with a minimum of prerequisites. In some ways this is a more challenging task than choosing the \\"greatest\\" theorems.My main reservation is the fact that at times the proofs get more ponderous than necessary, and can wind up obscuring the simplicity and elegance of the mathematics. The most glaring example is the already-noted proof of Fermat's Little Theorem (p. 226-9). The proof is incomplete, and presented in a very obscure way. The key fact, that (a+b)^p = a^p + b^p (mod p) follows easily and beautifully from the binomial theorem, so a complete proof could be given quite straightforwardly. I had the sense that some of the other theorems could have been presented somewhat more cleanly as well.The story behind Bernoulli's proof of the divergence of the harmonic series is enjoyable, but Bernoulli's proof is complex and unmotivated. Happily Mr. Dunham presents the beautiful proof Nicole Oresme from the 14th century. It is superior to Bernoulli's in every way: shorter, more elegant, and more illuminating, since pursuing his line of thinking makes it clear that the series grows as the log of the number of terms. So it's hard to see why Bernoulli is getting high marks for this particular proof, though he is overall a towering figure in the history of mathematics.Really, all my complaints are nit-picking. This is a wonderful book.I do want to defend Mr. Dunham from one of the other reviews: Euclid's can prove (in modern language) that the area of a circle divided by the radius squared is a constant, and he can prove that the circumference divided by the diameter is a constant. But Euclid didn't show that these are the *same* constant, and that is why Archimedes result can fairly be seen as \\"greater\\" than Euclid's. Not that those theorems of Euclid's were slouches by any means."},{"Title":"Journey Through Genius: The Great Theorems of Mathematics","review":"In \\"Journey Through Genius,\\" William Dunham has selected twelve of the most famous theorems from throughout the history of mathematics, starting in ancient Greece and proceeding to modern times. He devotes a chapter to each of these theorems. Each chapter begins with background information -- about the mathematician who proved the theorem, the state of mathematics at the time, and any other pertinent mathematical information needed for understanding the proof of the theorem. He then proceeds to present a proof of the theorem, trying to follow closely the original proof, but also making sure to follow modern conventions for mathematical notation, and making sure to present the proof in a way that can easily be understood. Finally, he closes each chapter with additional information of interest regarding the particular theorem and/or mathematician, including other advances in mathematics that followed as a result of the theorem in question.The overall result of putting together each of these individual chapters is that the book as a whole serves as an excellent introduction to mathematical history, with most of the important people and events in mathematical history discussed. I found it to be a very entertaining book, one that is written with the layman in mind, rather than the mathematical expert. In fact, all that is needed in order to follow the proofs and other mathematical presentations in this book is a solid grounding in high school algebra and geometry (knowledge of calculus is not required).This book may not have a very wide appeal, but for someone like myself who has always liked math, this is a very enjoyable book. I found it very satisfying to follow the logic of each of the proofs, and I learned some things about mathematical history that I didn't know even after taking several college-level math classes. I didn't find the book to be particularly challenging, but I think that the author's intention was to get the reader to appreciate the aesthetic \\"beauty\\" of each of the proofs, rather than to present an intellectual challenge. I would recommend this book for anyone with a strong interest in mathematics."},{"Title":"Journey Through Genius: The Great Theorems of Mathematics","review":"Dunham explains the great theorems of mathematics by introducing you to the creators and the times in which they lived.

I read this a year ago, and wish I had read it in high school or first year of college, but it wasn't published until I was out of college. I read many of Martin Gardner's book which collected his Mathematical Games column in Scientific American while in school, but those had tempting bits and pieces where this book feels like the whole enchilada. I already had great interest, and this book might have directed me to a career in mathematics.My only problem is with the FOUR PAGES (I counted) on the hard personal life of the man who solved the cubic equation, solely to say that one doesn't have to live a nice, upper-class life to make a significant contribution to math. But I think that's the only four consecutive pages with no math content in the whole book.ETA (Nov. 2012) I wrote this a while back but forgot to say what I found MOST fascinating and informative about the book: I recall paging through the CRC mathematical tables book when I was in high school and seeing all these infinite series for pi, some which converged much faster than others, and I wondered how in the world someone came up with these.

Bell's bookMen of Mathematics (Touchstone Books)is far more preferable.Despite this, the theorems are, in fact, great. Their creators were 'geniuses' as well."},{"Title":"Journey Through Genius: The Great Theorems of Mathematics","review":"This is a good book. I shall offer some minor points of criticism, but only because the praise that the book deserves would be too repetitive. First we should note that the originality lies in the mathematics (esp. chs. 7 and 8 are pretty original); the historical narrative is basically just a compilation of the standard anecdotes (often tangentially related at best to the mathematics discussed). My main problem with this book is that Dunham is too uncritical and faithful to the canon: where the canon is silent, so is Dunham, no matter how glaring the omission may be. There is one serious illustration of this: Archimedes on the circle (ch. 4). We read that \\"Archimedes' bold proposition easily implied Euclid's relatively tame result that the areas of two circles are in the same ratio as the squares upon their diameters\\" (p. 96). I suggest that \\"bold\\" and \\"tame\\" are euphemisms for \\"taught today\\" and \\"not taught today\\" respectively. Durham, being a slave to the current canon, is happy with this test and does not provide any additional evidence or arguments for his claim. This is great shame for anyone who is not willing to salute the reigning flag for the sake of it. Why is Archimedes' result \\"bold\\" and \\"great\\" enough to warrant inclusion here? How exactly does it go beyond Euclid's \\"tame\\" result? It can hardly be \\"the critical link between circumference and circular area\\" (p. 90) since \\"the importance of this ratio had been recognized long before Archimedes\\" (p. 106). Nor can the answer be found in a link between \\"one-dimesional constants\\" (p. 90) such as that of circumference to diameter and \\"two-dimensional constants\\" (p. 90) having to do with areas, since Euclid's \\"tame\\" result provides precisely that. Archimedes' work on the circle is surely related to his work on the sphere (if only conceptually). The latter is discussed here at some length, though no indication of its relation, if any, to the former is provided. Since the canon in silent on this matter, so is Dunham, even though critical readers will all be asking this question."},{"Title":"Siege of Wonder","review":"Magic reappeared in the world, and now the Earth is divided into two empires, forever at war: a cold and rigid technocracy devoted to science, and the chaotic kingdoms of magic, filled with dragons and rocs and ruled over by an elite of wizards.

The information it will gather could end the war in a year's time.Geston's novel is the story of that agent; what he did, what happened after he planted his eye in a unicorn, what happened to the war.This work is not typical of Geston, or anyone else. The style is plain, but is more like Jorge Luis Borges than anyone else. The story is told in brief episodes, little flashes of light from the war. This story is not for everyone, being more interested in a love affair or the gleam of starlight on a zombie's armor than with the line of march or the order of battle.I read this book 25 years ago, and it has stayed with me.

The key is...You must exercise!!!!"},{"Title":"The Fat to Muscle Diet","review":"I purchased this book in March of 2002 and began my \\"diet\\" in April. I was obese to say the least. I have since lost a total of 60 pounds and overall 22 inches (13 from my hips and waist alone)I am sure that my personal motivation has had a lot to do with my success and I now have more energy than I have had in years. I am now able to wear a pair of jeans that I purchased my senior year of high school (I know... why would you save them?) which was 15 years and 2 children ago. I am absolutely NEVER hungry and actually crave drinking water now. (which I used to gag just at the thought of drinking) I have promoted this book to EVERYONE I know and even laugh about the fact that it was published so long ago, but still applies and is so useful.My additional motivation is that I have gone from a size 22W pants to a comfortable 12 and often a 10. I run /walk 3 - 6 miles each day with my son, something I would not have been able to do 6 months ago and this also gives us some special time together.I will say that this is obsessive, and my family hates to eat with me. Everytime we cook or eat together I do a lot of \\"do you know how much fat that has\\" or \\"I can't believe you ate sausages for breakfast!\\"If you are even thinking of buying this book ... DO IT...

However, during the holidays over the years, the weight crept back.Now my wife and I are both on this diet and in the first two weeks, I have lost:14 pounds2 inches in the hips3 inches in the waist1 1/2 inches across the breastMy wife keeps her weight secret, even after 14 years of marriage, but she has lost 4 inches in the waist, 3 inches in the hips, and 2 inches across the breasts, in our first two weeks. HINT: Buy a scale with a memory!I would say the diet still works. In addition, I don't feel any hunger pangs between meals.The exercise is important, but drinking 64 oz of water each day is more important, to wash out those fatty acids that accumulate from burning your stored up fat. DON'T WAIT until you are thirsty, start with water before the first cup of coffee.There is no mention of increasing your water intake after drinking caffeinated drinks, that in hot weather would leave you dehydrated. The typical rule is to drink 2 times the amount of water for each amount of caffienated diet soda. Apparently, the fluid intake and outgo with 64 ounces of any liquid is enough to flush the system.Our sample supper meal for one person:Fruit: 4 oz high pulp Orange juice1 Vege: 2 cups salad mix with 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar dressingProtein; 1 Vege; 2 starch & 1/2 dairy:2 yellow no fat tortillos1/2 can no fat refried beans1/2 can diced tomatoes with green chilliesgrated cheese on topHeated in microwave 2 1/2 minutes.

You get maximum flexibility with your daily menus or you can follow full menus in the book. They even have som pretty decent recipes.

I've just ordered a hardcover edition hoping it will last into my old age. If you're new to this book, keep in mind the fat comes off slowly - replaced by muscle. It's not an overnight diet - but a forever body change. Give yourself a couple of months to really see the difference. Also, you won't be hungry. The only thing I do differently from the book is to have two starches at lunch and one at dinner; this seems to work better for me. Also, I've found that water-packed tuna with BBQ sauce for flavor really sticks with you.

The recipes are pretty good too."},{"Title":"The Fat to Muscle Diet","review":"In 1987, when this book was first released, Dr. Peter Vash (one of the authors) came to Seattle to promote the book/diet. As part of his appearance on a morning TV show, \\"Good Company\\", he asked for them to find a viewer that would come on the show and try out the diet. Lucky me, I was the one chosen. On the \\"before\\" taping, I was in the audience and Dr. Vash talked with me and measured my hips (embarrassing) to get my percentage of body fat (about 32%). I then had eight weeks to follow the plan before returning for the \\"after\\" taping (then both before and after segments aired together). It took me about 8-10 days to really get focused to follow the plan exactly but the results were AMAZING! In about 6 1/2 weeks I lost 17 lbs but even better, my percentage of body fat dropped from 32% to 22%! My hips went from 41\\" to 36\\". I know that I lost mostly body fat because before I gained weight, I weighed about 130 and wore a size 11 jeans. After following the program, I once again weighed 130lbs but fit into a size 9.I recommend this book/plan as a healthy way to drop fat at a fairly consistent rate. Once you have mastered the basics, it's easy to adapt other food and recipes. The main thing to remember is during the initial phase (as Dr. Vash told me): if it's wrapped in cellophane - don't eat it; if it walks on four legs - don't eat it (although these days I imagine he would OK lean pork) and if it feels greasy - don't eat it."},{"Title":"The Fat to Muscle Diet","review":"I was on this diet for a year a few years ago. A friend and I walked for an hour a day for 5 - 7 days a week also. I stuck with this diet,which just became a way of life that I enjoyed. I lost 40 or more pounds, which brought me down to 126. My walking friend's husband passed away and we stopped walking. For the first few months I slowly began to eat what I wanted again but I had built so much muscle on this diet that it took a good 6 months or more to even begin to gain weight. Before I went on the diet I had sinus problems alot. When I ate right and exercised I never had sinus headaches, or any kind of headache. I was never sick with a cold or any other problem and I felt great! It's approved by every association out there; heart, diabetes, ect. It's the diet I go back to when I am serious about taking care of myself. I just started it the past couple weeks and plan to stick with it. It works and is healthy and provides what your body needs.

Prime time weekdays was reserved for Funimation, an importer of anime that managed to come up with the some of the coolest shows I've ever seen come out of Japan. One of them, and the one I miss most dearly these days, was Case Closed. So when I found the manga sitting at my local library, I was overjoyed and immediately dove in.Volume 1 gives us the story of Jimmy Kuda, high school super-detective, before he becomes Conan Edogawa. (Because the idea of a high-school super-detective just isn't enough weirdness for a manga, it seems.) We see him solve a few cases, meet some of the main characters, and get himself into the tangle that results in the creation of his alter ego, pint-sized primary-school sleuth Edogawa. Fast-paced and fun, a good start to the series. ***"},{"Title":"Case Closed, Vol. 1","review":"Jimmy Kudo tries his best to be like his idol Sherlock Holmes by helping the authorities solve baffling crimes even though he's just a junior at Teitan High School. His mind has been trained by reading an extensive library of detective novels, which include those written by his own father, who along with his mother, work in the United States, leaving Jimmy to fend for himself. He might have gotten involved in one case too many as he is knocked unconscious while witnessing a blackmail payoff. Instead of killing him outright for what he's seen, a mysterious man in black slips him an experimental untraceable poison and leaves Jimmy for dead. But instead of bringing about his death, the poison transforms his body into that of a 6-year-old boy! Of course noone believes that he is Jimmy Kudo, except Dr. Agasa, a mad scientist that happens to live next door. Agasa advises the boy to keep his identity secret because if the guys that poisoned him find out he is still alive, they'll just come after him. Better to let them think he's dead. Taking the name Conan Edogawa, Jimmy must keep his secret even from the girl that loves him, Rachel Moore, even as he moves in with her and her father, who is a sorry private detective. Conan will try to use the resources in Richard Moore's office to track down those who gave him the poison and hopefully get his body back to its normal size. Along the way, he will help Rachel and her dad solve cases while at the same time never revealing his real identity.Volume 1 of Case Closed is a promising read that is nothing if not entertaining. The art is more influenced by Disney than most manga I've read and gives you a feeling of anthropomorphized animals like Donald Duck or Goofy. While the art seems very kiddy-friendly there are some very unfriendly scenes in this book of graphic violence such as a man getting decapitated on a rollercoaster and bloody corpses. Actually, this ability to show some of the crime scenes is what makes it interesting to older readers. While Case Closed is no CSI, this book provided some entertaining mysteries even though it fumbles on its own passion to connect dots and make plot twists, which can be a failure in any mystery novel. The characters are cool, but I could have done without the needless identity secret giving Rachel an ulcer. Jimmy could have at least told HER if he told some crazy scientist so she wouldn't be worrying about him. A good start to the series."},{"Title":"Case Closed, Vol. 1","review":"Of course there is a lot of comedy and a lot of romance and back story but the part that I find really interesting are the cases.

Until he can find the men in black that shrunk him, he (taking on the alias of \\"Conan\\" since if the men find out his real idenity they will kill him and the ones around him,) solves these ridiculusly hard cases.

The show was great and the book is even better. The book is full of suspense. You can solve the case with Conan Edagawa (main character) and get confused. All while by his side. There is plenty of times where you solved the case until another suspect shows up or a new piece of evidence reveals itself. The book is also filled with action. Conan is always getting attacked when he gets close to cracking a case. This book also has an amazing story line and some of the most amazing plot twist I have ever read.You will fall in love with Conan as you find out how he solves the most unbelievable cases known to man. These cases range from child's play, to master mind, and finally to unsolvable. Even still Conan some how manages to solve everyone of them no matter how long it takes. Conan is like any other ordinary teenager. He has his share of girl problems, as well as friendproblems. The only difference is that he is incredibly smart for a 9 year old.

Such are the problems for Jimmy Kudo in the first volume of Gosho Aoyama's \\"Case Closed,\\" a solid little mystery manga with a healthy dollop of comic relief and romance -- the mysteries are a bit spotty, but promise to improve drastically.Jimmy Kudo is a detecting genius, to the point where the police call him in all the times and he gets fanmail from girls. But at a trip to the amusement park with his childhood friend Rachel, he has to solve a gruesome beheading on a rollercoaster. And when he later witnesses a blackmail payoff, he's knocked unconscious and force-fed a poison by a pair of mysterious men in black. And they're not as nice as Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith.When Jimmy wakes, he's horrified to realize that he's been shrunk into the body of a first-grader. His old friend, kooky scientist Dr. Agasa, says that he must keep his true identity a secret to keep the MIBs from returning -- and he should live with Rachel and her dad until he can find the mysterious men, nab a bit of the poison, and have Agasa make an antidote.But while Rachel's dad Richard is a detective, he's a pretty inept one. So Jimmy -- now using the name \\"Conan Edogawa\\" -- must solve the cases through hints, dropped clues, and some James-Bondian gadgets. The first is the case of a kidnapped little girl, which takes an unexpected twist when someone ELSE kidnaps her. And then Richard's favorite pop idol needs his help -- first she's being stalked, and then a man is found dead in her apartment.Most first volumes have some awkwardness, but Gosho Aoyama does a commendably smooth job in \\"Case Closed Volume 1.\\" He introduces the characters and the beginning of an overarcing plot -- in this case a sinister syndicate, a mystery poison, and some truly gruesome crimes. One particularly nasty moment has a decapitated man's body spewing blood on a rollercoaster... definitely not for kids.The main problem is that the first few mysteries solved (especially the one in the first few pages) are rather simplistic and easily solved. They also get a bit far-fetched at times... seriously, who dies like THAT? And for some inexplicable reason, they changed the original Japanese names to Westernized ones.However, the story itself is pretty solid -- Aoyama weaves together a unique dilemma, some murky bad guys and odd crime-solving methods (ventriloquism! Dog-riding!). He also gives it a hefty dose of humor (\\"I wanna go home with big sister!\\"), usually from the inept Richard. And there are some flickers of he-bugs-me-but-I-love-him romance between Rachael and Jimmy, which is somewhat hampered by his tiny prepubescent body.Jimmy is a pretty endearing character despite being a genius who is fully aware of that fact -- he's also kind, sharp-witted, and a massive detective geek who prattles endlessly about Sherlock Holmes. You really feel for him when he gets chased by cops through the rainy streets, after being turned into a seven-year-old. And while Rachael seems too grumpy at first, Aoyama soon fleshes her out into a butt-kicking yet sensitive heroine.\\"Case Closed Volume 1's\\" mysteries aren't yet truly baffling whodunnits, but Gosho Aoyama starts off his ultra-longrunning series pretty smoothly. An enjoyable start, and it only gets better."},{"Title":"Mr. Forgetful","review":"I have had this book since I was a child and I recently found it and read it to my 2 1/2 year old son. He loved it!

The Evidence Exposed is a collection of three stories; while I. Richard, the next collection out, is the same three stories (though with one drastically altered), plus two more, plus author introductions. The title story of The Evidence Exposed is also the lead story in I. Richard, but called simply, \\"Exposed.\\" The author is quite frank about the repetition, saying that she was so dissatisfied with The Evidence Exposed that she wrote it again, realizing that she had \\"killed the wrong person.\\" It is a story that did not work the first time, and does not work the second time, either. She should have left it alone -- in fact, forgotten it.The best story in this collection is,\\"Remember, I'll always love you.\\" It was the only one that was not predictable. Otherwise, it does seem hard on Elizabeth George's many fans that they should be tricked into buying two books that are almost identical. In effect, they are being asked to pay out again, in order to read a couple more yarns, plus a revision. In her defence, it must be recognized that inspiration does not always oblige, especially when an author has set such high standards for herself. It would be nice if her publishers would give her breathing space to regroup, and quietly devise another of her wonderful plots without being pressured by contractual or commercial obligations. I am sure her fans would understand and be patient."},{"Title":"The Evidence Exposed","review":"This book by Elizabeth George consists of three short stories. If you are expecting to find the detail and development in her novels, you should look elsewhere. When I bought the book, I was looking forward to a dense read and found instead stories that were thin on plot, development, and text. If you're a die-hard Lynley fan, you might enjoy the one story where he briefly appears. Otherwise, wait until her next novel is released."},{"Title":"The Evidence Exposed","review":"I'm a huge fan of Ms. George's work and I was puzzled by this short book of mystery stories. They seemed like something a person would write for an adult education language arts class - maybe they were, for something she was teaching? She joined her students in the exercise? I don't know the background. They seemed like skeletons of stories. Why release them, then? They didn't even serve as something a fan could use to tide her over until the next novel, because her usual characters don't appear (except for a cameo by Lynley and his wife in the first story). Please Ms. George, write another full length novel that features Barbara Havers heavily. It's what a lot of fans are waiting for."},{"Title":"The Evidence Exposed","review":"These are great. They are all different, all entertaining, all well written.The title story is perhaps the worst of the collection. The solution to the whole thing is a bit silly. the motive for the killing just not believeable...but up until then it is a stunning short story. There is a memorable cast of eccentric characters who are really well drawn and believeable, in true George style.The second story \\"I, Richard\\" is perhap a little long, but nonetheless it is an interesting character study on people's motives, also it is very good in that it provides some really interesting tidbits of historical english detail (which even I, as a person from england, did not fully know). The twist at the end is a surprise, and also quite amusing. The lead character in the story is not a likeable man, and he really gets some compuppeance!\\"The Surprise of His Life\\" the final story in this collection is also very good. They all are very good showcases on human weakness and what will drive people to murde.r this story to some extene deals with paranoia and obsession leading to a tragic death. the build up to the death is suspenseful and intriguing. Yet again, when we think everything is all going along smoothly, George pulls the wool over the reader's eyes once again with another nice sting in the tail.All in all, this collection has flaws (perhaps the middle story is a little long. the solution to the first story is not very believeable) which is why it gets four stars. But overall, the quality of these short stories is very good, and they are a nice little treat to tide you over until her next full-length novel."},{"Title":"The Evidence Exposed","review":"The three short stories in this volume contain all of the elements of George's novels; I was pleasantly surprised that the author displayed her talents so handily in these pieces, and have read each of them more than once.

The author has given no creedence to readers who havn't invested heavily in purely Nikon gear such as lenses and flash units. Descriptions of shooting scenarios are too concise and again apply specifically to all Nikon apparatus.I would have found it more useful if the author had concentrated his advice with information specifically on how to get best use out of the functions available on the camera body itself i.e. Aperature &amp; shutter priority modes when shooting in different conditions. I found the glossary of camera's which takes up a good 100/150 pages to the rear of the book a waste as all this information is copied direct from the user manual of the associated camera's as anyone with the camera's reviewed will know.All in all a very dissappointing read and one which I now never refer to."},{"Title":"The Nikon Field Guide: A Photographer's Portable Reference","review":"I reccomend it to all of my friends who never read the direction manuals"},{"Title":"The Nikon Field Guide: A Photographer's Portable Reference","review":"This book is very good, but slightly out of date.

Also some newer Nikon lenses like the 70-300mm 4-5.6 D zoom lenses are not included in the charts.

It includes quite a bit of information on techniques and some helpful tips."},{"Title":"The Nikon Field Guide: A Photographer's Portable Reference","review":"As an avid user of Nikon cameras and accessories, I very much appreciate what THE NIKON FIELD GUIDE offers: a comprehensive guide to using Nikon equipment to produce high quality photographs of a wide variety of subjects under varying conditions, along with reference sections devoted to the F5, F4, N90s, N70, FM2n, F100, and N60 cameras. Conspicuously absent from the camera sections, however, is the F3. That one of Nikon's most successful and recognizable professional system cameras of the past twenty years would be given short-shrift here is perplexing and disappointing, especially considering the fact that the F3 is still listed in Nikon's product guide. That's a minor criticism, however, and I would still recommend this book based on the wealth of generic information it provides."},{"Title":"The Nikon Field Guide: A Photographer's Portable Reference","review":"I just bought a NIKON F3hp camera, and together with the NIKON field guide I am ready to start learning the art of photography.

If you are thinking of buying this book, look at the sample pages (index) to ensure that it covers your camera!!!"},{"Title":"The Nikon Field Guide: A Photographer's Portable Reference","review":"This is a GREAT book for Nikon enthusiasts. There are several caveats that the reader should be aware of which, unfortunately, several of the previous reviewers were not. First and foremost, the back jacket of the book states clearly that CAMERA information is aimed at users of the F100 (one reviewer states it doesn't cover the F100 but this edition DOES cover it from page 232-251), N60/F60, F5, F6, N90s/F90X and FM2n models. Second, this 2nd edition was published in 2000 and though Mr. Hogan would love to update it with a 3rd edition, he doesn't own the rights and the publishing company that does own them has gone bankrupt, making the rights currently unavailable, which is why it is now out-of-print and probably won't be available other than on the used market so get one when you can!!!As for the reviewer who complains...\\"The author has given no creedence(sp) to readers who havn't(sp) invested heavily in purely Nikon gear such as lenses and flash units. Descriptions of shooting scenarios are too concise and again apply specifically to all Nikon apparatus.\\"the title of the book IS, after all, \\"THE NIKON FIELD GUIDE\\" so of course it applies \\"specifically\\" Nikon equipment.This book also extensively covers Nikon/Nikkor lenses, Nikon Speedlight models SB-25, -26, -27, -28 as well as basic flash/lighting techniques, general shooting tips, filters, outdoor and wildlife techniques and macro photography. Plus it contains exposure guides, short cuts and very useful photography-related equation charts such as the Sunny 16 rule, Exposure Value (EV), Hyperfocal distance, Depth of Field and more.As I stated above, this is THE book for Nikon enthusiasts as besides the detailed instructions for the cameras and flash units listed, it also contains a wealth of photography ideas and information. If you find a used copy of this book, BUY IT! It is well worth it!!!"},{"Title":"The Nikon Field Guide: A Photographer's Portable Reference","review":"Costa Rica 8-Feb-10Mr. Thom Hogan: thom_hogan@msn.comLet me begin by saying that I am an avid reader of your guide books and I would probably not be using a Nikon camera today if wasn't for you. Your books are well-written and contain sound, practical advices that are immensely appreciated.I have read the Nikon D300 To Go, and I have to say that it GOES with me everywhere..... from the tropics of Costa Rica (where I live) to the city streets of New York. It's a must read for anyone using the D300. I highly recommend your book and DVD to all photographers out there currently using the Nikon D300. Your professional and expert knowledge in handling specific issues related to the Nikon camera are extremely important given that the Nikon company has continually failed to do so through their own manual. Their manual that comes with the camera requires you to read information on dozens of separate and separated pages to follow one idea from beginning to end. They should be paying you!!! You have a gift for discussing typical Nikon problems and resolving them in clear constructive ways. I look forward to reading your next informative work.

HiltonCody Gunner knows just one thing. Since his dad is a professional football player, he wants nothing to do with the sport. Angry at his father for walking out and leaving his mother and his handicapped little brother, Cody decides to go out for the one sport that will allow him to work out his anger. Bull riding. Cody possesses a natural talent and soon becomes a top ranking bull rider.Ali Daniels has loved horses as long as she can remember. She makes the most of every moment and risks her life for her passion. Now she is the top barrel racer in the country. But she has never taken the time to make friends and no one knows her terrible secret.Competing is all Cody and Ali need until the day Cody accidentally discovers Ali's secret. The two become friends, of sorts; even through her parents want her to have nothing to do with Cody Gunner. Will Ali and Cody ever be able to become more than friends? Or will Ali's secret destroy any chance of that happening?I felt at first that A THOUSAND TOMORROWS is more telling than showing, but nevertheless I had no problem getting into the story and it held my interest until the end. I sympathized with Cody and felt his anger when his father walked out and also identified with Ali. Both characters are realistic.A THOUSAND TOMORROWS is heart tugging. Readers will need a box of tissue close by. Although Karen Kingsbury usually writes inspirational novels, this one is from a new line focusing on wholesome fiction without an overt religious slant. A THOUSAND TOMORROWS is a very good read. $18.95 hard cover. 241 pages."},{"Title":"A Thousand Tomorrows (Cody Gunner Series #1)","review":"The was the first book I read by Karen Kingsbury and I am so glad I picked it up. It was fantastic. The characters completely draw you in until the tearful end. Have tissues ready."},{"Title":"A Thousand Tomorrows (Cody Gunner Series #1)","review":"Nice easy read. A lot like \\"A Walk to Remember\\" in many ways, bad boy turned good. It kept my interest and it is a sweet story. I had no knowledge of Bull riding or barrel racing and I found that fascinating.

Not once. I was so disappointed in the lack of faith and trust in God.Karen has written yet another gut-wrenching, tear-jerker of a story but the spiritual aspect was dismal.I sincerely hope that she quickly abandons this format and returns to her previous way of writing. One that actually contains scripture texts and prayer by the characters instead of angry bitterness and acceptance of circumstances that don't seem to have anything to do with God's grace.Not her best effort."},{"Title":"A Thousand Tomorrows (Cody Gunner Series #1)","review":"Karen Kingsbury has long been one of my favorite authors, but this book let me down. I found it exceedingly hard to believe that a thirteen year old boy, with absolutely no roughstock experience, climbed onto a bull and rode for eight seconds. I've seen bullriding--more importantly, I've seen bullriders who have never been on bulls before ride for the first time. NONE of them stayed on.And then Ali--a girl with a fatal lung disease that holds her breath for the better part of twenty seconds? Even if her lungs were in top physical condition, it would be difficult at best, considering the fact that unless she's just hanging on and letting the horse do all the work, she's putting her body under stress and wouldn't be able to hold her breath for quite that long.Ali seemed to have faith in God, but I never saw it in Cody. I wanted to like both of them, but I had a really hard time believing them. I don't know, maybe I'm wrong, but this book fell flat for me."},{"Title":"A Thousand Tomorrows (Cody Gunner Series #1)","review":"I didn't expect this to be a Christian book, but was pleased with the fact that Christian convictions and themes were still present. The reader gets to share the joy of pure love with Cody and watch his transformation to a faithful, devoted man, from a reckless, partying lecher. While his hatred for his parents is a bit over-the-top, I know people who really feel that way about their parents. This story reminded me a lot of A Walk to Remember, and in some ways Karen is to me like a female Nicholas Sparks in her writing of this novel. I loved it when Cody started connecting with another loner like himself, who was fighting her own private battle. He becomes a faithful friend and no longer desires another woman. It would seem filthy to him after meeting a woman so pure of heart. I liked how they gradually got to know each other before they kissed and his restrained passion when they finally did. I loved how she wanted to live her life to the fullest, but how she also regretting ending her life early by exposing herself to the very things that would make her sicker dander and dust. The purity of Cody's love for her was truly inspiring. The marriage proposal was beautiful. The transformation of his heart was miraculous even without blatant references to God. I did enjoy experiencing her passing with him loving her to the end. It was sad, but inspiring and beautiful at the same time. His grief seemed genuine and real to me. I couldn't help loving Ali as well, because she received his love and sacrifice with a tender resignation after refusing to let him help her for so long. This may have been predictable plot-wise as stated by other reviewers, but come on...it's a romance. Of course the hero and heroine were going to end up together. The author also portrayed the brother with Down Syndrome very well, and after reading about Ali's struggle, I can't think of a more horrible way to die than fighting for every breath for weeks and essentially suffocating to death. Overall, this book was worth my while and I felt truly inspired to appreciate every day I have even more. And as far as God being in the book? God is love and this novel was full of pure, devoted love, so I saw God on every page once their relationship began. But it would have been better to portray heaven more biblically because it's misleading to make it look like she went there just because she suffered and was a good person."},{"Title":"A Thousand Tomorrows (Cody Gunner Series #1)","review":"once again I can't say enough about her books, God has truly blessed her with a very special gift.

Too busy to even think about love, Cody Gunner and Ali Daniels were focused on the prize, a national championship. Cody was concentrating on bull riding and Ali was concentrating on barrel racing. Both have pasts that give them the drive to ride. Both different, both tragic and both life changing. They are the only two in the whole tour who don't ride for the fame; they ride because they have to. Cody rides because of his father and Ali rides because of her sister, Ana. When Ali starts notice Cody she begins to fall for him, but finds out that it might not work due to what he has been through. She talks herself out of it because she doesn't want any distractions, and is determined to make the best of the few years of riding she has left. This wasn't ok with Cody and he tries to make their relationship work. But by pushing too hard, Cody could hurt the person he has ever loved, Ali. As the two rodeo stars struggled to stay at the top of their game, they find out that life is too short for regrets.Anyone who wants a fast and furious read should consider A Thousand Tomorrows. It will keep you wanting more and will reveal questions you never would have asked yourself. This exciting love story addresses anyone with a passion for adventure and a little romance. Girls especially, will be kept interested by the \\"head over heels\\" type of love that the two stars share. This book will inspires many to follow their gut and go for what feels right. It also has some mystery and suspense that keeps the reader interested. The individual tragedies that Cody and Ali over come will motivate readers to achieve anything that seems impossible. I suggest A Thousand Tomorrows because it's an uplifting, mysterious and passionate story of two stubborn people with the same goal in life, success.I was on the edge of my seat the entire time and I couldn't wait to get further into the book. I would strongly suggest reading this story because of the way it takes you to that \\"different place\\". It lets the reader's imagination run wild, makes you think about the unthinkable and answers questions I never thought could be answered.

Cody detests his former NFL great father who he worshiped until dad walked out on his family once he concluded that his youngest son was defective. He loathes his mother for allowing her hurt caused by her spouse's abandonment to interfere with raising her two children especially the handicapped Carl who needed more from her. When he was eight and dad left, Cody vowed no one will ever get close to him again.Though horse riding champion Ali Daniels must hold her breath for the eighteen or so seconds she competes, she refuses to quit although she knows the dust and related ilk is cutting into her life span, which already is shortened by cystic fibrosis. Still she refuses to quit, riding with passion dedicated to her deceased younger sister. Because of her illness, she has no plans for a lasting relationship.When Ali and Cody meet and reluctantly share their inner demons they fall in love. Although both want to flee from the previously unwanted emotions, they embrace their feelings, providing one another with healing solace while understanding that they probably will not share A THOUSAND TOMORROWS together.This is a fine inspirational romance starring two interesting individuals who choose love although they know how limited their mortal time together will be. The story line grips the audience from the start and never lets up until the final soliloquy. The plot especially the ending is obvious because of the realistic portrayal of CF; fans who appreciate an uplifting somewhat melancholy tale will appreciate Karen Kingsbury character driven inspirational.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"A Thousand Tomorrows (Cody Gunner Series #1)","review":"ok,so this is a christian book.i found it boring and full of trite phrases.karen kingsbury is a great author for a limited audience."},{"Title":"A Thousand Tomorrows (Cody Gunner Series #1)","review":"While I generally love Karen Kingsbury's books, and believe she is one of the most gifted writers of today, it seems her books are becoming too sad and leave me feeling down instead of uplifted.

This was such a beautiful love story. You have Cody, whose father abandoned him because of his Down's Syndrome brother. He becomes a bull rider and is into fast living until he meets Ali. Ali's sister died at an early age, some Ali lives out her sister's dream of being a horse rider. The problem is that she is battling cystic fibrosis.The love story between Ali and Cody is beautiful. It is so obvious how much they love each other. Through Ali, Cody learns to love and he eventually forgives his father for abandoning his family.The book is short, yet, there is so much depth to the storyline and characters. And Kingsbury has obviously done a lot of research on cystic fibrosis and how terrible the disease is.Yes, the book doesn't make Scripture references like in her other books, but you can demonstrate Christian concepts without always quoting verses. This book seemed to reach out to all audiences, Christian and secular, without all the smut.I highly recommend this book. It is a real tear jerker."},{"Title":"A Thousand Tomorrows (Cody Gunner Series #1)","review":"This novel is predictable for the most part, but still a warm and emotionally satisfying read, if you are looking for a tragic love story. The characters are well written and it is easy to Identify with Cody's bitterness and anger driving him to reckless behavior, as well as Ali's desperate desire to experience life before she must die. I really appreciated the way that Ms. Kingsbury used the story as a backdrop for Cystic Fibrosis. While the life expectancy of those who suffer with it has increased greatly, it is still far too short. Following Ali's determined fight to do more than simply survive with CF drew me in and made me smile and shed a few tears as well. While this particular book does not speak overtly of Christianity, nevertheless, the characters experience forgiveness, love and redemption. As it is a book aimed at a non Christian audience, I feel it does a good job of painting a picture of 1 Corinthians 13 without actually quoting chapters and verses.Far Country"},{"Title":"A Thousand Tomorrows (Cody Gunner Series #1)","review":"A Thousand Tomorrows by Karen KingsburyAt 8 years old Cody watched his father leave stating he couldn't do it anymore.

I must also say that I don't remember if she handles his anger differently in the 2nd book. She could have expounded on his forgiveness toward his father.

The heart she puts in the development of her characters has always touched me and I don't believe I've ever read one of her books without shedding some tears. \\"A Thousand Tomorrows\\" certainly was no different. However what I did notice was different about this novel was the abscence of reference to scripture. In previous books scripture tended to be threaded througout the entire book. This just wasn't the case in this novel. Again, I certainly still enjoyed the book a great deal and read it in one sitting because as usual, Karen's characters drew me in and gripped my heart. There just seem to be a change in this book from her previous books. With that said, I learned that Karen's books don't have to meantion specific scripture to teach us all lessons about the love of God. Incredible author."},{"Title":"A Thousand Tomorrows (Cody Gunner Series #1)","review":"A Thousand Tomorrows is and inspirational book about how to live your life to the fullest. In this book Cody Gunner goes through life missing someone special to him. The reason why this person left causes Cody a lot of anger that he expresses through bull riding. He doesn't care that he might die doing this; all he cares about is the eight seconds that he is on the bull. This is only way to let out his anger but this is a secret that he keeps to himself. Ali Daniels is on the Pro Rodeo Circuit, too, and she has a secret she keeps from the rest of the riders. This until she meets Cody. Ali learns that she can learn to trust Cody and with the trust they give each other they fall in love. When a tragedy happens, they both have to live life together fully because the time they have may be short. Anyway this is an amazing book, and the ending is so sweet that you may end up crying.Karen Kingsbury is an inspirational author who knows how to write a good book that you take it to heart. She is an amazing Christan author. In A Thousand Tomorrows she portrays two people's lives in which all they can do is live life to the fullest or they are cheating themselves of the time they have. This is an amazing book that all you can do is love."},{"Title":"A Thousand Tomorrows (Cody Gunner Series #1)","review":"This novel, like all of Karen Kingsbury's novels, was great. You identified with her fcharacters, you learned lessons, and you grew from reading this book.A Note to anyone reading this novel: This is NOT a Christian Fiction novel, like you have come to expect from karen kingsbury. this is by her own admission, a secular nove, written for a secular audience, but clean enough so her Christian readers would feel comfortable. That had (in my estimation) been achieved. This is a novel I would use to give to someone who was interested reading Christian fiction, but didn't know where to start, or didn't want to go BOOM right into the \\"preachy-teachy\\" as some people think books end up like in this genre.I unlike some people who have mentioned this, appreciate the realism in Kingsbury's stories. Life does not have a happily ever ending to it, instead she makes her endings as I like to call Happily After All. Yes, there is sadness and sorrow and death, but usually (as there is a sequel or a series to nearly all of her works), things work out in the end. Maybe not in a happy, rah rah yay! kind of way, but in a spiritual, uprising way.Why the 4 Stars? Too short for my taste and read way too fast.http://christianlit.proboards27.com/index.cgi : Christian Lit Reviews"},{"Title":"A Thousand Tomorrows (Cody Gunner Series #1)","review":"A beautiful story, but I'm disappointed in it. I had come to trust Karen Kingsbury's characters as being of strong Christian convictions, but this book gives me no reason to even believe the characters are Christian at all. It is a beautiful tale of loving and giving, but there is no scripture, no exhibition of faith short of a brief mention of prayer, nothing to draw one closer to God in the writing of the book. I don't believe that every book one reads has to be loaded with Godly talk from start to finish, but when it is being sold as a Christian book by a known Christian writer, I believe a person has a right to expect strong Christian characters in the story and writing that will help strengthen the walk of the Christian reader. Nothing in the book was offensive, but it just didn't have the depth I've come to appreciate in Kingsbury's other works. I wish I'd have read it before buying it."},{"Title":"A Thousand Tomorrows (Cody Gunner Series #1)","review":"What motivates people to greatness? Often it is anger, sometimes it is determination to defy the odds. In this heartwarming tale of love and struggle, both of these emotions are displayed in the lives of Cody Gunner and Ali Daniels.Acclaimed Christian novelist, Karen Kingsbury shares insights into the world of rodeo, barrel racing and bull-riding, an environemnt that many of us are not familiar with and yet the reader finds himself becoming more interested this distant sport.Cody is the bitter son of an NFL great. His Dad left at an early age and Cody never forgave him or his mother. Ali is surrounded by loving parents, but she battles a fatal disease, Cystic Fibrosis.For Cody, his anger fuels his passion to ride. For Ali, her determination to live a life of purpose fuels her. In the midst of their individual quests, their paths cross and hearts once closed to love are now open. Even as they face Ali's impending death.It is clear that Karen wrote this book to be a bestseller and a Hallmark movie. It has all the right elements. And yet the reader's interest is kept because we're taken inside the unknown world of rodeo and the mysterious and yet incurable disease called Cystic Fibrosis.I came away with a greater appreciation for both, especiall those who struggle with CF. I had heard of the disease, but I did not really know what it was. Karen Kingsbury carefully educates the reader on the struggles, the medical treatments, the long-term prognosis, and everday life for those afflicted with this disease. If anything the beautiful storytelling and the delicated dialogue draw into the world of CF like never before. I personally came away with much greater compassion for the parents of CF-afflicted children. God bless them.This is an inspirational book, a family-time story, a heartwarming tale of hope, love, and forgiveness. You're entire family will enjoy it."},{"Title":"A Thousand Tomorrows (Cody Gunner Series #1)","review":"Karen Kingsbury, that is all you need to say, those who read her know she is the MOST AMAZING AUTHOR.

Just when you think she has dealt with most of the controversial issues of life she finds two more to deal with in a way that can't help but touch every reader. Three years can sound a lot longer and a lot more hopeful when you think of it as \\"A Thousand Tomorrows\\". This book's main emphasis is the Downs Syndrome issue as seen because of Cody's brother introduced in \\"Beyond the Clouds\\". The other issue was probably addressed more in the earlier book but continues with some follow up in this the second of this series. I could have read \\"A Thousand Tomorrows\\" as a stand alone book, but was glad that I had found and read \\"Beyond the Clouds\\" first as it made the whole story much richer.

Also presented is commentary inserted in-between Hughes reading of his poems. You get the background of how a certain poem came into being. You get Hughes talking about his childhood and racial pride. You get Hughes voice, soft, sort of high pitched, and inviting. MY LORD, MERRY-GO-ROUND, THE NEGRO SPEAKS OF RIVERS, JUDGEMENT DAY, MY PEOPLE, WHEN SUE WEARS RED, and FIRE are a few of the poems recited on this cd by Hughes. For those able to do so, I recommend purchasing the audio tape, LANGSTON HUGHES READS HIS POETRY, because this cd truncates some of Hughes commentary and poems.It does a disservice to Hughes to dismiss much of his body of work as \\"wry\\" to make a particular audience more comfortable with it. It does a similar disservice to Hughes' integrity to ignore that both his parents were black and play up distant white blood to make him more palatable, so-called universal, to the larger audiencences prejudices (most of black America share his same distant bloodlines). One of Hughes's biographers said you cannot respect Hughes without respecting black American people and their culture in the U.S. To disrespect one is to do so to both. Hughes's black pride permeates his so-called race poems and poems of social protest from the 30s and the vast majority of his work in general.Langston Hughes showed his anger and bitterness toward the injustices of racism as he sharecropped his way among many different genres of the arts as a proud and unflinching black American. His genius, and lesson, was that he did not allow this bitternerss and anger to cause him to hate or infuse his body of work with hate. He may not have liked some in gerneral, but he \\"never, never\\" hated. Hughes had to much humanity in him to reward hate with hate. Even in his anger, Hughes could be benevolent. Hughes did not hesitate to like anyone who showed respect and gestures of friendship to him and his people. His lesson to black artists was be proud of their heritage in their work and not run away from it for a quick profit and fame in catering to the prejudices of the larger community beyond that of black America. His lesson was also that they should not beconsumed with anger and bitterness even though they had a right to be angry because through their words a world could be enlightened and made better.Here in THE VOICE OF THE POET: LANGSTON HUGHES, as other works by Hughes, a man is revealed who was often angry and bitter, but who never lost sight that there was some good in the world worth fightiing for. This makes him a writer to be universally admired by everyone regardless of race, religion, and whatever."},{"Title":"Langston Hughes (Voice of the Poet)","review":"I am an author and a poet. Langston Hughes' style of poetry is simply amazing. This CD gives a historical rendition on the era of his childhood, school years, work experiences and poetic growth. His world travels certainly expanded his vision of life and impacted positively on his writings. The enlightenment of his trip to Africa resulted in the poem \\"My People.\\" This poem has a fascinating view of Africa, the people, and Hughes' connection with them. His articulation of the poem \\"Mother to Son\\" is amazing. He shows another side of life and how one's vision influences the rearing of a child. One of the greatest poems on the CD is \\"The Negro Speaks of Rivers.\\" This was written while taking a trip to Mexico to visit his father. In this piece he gives a visionary perspective and uses the art of personification to make the connection of his people, history, and life from a historical standpoint. The poem \\"Words Like Freedom' and \\"Tomorrow\\" will touch the heart of the reader. The stories on the CD are awesome. The reflection he gives of life during his younger years certainly is a distinctive comparison from then to now, especially highlighting how individuals were treated based on the color of their skin. This CD is a must have for one's poetry library. This is not just a CD of poetry it is also a CD of history. Also check \\"Trilogy Moments for the Mind, Body and Soul\\" with the new selection of Epulaeryu poems."},{"Title":"Langston Hughes (Voice of the Poet)","review":"This is a terrific addition to the Voice of the Poet series. Langston Hughes doesn't just read his poems; he talks about their genesis and about his life. For all the ugliness of Jim Crow, he never sounds bitter, but he tells the whole truth, doesn't sugarcoat anything. My one tiny disappointment is that in the book the format was changed on a couple of poems due to space constraints. This CD is worth it just for his story of how he became a poet. I listen to lots of audio poetry and this is one of the best collections I've ever found. You can't miss."},{"Title":"Langston Hughes (Voice of the Poet)","review":"The Voice of The Poet Series continues to deliver with the Langston Hughes collection which is engrossing and incredible.This is a CD and Book package that spans the entire career of Langston Hughes's work that was recorded on tape in different settings throughout the years. The book is small, clean and well-presented making it easy for the reader to follow along with the disc.Langston not only delivers some very straight-forward readings of his work, but does a fair bit of story-telling and warmly lapses into casual conversation in several spots. There is a lot of biographical information in between the poetry which is worth the cost of the set alone. I found this set warm and engaging from beginning to end and wished that there was more.After looking around on the Internet, I've come to discover that these recordings have been repackaged on compact disc before but without the book and without some of the biographical musings, however, this is the set to buy without any doubt. The recordings are clear, crisp and without static, interference or fading, unlike some of the other products.If you've never heard Langston Hughes's voice before, get this. If you've never heard him read aloud his poetry and tell parts of his life story, get this. If you've gotten any of the other offerings from 'The Voice of The Poet' series ... get this.... ..."},{"Title":"Langston Hughes (Voice of the Poet)","review":"HUGHES HAS BEEN RECORDED? That was my first reaction when I went to the library and found this CD. The pleasure I got listening to Langston Hughes reading his work in a relaxed non rehearsed atmosphere was one of the most thrilling experiences I'd had the pleasure of experiencing in months. I can't wait to share this with my family and discuss the contents. Any one who enjoys poetry, social commentary and history will enjoy this CD."},{"Title":"Richard Billingham: Ray's a Laugh","review":"When I first looked at this book, I wrote it off as odd, but stupid...snapshots some guy took of his family. So what? We all have photos like this. But this book contains some of the most disturbing photos I have seen in a while, and I've seen a lot that are considered to be disturbing... they are also brillant.Billingham's photos completely avoid the current trends in contemporary photography (large format, brilliant prints) to offer an honest look at life today. And that life is odd. His prints appear to follow in the tradition of Eggleston's and Friedlander's in that they are of &quot;nothing important&quot;, while adding that taste of the raw, the real, which is found in (Larry) Clark's photos. I would probably say his work is closest to Nan Goldin's, but undercut with a calm bitterness or a bitter calm.This book makes you think a lot about what &quot;art photography&quot; is. It does not use fancy technology or obviously subject matter to push the boundaries of the medium. Definitely a book for the connisseur who wants to reflect on the nature of photography today."},{"Title":"Richard Billingham: Ray's a Laugh","review":"I am an avid fan of Billingham and 'Ray's a laugh' really is remarkable. Powerful with a gift for storytelling that reminds me of Nick Waplington (see Living Room & The Wedding), but Billingham here is much more intimate. The courage to put your family on public view, is breathtaking.So Why do Scala try to mess it all up, with really poor layouts. Some really strong images lose their stock as they disappear into the book gutters, and the compositions of many of the pages and their counter pages are just plain wrong.A brilliant book marred by bad design. We are indeed fortunate that the images really are strong enough to breakthrough."},{"Title":"Richard Billingham: Ray's a Laugh","review":"A terrific book by Scalo/Billingham. The images of his family are unforgettable, and Billingham is one of those rare souls that comes through from the 'underclass' every decade to fly high. Apparently he took these originally as painting studies, (suffering like many from the naive delusion that a painting is 'real art', photography is lesser) but the intimacy and tragedy of it all burns through. I find the book design good, though I don't care for the cover myself.It seems a personal exorcism of sorts - Billingham coming to terms with who/what/where he came from. Did he really know what he was doing? Probably not, but that doesn't matter. The work owes quite a bit to that school of British Color Documentary Photography from the 1980's-90's, started by Paul Graham (Beyond Caring, A1) and Martin Parr (New Brighton) etc. Though whether Billingham appreciated the legacy, is questionable.Since then his work has fizzled and got much less interesting. Galleries and museums now publish books of his random images from around the world, or catalogs with video stills, none of which is even close to this work. But who cares? We have Ray's a Laugh, and its right up there as a great photo book."},{"Title":"Festering Lilies (Ulverscroft Large Print Series)","review":"The Willow King mysteries of Natasha Cooper are of an old style that had been modernized. There is little explicit violence; all sex is tasteful, but the plots and characterization is modern. I was reminded somewhat of P.D. James.Willow King leads a double life -- bureaucrat in a fictional British government bureau -- Department of Old Age Pensions and as a writer of romance novels. This twist of personalities helps to make the story interesting.The characterizations and the evoking of a keen sense of place were highlights for me. The actual plot, though interesting, is not particularly unusual, although there was a very interesting twist in the end that I should have seen coming, but didn't."},{"Title":"The new! improved! Bob & Ray book","review":"Here are Bob and Ray on tape again, late in their career but still the funniest duo on, and off, radio. Here they're reading (with sound effects) from their book - which is more like a collection of radio scripts; it's a good introduction to their work, and longtime listeners will find their material as fresh and funny as always. And while some hardcore fans may miss the unique \\"live radio\\" quality that Bob and Ray had, they're every bit as funny as in any of their earlier work. The running gag about walnut pickers is reason enough to buy this, as is the grammar lesson. It's also fun to read along while listening to the tape, so get the book as well. Bob and Ray are a reminder that enduring comedy needn't be offensive."},{"Title":"The new! improved! Bob & Ray book","review":"A work of off-kilter genius from Bob and Ray, surreal comedy pioneers. From &quot;small village endocrinologist Engelbretzen&quot; to the seedy soap opera Garish Summit, it's one loopy deadpan laugh riot. The cheesy, mock-melodramatic music adds to the fun. Hilarious running gags, idiotic talk show guests, crackpot pseudo-experts, bizarre mini-dramas, pathetic losers we can simultaneously sympathize with and deride--the &quot;New! Improved! Bob and Ray Book&quot; is first-class lunacy.How often do you find humor so insanely funny that you can't resist smirking and chuckling in public places as you remember your favorite lines? This is that funny. A great gift idea for anybody who likes warped humor that's both sophisticated and moronic at the same time."},{"Title":"The new! improved! Bob & Ray book","review":"In a broadcast studio, a man in the audience introduces himself as \\"one of the very few people in America with a name that is completely unpronounceable\\", spelled W-W-Q-L-C-W. \\"I'd like to say hello to my brother on your program, but I don't know how to pronounce his name, either.\\"Consumer affairs expert Hoyt Netley recommends a child's tricycle from Denmark on account of its rounded edges, plus the gunpowder-fueled rocket engine that eliminates the need for dangerous pedals. \\"The child just lights a fuse when he's ready to ride.\\"Bob and Ray. How I miss those guys. This 1985 collection of sketches was their last published work before Ray's death in 1990, and catches them just about wrapping up their comedy career. Even though it is a half-step below their earlier two books in terms of consistent excellence, there's enough good moments in here to sustain many of today's comics over an entire career.There's another episode of \\"Tippy The Wonder Dog\\" and a new visit to \\"The Hobby Hut\\", where host Neil Clummer meets a man who collects numbers held by people who wait in line. Two doctors exchange rote platitudes about patient confidentiality until they repeat each other's lines.The accent on newer material is a drawback. By 1985, Bob & Ray were reworking old concepts rather than trotting out new ones with the boldness they displayed in the 1960s and 1970s. As sharp and witty as they were, there was also a structural element to Bob & Ray's best comedy, Monty Pythonish logic-stretching, which simply doesn't come off as well in a series of sketches of a man being interviewed, which is what you have here.The newer ideas they did use, like the soap opera \\"Garish Summit\\" (a couple of episodes from which appear here) annoyed some older fans who remembered the goofier antics of \\"Mary Backstayge, Noble Wife\\". \\"Garish Summit\\" was funny, though, and so is regular sports announcer Biff Burns' interview with champion low-jumper Big Steve Wurbler, who explains why standing atop a cliff and jumping should be an Olympic sport.\\"In high jumping, you can strain a muscle or hurt yourself on the way up,\\" Big Steve explains. \\"But in low jumping, you only have to worry about what happens to you on the way down.\\"One thing \\"New! Improved!\\" has over the earlier B&R; collections is the audio version that came out the following year, which shows the two men in fine form giving even the weaker material in this collection a fresh life. Bob & Ray had a habit of surprising you just when you thought you had them figured out; their like won't be seen again for a long while."},{"Title":"The new! improved! Bob & Ray book","review":"Approach this small book as a collection of comedy routines written for a Bob and Ray broadcast; while reading it, longtime fans will probably hear in their minds the duo's voices and inflections. And this book is even more fun when reading along with the recording of Bob and Ray themselves reading the routines. But whatever the circumstances, this is a good, and funny, introduction to Bob and Ray's work. And knowing that this was one of their last works together makes one realize how remarkable their comedy was."},{"Title":"The new! improved! Bob & Ray book","review":"If you consider yourself a fan of comedy or improv, you'll love Bob & Ray. They were original pioneers of radio comedy and their dry humor, delivered in deadpan, inspired many, many imitators which continues into present day. Comedians and actors such as Leslie Nielsen, Johnny Carson, Bill Murray, Steven Wright, the casts of SNL, etc. have all paid homage to Bob & Ray at one time or another. Chris Elliot, Bob's son, is still doing a quasi Bob & Ray improv in his acts, such as his early days on NBC and on David Letterman's show.Inside this book is a collection of their sketches written in the form of a script, as if the editor had intended for the readers to broadcast their own radio show (but more likely to follow the gist of the humor and punchlines). This book isn't about Bob & Ray so much, or their show. This book is a small collection of their immortal radio banter.Some of their material may seem a little dated to the individual, given our electronic media-saturated contemporary times, but all of their works are timeless. You don't have to consider yourself a fan or Old Time Radio to enjoy Bob & Ray.Starting out in a Boston radio station just after the end of WWII, Bob & Ray were doing their thing on radio decades before anybody ever heard of \\"intelligent comedy\\" from the likes of Larry David or Jerry Seinfeld. Bob & Ray were eventually syndicated nationwide. Bob is still with us in 2011, but both of them have acquired cult status among old and new fans alike!So, if you want a window into the old Bob & Ray show, buy this book. If you want a more detailed, tell-all book, this isn't it but it's good reading, all the same!"},{"Title":"Conquering Bad Dreams & Nightmares : A Guide to Understanding, Interpretation & Cure","review":"I spent my entire life having nightmares routinely.

Understanding nightmares is a critical first step to their resolution, and the authors provide very adequate material for this purpose.A bonus for interested readers who do not suffer from bad dreams or nightmares is their advice on how to handle these dreams for their children.

Snowden examined the ancient Mediterranean world--a highly pluralistic, interracial world--to learn how significant the concept of race was at that time. His compelling and creative use of human representations in art, and of the stories that ancient people told about eachother show that race--while seemingly all-important today--was insignificant to them. He identifies (among others) Egyptian, Greek, Hellenistic, and Roman art in which &quot;black&quot; and &quot;white&quot; people stand side-by-side as soldiers, military officers, political rulers, spouses, athletes, guests at feasts, mythic figures, etc. While ancients recognized the physical differences which we use as racial identifiers, they did not seem to draw the same invidious distinctions or make the same social uses of race which Europeans around the world have made over the past 500 years. I regularly refer to his findings in 2-3 of my college courses to raise questions about the naturalness and inevitability of our current racial assumptions. The many photographs included in the text make it even more valuable, by allowing us to draw our own conclusions from his graphic evidence. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Before Color Prejudice: The Ancient View of Blacks","review":"Let's get it straight. Dr. Frank Snowden knows what he is talking about.Snowden offers solid evidence from antiquity that does show &quot;racism&quot; based on skin color was in fact not a major issue of ancient times. While it is true that slavery did exist from antiquity, it was based on conquest, and not skin color or race from a biological superiority/inferiority perspective.Dr. Snowden is not writing a piece of revisionist history or unsupported political Afro-centrism, he is presenting findings of honest and credible research.This is an excellent book that any intelligent person who has serious questions about race and racism in history should read.One possible conclusion you may arrive at is that racism is evidently a much more recent social (and possibly even theological) construction in history and definitely not one that originated in antiquity.I highly recommend &quot;Before Color Prejudice&quot;."},{"Title":"Before Color Prejudice: The Ancient View of Blacks","review":"This book investigates the relationships of blacks and whites in the Mediterranean world before color prejudice. Much of the Snowden's book focuses on the relationship between Ethiopia and Egypt. Ethiopians and Egyptians did not always get along, indeed wars were fought between the two, but their struggles were not based on racial differences. Snowden claims that the skin color of northeast Africans gradually lightened as one moved down the Nile.Perhaps the most interesting aspect of Snowden's brief book was his description of Nubian culture. Snowden presents a vibrant society with its own distinct civilization that affected the Egyptians as much as the Egyptians affected it. Indeed, Snowden indicates that the civilization south of the first cataract was politically stable in comparison to the turmoils that faced other areas in the Mediterranean.The main idea of the book is that whites and blacks got along in the Greco-roman world. Of course the Greeks and other \\"white\\" peoples were interested in the \\"black\\" peoples and their customs, but the racial difference did not cause the whites to look down on the blacks. Snowden discusses the many ways in which blacks and whites worked together, especially in fighting along side each other. He also claims that mixed marriages were common, even in Greece, and that mulattoes did not hold an inferior social place.

It tells of a time that I, and am sure many others, are unaware of. Centering mainly around the centuries before and after Christ it shows that racism was not an inherited trait of whites but something that evolved over time. It describes the ageless meaning behind racism and how it is a way for one to hold one group of people down in order to uplift you and whatever group you belong to. This book does not paint the broad brush of generalizing all whites as prejudice, but that a substantial number of whites became prejudice over time so that such things as: black slavery lasting over 500 years while no other ethnic group was so wholley enslaved. Or how the world had designated at one time that regardless of where the black man was at he was a slave until proven otherwise.

Franklin, is a heart filled story about a boy named Perry Dubois. I liked this book because you can see and feel how Perry grows into a new person after tragedy. A lot of the feelings that Perry has, relate to the feelings people occasionally have. That is important. He thought that he would be just fine on his own. He didn't need other people. He wasn't lonely. After his little sister died, and his mom left his dad and him, he could be alone forever. This all changed after he met Willow.This book is similar to my life, because Perry Dubois can only be friends with a girl, because no other boys live around him. When I was little, before very many kids moved into my neighborhood, the only person I had to play with was a boy. No girls lived around me, although it changed after a few years.This is when Perry tells his father that he is going looking for a wolf with a girl. \\"Well, one of those girls, Willow, saw a wolf up on the big granite slab. She drew a picture of it. She has a big family and her mom's an artist. I think her dad is too. We're going looking for wolf foot-prints and stuff like that. (Franklin, 78)The title of this book, Lone Wolf, means exactly what the book is about. Perry Dubois's life was just like any other kid his age's. But when his mother and his sister were in a car wreck, and his little sister was killed, his mom never got over it. She cried all the time, his father couldn't stand it, Perry couldn't either. After a year, Perry's mom walked out on them. He and his father moved into a forest about five miles away from town. Perry and his father rarely talked. Perry spent a lot of time in his cave that he discovered in the forest. The only other house around was vacant; The Bennet House, until The Pestalozzi Family moved into it.Willow and Perry met in Perry's cave. The cave is actually on Willow's family's property. He's frightened of loosing his cave, it was his private resort where he could get out of his less-than-satisfying world.\\"You're trespassing.\\" My stomach dropped down to my knees. No! Could it be true? Could my cave, my wonderful secret hideout, my privacy place, be part of the Bennet House property? That possibility had never occurred to me. (Franklin, 31)When I read the book, Lone Wolf, at times I felt very sad and sorry for Perry Dubois. Other times, when Perry is able to have fun, I felt good for him. He had such a depressing life, but as the book goes on, he gets to be happier. After Willow came into the picture, he was growing fond of her family. It was a happy event when the Pestalozzi Family invited his father and him over for Christmas eve.Perry got his father to accept the invitation and go, but when he went into town for firewood, it was snowing too hard for him to come home.\\"Did my dad call or anything?\\" I asked Mr. P when I got to the table.\\"No Perry,\\" he said sadly. \\"And it's snowing really hard out. I doubt if he'll make it back, so we'll go ahead and eat. Dinner has been ready for more than an hour. We may get fifteen to twenty inches tonight.\\"\\"He'll make it,\\" I said, trying to sound sure of myself. \\"He's got the blade on the truck.\\"\\"Some sections of the highway are closed,\\" said Mr. P. \\"We'll save some food for your dad, just in case.\\"\\"You can stay with us, Perry,\\" said Willow. She pushed her glasses into place and blew a long strand of dark hair out of her face. \\"We can pretend you're part of our family, like a cousin or a brother or something.\\" She grinned and wiggled her eye brows up and down. (Franklin, 196)This is an example of how a sad situation can turn into a happy one."},{"Title":"Lone Wolf","review":"This is the story of Perry, the lonliest kid in the world. In response to the tragic death of his daughter and separation from his wife, Jack Dubois takes his son, Perry to a secluded, forested region of Minnesota, then becomes the stereotypical \\"silent tough guy.\\" As a result, Perry (who is also home-schooled), has no friends and nobody to talk to. He is self-reliant until a new family moves into the nearby Bennett House: A large family of talkative artists from California. Perry is upset about this (as I know I would be if talkative artists moved in next door to me), especially because the only family memmber his age is a girl (ewwwwwww!). Slowly, Perry and Jack open up to each other and build interpersonal relationships.While I don't think this is Kristine Franklin's best book, it is a good one. I taught it to my fifth graders who enjoyed it a lot. One good thing about this book is the fact that Perry is a dynamic (changing), three dimensional character, so we can focus on him and how he changes during the novel, while the other characters are largely one-dimensinal. This is not a criticism of the book: it allows the young reader to identify with the characters and predict what his/her reactions will be (\\"Dad will say nothing, Willow will talk a lot and be annoying,\\" etc.), so that reading comprehnesion is easier.In sum, I recommend this book because kids enjoy the story, the static characters make reading it easy and because it's generally an easy book to teach."},{"Title":"Lone Wolf","review":"Lone Wolf, set in northern Minnesota, reflects an 11-year-old boy's point of view. Every character in the book is seen through the eyes of this young man, so his perceptions of how the other characters relate to him are insular and are related to his innermost feelings, which are not objective during this period of his life. I found the book hard to put down and very descriptive. No one has mentioned how art plays a role in the plot. This is a book about feelings -- total avoidance of feelings and the consequences, the need for touch and companionship of social beings, and the basic human need for love. This is also a book about acceptance -- acceptance of those who are different from us, accepting change in our family units as people grow in different directions instead of growing together within the family unit, and accepting our own shortcomings in our family-and-friend relationships. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Lone Wolf","review":"Lone Wolf is a book about an 11 year old boy named Perry Dubois and his conflicts with his lonliness. His mother has left him and his baby sister has died, leaving Perry and his father to survive together. Perry starts out as a very private individual whose thoughts and struggles are only known by the reader. His cave is his retreat from the pain he feels. He enjoys being there with his German Shepherd and watching the wildlife..especially a wolf he calls King. It's when the Pestalozzi family from California moves in that Perry begins to change. The oldest daughter Willow befriends him and joins him in his cave. At first Perry is reluctant but while reading you can see that he's enjoying her company but having trouble admitting it. They enjoy sharing drawings and watching for wolves together. Over time he begins hanging out with the Pestalozzi family and finding himself having fun. He enjoys the company of others and starts to depend on it.I like how the author incorporates a howling wolf into the story. It is as if a wolf represents Perry himself and the howling is a call for another wolf, just as Perry wants to be with others. Just like wolves, people are not meant to be alone, they need to travel in \\"packs\\".This is a good book for discussion in a classroom. You can discuss how Perry has changed and how he and the wolf are alike. It will also spark a conversation on why people become lonely.I would reccommend this book for a child and an adult. It will make you think about the internal conflicts we all have within ourselves."},{"Title":"Lone Wolf","review":"Perry Dubois (pronounced \\"Du-boice,\\" not \\"Du-bwah\\") has lived in Minnesota's north woods with his father for the past three years. His mother left when he was eight. Now he's eleven and used to the solitude of the forest. It means he and his father don't have to share their business with other people. It's not so bad, even if Perry's father hardly ever talks, and even though there aren't other kids around.Then the Pestalozzi family moves in to a neighboring house that had been vacant for a long time. This new family's home is near the cave that Perry considers his private space, and Willow Pestalozzi is a dreaded new intruder who won't leave him alone. She's a girl, she talks too much, and she found his sacred hideaway. How is he supposed to deal with a girl who wants to know everything about him? It's none of her business why he lives in the middle of a forest with his dad, why he's home-schooled, or anything else.Willow's irritating presence starts to grow on him, especially when she develops an interest in tracking a wolf with him, but something about her family reminds him of things he'd rather not think about. Although he likes her family's warmth, getting too close could be more painful than a lifetime of solitude.More than another deep-woods tale, LONE WOLF is a poignant experience told from a young boy's perspective. Franklin explores the meanings of loss and coping through Perry's journey and beautifully captures the impact of a family's disintegration by bringing Perry to life. Everything he does, feels, and thinks is colored by a past that would be traumatic even to adults, indeed, as it has been to his father. The writing pulls readers along by dangling hints of the past throughout several turns in the story.A compelling read, LONE WOLF promises to be a classic on the level of WHERE THE RED FERN GROWS or BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA. The experience of crushing loss is not limited to adults, and stories like these can help children to find solace and strength.Highly recommended.Reviewed by Christina Wantz Fixemer02/02/2007"},{"Title":"Lone Wolf","review":"The book LONE WOLF is a great book by Kristine L.

I can underscore the lack of solid evidence and lackaday assembly of the few facts there are.Try to find one crisp summary of Mr. Halliday's thesis anywhere in this book. You won't. Instead, you'll find a lazy summer day's read, drifting down a river of possibles. A little bit here, a little bit there, a little bit more back over here, some different stuff there... Who edited this thing for him?Along those same lines, the book's organization could use some work. The &quot;essays&quot; making up the second half of the book are as muddled as the &quot;history&quot; of the first half. They should get their own &quot;Part II&quot; instead of simply having different chapter names.Throughout, compute the ratio of &quot;might/could have/may&quot; to &quot;did/was/had&quot; and you'll understand how imprecise a view of Jefferson this is. Halliday himself muses on the transience of historical understanding. Better for him to take it to heart, and focus on the hard facts than try to read sheep's entrails to discern what might have been.Certainly Jefferson deserves better than this! Certainly American Heritage deserves better than this!By the way, wouldn't this suffice, instead of 250 pages of gumming the subject to death?: 1. TJ had a 10-year, very sexual marriage to Martha. He may have promised her on her deathbed not to remarry. 2. Sally Hemings was Martha's half-sister. 3. Perhaps out of family relation and resemblance, or perhaps out of his horniness and her availability, Tom/Sally were perfect for each other. 4. Why else would TJ have freed her offspring? He freed none of his other slaves; instead they were sold after his death to cover his debts.Buy the book. Read the book. Don't believe you &quot;understand&quot; TJ any better after having done so."},{"Title":"Understanding Thomas Jefferson","review":"When I first picked up Understanding Thomas Jefferson to read, I was most aware of E.M. Halliday's credentials as a writer, and I had very high expectations. In a few respects the book delivered, especially in its attack upon best-selling historian Joseph J. Ellis for his implication that Jefferson opted for celibacy after his wife died. Jefferson was then not yet 40, in remarkable physical condition, and enjoyed being among women.However, Mr. Halliday pushed his Freudian analysis a bit far and made that and his forays into existentialist behavior the principal bases for our supposed &quot;understanding&quot; of the complex Thomas Jefferson. The narrowness of the author's approach to judgment was a letdown.So long as the author was entering the realm of reasonable speculation, I would have thought he might pay considerably more attention to the influence of Jefferson's father, Peter, and that of other strong males, mentors, and intellectual companions of both sexes in Jefferson's life.Surprisingly, though, Mr. Halliday was not quite so thorough in his examination of the available Jefferson literature as one could hope. As a result, he made a few important factual missteps and left several doors unopened.I happened to catch an interview of the author on C-Span after I read his book and heard him compound errors by tossing an 1815 Jefferson observation into the mix of factors leading him to Sally Hemings in the late 1780s.On the whole this book was a disappointing treatment of Jefferson which left me no more understanding of the Sage of Monticello at the finish than I was at the beginning."},{"Title":"Understanding Thomas Jefferson","review":"I started out very excited by this book. Based on my readings, I was convinced that Jefferson had had a liason with Hemmings, unquestionably based on the circumstanital evidence. (I did not know about the DNA testing at the time). I was looking forward to this book because I knew Halliday thought it to be fact, and I didnt want a biographer who masked over real history. It started out as an easy read. It quickly disintegrated into a book of sleazy guesswork and disjointed facts. I knew more about Jefferson's sex life than I did his presidency. I cant remember EVEN ONE mention of who his vice president was. Did he even talk about the election? Not that I recall. I do remember Halliday speculating about whether Jefferson masturbated. (forgive the image but you get the idea now of what Im talking about). The time chronology is all over the place, nothing is in order. The tone changes chapter by chapter. One minute he is talking about Hemmnings, the next chapter is spent degrading all the other authors who have written about Jefferson, of course none of them have it right according to Halliday. I have never seen an author so unprofessional to spend an ENTIRE chapter (entitled \\"Blinkered Historians) on why the other biographers were wrong. In retrospect, even if David Ellis did have it wrong about the Hemmings affair (which he did), I feel my time would have been spent much more wisely reading him, even if it is a little harder to read. I also fealt that Hallidays own personal beliefs and interests seeped into the book. Because some parts of the book were not credible, I wasnt sure what to believe. Examples, the specuations about the sexual details. Another example was when he claimed Adams believed that government and power should be intrusted to the aristocratic and the rich families of America. That is really not true, while Adams did belive that the federal gov't needed certain powers, he did not believe in elite rule. He was criticized for being a monarchist in his time, but that was really nothing more than politics, he believed in a multi-faceted gov't. Okay so that was a tangent, long story short, I fealt that I walked away much less enlightend about jefferson than I had hoped."},{"Title":"Understanding Thomas Jefferson","review":"This book is a very easy to read seemingly well documented work but it will not provide the reader with Thomas Jefferson in historical context. If your interest is in what Mr. Jefferson accomplished during his life and the many great achievements that he participated in on behalf the formation of the United States I would pass up this work. If your interest lies in his carnal side and his personal sexual history this might be more your speed. Had I known this was the piece of fluff that it turned out to be I would not have wasted my money on this work. This book would probably be a good basis for daytime TV couch potato fare. It is hardly a good work of historical content and most likely would have been rejected by any Masters level thesis committee. Most of this book could be condensed into one chapter.On a number of occasions Mr Halliday lets his own personal political bias color his image of Mr. Jefferson pushing this work even further from the vein of relevant history.I picked up this work based upon the recommendations on the inside cover. I have always been impressed with the historical works of Mr. Ambrose but I believe that there must have been more to his review."},{"Title":"Understanding Thomas Jefferson","review":"&quot;The past is never fully recoverable, and any history will indeed be fictional to some extent,&quot; writes Halliday in the closing chapter of his book &quot;Understanding Thomas Jefferson.&quot; Oh the irony...Halliday's book reminded me, through the first half, of reading an (almost) trashy novel in which he goes on for greath lengths about Jefferson and his sexuality writing about Jefferson's infatuation with &quot;Belinda&quot; to his ten year romance with his wife Martha (in which Halliday writes that he literally &quot;loved her to death&quot;), to Maria Cosway and Sally Hemings and her arrival in France. Halliday seems to (conveniently) forget that Tom Woodson, Sally's first child conceived in Paris, has been shown through DNA testing that he is not Jefferson's son. Thus, throughout most of the part in describing the &quot;affair&quot; between Hemings and Jefferson in Paris, Halliday draws upon massive speculation and an abounding amount of &quot;what ifs&quot;, &quot;could haves&quot;, &quot;perhaps&quot;, and &quot;maybes&quot;.It is this theme of Jefferson and women that repeatedly appears throughout the book. Just as the reader thinks that he is now reading about Jefferson's political ideology or moral philosophy, Halliday always manages to somehow fit in a sentence or two concerning Sally Hemings or Jefferson's ideal woman. He seems bent on convincing the reader that Jefferson was a very sexual character who was a follower of &quot;Nature&quot; and so forth that often times, I wanted the throw the book across the room (or the bus) out of frustration of constant reminders of the author's insistence of Jefferson's &quot;urges.&quot;The book does go into other aspects of Jefferson's life, occasionally touching on his family life (of course, without speculation as to why his daughter Patsy married so quickly upon arriving at Monticello from France -- could it be because of Sally Hemings?) and his thoughts upon organized religion, morals, and philosophy, including writing about Jefferson and his &quot;Philosophy of Jesus of Nazareth.&quot; Halliday describes Jefferson's political struggle against Alexander Hamilton, but fails to mention the falling about between Jefferson and Adams. Of course, Halliday couldn't possibly write a book without mentioning Abigail Adams -- of course he does, and mentioning her often leads back into more about Jefferson and his love of &quot;beautiful women&quot;.This book did not make me feel that I had understood Jefferson any further from what I had previously read. It was entertaining at times, but Halliday's gossip-like tone grew tiresome and weary.Read this book, but don't take everything for face value. To get to know Jefferson, keep reading, keep researching, and form your own opinions. Just make sure they're not Halliday's."},{"Title":"Understanding Thomas Jefferson","review":"Mr. Halliday's book starts on the first line of the jacket by presenting something that IS NOT accurate. It states that &quot;Thomas Jefferson foe of miscegenation yet secret lover of a beautiful slave for thirty years&quot;, must set the tone for his entire book. As a past editor of American Heritage we would assume that the man is giving us the benefit of his vast knowledge of the subject at hand and we should all believe his assessment. Mr. Halliday knows well about the results of the DNA Study, however he does not feel compelled to tell the reader that there was NO Jefferson/Woodson match. In fact, I can find no reference to Dr. E.A. Foster's thoughts and statement on the DNA Study. Like Fawn Brodie, for whom he dedicates the book to, there are much to many, &quot;could easily have&quot;, &quot;he may well have been&quot;, &quot;there is reason to think&quot;, &quot;there would seem&quot;, &quot;it is very conceivable&quot;, &quot;might have been&quot;, &quot;apparently&quot;, &quot;hard to avoid the conclusion&quot;, you get the idea. Unless I am mistaken,Mr. Halliday OMITS from Mr. Jefferson's acknowledgement about the Walker affair, that in letters to his Secretary of the Navy, Robert Smith and his Attorney General, Levi Lincoln, that that was the only rumor that he would conseed is true among all the rumors spread about him, thus this was a blanket denial. Mr. Halliday has taken his well worn material from recognized books about Jefferson that have been hashed and rehashed over the years. He also makes reference to Annette Gordon-Reed's book, &quot;Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings, An American Controversy&quot;, but does not tell the reader that she states in her updated version, &quot;The DNA test does not prove that the descendant of Eston Hemings was a direct descendant of Thomas Jefferson.&quot;In one of the earlier pages he again sets the scene that Jefferson is guilty by saying, &quot;how could a man assert his disgust for sexual mixing of the races have taken as his concubine one of his own, the very young and beautiful Sally Hemings.&quot; My over 28 years of research as Jefferson Family Historian and one who assisted Dr. E. A. Foster with the DNA Study, have found NOTHING to indicate that Mr. Jefferson fathered any Hemings child. He takes two of our greatest Jefferson researchers, Merrill Peterson and Dumas Malone to task for giving the public the benefit of their vast knowledge by supporting the fact that Jefferson is innocent of the charges. Mr. Halliday chooses to bring the owners of Monticello, The Thomas Jefferson Foundation, formerly known as The Thomas Jefferson Memorial Foundation who have decided to DROP the &quot;Memorial&quot; from their title, into the fiasco by stating that they had accepted the fact that Sally and her master had a long time love affair.At this point I wish to enlighten the reader that ALL sides of an issue must be presented so a new book will be out in May, &quot;The Jefferson-Hemings Myth, An American Tragedy&quot; (available from Amazon.com), and so will a Scholars Commission Report researched and studied by 16 or more well known professors, NOT employees of Monticello but volunteer scholars who wish to give the public the benefit of their unbiased research. The book also states that Thomas Jefferson Randolph (Jefferson's grandson), wispy story that the Carr brothers had admitted to fathering some of Sally's children but now the DNA had completely blown away that story. Now if the author were such a careful and observant researcher he would know that only one DNA sample from the Hemings matched, there was NO available data for the four other children. My research reveals that they could be guily for some of the earlier ones. I also note an absence of any reference to Mr. Jefferson's brother, Randolph, and his 5 sons who are prime suspects. As Jefferson Family Historian, I have found the grave of Madison Hemings son, William, (a valuable and prime source of DNA) BUT the Madison Hemings descendants are happy with oral family history and WILL NOT give permission for exhumation. The Monticello researcers would not seek this very valuable information either and did not tell the public of it's availability. You will notice that Mr. Halliday does not mention this either. There are many other statements mentioned that tend to degrade Mr. Jefferson in the eyes of the public. We should NEVER place all our history in the hands of &quot;authorities&quot;, some academia, some foundations and some writers. Politically correct historical revisionists are prevelant on many scenes. BUY THE BOOK........we must hear both sides of the issue.........let the reader decide.Herbert Barger Jefferson Family Historian"},{"Title":"Understanding Thomas Jefferson","review":"E.M. Halliday's psycho-biography and its premises about Jefferson's character rest largely on a falsehood--that Dr. Eugene Foster's DNA tests proved that Thomas Jefferson fathered Sally's Hemings' first child in Paris, as well as her other children. Foster's letter to the N.Y. Times corrected the record, &quot;the genetic findings [we] reported...do not prove that Thomas Jefferson was the father of one of Sally Hemings' children. We never made that claim.&quot; The DNA in fact proved that 1) Sally Hemings' first child (Paris) was not a Jefferson--two DNA tests on a Hemings descendant proved it conclusively, and 2) Sally's last child, Eston, could have been fathered by any of 25 Jefferson males, including Jefferson's brother Randolph, who was known to spend late nights playing his fiddle and dancing in the slave quarters.As for the Madison Hemings newspaper article, scholars have always considered the evidence as hearsay, not uttered by Madison until fifty years after Jefferson's death, and the nature of the article flawed and unqualified to stand on its own.The verdict is still out on Jefferson-Hemings, but an in-depth report on the issue will be released by the Scholars Commission on April 13, Jefferson's 258th birthday. The Commission includes Jefferson and presidential scholars, including Doctors Forrest McDonald, Willard Sterne Randall, Harvey C. Mansfield and Robert H. Ferrell."},{"Title":"Understanding Thomas Jefferson","review":"If you're looking for a good, all around biography of Thomas Jefferson, this is not the book for you. \\"Understanding Thomas Jefferson\\" attempts to do exactly what the title suggests-understand Thomas Jefferson, but as a human being rather than as a statesman. E. M. Halliday's thesis is that virtually every standard biography of Thomas Jefferson describes him as a complex individual and highlights the contradictions in his life that border on hypocrisy (maybe even cross that border), but few try to put them in perspective.This book attempts to do just that. Much of it (especially the first part of the book) deals with Jefferson's relationships with the women in his life. Admittedly, much of it is conjectural, because there's not much documentation extant. For example, Jefferson burned all his correspondence with his wife and mother. But Halliday has done a lot of research and puts his conjectures in context with documented events in Jefferson's life as well as with the social norms in which he lived.If the author attacks the renowned Jefferson biographers (e.g., Dumas Malone and Joseph Ellis) for concluding that Jefferson's relationship with Sally Hemings was a myth, the criticism is well deserved. I read Joseph Ellis's biography \\"American Sphinx: The Character of Thomas Jefferson\\" when it was first published in 1997 and was astonished with his conclusion (in the Appendix of the book) that the \\"rumors\\" about Jefferson's relationship with Sally Hemings were not true. Now, this was the first biography I had ever read about Thomas Jefferson, so after having read what Ellis himself had written, I was shocked that he could come to that conclusion.If you find Thomas Jefferson to be a fascinating individual (as I do) and have already read some mainstream history/biography about him, then you will probably enjoy this book immensely (as I have). It's different, it's conjectural, and that's its appeal."},{"Title":"Understanding Thomas Jefferson","review":"A word of warning from the get-go: E. M. Halliday's \\"Understanding Thomas Jefferson\\" is not your standard biography of our third president. It does not fawn, nor does it marbleize Jefferson as some untouchable, unknowable, walking mystery so impenatrable that none but the most scholarly of biographers dare touch him.What you come away with from this book is a sense that you know Jefferson just a bit better or, barring that, you at least have had a light shown upon areas of his life not heretofore illuminated for fear that doing so might \\"cut him down to size\\", make him merely mortal.Halliday takes us through just about all the phases of Jefferson's life, from his youthful years, through his marriage, his various relationships with the three main women in his life (outside of his daughters): his wife, Martha, Maria Cosway and Sally Hemings. He shows us Jefferson's stormy relationship with Alexander Hamilton while the former served as Secretary of State and the latter Secretary of the Treasury in Washington's cabinet.He unsparingly comments on previous, \\"god-like\\" biographers of Jefferson, including Dumas Malone and Merrill Peterson, pointing out their (to him) flaws and blindnesses (especially on the subject of Sally Hemings). He steers the reader in other directions of thought that these men did not see fit to address, which failure, as Halliday would have it, presents an incomplete picture of their celebrated subject and cheats posterity of a history which is \\"meaningful\\".There are blunt discussions and speculations upon the nature of Jefferson's sexual development, both before, during and after his ten years of relative marital bliss with Martha Wayles Skelton. If you are someone who just cannot abide the thought that Jefferson had a sexual and, apparently, long-term and loving relationship with Sally Hemings (despite acknowledged DNA evidence to the contrary), or who thinks that after Martha Jefferson's death, her husband turned off his sexual desires like one turns off a kitchen faucet and became an emotionless stone statue, then perhaps this book might not be your cup of tea.Try it anyway. Mr. Halliday makes his case rationally, calmly and gradually, debunking a few things and confirming others along the way, for example, rendering the supposedly \\"long-lasting\\" passion of Jefferson for Maria Cosway (the married English lady with whom he flirted - and we really don't know what else - while he was ambassador in Paris) much shorter than it actually was, primarily because ... well, Maria was apparently a bit of a fluff-head. And you can well imagine that Jefferson, of all people, with his love of learning and books and education, could not long have endured a ditzy female.If you had read nothing about Jefferson, and wanted to use this as a first introduction to the man, I'd discourage it, recommending that you read at least one other \\"mainstream\\" conventional biography before reading E. M. Halliday's work in order to see the sharp contrast between the two resources. If you approach Thomas Jefferson in that fashion, then Halliday's honesty and open style, as well as his obvious desire that history consider all aspects of its subject, no matter how unthinkable or \\"forbidden\\", will become, I believe, quite appealing.You will find this book a refreshing look at one of the most respected figures in American history, no less so because he is examined unsparingly and who, while found wanting in some aspects of his life, emerges less of an enigma and more of an \\"every man\\" than most biographies of Jefferson would have you to believe."},{"Title":"Understanding Thomas Jefferson","review":"As a self styled Jefferson &quot;scholar&quot;, I found the book fascinating, thought provoking and enlightening. I agree with the editorial comments that there is a heavy emphasis on Jefferson's sex life; the emphasis was there, but perhaps it would be better called his &quot;love&quot; life in the truest sense of that word. I've read and studied the other books the auther cites and wonder now how so many of us, for so long, accepted the academic view that the man was non-sexual. We made a priestly nun out of a real man, and thought we must be right. How much racism played into that belief, I can't tell. Who among us can rate our own racism and separate it from our culture and our time? And which of us can separate our home/love/erotic life from the actions, large and small, that make up our professions, careers, beliefs, actions? I've often felt that Nixon's follies could have/would have been far different if his sex/love life (whatever it was) had been different.Now it is possible for me to consider the TRAGEDY of the life of Jefferson and Sally Hemmings....there must have been &quot;love&quot; (however that is defined for that age, that culture, that understanding) between the two for it to have lasted a lifetime! And never, never to be able to speak of it to a soul! Maybe THAT'S what made him want to go home again and again and again. The mountain, the fascinating building, the horticulture, surely, but the woman too!Halliday's book brings an &quot;understanding&quot; of that.My criticism of the book would be that Halliday is TOO conversational, TOO gossipy; he seems too ready to apply today's views of sex/eroticism to the culture of the 18th Century. Since the book IS chiefly about the man's erotic life, it would have added to our knowledge to have included further studies of the sexual, cultural differences these two centuries have made in our understanding of human nature....also far too much on Laurence Sterne.But all in all, a must book for those who have an abiding interest in Jefferson and what made him tick."},{"Title":"Understanding Thomas Jefferson","review":"I selected this book somewhat blindly from my library after learning that Thomas Jefferson was, if not officially, predisposed to a Unitarian belief system and desiring to learn more about who he was as a person.

If you are not interested in her, don't read this book. The author is a good writer as far as making his subject interesting, and maybe he thinks a book was needed with an emphasis on Hemings.This is not the first I have read on Thomas Jefferson, and I'm glad of that because I do think the emphasis on Sally Hemings makes this book something to read AFTER you have already studied Thomas Jefferson from a historical point of view on his importance to the creation of The United States of America.On the importance of Sally Hemings here is what I glean from all of this. Thomas Jefferson was married once to Martha Wayles Skelton, widow of Bathurst Skelton, daughter of John Wayles. By all accounts, Jefferson was completely and utterly faithful to Martha. He adored her and loved her passionately. John Wayles fathered Sally Hemings, making Sally, Martha's half-sister. After 10 years of marriage Martha died leaving Jefferson devastated. They say he could not even bear to discuss her his pain was so great. He never remarried. But at some point he did begin a long affair with Sally Hemings. The fact that Hemings was Martha's half-sister is very revealing to me and makes me feel great sympathy for Jefferson, not contempt.Overall though, the Sally Hemings angle is not important to the founding of our great nation, or Thomas Jefferson, other than to explain why he had any bond with her at all. It all goes back to his beloved wife Martha, who died way too soon."},{"Title":"Understanding Thomas Jefferson","review":"How they managed to get Stephen Ambrose to write such a glowing review is a mystery to me!! Halliday's obsession with Jefferson's sexuality and his speculation about his relationships tells us nothing about Jefferson the man or his legacy. The fact that he is the acknowledged father of several illegitimate children is really of no interest and has no impact on the things he should be remembered for. I am no closer to understanding Jefferson but I might be a little closer to understanding Halliday. Surely he is too young to have been born during the victorian era?"},{"Title":"Understanding Thomas Jefferson","review":"This is truly a book of speculation, fluff and bad biography.Most of the book focuses on Jefferson's sex life and the author's speculations about it. (Did he or didn't he? Could he or couldn't he?) Even if there were a shred of evidence about any of this, I wouldn't care to know, and since it is all just guesswork, it is even less interesting.It would be a terrible shame if this were the only Jefferson &quot;biography&quot; that one read. There are so many great Jefferson biographies out there, that your time could certainly be much better spent."},{"Title":"Understanding Thomas Jefferson","review":"Overall, I have to say this is a decent biography on Jefferson. However, if you aren't a fan of Brodie's work, this one probably isn't for you. For the most part, Halliday has just re-printed information that has been published many times over. He does look at some issues, such as Jefferson's relationship with Maria Cosway, in a new light. But I found many parts of the book to be poorly worded and sometimes very low in judgement. This would be a great book for someone who has never read much on Jefferson, but if you have, there isn't a lot of new insite Halliday adds to the great man's life."},{"Title":"Understanding Thomas Jefferson","review":"The book is incredibly well-written -- I found it difficult to put it down -- and achieves what only one other biography on Jefferson does (that would be Jack McLaughlin's work), which is, Jefferson comes alive here. Halliday describes in beautiful detail Jefferson's passion for his domestic life (mixed with his complex relationship with public life) to help define him, thus succeeding in capturing his humanity while also allowing the reader to continue to appreciate his manifold contributions to the world.Halliday also describes the world around Jefferson in a way that is both modern and removed but still has the ring the truth. The writer presents the man like his world: both modern and of his time, and therfore, not nearly as inaccessible as the erstwhile sage of Monticello or, especially, as the Sphinx Joseph Ellis painted.Some of Halliday's energies were not as well spent devlving into Jefferson the lustful young man, and there were several passages, including one about Jefferson's arousal at exposed nipples in Paris, that I felt were gratuitous.I also thought Halliday was too forgiving of Jefferson regarding the Betsy Walker affair. If we accept Jefferson was proactive in the seduction of his best friend's wife while the best friend was away, then Jefferson behaved in a sleazy way. Period. Halliday's contention was that Jefferson was bewitched by Betsey's curves and therefore portrays him as somewhat of a victim. If we consider Jefferson's fashionable chauvinism towards women at large -- evidenced in his writings -- and consider what little sexual power American women had, and when we consider also, that charges of infidelity were often settled by men shooting at each other, then we must sympathize with Betsey Walker and accept that she was truthful when she said she was silent for sixteen years about Jefferson's advances, because she was both afraid of Jefferson as a dominant male, a powerful public figure, and also afraid a duel might ensue and kill off her husband. She had nothing to gain by stepping forward and everything to lose.These points aside, E. M. Halliday has written a fresh, honest, and beautifully written book about a heretofore enigmatic American hero. Well done."},{"Title":"Understanding Thomas Jefferson","review":"Despite the puff reviews on the jacket, this is not the book to read to &quot;get to know&quot; Thomas Jefferson. It is an entry in the Tom and Sally myth, mostly based on secondary sources, which attempts to raise Fawn Brodie's 1974 musings (&quot;Thomas Jefferson: An Intimate History&quot;)to historical fact. The narrative flows smoothly under Halliday's writing style and will reinforce the opinions of those who are predisposed to accept the claim that Jefferson fathered children by his slave Sally Hemings. The book will be frustrating for one who is reading about this issue for the first time because Halliday piles inference on supposition and kneads them together so that it is difficult to separate fact from imagination. The agreed historical record on Sally Hemings is scant: Hemings was inherited as a baby by Jefferson's wife; while in her early teens she spent about about two years in Paris as a maid to Jefferson's daughters; she returned to Monticello and bore four children who survived to adulthood; she lived about eight years as a free woman after Jefferson's death. Halliday skirts, as have other proponents of the paternity claim, that during the thirty-five years Hemings lived at Monticello after her return from France she was treated as a slave, and not one person made a direct reference to so much as a glance between her and Jefferson. This includes many of Jefferson's grandchildren who lived at Monticello, his two daughters, countless other relatives and visitors, and those slaves who could read and write, which included three of Sally's brothers freed by Jefferson, one of whom was in France with Sally. For proof of paternity, we are asked to accept a newspaper interview of one of Sally's sons, Madison Hemings, conducted some fifty years after he was freed by Jefferson. Madison relates events that occurred before his birth, including the claim that Sally's first child was fathered by Jefferson in Paris, an oft repeated legend, unsupported by any record or witness. However, Halliday accepts the hearsay of the Madison Hemings interview, but then, on the grounds it is &quot;hearsay,&quot; rejects the interview given by Jefferson's grandson, who spent much of his youth at Monticello, and who denied that his grandfather had a relationship with a slave. Halliday also asserts that the relationship has been accepted by most scholars. Actually, there have been very few. There was the strange concession by the Trustees of the Monticello Foundation that Jefferson was probably the father of Sally's children after DNA tests showed that the descendants of Sally's youngest son, Eston, carried a y haplotype common to the Jefferson male line. Recently, a panel of distinguised scholars considered the DNA results, as well as the historical record, and released a detailed report which concluded Jefferson was not the father of Sally's children. Even though Halliday makes Jefferson into a public and private fraud, he inexplicably concedes at the end that Jefferson deserves his spot on Mount Rushmore."},{"Title":"Understanding Thomas Jefferson","review":"First, Halliday has just re-stated many things that have long since been known about Jefferson and he covers that in a brief overview of Jefferson's life in two chapters. Secondly, he spends too much time on things that are relatively irrelevant. An entire chapter has been devoted to pointing out what he feels is right and what is wrong with all other Jefferson biographers. Lastly, Mr. Halliday doesn't seem to have a decent grasp of English and makes several very distasteful comments. Overall, I say big waste of money."},{"Title":"Understanding Thomas Jefferson","review":"When Thomas Jefferson came to sum up his lifetime accomplishments, there was no mention of his two terms as President of the United States. Instead, he saw himself as &quot;Author of the Declaration of American Independence, of the Statute of Virginia for religious freedom, &amp; Father of the University of Virginia.&quot;E M Halliday pretty much avoids the great political moments of Jefferson's life and answers, instead, the question: What kind of man was this? Much of the book is involved with Jefferson's relations with his wife, daughters, and -- more speculatively -- with his maid Sally Hemings, who was not only a slave but his late wife's half sister. Ever since Fawn Brodie first broached the subject in her 1974 biography, the Sally Hemings question has intrigued many scholars, at least those who were not previously over-invested in the notion of an altogether more celibate founding father.I do not take sides one way or the other, but I find the possibility intriguing. Considering that Jefferson had in fact a documented ability to dissemble and act contrary to his stated beliefs, I am willing to accept that he was a less than perfect man. Today, some Kenneth Starr type abetted by a swirling band of journalistic and political harpies would have wiped the act in his face with every emission across the full media spectrum. But the times were different then, and there was an inherent disconnect among Southern slave-owners between &quot;could&quot; and &quot;should.&quot;I am fascinated by the fact that Jefferson did not regard his presidency as the pinnacle of his career. He always valued the domestic life; he loved being a planter, though he was a financial failure at it; and he loved dabbling in domestic architecture. I thank E M Halliday's book for introducing me to this Jefferson; and I think none the less of him for his putative peccadillos."},{"Title":"Understanding Thomas Jefferson","review":"The title is seriously misleading as this book is mainly about Jefferson's relationships with women and his postcript really doesn't make sense. The book is short so there wasn't too much waste of time, but I would have picked other books if I had known. For somebody as brilliant, complex,and erudite as Jefferson, this book did not do justice."},{"Title":"Understanding Thomas Jefferson","review":"Understanding Thomas Jefferson: By E. M. HallidayUnderstanding Thomas Jefferson by E.M. Halliday is a book mainly about the rumor of an amorous relationship between Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings. Sally Hemings was a half-sister to Jefferson's wife. She was fathered by Jefferson's Father-In-Law. Thomas Jefferson not only was one of the founding fathers of America but also the third president. While he authored the Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson also owned slaves. The fact that he owned slaves nullifies the ideals and morals, which one often associates with being a founding father, president or the author behind such a masterpiece as the Declaration of Independence.The long history of slavery in Virginia makes it impossible to discuss the history of Virginia without discussing slavery. Slaves in Virginia mostly worked on the plantations or in the houses. The early Africans were more like indentured servants than slaves. They were allowed to own property, marry and raise their family. However, starting from mid-17th century the legal framework of slavery based on color was put in place to gain more benefit out of the imported Africans. Thus, the long history of slavery began. Consequently, more laws dictating slavery were put in place to profit the masters without any considerations for the slaves. During Thomas Jefferson's time slavery was an institutionalized system that he was born into. As a result, it is self-evident that he would also own slaves like his father.But more importantly, this book is about the mores of that time. Remember that it is very hard to compare mores of today with those of that time... things and life were vastly different. Jefferson believed that slavery was a product from a corrupt King of England and the colonists had to endure this evil via the proxies of that government. Thomas Jefferson whether an \\"enlightened man\\" or a \\"racist\\" needs to be reexamined to form a more realistic picture of who Jefferson really was.Along these lines of thought, Jefferson was not the only Founding Father to have a fancy for the ladies. Washington, Franklin, Hamilton were known for their love of the ladies. These men were like rock stars today with the expected groupies and all of the trappings. Of course, what you do with these trappings is a matter of your moral standards.Remember, around the world, women were treated maybe, just maybe a little better then cattle. I know... your saying what has this to do with the book. Well, my answer is that Jefferson being a well-dressed man with striking appearance also traveled Europe and was exposed to this practice. So, the women involved with Jefferson throughout the book knew what they were doing. Just as Jefferson knew how the game was played.As to the Sally Hemings claims, it could be any of the male Jefferson extended family that MAY have impregnated Sally Hemings... there is NO concrete evidence that it was Thomas Jefferson. The book is full of conjecture, heresy and second hand information. The only way we will know for sure is more DNA testing. So, discretion being the better part of valor, to whom do we believe. Jefferson was a man, not a celibate monk and if we go by his word he abhorred miscegenation, but he professed that \\"all men are created equal.\\"So, the debate goes on and on, only Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings know for sure what transpired. All we have is conjecture. Even DNA will bring us closer, but not definitive as there were other male members within the Jefferson household that have to be taken into account.As for the writing in the book and the storytelling it moves shrewdly and you keep reading. Whether you believe what is written is not for me to say, but I took it with a grain of salt. The dichotomy of Jefferson still continues, as one of the most human of the Founding Fathers, Jefferson will be forever elicit adamant opinions. Halliday takes readers deep into Jefferson's private life--exploring his childhood, his literary taste, and his unconventional religious thinking and moral philosophy. Here, too, are his adamant opinions on women, the evolution of his ideas on democracy and freedom of expression, and fresh insights into his relationship with Sally Hemings. Intriguing as it is, it is history or rumor, history is founded on facts, the facts presented here would not exclude to other players from the same gene pool. Therefore rumor, innuendo, gossip, and hearsay; especially about the personal or private affairs of others, pertaining to or affecting a particular person or a small group of persons or an individual is highly speculative. No one alive today will be 100 percent sure.Thomas Jefferson is a controversial historical figure. Contradictions are evident in almost every sphere of his life from his view on his slavery to his relationship with his slave Sally Hemings. Thus, it is important to form and reform our arguments and adjust our opinions on such an influential American character. It is essential to be engaged in a constant dialog with history, so one can develop a clear understanding of Jefferson, instead of hold on an unchanging heroic image of him. However, this does not mean Jefferson should be knocked off of the pedestal but instead he should be criticized and be put responsible for his racist views. In doing so present day America can send a clear and loud message of how racial injustices are unacceptable and immoral. Moreover, there is a great need to recover the untold slave stories such as the story of Jame Hubbard who deserves accolade for being courageous enough to seek the liberty Jefferson defined on paper."},{"Title":"Understanding Thomas Jefferson","review":"Halliday is purely interested in the man's sexual behavior and his romantic exploits. Contrary to some of the quotes about the book, I did not feel like it allowed me to get to know Jefferson better. There is practically no mention of his public life and accomplishments. Halliday expends tremendous energy on criticisizing other historians for their conclusions, which becomes very cumbersome and boring."},{"Title":"Understanding Thomas Jefferson","review":"Written shortly after DNA testing seemed to \\"prove\\" Thomas Jefferson fathered at least one (possibly all 6) of slave Sally Hemings's children, Halliday has sex on the brain. Purporting to be about all aspects of Jefferson's personality, Halliday keeps coming back to the Hemings thing over and over. Obviously intended for a popular audience, the book seems shallow and unconvincing. There is no doubt that Jefferson was an enigma, a contradiction in many things (one who could, for example, espouse that \\"all men are created equal,\\" but declare that blacks were inferior and should not intermingle with whites), which Halliday admits, but Halliday seems fuzzy and speculative on issues of Jefferson's religious beliefs and \\"Romantic\\" (capital R) impulses. Also many of Halliday's judgments seem tempered by 20th-century principles and prejudices that he then levels against Jefferson's 17th-century background. He is critical of past Jefferson scholars (Dumas Malone, Merrill Peterson, and Joseph Ellis) as being too determined to defend their hero Jefferson (especially against the Hemings charge), but he nowhere shows the same insights and scholarly perceptions as these biographers. Disappointing, all in all."},{"Title":"Understanding Thomas Jefferson","review":"For fifty years I've read extensively about Jefferson,and to understand him, about the history of his time, and about his contemporaries.

I cannot recommend it highly enough."},{"Title":"Understanding Thomas Jefferson","review":"How curious that almost 200 years after the events, we remain fascinated by the inner life of our third president, Thomas Jefferson! The strength of the vivid arguments for and against the evidence of his long love affair with Sally Hemings demonstrates more about our crabbed turn-of-the-century mores than it reveals about Jefferson the man. This book is flawed: it is breezy, casual in its research, and narrowly focussed. However as a portrait of Jefferson as the sensual intermingling of intellect, philosophy, and emotion it is first-rate and to be admired. Jefferson, through his relationship with Sally, found his humanity, a gritty reality that necessarily was contradictory, complex, and unresolved. When I picked up Halliday's book in the history shelves I found near it a wonderful picture essay on &quot;Jefferson's Children&quot; showing the gorgeous physical diversity of his descendants, spanning the entire color spectrum of America. These two books together suggest what is most profound about the story of Jefferson and Sally: in some intimate, almost unacceptable manner, they are indeed the splendid ancestors of what is distinctively American about our nation."},{"Title":"Understanding Thomas Jefferson","review":"Do not take this book seriously.

That's his plan from the moment she arrives in town. Unfortunately, he didn't plan to be so drawn to her. He didn't plan to get as caught up in her quest as she was nor did he expect to fall in love with her. The chemistry between these characters is so real, you can feel the heat right through the pages. And just as real is the chilling tingle that runs up your spine as the fifteen-year-old mystery begins to unravel.

If that was the case one could almost excuse the sappy story and hope she did better next time around. Not for me. Buy a used one - don't pay full price."},{"Title":"Prince of Darkness, and other stories","review":"These ten stories were first published in 1947. They reflect Powers, Midwestern-born and bred, as intrigued by the possibilities of writing about Catholic priests. This slim volume treats as well as what then was called the \\"race problem\\" with contemporary African American tensions; baseball; \\"The Old Bird\\" where a middle-aged man looking for work during war when he knows it's the only reason he could find the menial temp job he must accept, and a nuanced story, \\"Renner,\\" about refugees and anti-Semitism. As a Catholic Worker who had been jailed for his opposition to WW2, Powers possessed the moral strength of convictions rooted in signs of contradiction. He also peered about with an unsparing eye for dissembling, and called his fellow Americans to task for it. Yet he remained free of sanctimony, no mean feat, and counted himself culpable too.No wonder that Thomas Merton admired him; Powers went on with only twenty more stories over a long career. (Born 1917, he began publishing stories in the mid-1940s; he died in 1999). A \\"writer's writer\\" who refused to glad-hand or cater to the mass market, his fiction in the post-Vatican II age failed to keep the attention of a fickle readership, but in retrospect his questioning of the insularity of a Babbitry within the separatist mentality endemic to the Catholic Church in the middle of the century may have hastened its own undoing! Powers had enduring ties with those in the Church agitating for social reform and relevant liturgies. His concerns may be muted in his art, but they resonate for an attentive audience today.The best stories here probe gently but relentlessly how moral dilemmas unfold within a superficially trivial job or mundane career, often one in a rectory or chancery. This concentration enriches the collections \\"The Presence of Grace (1956) & \\"Look How the Fish Live, expanding the themes of his early stories. and his novels \\"Morte d'Urban\\" (1962, winner of the National Book Award) and \\"Wheat That Springeth Green\\" (1988) of which build on the promise first shown here, lean towards mordantly tragi-comic scrutiny of clerical life in unnamed Middle America.His thirty stories have been collected, with no additions, as \\"The Stories of J.F. Powers\\" in 2001 by New York Review Press in a handsome edition, as well as the two novels each reissued. Painstakingly crafted, the lesser stories in \\"Prince\\" about racial tensions date themselves, however, compared to five clerical stories. \\"The Lord's Day\\" examines tensions between a domineering pastor and a convent full of cowed sisters. \\"The Valiant Woman\\" looks at a meddling housekeeper from a priest's perspective, as they are doomed to live together but remain vastly apart in their curious intimacy. \\"The Forks\\" poses a moral dilemma for an upright if uptight curate under a pastor's annoying but worldly-wise readiness to compromise one Gospel truth for another just as compelling. \\"Lions, Hearts, Leaping Does\\" offers a heartbreakingly vivid if uncharacteristically lyrical account of a dying friar's last days. It ends with an epiphany equal to any in one of Power's inspirations along with Hemingway and Faulkner, James Joyce's \\"Dubliners,\\" A no less dramatic final line less ambiguously and more chillingly concluded the longer narrative of a restive associate pastor wanting a promotion in \\"The Prince of Darkness.\\" This story prepares in retrospect for the fictional dioceses of Great Plains and the wonderfully apropos Ostengothenberg in the later work of Powers.While unfairly consigned today to a mid-20c Catholic ghetto of once respected writers, Powers need not be read only by those interested in religious themes in American fiction. His assured style pares down what he ruefully and slightly satirically often observes while allowing a tenderness and humanity to filter in, akin to stories today of a superficially far different author, George Saunders. Like Saunders, Powers listens to everyday Americans off the beaten track, in nondescript suburbs and featureless tracts, and makes them as worthy of compassion and dignity as any hero of a revered epic."},{"Title":"Prince of Darkness, and other stories","review":"I bought this book around 20 years ago and finally got around to reading it.It was about time.Powers had the dubious distinction of being a writers writer.That is ,writers read him while the general public largely ignored him.He was respected by Saul Bellow and there are a couple of letters to him in the recently published collection of Bellows letters.The introduction to this volume is by Mary Gordon and it reminds me of why I once liked her.She can be a good critic when she restrains her polemical instincts.Some of the stories here are not all that distinguished.I found RENNER,THE OLD BIRD and THE LORD'S DAY to be little more than competent character sketches.However, LIONS,HARTS,LEAPING DOES is a great story.Although I'm not sure I can say what it is \\"about\\".An old priest is dying and he interacts with a none too bright monk who he has long known.This interaction is both moving and intellectually engaging.THE TROUBLE,THE FORKS and PRINCE OF DARKNESS are almost as good.Powers primary focus is American , largely Midwestern ,Catholic life in the mid 20th century.It's a bygone world but Powers observations are by no means dated.He casts an unsparing but I think understanding eye on the foibles of people trying to lead lives in conformance with a moral code. Without necessarily knowing it, they aim to live life deliberately as opposed to living lives of quiet desperation.In their struggles Powers characters can be comical but even the mediocre are trying ,which gives them a dignity and grace they would otherwise lack."},{"Title":"Computers and Thought","review":"This book is to the field of Artificial Intelligence what Darwin's Origin of the Species was to the idea of evolution.

It has a new preface by Feigenbaum with help from Feldman that gives the history of the book. This is the first computer book I ever bought (after McCraken's Fortran manual). I gave it away in about 1980 and have regretted ever since not still having it on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"Computers and Thought","review":"It looks like Alan Mathison Turing's suggestion stands the test of time: come up with a program that apes a child's mind and then put the computer through school. That may be what it takes to bring COMPUTERS AND THOUGHT together in the first real thinking machine. Proving theorems is good training in problem solving, which we learn along with verbal training, concept formulation, decision making under uncertainty, and social behavior. The first high order artificial intelligence, the logic theorist, finds proofs for theorems but gets into trouble when answers are beyond rote recalling of the table of integrals. We pull in intuition, transformations and tricks beyond elementary calculus, but the computer problem solves according to the way it was designed. So if computers could be designed to learn from routines, they would recognize patterns in proofsearch procedure and then strategize to repeat the patterns in later proofs. At the last page I felt energized from having gotten through such a challenging, excellently organized, and fascinating book. Editors Edward A Feigenbaum and Julian Feldman make a major contribution to information on artificial intelligence. So their book fits in with George Dyson's DARWIN AMONG THE MACHINES, Stan Franklin's ARTIFICIAL MINDS, David Freedman's BRAINMAKERS, John Haugeland's ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, or Clifford A Pickover's COMPUTERS AND THE IMAGINATION."},{"Title":"Stories of champions;: Baseball Hall of Fame","review":"Not much I can say about this book.

Then there are a few pictures for each player. Finally, there is a statistical chart for each individual, as well. And that's it.I give it a 5 because of the history I share with this book. But it's sorely antiquated.

He was probably born in A.D. 69--the famous 'year of four Emperors'--when his father, a Roman knight, served as a colonel in a regular legion and took part in the Battle of Baetricum.Suetonius became a scribe and noted secretary to the military set, eventually ending up in the service of Hadrian, who was emperor from A.D. 117-138. He was dismissed for 'indiscreet behaviour' with Hadrian's empress, Sabina, but not before doing sufficient research to complete many books of a historical nature. His attempts at philosophy were much less well received, and most of his history has been overlooked by all but classical scholars, but this work, 'The Twelve Caesars' has held the imagination of more than just the scholarly set since it was first written.Suetonius had the good fortune of speaking to eyewitnesses from the time of the early Caesars. Much of his information about Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, and Nero in fact comes from those who observed and/or participated in their lives. Suetonius is in many ways more of a reporter than an historian--he would record conflicting statements without worrying about the reconciliation (this set him apart from Tacitus and other classical historians who tried to find a consistency in stories and facts.Suetonius has been described as the tabloid journalist of ancient Rome, because not only did he not appear to check facts (which in fact is not true--he did check, he just didn't try to smooth over the conflicting facts), but he choose to concentrate on the private lives, motivations and personality quirks of his subjects rather than their grand plans, policies and military/political victories. Thus, many details of the lurid scene appear. Suetonius, and this volume in particular, formed much of the basis for Robert Graves as he wrote 'I, Claudius' and 'Claudius the God', which in turn pulled up the popularity of Suetonius in this generation.Suetonius had first hand knowledge of many of the Caesars who followed the Claudians, and ready access to the archives of the imperial family and the Senate, given his imperial posting.This translation is not intended to be a faithful rendering of the language (which might well result in a stilted English construct) but rather a faithful account of the stories Suetonius tells. Graves has taken the liberty of changing monetary, date, and technical terms into standard English measurements of close kinship of meaning.For the record, the twelve Caesars, about whom Suetonius writes, are:+ Julius Caesar+ Augustus+ Tiberius+ Gaius Caligula+ Claudius+ Nero+ Galba+ Otho+ Vitellius+ Vespasian+ Titus+ DomitianSuetonius held nothing back in writing about the personal habits of the emperors and their families, nor did he hold back in his moral judgement of them. Of Tiberius, for instance, he wrote that Tiberius did so many other wicked deeds under the pretext of reforming public morals--but in reality to gratify his lust for seeing people suffer--that many satires were written against the evils of the day, incidentally expressing gloomy fears about the future.... At first Tiberius dismissed these verses as the work of bilious malcontents who were impatient with his reforms and did not really mean what they said. He would remark: 'Let them hate me, so long as they fear me!' But, as time went on, his conduct justified every line they had written.Graves' edition of Suetonius is available under many covers, from hard-back study editions to Penguin paperbacks, including a wonderful, finely printed edition by the Folio Society. Take a step back into the seemier side of ancient Rome, the side most history courses overlook in favour of more traditional historical events, and hie thee to the bookstore for this work."},{"Title":"Freezing Tillie: An Alliance of Strangers","review":"This is the funniest book I have ever read.

I can't recommend this book enough."},{"Title":"Freezing Tillie: An Alliance of Strangers","review":"Not since John Kennedy Toole's \\"Confederacy of Dunces\\" have I read a book that I consider to be actually funny! Gary Barnes lets his comic imagination run rampant in this story about Alf and his octogenarian wife, Tillie, who is not so gradually losing her body organs to cancer. He does not want to lose her at such a tender age and so enlists the aid of the miracle workers at the \\"Institute of Igloology\\" where she will be tenderly cared for while in a state of \\"suspendered aviation\\". Little does he know that the Institute is the latest hare-brained concept of Sammy, a taxi driver and slayer of the English language, and Barney, an auto mechanic who longs to save enough money to buy his own garage. Barney's wife has left him (but not his furniture) simply because he tried to drown her in his Australian Monster Wriggler Worm Farm trough. Barney is now living alone in his basement, sleeping on a recycled backseat of an old Cadillac. He has it all: Twinkies, beer, cigarettes and an empty refrigerator. What better conditiions for storing the newly, or nearly, deceased until such time as a \\"cure\\" can be found. Of course, not everyone in this town is as urbane, sophisticated and farseeing as Sammy and Barney. Among other characters you wouldn't want to live anywhere near but can't read enough about, is Miss Nicholas, a third grade teacher who thinks education can be battered into children with a hickory paddle, the same paddle she has used on three generations of students. She writes daily to her future, unknown biographer who will finally and deservedly bring Miss N's millions of chapters of glorious prose on the subject of being an educator to the attention of the waiting world. What the future does hold for her is not what she, nor any rational person, could possibly expect. It is, however, perfect justice in an imperfect world! I was a little hesitant when I heard of this book. I was afraid it would be a poor attempt at recreating Toole's \\"Ignatius\\". How wrong I was! I started reading this book by flashlight in a tent in my backyard and finished it while undergoing an extremely disgusting medical procedure. To say \\"I coudn't put it down\\" is an understatement.

I have no stake in this book other than to know that I can pick it up when I need a laugh! Trust me! The check is NOT in the mail, but this is a book that will have you laughing out loud by the third page and reading bits to the neighbors and total strangers just to be able to share the joy!

One remembers the level of intelligence some nameless spin doctor had with the Republican mistake of having Pat &quot;Attila&quot; Buchanan give his speech/declaration of intolerance for free thinking at the the Republican National Convention.

Go to the local library and check it out (as in, browse it while in the library)..."},{"Title":"Al Franken Is a Buck-Toothed Moron: And Other Observations","review":"While Franken's books use facts to illustrate their points, this book relies on the author's constant barrage of insults and subjective attacks. If you want to read a baseless war on the left, this book is for you. If you enjoy comedic writing, satire, or political banter, avoid this at all costs. Don't waste your time. It's a rant from start to finish, and with nothing to even remotely back up the arguments, it's more like a bad mood than a good book."},{"Title":"Al Franken Is a Buck-Toothed Moron: And Other Observations","review":"You think George W. Bush calling himself &quot;bold and decisive&quot; is funny? Republicans have always been renowned for their biting satirical skills (think of Gordon Liddy and Put Buchanan), but this is perhaps the finest example of the fact that Republicans can do more than speak at racist, anti-Catholic colleges and triple the national debt in eight years ('81-'89)--they are also sans peer as political satirists. With this book, &quot;J.P. Mauro&quot; demonstrates that someone can actually write three hundred pages worth of &quot;jokes,&quot; and still fail to include one that is actually funny. No small feat. This book is a truly pathetic attempt to counter Al Franken's brilliant, hilarious &quot;Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot&quot; (perhaps the most accurately titled book of the '90s) with some right-wing barbs.

Mauro's book will keep you chuckling from beginning to end. He satirically attacks such liberals as Al Franken, Bill and Hillary Clinton, Barney Frank, Jesse Jackson, the Hollywood elite, left-wing journalists, and anyone else who gets in his way. He starts off by explaining how he became a conservative and how he disagrees with its ideologies. He criticizes the narrow-minded, bleeding-heart mentality of liberalism, the hypocritical, elitist attitude of many modern liberals, and the backward agenda of many liberal organizations like PETA .... In all, Mauro generally gives his brash opinions of his views and discredits overblown liberalism.The author also offers a chapter on why he is a Republican. It is a humorous, indirect attack on liberalism because Mauro talks about regular events in a typical day that seem like anyone does, but when he says it, it seems like proud conservatism. His eggs and meat for breakfast, his large car, his attending a regular barbershop for a haircut, and his praying at the end of the day. Many liberals, according to Mauro, would not want anything to do with these activities or events.Overall, Mauro succeeds in his attempt to refute Al Franken's book and absent-mindedness of modern liberals. Throughout the book, I was laughing at the many observations Mauro makes. The index is hilarious. His references to Franken in the index are a bit childish, but really made me laugh. For a very funny payback to Al Franken and his liberal pals, J.P. Mauro's book can open your eyes while giving you a good laugh."},{"Title":"Al Franken Is a Buck-Toothed Moron: And Other Observations","review":"I laughed...It's a bit dated (bought this book as a remainder), but it's still one of the funniest and accurate things I've read in a long time.

The only fact that Franken gets consistently right is the spelling of his name, and I have to assume he had help with that. After all I've seen him on TV and heard his babble on the radio, and he doesn't sound bright enough to handle spelling as complicated as his name: Al. The scary thing is that is then followed with hundreds of droning pages of distortions, lies, and general all around dopiness.Anyone illiterate and uninformed enough to consider Frankens' tombs to be remotely funny should seek psychiatric help, unless lies, distortions, and specious \\"referencing\\" are your idea of clever humor.This book certainly could be better, but those who are not humor challenged (e.g., hard core liberals and associated nitwits) will get a some laughs. It is a welcome antidote to the Franken garbage, though my own forthcoming book will be better researched, footnoted, and a lot funnier.I mean think about it, can you imagine an easier targt for satire than Al Franken? Well maybe Michael Moore, but his twaddle is so transparent that I find it hard to believe that any semi-literate student of politics, history, or basic logic isn't disgusted within the first few pages of his compiliations of left-wing fantasies.It's nice to see a conservative with a sense of humor here. My own leanings are more libertarian, but the left wing has gone off the deep end with its humorless inaccurate hatchet jobs.But now that I think about it, perhaps that is what they consider humor - getting basic facts, research, and analysis SO wrong that it is laughable.Pick this up for a nice though hardly comprehensive anti-dote to the Franken/Moore canards. The best anti-dote to them is actually knowing what you are talking about, but that would take a bit of reading, perhaps a touch of logic, and a minimal ability to reason coherently! None of which is evident in Franken or Moore's stuff.Delightfully there are flashes of documented material with humorous insights here, though I would have preferred to see such maintained throughout the whole book. But how often does that happen anymore?"},{"Title":"Al Franken Is a Buck-Toothed Moron: And Other Observations","review":"At least it's funny.

It's also surprisingly accurate -- I can't believe it wasn't a bigger deal when it came out (the Jesse Jackson stuff alone is scarily prescient). Definitely worth the few bucks I paid.

I bursted with laughter when I read the title ( obviously a faux paus in a library) and haven't stopped laughing since. I wish I had known about this book sooner.Another reviewer on Amazon stated that the book was \\"dated\\" but it is more accurate to say that Mauro's book is ahead of its time. Published in 1996, it is a precursor to Bernard Goldberg's \\"Biased\\"; in fact Goldberg mimics most of Mauro's observations on liberal bias in the media and uses the same data as Mauro to support his assertions.I have let several co-workers read just the first chapter and they too laughed out loud. Anyone on this webpage that gave \\"Al Franken is a Buck-Toothed Moron\\" less than five stars is probably eating a \\"not-dog\\" with Barbara Steisand at this very moment or out protesting the war against Iraq.You owe to yourself to read this book.

No, this is just an everyday conservative Republican lawyer (or is it two everyday conservative Republican lawyers?) doing his best to add fuel to the already burning-out-of-control fires of conservative ire over how there are too many liberals in America today. It's telling, for instance, that Mauro doesn't even bother to devote as much time to defending Limbaugh as Franken does to dissecting Limbaugh. Mauro appears to be more interested in comparing the person Franken was in his years on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; to the person he is today as a result of writing the Limbaugh book.To give Mauro credit, he does do a great job of cutting PETA up like a buzz saw and pointing out how tiresome some of Franken's most repetitive jokes can be, case in point: the one about former Senator Alphonse D'Amato. At least those parts are funny."},{"Title":"Al Franken Is a Buck-Toothed Moron: And Other Observations","review":"Despite the clever manipulations exercised upon the photo at the front of this book's jacket, I do not believe that Al Franken actually has buck teeth. At least, it is not anything that I have ever noticed before. This error, regrettably, tended rather to taint the entire book for me, so forgive me if my observations fail to accord with your own.Al Franken is a funny guy. Now, it has been said by some that actors, musicians, or funny men should just spend their days engaging solely in the practice of their own vocations for which their own, specialized gifts and training (i.e. acting, singing, being funny) have adequately prepared them. They should likewise spare the rest of us from having to listen to their political views. After all, they say, these people are not professional, licensed, or board-certified politicians and thus should not venture into such fields that their own professional degrees or training (i.e. Acting, Comedy) have not properly prepared them (as opposed to, for example, the professional study of Law, Political Science, or Country Music). Concerns of this sort are, as often as not, voiced by pundits (whose own unique place in society exempts them from having to be qualified for anything). Often overlooked by these pundits, however, are the multitudes of non-comedians who seek to be funny--seek even to be regarded as funny men--though they clearly do not possess the natural ability, training, or board certifications to lawfully do so.J. P. Mauro is not a funny guy. Unfortunately, there is no cure for this. In AL FRANKEN IS A BUCK-TOOTHED MORON, Mauro's cleverest bit is the title itself, albeit this cleverness is borrowed from Al Franken himself. What could have been a good idea is ultimately a failure. For a book like this to succeed, it needs to depend upon humor which is sadly lackluster in this attempt. Conservatives should purchase this book and leave it on their coffee table unread. Their friends will appreciate the joke, but then again, they hardly need a reminder of their own righteousness.Jeremy W.

That degree of ineptitude is on display throughout every unfortunate page of this crummy excuse for a book.I would sooner pay money to NOT read this book than to read it. It's so not funny, it's sad.

As a Republican I was insulted when after reading Mauro's attempt at literature, I found myself asking one question: Since when did liberals get a higher education than a member of the GOP? And why does Mauro choose to advertise this fact to the public? With weak insults to JFK and a basis for wit, Mauro starts up a humorous story line but can't seem to shift out of neutral. A loyalty to the GOP may well be the only reason to even contemplate reading this book, and still, that loyalty must be incredibly strong, like that of a puppy to its master.

Mauro, a conservative who apparently was so rattled and upset over a COMEDIAN'S book on the conservative icon Limbaugh, that he exposes the conservative side of \\"touchiness\\" by writing this weak, poorly thought out knockoff of Franken's humorous and interesting book. Obviously, conservatives consider any sort of investigation or analysis of Limbaugh to be \\"off limits\\" (how American!), and Mauro displays his lack of wit and integrity throughout this book.

I was hoping for a good laugh.The problem I have is that this is completely unoriginal and tries to mimic Franken's style too much. Satire requires a subtlety that Mauro fails to deliver. What makes it bad is that it just comes across as an attack and what is worse is that it's just not funny.

I asked a question in a civil tone about the role of the Democrat's in the federal deficits in the 1980's. He wrote me back a totally flame email, ignoring the question and instead, attacking my motives, saying I had no integrity and basically saying I'm a liar. It was completely juvenile.In a subsequent email, he did apologize, but went on to admit that he writes reviews about politics simply to annoy those he disagrees with. He also expressed what amounted to a visceral hate of those he disagreed. Along with this is his habit of comparing anybody who disagrees with him to Nazis, fascists and racists.

It covers westward expansion during the years 1830-1860.

The book speaks about what it means to be an authentic human being through a parable about a special kitten who must find his way in the world on his own and triumphs over loss, disappointment, and exploitation to find self-realization. \\"'Sing your own song,' said the River, 'sing well.'\\" It is never too late to sing your own song, if your heart will let you. How the cat learned to do this is worth learning at any age. Now this is how I interpret what goes on in the story in today's vocabulary, not how the author puts it, but my point is the book is just as relevant today as when originally written. The experiences of this cat will hit home with all too many people today, both children and adults. The book is beautifully written by Catherine Coblentz, a lady who by the way spearheaded the establishment of the Cleveland Park branch of the D.C. Library, where there are etched glass drawings from the book.

The reading level is about 5-7th grade, not for babies or toddlers. The plot of the book is based on a number of items in the Metropolitan Museum of Art which all hale from a town in Vermont called Castleton. One of them is hand-woven carpet with a blue cat depicted on it. Another is a pewter teapot. Around these artifacts and the small amounts of information that could be gleaned on their history, the author has built a charming tale of a blue kitten in search of a home. Since he was born under a blue moon, the kitten can only find a home and a hearth in the house of a human who knows (or can be taught) the River's Song. The River's Song is the Song of Creation, of the making of beautiful things. The kitten encounters many inhabitants of Castletown in his quest and finds them falling under the dark spell of Arunah Hyde, whose whole interest is speed and wealth. The kitten himself nearly falls under the same spell, but escapes at the last minute. His quest seems doomed to fail, however, until he crosses the path of a lonely, ugly girl. This is a book that does not deserve to be out of print. It could easily be used in the classroom as a lesson in early American culture and history, but is also a just a very enjoyable and moving read."},{"Title":"The blue cat of Castle Town","review":"I read this book when I was eight and it was one of my favorites--something magical and yet so real about this blue cat and its quest.

I would credit it as one of the influences in my choosing writing children's books as a career. Over 60 published books later, I am stilll happily trying to sing my own song.

It is based on historical information which gives additional interest."},{"Title":"The blue cat of Castle Town","review":"Set in a kinder, gentler Vermont this quiet charmer by Coblentz permits readers to relax and savor the humble pleasures of a sleepy village through which a river meanders--a town where craftsmen take true pride in the creation of works of beauty. But then rich resident Arunah Hyde decides to make Castleton the center of the universe, with his fast coaches and dreams of even faster trains. Speed is all that matters as he insidiously weaves his Dark Spell--demanding faster work and shoddy standards, for he is obsessed with Time and cares naught for things of lasting beauty.Inspired by a visit to a NY Art Museum the author was impressed by a tapestry which included a blue cat in one of the hand-woven squares. While accompanying her husband on an extended business trip to Castleton, she decided to research the local folklore surrounding a blue cat, whose almost invisible trail included works of handcraft admired to this day. A church pulpit and a hand woven linen table cloth are among its treasures.A blue kitten is born in a fragrant field by the river, and to his mother's dismay, and against her strict warning, begins to listen to its song--unable to resist; yes, destined to learn its song. No normal life will this kitten with only three black hairs on its tail live out, for he must teach the river's song to one mortal before he may find his home and hearth. Not an easy task when Arunah Hyde is spreading the dark spell throughout the town; besides, who will listen to the plaintive mewing of an orphan cat? Will the trusting Blue Cat be able to resist the clever trap set by Arunah--who has evil designs on him?You too can seek and enjoy the Bright Enchantment of this storybook village, if you visit this charming town in September. Then the locals reenact the tale on a delightful Blue Cat Tour, by a uniformed guide, during which the story comes alive for readers and all cat lovers. This has remained one of my favorite childhood books for many decades and may secretly have whispered to me that I should move to Vermont some day."},{"Title":"The Last Cattle Drive: 30th Anniversary Edition","review":"At last, a fiction set in Kansas that gets the state out of the old &quot;Wizard of Oz&quot; trap! I grew up in the Hays area and moved to Lawrence several years ago, so it was sheer delight to see places I've always been familiar with, e.g. Betty's Cafe in Gorham, Dirty Dan's, Brookville Hotel, gain notice in popular fiction. This book captures so well the contrast between eastern and western Kansas -- the snobs versus the hicks, the suburbs of Johnson County against the flat horizon of Gorham, the rushed noise of mechanized diesel, such a part of the industrialized world, against the solitude and stillness of the High Plains. The people around the Hays area whom Day describes are based on real folks, and in some cases ARE real folks, though I think he exaggerates their crudity and profanity excessively. I recall working for ranchers and farmers who remind me a lot of Spangler Tukle. And the main character's clash with a film crew is based on the trouble that the crew of &quot;Paper Moon&quot; had with locals when they shot that movie in northwest Kansas in the early 1970s. As the cattle drive commences and works its way toward Kansas City, the reader is swept along the plains landscape adjoining I-70, beautiful little spots that most tourists miss as they set their cruise controls, race through the state, and see only enough to confirm their prejudice of Kansas as a flat, character-less place. The ending seems to synthesize the two worlds of country and city, with cowboys driving their herd into the KC stockyards over expressways and interchanges, and city people lining the route to welcome them as heroes. To my knowledge, no such cattle drive ever took place, and I suspect the residents of KC, Missouri would react more with horror than with the fanfare presented here to see tons of hoofed beef clopping down their streets. But this book, after all, is fiction. Thanks, Prof. Day, for what hopefully will become an enduring classic on twentieth-century Kansas and Kansas people."},{"Title":"The Last Cattle Drive: 30th Anniversary Edition","review":"I originally purchased this book because it was required reading for a college course.

While a work of fiction, Day's story considers how reality has been altered from the days of the early frontier to a more modern landscape. The novel, set in 1970s Kansas recounts the invigorating and often hilarious tale of a dynamic cast of characters who decided to organize one last cattle drive from Turkle Ranch near Hays, Kansas to the stockyards in Kansas City, Kansas. Working through the hilarity, the difference between medicinal sex and indiscriminate screwing, a cat which may or may not have rabies, the annoyance of Hollywood types, lame heifers, and difficult police officers, we find that Day's book is telling us another, even more important story: life in Kansas, while similar to its Homestead Years, Railroad Booms, and now renowned cattle drives from Texas, has changed immensely in a variety of ways. This book is about those changes and how Kansas has not just coped with but grown into them.If you have a few hours and a few dollars, the Last Cattle Drive will not disappoint in the end."},{"Title":"The Last Cattle Drive: 30th Anniversary Edition","review":"This is an excellent book if your from anywhere near Hays Kansas and the surrounding area.

I wouldn't have felt so alone.I've lived in kansas most of my life, and the character sketches Day makes of his book people -- especially Spangler and Opal Tukle, and Jed, and the farmers and ranchers that they meet along the way to Kansas City -- are so well formed! And funny! And the depictions of Kansas as being far away from real civilization are dead on, too -- like the non-degreed teachers at the protagonist's school just laughing and throwing away the new dictum from the state, saying that all teachers have to be degreed and certified.

Spandler Tukle is a character, the likes of which we have all met at one time or another in our lives. The reader will enjoy the journey through modern day Kansas under some old-time conditions.

One gets a profound sense of the bifurcation of the Kansas Plains to the industrial machinations of city life. However, if one is looking for literature I recommend looking elsewhere. Even though Cattle Drive is a delightful little tale it leaves the reader with a bad taste in his or her mouth. Why? There is an implicit urge present in the story that verges on Egotism of the highest sort where it is obvious the author struggles not with narrative but his own fascination at his ability to type words. Moreover, the novel would work better if the voice were autodiegetic instead of didactic. If you found that last sentence furstrating don't read the book. Incidently I do recommend the movie City Slickers with Billy Crystal, a tour de force of cinematic comedy. Crystal got it right. Day didn't.

Although I am a great fan of Linda Chaikin and have read all her books except one series, I must say that this was a slight disappointment. Though, as ever, the characters are intriguing and never what they seem, keeping you on edge throughout the story, the plot takes a great deal of time developing. A man is revealed as murdered in the first chapter, but it isn't until six or seven chapters later that anything of great significance occurs, besides introducing the second main character, British officer Bret Holden. Too much time is spent on trivial dialogue and not the matter at hand-the solving of a murder, the intreagues behind the Great War, and the turmoil of Wescott as she is torn between two lovers. Neither do you find yourself becoming involved in the story, but instead watching dispassionately as the characters move slowly from one event to the next, and wondering if something interesting will happen before Christmas holiday."},{"Title":"Arabian Winds (Egypt Trilogy #1)","review":"WOW!

Overall, very enjoyable and reader fridenly. The only reason I didn't rate it higher than I did is that, due to its rapid movement of plot and action, Voltaire does not give us quite enough philosophical miles to the gallon.

Voltaire has here written a gem of a story from the unpromising material of cynicism and farce. Don't try this at home -- apart from genius, it will fall flat -- but Candide ripples with wit.Leibnetz, it is true, is hardly a household name today. But I expect Candide was also meant to be a sword-thrust into the soft underbelly of theism, the \\"Problem of Pain.\\" While orthodox Christians do not claim this to be the \\"best of all possible worlds\\" (rather, a fallen one), the chaotic and apparently senseless troubles in it seem to a lot of us, too, to be the best argument against our faith. Voltaire twists the knife well. I was glad to see that though he excels, and delights, in mockery, the story functions ultimately as what may be an honest question, like that of Job or of Solomon. (In fact, ironically, the book Candide most reminds me of is Ecclesiastes.)In one regard, at least, Candide is less true to life than the Biblical point of view, however. Thousands die here, but no one is begotten. The insanity of life is celebrated to the full, but its beauty and wonder are not squarely faced. The one-sidedness of Voltaire's approach lessens it as a work of philosophy, in my opinion. I couldn't help but reflect that many in the 20th Century went into the hell-holes of communist prisons, where every horror Candide and his friends experienced occurred, and more (the atheists of the 20th Century were also, in their own ways, ingenious), yet emerged with a strong belief in God. (Even some, like Solzhenitsyn, who went in as atheists.) Why is that? Philosophy, it seems to me, needs to face all sides of a question. This Voltaire hardly pretends to do: the book is a question, not an answer. But as satire on premature answers, it sizzles.If all Voltaire's books contain cannabalism, libel, bestiality, and philosophical arguments based on slapstick humor, I can hardly blame the authorities for burning them. Being something of a Puritan myself, I docked Voltaire a star. Let that be a lesson.The introduction by Andre Maurois is excellent.author, Jesus and the Religions of Man"},{"Title":"Candide (Franklin Library)","review":"Though, in my humble opinion, Voltaire is not one of history's greatest philosophers, &quot;Candide&quot; is indeed one of history's greatest works of philosophy. It is also one of the greatest satires ever written. I believe that even Leibnitz would have found something eminently enjoyable in this work."},{"Title":"Candide (Franklin Library)","review":"Candide is far from being ennervated by time. In fact, it may be more relevant now than at any time since Voltaire wrote it in the mid-1700s.What happens to Candide, Pangloss and all the other main characters in the novel is cruelly absurd. Real life itself, as we can all testify from personal experience, is often just as capricious, nonsensical and painful as the landscape through which Candide moves.And make no mistake -- this is a novel of movement: movement about the globe, movement up and down the social ladder, movement toward utopia and away, movement toward wisdom hard-won through experience. Voltaire has taken a common-place 16th Century literary form, the picaresque novel, and breathed new life into it. His aim is far higher than the genre's typical morality. In traditional picaresque novels, the hero -- the &quot;picaro&quot; (the genre is Spanish in origin)-- learns through a series of misadventures his place in the grand scheme of things, usually on the underbelly of the society in which he lives.Candide and Company range far and wide through a myriad of societies, including an Andean utopia, finding no permanent place. Only when they settle on the Propontus in Turkey and settle down as a family, not of blood ties, but of mutual suffering and experience, do they create a space for themselves.The novel's oft-quoted ending, which has Candide espousing the virtues of tending to one's own garden, is far more than a call to Protestant simplicity and self-denial. The garden Candide and his friends cultivate is a poor recreation of the original garden, the Garden of Eden. But it is theirs, won through misadventure, pain and suffering. Relentlessly pessimistic throughout the novel about the natural state of mankind, Voltaire hints at an optimism in the end, the possibility that the downtrodden can redeem themselves.This is a fun romp for high school readers and college undergrads will enjoy the overt sexual references scattered throughout. For their teachers, Candide offers the opportunity to show their students that we can all persevere and tend to our own gardens, if we can but recognize the claim of humanity we have upon each other. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Candide (Franklin Library)","review":"For what reason would the greastest tale of Franois-Marie Arouet (Voltaire) be considered one of the best books ever written? For answering such a question, I would have to waste the pages of a little essay, but if you want a short response, there it goes, whomever is not drowned on the best-seller trash of our comtemporary times will get the point: If thee think Candide's philosophical, historical and sociological analyses are as small as the book, thee haven't understood the story, or better saying, never really read it; If you just laugh at the sufferings of the characters, remember laughing is one of the best ways for showing much of the human misery, and so,realize about what you smiled at, if it was not at yourself. I won't write much more, READ the Candide and, as Italo Calvino said, have this &quot;moving picture of the velocity&quot; on your hands, a book destined for immortality, as his writer and maker, who once said: &quot;to write is to act&quot;.

Anyway,this was an interesting book that really made me think. I didnt find it so much as funny as sad at depicting the horrors of the world but it does so in such a light, outragous way.Some of the best parts are at the end, like when they go visit the rich man who doesnt enjoy anything.The plot is over the top and outragous but this is still one of the most realistic books Ive read. I found it kind of bleak and depressing but I also found it intriguing.Voltaire exaggerates everything in Candide, all of the misfortunes everyone has to go through are too horrible to be even realistic. At least I hope no ones had quite as bad time of it as candide. Even if you dont agree with Voltire and even if you share views with Dr. Pangloss you should still read this book.One final thing, dont mourn overmuch for any of the characters when they die, theyll turn up again later."},{"Title":"Candide (Franklin Library)","review":"Like any story that is written in an allegorical style, it serves the reader well to investigate the story of the writer as a person before trying to understanding the motivations of the person as a writer. (Clarence Darrow's short, unofficial biography is an excellent reference.) Suffice to say that any philosophy that can be applied and re-applied through history must be treated as relevant. Candide's story, a quest to be reunited with a woman who represents an idea more than a person, of human suffering, of enduring injustice, and of noble intention twisted to serve the basest defects of human character, could evoke similarities in a modern setting as easily as it was applied to the brutish realities of the 1700s. Read this story. Better yet, read several of Voltaire's stories (Zadig or Fate, Princess of Babylon, The White Bull, etc.,). Monsieur Voltaire was a hero to not only many of his French brothers and sisters, but was inspirational to several rebellious British subjects in the \\"New World\\", most notably Ben Franklin and Thomas Jefferson. The Age of Enlightenment owes perhaps more to this man and his spirit of personal freedoms, independent thought, and libertarian dogma, than any other thinker of his time."},{"Title":"Candide (Franklin Library)","review":"I'm not usually predisposed to the classics, but this is one I'd been meaning to read for quite a while, and it is relatively short.

Candide, albeit a short work, emanates incredible power. When first printed, Candide subsequently was banned by Louis XV for fear of rousing the proletariat. Upon reading Candide, one can, without doubt, ascertain why. Voltaire stresses resilience, realism, and an eschewal of blithe trust and optimism.For a short work, Candide provides more outrageously absurd events than one would deem possible. Voltaire's unremitting penchant for humorous and farcical satire makes this book an absolute necessity to read for anyone who possesses a keen mind and is up to the challenge of profound literature."},{"Title":"Candide (Franklin Library)","review":"Complete shock with mix of giggle and 3rd eye opened with depth of meaning. I have read this book at least 7 times: thoroughly. With short words, I give this book an enormous respect: Satiric, philosophical, historical and AWESOME.

I don't have much more to say but it is your choice. Afterall, this is one of the theme of the book. Destiny &amp; free will. Bravo!"},{"Title":"Candide (Franklin Library)","review":"Everyone will like this story for different reasons. It's easily read, and one can then toss out the phrase &quot;I, frequent reader of Voltaire, think...&quot;. Alternatively, one can read it AND think about it. How strikingly funny it is. How incredibly relevant it remains to this day. How possible it is to challenge blind optimism and yet not wallow in complete despair and self-pity. Above all, I found it to be a very accessible work of philosophy. Ahem. I mean, &quot;I, frequent reader of Voltaire, think it is a rather accessible work of philosophy...&quot;"},{"Title":"Candide (Franklin Library)","review":"While I must say that I would have never read this book on my own, and satire is really not my favorite genre, it was a fairly good book. It took a second read to appreciate the elements that Voltaire incorporates into every passage of the novel. There is literally nothing that isn't satirized in Candide. I found this book a very tedious and I did not enjoy the wild plot as Candide and his fellow friends travelled all across the world, never to escape sorrows. If you are reading it for surface content and plot I'm afraid you will be sorely disapointed. Enjoy the satire within it and you will be more likely to appreciate the novel more."},{"Title":"Candide (Franklin Library)","review":"This book is really a masterpiece. Once again Voltaire proved himself as a world class philosopher. It started with the &quot;everything is for the best of all world&quot; as Candide, the central role of this writing, taught by Dr. Pangloss, until he travelled around the world to find many contradictive things which influenced his way of thinking. It's set in the eighteenth century and deals with all the tragedies of it's time. Voltaire touches base with many historical accounts including the earthquakes of Lima and Lisbon. Candide is a naive, innocent, and optimistic sort of person. If you ever feel that life has treated you unfairly, then you have nothing to complain about if you compare yourself to poor Candide. Really give me an enlightenment"},{"Title":"Candide (Franklin Library)","review":"One of the funniest books ever written (if you don't mind historical references..)"},{"Title":"Candide (Franklin Library)","review":"I picked this book up at the bookshop near Ground Zero. And to my suprise it was not a heavy story that caused one anguish to read it. I thought the story was told in a quick straight forward way that was both fun and educational. I agree if one were to really take this book and ponder over the morals Voltaire tries to preach, then the book wouldn't have been as entertaining to me. Nice and lite read. I recommend it to anyone over the age of 18.I think I know why this book was not taught in many schools, it does have a hint of anti-Semitism."},{"Title":"Candide (Franklin Library)","review":"Ever since philosophers began thinking about the meaning of life, a favorite question has been \\"Why do bad things happen to good people?\\". In Voltaire's day, this issue was primarily pursued either from the perspective of faith (everything that happens is God's will and must be for Divine purpose) or of reason (What do these events mean to you, as you interpret them subjectively?). Infuriated by the reaction by some members of the church to a horrible loss of life from an earthquake in Lisbon, Voltaire wrote this hard-biting satire of the human condition to explore these questions.Before reading further, let me share a word of caution. This book is filled with human atrocities of the most gruesome sort. Anything that you can imagine could occur in war, an Inquisition, or during piracy happens in this book. If you find such matters distressing (as many will, and more should), this book will be unpleasant reading. You should find another book to read.The book begins as Candide is raised in the household of a minor noble family in Westphalia, where he is educated by Dr. Pangloss, a student of metaphysical questions. Pangloss believes that this is the best of all possible worlds and deeply ingrains that view into his pupil. Candide is buoyed by that thought as he encounters many setbacks in the course of the book as he travels through many parts of Europe, Turkey, and South America.All is well for Candide until he falls in love with the Baron's daughter and is caught kissing her hand by the Baron. The Baron immediately kicks Candide out of the castle (literally on the backside), and Candide's wanderings begin. Think of this as being like expulsion from the Garden of Eden for Adam. Soon the penniless Candide finds himself in the Bulgarian army, and receiving lots of beatings while he learns to drill.The story grows more far-fetched with each subsequent incident. To the casual reader, this exaggeration can seem unnecessary and annoying. It will remind you of the most extreme parts of Swift in Gulliver's Travels and Rabelais in Gargantua and Pantagruel. But subtly, Voltaire is using the exaggeration to lure the reader into making complacent judgments about complacency itself that Voltaire wants to challenge. The result is a deliciously ironical work that undermines complacency at a more fundamental level than I have seen done elsewhere. Basically, Candide challenges any view you have about complacency that is defined in terms of the world-view of those who are complacent.Significant changes of circumstances (good and ill) occur to all of the members of the Baron's household over the course of the story. Throughout, there is much comparing of who has had the worst luck, with much feeling sorry for oneself.That is the surface story. Voltaire is, however, a master of misdirection. Beneath the surface, Voltaire has another purpose for the book. He also wants to expose the reader to questioning the many bad habits that people have that make matters worse for everyone. The major themes of these undercurrents are (1) competing rather than to cooperating, (2) employing inhumane means to accomplish worldly (and many spiritual) ends, (3) following expected rules of behavior to show one's superiority over others that harm and degrade others, (4) focusing on money and power rather than creating rich human relationships, (5) hypocritical behavior, and (6) pursuing ends that society approves of rather than ends that please oneself.By the end of the story, the focus shifts again to a totally different question: How can humans achieve happiness? Then, you have to reassess what you thought about the book and what was going on in Voltaire's story. Many readers will choose to reread the book to better capture Voltaire's perspective on that final question, having been surprised by it.Candide is one of my favorite books because it treats important philosophical questions in such an unusual way. Such unaccustomed matching of treatment and subject matters leaves an indelible impression that normal philosophical arguments can never match. Voltaire also has an amazing imagination. Few could concoct such a story (even by using illegal substances to stimulate the subconscious mind). I constantly find myself wondering what he will come up with next. The story is so absurd that it penetrates the consciousness at a very fundamental level, almost like doing improvisation. In so doing, Voltaire taps into that feeling of \\"what else can happen?\\" that overcomes us when we are at our most pessimistic. So, gradually you will find yourself identifying with the story -- even though nothing like this could ever happen to you. Like a good horror story, you are also relieved that you can read about others' troubles and can put your own into perspective. This last point is the fundamental humanity of the story. You see what a wonderful thing a kind word, a meal, or a helping hand can be. That will probably inspire you to offer those empathic actions more often.After you have finished Candide, I suggest that you ask yourself where complacency about your life and circumstances is costing you and those you care about the potential for more health, happiness, peace, and prosperity. Then take Voltaire's solution, and look around you for those who enjoy the most of those four wonderful attributes. What do those people think and do differently from you?"},{"Title":"Candide (Franklin Library)","review":"It is probably fair to say that there is no book that is quite like Voltaire's 'Candide'. This is a venomous satire of the 'Optimistic' philosophy and outlook of enlightenment thinkers such as Leibniz and Alexander Pope. As such, it is served well by the unique combination of repeated brutality and a deft, light touch. If that last comment doesn't make sense, then you'll just have to READ THE BOOK.At a mere 144 pages (in this edition), this is a classic that is a breeze to read. As to the charge that this book is too &quot;violent&quot; or &quot;in bad taste&quot;, I would only ask you to remember that Voltaire was furious that learned members of a &quot;civilized&quot; society (like Leibniz, Pope, and even Rousseau)could claim that the apparent senseless violence and mayhem wrought by disasters, war, disease, man's cruelty, etc. was actually only a part of some 'greater good' - after all, God (being perfect) could not 'logically' created anything but the 'best of all possible' universes.Voltaire's touch is so light and understated that I defy anyone to write anything that contains a third of the violence in 'Candide' and still manages to read as breezily and somehow be genuinely funny.But dark satire must be funny - otherwise it lapses into pedantry.Read it - even if you do not like it, I guarantee you that it will disturb you and make you think.And for that, we can thank Voltaire."},{"Title":"Candide (Franklin Library)","review":"&quot;All is for the best...in the best of all possible worlds.&quot;Utopia generally conjures up images of beauty, brilliance and harmony. How is it possible to conceive of the violent and brutal happenings in Candide as &quot;the best of all possible worlds?&quot; Our world is clearly not perfect, so isn't it more logical to conclude that all is not for the best? At least not all of the time? Such are the questions raised in Voltaire's timeless masterpiece of satire, Candide.Candide tells the journey of a young man through the world and the realities he must face, deal with and eventually come to be defined by. During his ventures, Candide leaves behind the naive innocence of his childhood and assumes the status of an intelligent and distinguished man.Candide was born and grew up in the castle of the Baron of Thunder-ten-tronckh, in the land of Westphalia in Germany. Soon after his mentor, the philosopher, Dr. Pangloss introduces him to the idea of extreme optimism, Candide's adventures begin as he is banned from the kingdom for kissing the Baron's beautiful daughter, Lady Cunegund.As Candide travels through Germany, Holland, the New World and the remainder of Europe, he encounters trials and evils of every sort--war, hatred, betrayal, starvation, natural catastrophes of all kinds, in short, any and every evil to which man has ever fallen prey.In the course of his travails, however, one thing becomes outstandingly familiar to Candide; the parallels of events that denote the universality of evil.Finally, coming full circle, Candide settles down to cultivate his own garden and make the best of his own possible world.As with most satire, the characters in Candide exist for one unique purpose rather than being fully fleshed out. Dr. Pangloss is the most notable. Pangloss is not present in most of Candide's adventures but he does provide the theme underlying the whole of the book. He serves to sway Candide with his one, unrelenting optimistic outlook on life.The epitome of Pangloss's philosophical outlook, &quot;Everything is for the best,&quot; is assimilated by Candide very early in the story. Being young, sheltered and naive at the time, Candide proceeds to live his life according to this tenet. When faced with a problem he always asks himself what Pangloss would do or say in a similar situation.Candide, however, eventually learns to form his own opinions and concepts and thus the philosophical optimism of Dr. Pangloss is tested and challenged throughout the book.The &quot;Pangloss Effect&quot; is also demonstrated through Candide's experience in El Dorado, Voltaire's fictional utopia. Candide, traveling with Cacambo, his servant, finally discovers El Dorado, the purported &quot;perfect&quot; place. Why would anyone ever want to leave this perfect place, Candide asks himself? His quest had been to prove the theory of optimism of Pangloss and now apparently, he had succeeded. However, all is not what it may seem, even in El Dorado, and Candide is confronted with many ironic and enigmatic questions.As his journeys draw to a close, Candide comes to realize that it is man's almost limitless ability to accept the fate that befalls him and move on to new and better things that allows him to remain sane, happy and productive. In this sense, Candide comes to represent change and development while Pangloss remains the apex of the unchanging and inflexible.While most satire grows stale and dated, Candide remains as fresh as it was when Voltaire wrote it. In the end, as Candide wisely shows us, in the best of all possible worlds, we all tend our gardens as best as we possibly can."},{"Title":"Candide (Franklin Library)","review":"When Voltaire's Candide was originally published in 1759, it must have really been something. Voltaire's goal, of course, was to satirize the haberdash Liebnizian view holding that everything that happens in this world - the good, the bad, the ugly - is all part of God's omnibenevolent plan, and hence, ultimately, for the good. Thus, by watching young Candide, a boy schooled in this philosophy, endure mindless tragedy upon mindless tragedy while despearetely trying to decipher how each fits into God's all-good plan, we see how ridiculous such a view is.While this everything-is-for-the-best-no-matter-how-bad-it-actually-seems view is not AS active today as it was in Voltaire's 1759, we still see a good bit of it. Witness Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell telling us that the 9/11 suicide attacks were God's way of punishing us for leftward political activities (as if an all-powerful God couldn't come up with some better way to get a message to us than this). And how many times, in the face of tragedy, do we hear platitudes like \\"It is all ultimately for the best,\\" or, \\"God works in mysterious ways.\\"In a sense, Candide is as biting and prescient now as it must have been in 1759. Of course, Voltaire isn't trying to disprove this Liebnizian idea. Satire can't disprove; that's what philosophic tomes are for. Rather, Voltaire is simply trying to show it's absurdity by allowing us to laugh at it (in the comfort of our own homes, of course). So those looking for an actual debunking of the \\"problem of evil\\" (as it is known in philosophy) should look elsewhere.Another warning: as fiction - purely as fiction - Candide is not a good work at all. It basically consists of the main character going from place to place (searching for his lover) only to encounter one attrocity after another. If one throws out the satire element, then Candide is a rambling, disjointed and drastically inferior Don Quixote. But as satire, the work is innervating and deep."},{"Title":"Candide (Franklin Library)","review":"Candide is a short and rewarding read. Follow the adventures of Candide, an honest and naive young man who grows up in a baron's household in Germany, on his loss-of-innocence journey. Kicked out of his house after he is caught in a tryst with the baron's daughter, Candide is banished to wander the cruel world. From forced conscription to the Inquisition, Candide sees wonder upon wonder, always holding fast to the teachings of Master Pangloss, his philosophy teacher, that all things (no matter how bad) are right--because they must be so, and picking up new friends on the way.Candide is Voltaire's Swift-like satirical commentary on the society of his day (Europe) and all its dirty laundry--the hypocrisy, greed, cruelty, lecherousness, and demagoguery. Not a single ethnic, political, or religious faction is spared. Voltaire wants Candide, and his reader, to cast off our complacency and irrational optimism, embracing instead demonstrable truths and the responsibility to make things right.In short, Voltaire wants Candide to live up to his name, and maybe it is the most innocent and gullible hero needed to restore the integrity Voltaire saw lacking in the men and women of his day--a new beginning."},{"Title":"Candide (Franklin Library)","review":"I first read \\"Candide\\" when I was still in HS, around 4 or 5 years ago. Maybe it was because I was forced to read it for a class, but I really didn't \\"get it\\" back then. Having some free time while I waited for my next amazon.com book order to arrive, I decided to pick up \\"Candide\\" once again. This time around, my experience was much more enlightening.\\"Candide\\" revolves around the title character, who has had it instilled upon him by Dr. Pangloss, his personal philosopher, that we live in the \\"best of all possible worlds.\\" After seeing Pangloss fooling around with the chambermaid, Candide decided to replicate the acts with the Lady Cunegonde. After being discovered by the Baron, Candide is swiftly kicked (on his rump) out of Westphalia. This sets into motion a long and unbelievable set of events. Candide travels across half the known world in hopes of once again being reunited with Lady Cunegonde. Calamity upon calmity is witnessed by Candide yet he remains steadfast in his belief that everything works out for the best. To fully understand the insanity that marks this book you have to read it for yourself. I would do it an injustice it by saying anything further. I will say that the ending is quite a change of pace from the rest of the book.Although it isn't hard to discern that this story is wholy unrealistic, it is written in such a way that you feel it is somewhat plausible. This might stem from the fact that our society has done a 180 and is composed mainly of cynics and pessimists. Although it was written around 250 years ago, many of the basic issues that Voltaire attacks are still around today. While we don't have the Inquisition murdering people today, religious intolerance is still deep rooted in many humans.There are many reasons I so highly recommend this book. It is a quick read, something you can finish in only a couple hours. It also has several fantastical scenes that will leave you chuckling in disbelief. Finally, it is a good book to see exactly how much our world (at least the Western half) has changed."},{"Title":"Candide (Franklin Library)","review":"The story of Candide greatly affected the way I perceive occurances on a daily basis. I've always lived with a very optimistic outlook on life, assuming things will always turn out for the best. After reading the tragedies young Candide had to cope with and the way that he handled them, I realized that such a naive approach to life could be very dangerous. The proper amount of optimism is always good because it keeps hopes alive, but being irrationally optimistic in certain circumstances can often result in dire consequences."},{"Title":"Candide (Franklin Library)","review":"It [optimism] is the obstinacy of maintaining that everything is best when it is worst.\\"With satirical wit and humor, the great French Enlightenment thinker Voltaire espouses his philosophical beliefs in \\"Candide,\\" an 18th century masterpiece. At first, the intent of \\"Candide\\" may be a bit difficult to discern. If you have a mindset that this is a flowery treatise on Enlightenment philosophy, you may be disappointed (or relieved). \\"Candide\\" is neither realistic nor didactic. In fact, one can almost view it as a dark comedy or a biting satire, for most of the circumstances are absurd and far-fetched, to say the least.Although Candide (\\"The Optimist\\") is the protagonist, his teacher Pangloss is the most important character, for Pangloss is a magnificent (or so Candide thinks) philosopher who espouses the eternal optimistic view - no matter what evil befalls humankind, it is part of a perfect master plan. Indeed, this is the \\"best of all worlds\\". Despite being stricken with syphilis, hanged, nearly dissected, enslaved, losing an arm, ear and nose, burned and drowned, he maintains this worldview until his last dying breath. As a foil to Pangloss, Martin is an eternal pessimist. Yet, while this worldview may be more pragramtic in an imperfect world, it nevertheless discounts true good in the world and can also be a hindrance. Indeed, Voltaire criticizes both extreme optimism and extreme pessimism.\\"Candide\\" is Voltaire's forum for exposing the hypocrisy and brutality of the world he lived in. Voltaire bashes Catholicism by repeated references to gay clergy and the illegitimate child of the Pope. Voltaire shows disdain for Protesant zealots by illustrating the contemptible treatment of Candide when he expresses doubt that the Pope is the devil. Voltaire ridicules the aristocracy with the character of Cunengard's brother, a homosexual German baron. Voltaire ridicules the monarchy by virtue of six deposed kings bemoaning their fates in a village inn. Voltaire satirizes do-nothing philosophers through Pangloss and Martin. Voltaire rips Islam through the sultans and princes of Turkey. Anyway, you get the picture. Even the relatively progressive country of England is not immune to Voltaire's criticism.Another myth that Voltaire dispels is the Utopian ideal, embodied in the mythical city of El Dorado in South America. In this city, there is no religion, prisons, or crimes. The roads are paved with gold and diamonds and even the most destitute denizen lives a carefree, fulfilling life. There is no need for money, despite the land's innumerable riches. Yet, this utopia is nearly inaccessible to the outside world, as Candide stumbles upon it by a freak of nature. Although this utopia is perfect, no one will ever reach it again. In this way, Voltaire seems to imply that the pursuit of a utopia on earth is a fruitless endeavor.So what exactly is Voltaire's worldview? Through Zenoida, a desposed Danish noblewoman, Voltaire expresses his philosophies. Although we are all children of Providence, we are not exempt from sorrow, misery, and grievous atrocities, for life is a conglomeration of both pain and pleasure. The best one can do is to better the community one lives in and to follow one's conscience. Idleness and philosophizing without action is a useless endeavor.\\"Wait a minute - who the #@%! is Zenoida and since when was Pangloss burned and drowned. I've read the entire book and there's no reference to either.\\" Ah, yes, most novels only present Part I of \\"Candide,\\" where our merry adventurers our left to live out a fulfulling life on a modest farm in Turkey. But there's more to this story. Do yourself a favor and download Part II of Candide, easily obtainable on the internet through a free literature site, such as the Gutenberg Project. In Part II, Voltaire presents a tidy conclusion for Candide and his companions, while providing more items for contemplation. Honestly, I found Part II (which is shorter than Part I) a more enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Candide (Franklin Library)","review":"Candide, which is subtitled Optimism, was written in 1759, and is proof that a sharp wit and biting satire was just as much appreciated in Voltaire's time, as it is today.Candide is the life story of a fictional character named Candide. He is a naive, innocent, and optimistic sort of person. If you ever feel that life has treated you unfairly, then you have nothing to complain about if you compare yourself to poor Candide. Just about everything bad imaginable happens to him during the course of his life. Fortunately, at least Voltaire leaves him still alive at the end of the book.Although the book is funny and fast paced (my copy has 115 pages), it can best be appreciated by recognizing the author's intention. Candide is Voltaire's commentary on the church's prevailing philosophy at the time.In Voltaire's time, the church preached that because God is perfect, he would only create the best of all possible worlds. To create a lesser world would imply that God was less than perfect. I don't believe Voltaire's argument was against this philosophy per se, but rather against the way it was used to justify all the evil found in the world.The &quot;best of all possible worlds&quot; proponents used the argument to justify all bad things as a necessary part of the world and so bad things should be accepted as just another part of life. However, Voltaire's philosophy was that &quot;we must cultivate our gardens&quot;, i.e., help the good to grow while pulling out the weeds. Greed, lust, vice, etc., were not necessary in Voltaire's opinion and we should make every attempt to ward off such evils rather than merely accept them.The &quot;best of all possible worlds&quot; philosophy is exemplified in the book by Candide's teacher, Dr. Pangloss (a footnote says that Pangloss means &quot;all-tongue&quot;). Pangloss teaches Candide this philosophy and Candide tries to use it throughout the book to justify the bad things that happen to him. Voltaire uses this approach to ridicule proponents of the &quot;best of all possible worlds&quot; argument for why evil things happen, and takes us on an exciting and funny adventure in the process.Candide is certainly one of the best books you could ever read. After all, there must be some reason the book is still popular today and has even been made into musical plays.

Voltaire's Candide is clearly a stab at the church of his time, a church unwilling to accept what are now basic scientific truths such as the earth orbiting the sun (and not the other way around). The church is painted in a less than flatering light, seeing as a few characters in Candide include the daughter of the pope, a monk with a favorite prostitute, and an Inquisitor with an illegitamate lover. Characters such as Doctor Pangloss display brilliantly the ancient thought, painting it (perhaps a bit too exaggerated)in a way nearly blind to the real world. Pangloss's views of all things happening &quot;for the best of all possible worlds&quot; is clearly defied in the story which is in essence a collection of horrific stories painted in a comical array of words. The innate sarcasm in the book pokes a great deal of fun at the thinking of the times, and yet Candide's views are applicable today.

All you need is a &quot;garden&quot; to keep your minds off of boredom and dispair. Voltaire might be daed but his books live on though the centuries"},{"Title":"Candide (Franklin Library)","review":"This book's eponymous protagonist is a naive young man who was taught by his teacher, the philosopher Pangloss, that ours is the best possible world and that everything in it always happens for the best. According to Pangloss, misfortunes only ever visit us because they contribute in some way to the general good and \\"the more private misfortunes there are, the more general good\\" there is. Pangloss also dusts off the old chestnuts that all men were created equal and that all property should belong to everyone. Voltaire wrote this novella mainly to refute these ideas, which he attributed to Gottfried Leibniz.It was hard for me to get excited about this book-length refutation because I don't know anyone who believes that everything in our world always occurs \\"for the best\\". Most of us are aware of people who think that private property is evil and that all men were created equal, but unfortunately, those are not the parts of Pangloss's thought that Voltaire spends most of his time refuting. He simply has Candide go through a long series of fantastically cruel misadventures, all just to prove to him that life isn't a piece of cake after all.At one point in the novella a character named \\"the wise man of taste\\" (oh, the subtlety!) holds forth on literature. Among other things he says that a good writer should always strive for newness without being bizarre. Voltaire clearly failed his own test here - all of \\"Candide\\" is bizarre.While pretty violent, this book is not at all depressing. This is mostly because Voltaire seems completely uninterested in his characters' inner lives. I can't imagine what a movie based on \\"Candide\\" would look like, in large part because a cartoon would be far more appropriate for it. After being hanged, raped and pierced with swords, the characters invariably dust themselves off to cheerfully continue their arguments about Leibniz's ideas. Their emotional responses to being hanged and raped aren't any more realistic or thought-provoking than the physical ones.Voltaire made his naive, honest, idealistic protagonist German. After two and a half centuries that stereotype hasn't really changed. Another one has though: in Voltaire's imagination Germany seems to have been a wild, provincial country situated on the far outskirts of civilization. In the 18th century his native France was still the cool kid of nations - a dynamic trend-setter, envied by everybody with a clue. Northern Italy had held that place during the Renaissance, but by Voltaire's time it was already considered a decadent has-been. Voltaire dramatized that feeling here through the character of the Venetian aristocrat Pococurante, who has seen everything and is tired of everything. The cycle that takes some societies from provincialism to leadership and then, almost invariably, to decline is, of course, fascinating. A century after Voltaire's death it was France's turn to become a symbol of decadence in the world's imagination, and Germany's turn to start setting the trends. Then, in the late 20th century, Germany itself joined the rest of Western Europe in the declinist camp, while America and Russia tried their hands at leading.In his time Voltaire was a notorious liberal, and consequently a very fashionable guy to know. But times change - so much so that some of the stuff in this book would probably get him thrown in jail as a Nazi in modern France. For example: \\"The northern nations have not that heat in their blood, nor that raging lust for women, so common in Africa.\\" Or this, from one female character's description of how she was raped by a pirate: \\"He was an abominable negro, and yet believed that he did me a great deal of honor\\". And this is how the same woman explains the pirates' attraction to her and to her European companions: \\"...our maids of honor, and even our waiting women, had more charms than are to be found in all Africa...\\" In a different chapter he describes women from an Indian tribe in Paraguay being amorous with apes, incorrectly stating that such unions are capable of producing offspring.Through the character of Pococurante Voltaire dismisses all scientists and their work as utterly useless: \\"...if only one of those rakers of rubbish had shown how to make pins; but in all these volumes there is nothing but chimerical systems, and not a single useful thing.\\" It's fun to note here that Voltaire belonged to the last generation of Europeans who could have honestly made that claim. He died in 1778, just as the Industrial Revolution was starting up in England.Another interesting thing in the Pococurante episode is that it contains a short review of what people of Voltaire's age considered great literature. Most of the authors mentioned were unsurprisingly Greek and Roman. Only one English writer is discussed and it is Milton, not Shakespeare. In 1759, when \\"Candide\\" was first published, Shakespeare hadn't become super-important yet.Voltaire spends a lot of time decrying the horrors of war here. Actually, I've never thought of the first three quarters of the 18th century as having been particularly violent. It is only with the French Revolution, many of whose leaders were inspired by Voltaire, that the quaint little wars and cartoonish despotisms of his age gave way to the megawars and megadespotisms of the Jacobin and Napoleonic types.Voltaire, a staunch enemy of organized religion, included an auto-da-fe scene here as an example of how violent his clerical foes could be. Of course, the Revolution and its copycats across Europe ended up killing a lot more people than the Inquisition ever could, with most of the Revolutionaries being as anti-clerical as Voltaire. It's important to state here, however, that unlike many modern European critics of Christianity, Voltaire was a consistent secularist - his attitudes towards Islam and Judaism were often negative as well.As a contrast to the crumminess of the real world, Voltaire included in this book a description of a utopia called Eldorado. Like everything else in \\"Candide\\", this utopia is painted in pretty broad, cartoonish brushstrokes, but I'd like to single out one of its aspects nevertheless.Eldorado is apparently devoid of war, crime and all other forms of human conflict. Let's disregard for a moment the fact that no such society has ever existed. Let's just ask if such a society COULD ever arise, and if it could, what would be the long-term consequences?I believe that man, like all other animals, is a product of evolution. The competition for survival, essential to evolution, takes many forms, most of them involving conflict in some way. Regardless of whether or not they want to admit it, most people enjoy conflict. I know that Voltaire did because I've just finished a book of his that joyfully attacks the church, Leibniz, a bunch of now-obscure Parisian writers who happened to be his professional rivals and lots of other people besides. If a society was somehow forced, against its will, to abandon all forms of conflict, what would become of that society long-term? Voltaire died long before the rise of political correctness, so he must have been aware of the correct answer to that question, yet he described his utopia as being devoid of conflict anyway. It is no excuse at all to say here that he couldn't have been aware of the theory of evolution as such. The 18th century was obsessed with the idea of breeding, both human and animal, so he must have known how that system worked even if he wouldn't have used modern terms to describe it.To me the most likely explanation for the Eldorado episode, as for much else in \\"Candide\\", is simple intellectual sloppiness."},{"Title":"Candide (Franklin Library)","review":"This book was moderately entertaining from a fictional standpoint. However, maybe I am shallow, but I did not see the philosophical genius which is frequently exalted in this work. I felt the conclusion was a great let down after all of the events that led up to it.

I was surprised in how funny and crazy this novel was. The chaotic events that take place, which continuously contradict Dr. Pangloss's notion that \\"all is for the best in the world,\\" meaning that the world is perfect because God made it, and the evils that take place upon the world are all part of a cosmic plan. But apparently, as we all know more than ever today, is that the world isn't perfect, and that we do have free will to prevent some things from happening. For such a short book, Voltaire portrays society, government, social classes, etc. very well into a very comical and sometimes appalling satire. I was very impressed, i look foreward to reading this again and again in the future. It's very entertaining, full of wit, exciting, and will make you laugh, make you shudder, and at the end, make you think.

The reviewer said that the book is no longer applicable to the world because Voltaire's fight had been won: that is to say religious intolerance and ignorance have been banished. I never agreed with that reviewer's assesment. In light of September 11, my disagreement is further entrenched in my body. Religious ignorance is still running amuck in the hills and desert dunes, and right in our own backyard. Has Voltaire's war been won? No, I don't think so. We're in the middle of it right now. Candide helped take the religious fanaticism out of Europe, perhaps some new translations in arabic and whatever languages are spoken in Afghanistan should be dropped from the back of planes along with the bombs.

It tells the story about an illegitimate son of Dr. Pangloss. This book is a satire and as good a depiction of the follies and vices of men that you'll find. We follow Candide through many outrageous adventures which put into question all that mankind holds dear (such as science, philosophy, religion, government and romance). It attacks the pretentiousness of the upper classes. It attacks man's culpability, stupidity and crudeness. It's funny, warm and incredibly poignant. It is no wonder that the printer that was to publish Voltaire's book had to go underground to do so, and that he lost his business and his personal fortune because of this book. This is a masterful, if blistering satire on the follies and vices of men. Voltaire does not save anybody, no matter what walk of life they are in. In fact, the upper classes are painted in a very unflattering light. Candide is a young and impressionable if somewhat bumptious hero, who falls into and out of more trouble in his life. He is a nave soul who believes all that he is told and thinks that everyone knows more about things than he does himself. Voltaire spares no punches as he outlines his idea of man. To him humankind shows grossness, cupidity, and not a little outright stupidity. But even so the book is not as pessimistic as it could be. There is a freshness here in the simplemindedness of Candide, and in the occasional goodness that he runs across. His stay at Eldorado is part of the book that illustrates goodness, and the ending leaves on an optimistic note when Voltaire and his motley band of followers realize that good will come if man will stay at home and look after his acreages. Wonderful book!"},{"Title":"Candide (Franklin Library)","review":"Candide is among the classics of world- literature.Voltaire wrote a hundred volumes or more but this is the only piece which is still read today. There is reason for this. The theme is an eternal one, innocent optimistic idealistic youth confronting the realities of the world, and being slowly disabused of his idealism. Voltaire takes on Leibniz whose views are represented by Candide's teacher Pangloss( Everything is for the best in the best of all possible worlds). Voltaire writes with great satirical skill of the numerous misadventures of Candide who after them all comes to the conclusion that ' it is best to cultivate one's own garden' . One reason I never fully enjoyed the book is my sense of a certain predictable slaptstick element in which the cruelty preceding is certainly about to be followed by the cruelty to come. And this too has to do with a feeling a sense that Voltaire himself seemed to be enjoying the cruelty more than anything else. Voltaire it is true has an honored place in the human struggle for freedom of individual expression but he was on the personal level a quite terrible person. And that feeling that for him the cruelties of life are a bit of a delight did not escape me when reading the work.This to my mind means that the work cannot even come close to those peaks of world literature in which we have deep connection with and sympathy for the major heroes. Candide is a straw- figure and this little moral allegory still speaks a truth and a question."},{"Title":"Candide (Franklin Library)","review":"Still today, over two hundred years after it was written, Candide still shines as one of literature's best satires.The book is full of pessimism does not prevent him from using humor throughout the book. Some of the humor used in the book is blatant; the governor of Buenos Ayres declares his love for Cun&eacute;gonde, says he will marry her, then never does. In case readers did not understand the hypocrisy, Voltaire gave the governor a name to remember: Don Fernando d'Ibaraa y Figuerora y Mascarenes y Lampourdos y Souza. Another interesting name is that of Baron Thunder-ten-tronckh. The illeteration and mental imagery is what stood out for me; the name brings pictures of a corpulent man thundering down a hall. It does not sound aristocratic (if indeed, names can be aristocratic) and seems more of a misnomer than a label for a noble from Wittenburg. By examining the Baron's behavior (working everyone towards his goals and then profiting from their labor while he does nothing) the name is no longer a misnomer.Candide reminded me of Miguel de Cervantes' Don Quixote in that a man following the regulations of chivalry is driven to do the correct thing even though disastrous consequences may come of it. Candine discovers this when he rescues Cun&eacute;gonde from a Turkish noble and finds she is ugly and disagreeable. In addition, Don Quixote and Candide both find themselves in improbable situations over and over again. Both books are satire and they poke fun at the same government, social, and ecclesiastical principles. Despite the similarity, I did enjoy reading Candide more so than I did Don Quixote."},{"Title":"Candide (Franklin Library)","review":"I disliked the book very strongly.

There are many things detestable about this novel so I will limit my critisicsm to only several aspects: the pot has no coherence, the character developement is not only unbelievable but also banal, the writing style ,although blessedly, terse is childish and unimaginative to say the least. And finally, a qotation I once read said something to this effect: the best novel are those that are novels not only of the hour but of all time. Candide has no relevance to my life or this era what so ever. One more word to those who wish to deride me as an illiterate teenage who can only process the sound bites of T.V., think again.

At face value, it is an allegorical attack in the belief on progress of its age, but I think it is much more than that. With a plot similar to that of a picaresque novel, it tells the story of Candide, a nave young man taught by Dr. Plangloss (\\"all is for the best in the best of all possible worlds\\") on Leibnizian optimism. Several misfortunes forces him to go on a journey throughout the world (among the lands he travels, very breezily, are his native Germany, Bulgaria, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, South America, France, England, Venice and the Ottoman Empire). Through the book, the main purpose of his life is to meet his beloved Cunegonde, a friend of his childhood who seems to have been through as much misfortunes as him. The novel attacks not only the religious intolerance of the day, but European colonialism, and institutions then considered natural by most people, like slavery (when he meets an African slave in the Dutch colony in Surinam, the black man wonders why if the Dutch preachers tell him that all men are brothers, some peoples rule over others). In a Rousseau-like touch, the place most happy to him seems to be a place in South America, where the natives have found a shelter from the European conquistadors, and where gold is considered valueless mud. And despite being almost 250 years old, the book is very accessible (at least in the translation I have read)."},{"Title":"Candide (Franklin Library)","review":"I decided to read this book after watching its broadway rendition, and I have to say that it truly surprised me.

It is a very short book, and although I wanted more at the end, it was nice, fresh and held my attention throughout."},{"Title":"Candide (Franklin Library)","review":"This is a hilarious romp through the 18th century world that Voltaire knew. This book provided him to make fun of the intellectuals of the day (cannibals who only eat Jesuits) the politics of Europe and the social mores of the elite. His characters include the noble Candide who combines his good heart with his reliance of Gilgamesh like helpers in order to succeed. His hero worship for Dr. Pangloss, the Rasputin like philosopher (and later Martin) bailed him out of some situations but perhaps more importantly his lesser, Cacambo saved his life. All of the fantastic adventures that Candide experienced were all designed to reunite him with his true love Cunegonde.Many years later, Upton Sinclair wrote a \\"Candide\\" like, utopian socialist fantasy novel, Metropolis that I was reminded of while reading this novel."},{"Title":"Candide (Franklin Library)","review":"As a rule I don't recap the plot of books because I don't want to ruin anything for anyone, but for this one I will make a slight exception. Candide is a naive young man who lives in paradise worshiping his one true love, a princess at the castle in which he resides. The cruel world comes in and sends him on a trip of horrors that would make what Job went through seem like a blister. Fast moving, exciting and funny as a great novel can be.This book can be read as a fun tale of misfortune and woe, or it can be read as a deep philosophical tale. Which is why the book is brilliant, it works on many different levels. Actually, it works on every level, which is why I recommend it to everyone who claims that they love to read. The humor is biting and hilarious, which is why it is the greatest satire ever written, even if the object of the satire has long since died.I do want to point out one thing, and it won't ruin the ending, because the ending isn't as important as the journey. Many people see this novel as an unabashed, full on assault on optimism. It isn't. Read the ending again. In the end things work out for the main characters, just not in the way they could have ever imagined in the beginning.

When their love is discovered, Candide is expelled from his home, and the fun starts. The entire novel is then consumed with tongue-in-cheek melodrama of Candide's worldwide attempt to find and marry Cunegonde, who is, of course, constantly on the move.Early on in the story we realize that the important aspects of Voltaire's novel are not the plot's details but the higher themes: the \\"real-world\\" tragedy which disproves Pangloss' initial optimistic teachings, the hypocrisy of the day's religious theologians, and the inability of money to solve problems.

Voltaire emphasizes the resilience of human nature. Finally, there is characterized the uselessness of metaphysical speculation and the value of work.Candid was granted a pardon from the King of the Bulgars because he was a philosopher. He encountered a charitable Anabaptist in Holland. In South America the lovely Cunegonde's, the woman of Candide's dream, brother appeared as a Jesuit. Candide had learned from their tutor Pangloss that he was deceased. The Jesuit Baron became angry with Candide because he wanted to marry his sister and then Candide had to kill him in self-defense. Subsequently Candide's life was spared because he was not a Jesuit. Candide and his servant, Cacambo, traveled to El Dorado. They left to find Cunegonde and ran into a sugar plantation.Candide embarked with an old man, the scholar Martin, for Bordeaux. Candide had the hope of seeing Cunegonde again. Candide went to Paris. He spent an evening gambling, and did not mind his losses, and so was taken as one of the English milords. Candide and Martin, through a series of events, were taken to lower Normandy to save their lives. Their ship went to Portsmouth, England. At length they reached Venice. Candide was reunited with his servant.The party went to Constantinople. First Candide bought Cacambo his freedom.

Optimism in the 18th century did not have the same meaning as it does today. Back then, it was the belief that ours is the best of all possible worlds, since it is G-d's world and G-d is perfect. Voltaire takes a naive adherent to this belief and exposes him to the horrors of the world: war, enslavement, theft, rape, heartbreak, etc. Not only does Candide experience these things himself but he hears everyone else bemoaning their situations. Perhaps the crushing blow is when Candide accidentally discovers the paradise of El Dorado, only to willingly leave and face the problems of the real world yet again.I will not reveal how the story ends, but I liked how it turned out. In my opinion, Voltaire does a good job of criticizing optimism, and he isn't afraid to take some more personal cuts at some of his philisophical opponents. The beauty of this story is that Voltaire accomplishes most of it through humor. Undoubtably it would have been funnier to an 18th century reader (I did not understand many of the religious references--and I still don't know what the Jesuits believe in) but I think I got most of the jokes.So, all in all, I give this a 4/5 for a story that still has value today."},{"Title":"Candide (Franklin Library)","review":"Yes, this is a rereading of a book for school, but like most books, I got more out of it on a second reading.

Why are all the wars, rapes, thieving, murder, and vengeance Candide experiences considered evil if there is no measuring stick to define it against an absolute good? In the words of C. S. Lewis, how can we call a line crooked without any notion of a straight line? Contrary to Voltaire's findings, the evil and wickedness in Candide's world point to absolutes of goodness, fairness, and honesty.

To what standard can he call rape and murder wrong if there is no ultimate goodness?"},{"Title":"Candide (Franklin Library)","review":"\\"When all is said and done, there is a sterling goodness in unsophisticated Nature; for instead of eating me, these people behaved most politely as soon as they learnt I was not a Jesuit.\\" Voltaire's protagonist Candide is certainly a character who withstood anything the world and mankind could throw at him and remarkably kept his spirit of optimism.Voltaire's satire - my first experience with anything Voltaire - was a quick and fairly easy read, and a rewarding experience to have acquainted myself with this literary work. Aside from the repeated tragedy experienced by Candide and his various travelling companions, one thing that struck me was how a satire written over 250 years ago still plays so well in today's world. It poked fun at a myriad of different societal aspects from Voltaire's time (mid-1700s): religious philosophies, man's penchant for power/riches/violence/domination, politics, and much more. Given that the satire seems just as relevant in 2011 as it was in Voltaire's time is a testament to me that there's creedence to the ol' saying \\"the more things change, the more they stay the same.\\"As for whether the Penguin edition of the story is any good or is an injustice to the original, I can't offer an opinion as I have no idea how the original reads or its literary style."},{"Title":"Candide (Franklin Library)","review":"This is my first attempt at Classic Literature, and I have to say that this one was very interesting, very well thought out, and dowright good.

Too bad it wasn't required reading when I was in high school."},{"Title":"Candide (Franklin Library)","review":"Before you read Candide, you must place yourself in XVII Century France; a time with no middle class, where most diseases are deadly, where the smallest dispute would be solved in a duel, and where making fun of the monarchy could get you hanged or at the very least, flogged. Are you there yet? If so, poor you. But to enlighten your mood, grab a copy of Candide and I guarantee it will put a smile on your face.Candide is a young, naive man who lives in the lap of luxury under the mentorship of Pangloss, an optimist philosopher who believes that everything that happens, no matter how bad, is always and without fail for the very best. The premise of Voltaire's story is simple. Optimism is absurd. And the lovely, but yet horrible life of Candide is the tool he uses to prove it.Most people attribute the literary genre of magical realism to Colombian author Gabriel Garcia Marquez and his novel \\"100 Years of Solitude\\", but that would be like saying that Christianity precedes the birth of Christ. Voltaire's \\"Candide or, the Optimist\\" is THE blueprint of magical realism and even satire.We follow Candide in his lifelong battle to be with his one and only love, Cunegonde, through a multitude of adventures full of misfortunes, unsurmountable obstacles, improbable situations, and downright silliness; all of which happens while he struggles to understand how so much misery can indeed be \\"for the very best\\". His travels take him through places like Germany, France, Portugal, and even Paraguay. It may sound crazy, but in the world of Candide, it all fits into place.There are so many politically incorrect and deliciously crafted remarks that at the time, would have been considered downright blasphemous. It's hilarious. Chapter 25 is a perfect example of this. Candide and a companion visit Lord Pococurante, a noble Venetian, at his breathtaking palace. Candide is impressed by the cultural collection of art and literary works he owns, but yet, Lord Pococurante is disgusted by it! When describing a Raphael painting, the senator explains that \\"the colours are too dark, the figures are not sufficiently rounded, nor in good relief, and the draperies in no way resemble stuffs.\\" Then, while they waited for dinner, the musicians played a tune and Candide found it delicious.\\"This noise,\\" said the Senator, \\"may amuse one for half an hour; but if it were to last longer it would grow tiresome to everybody, though they durst not own it. Music, today, is only the art of executing difficult things, and that which is only difficult cannot please long. Perhaps I should be fonder of the opera if they had not found the secret of making of it a monster which shocks me. Let who will go to see bad tragedies set to music, where the scenes are contrived for no other end than to introduce two or three songs ridiculously out of place, to show off an actress's voice. Let who will, or who can, die away with pleasure at the sight of an eunuch quavering the role of Caesar, or of Cato, and strutting awkwardly upon the stage.\\"After dinner they went into the library. Candide, seeing a Homer magnificently bound, commended the virtuoso on his good taste. To which he replied:\\"They used at one time to make me believe that I took a pleasure in reading him. But that continual repetition of battles, so extremely like one another; those gods that are always active without doing anything decisive; that Helen who is the cause of the war, and who yet scarcely appears in the piece; that Troy, so long besieged without being taken; all these together caused me great weariness.

It should be an example for all \`would-be' writers all over the world. It is not less than a frontal attack on the greatest philosopher of Voltaire's time, Leibniz, for whom the world he lived in was \`the best possible'.'Dear Pangloss (= know everything), when you were hanged, dissected, cruelly beaten, did you still think that everything was for the best in this word?' \`I still hold my original opinion', replied Pangloss, \`since Leibniz cannot be wrong.'This eventful text running with dazzling speed is a masterful mockery of Leibniz's philosophy with its \`causes and effects', \`sufficient reasons', \`(non)contingent events', \`freedoms and necessities', \`(pre-established ) harmonies', \`souls and evils' and \`natural laws':\`You expect to eat a Jesuit today; nothing could be more just, for natural law teaches us to kill our neighbor.

The only thing left is \`cultivate our garden.'This is a cowardly, selfish non-solution, to use Voltaire's own terms. Closing one's eyes for the realities of this world should not be an option.But how did Voltaire cultivate his garden? He profited handsomely from the slave trade. He even agreed that a ship for slave transport was named after him! A not so magnificent example of gardening.However, this brilliant \`cooking' of a philosopher's key ideas is a must read for all lovers of world literature. It should be a challenge for all ambitious writers."},{"Title":"Candide (Franklin Library)","review":"Candide, is a fast moving book that ridicules the philosophy that 'everything is best.' Throughout the book, in a comical, witty, and grotesque way, Candide, finds himself questioning whether that principle is really true, as it seems, things may really be for the worst. But, Candide being so naive and idolizing of his teacher, Dr. Pangloss, the man who taught him the philosophy, persistenly believes and defends it; although, it is clear by the events in the book that it is false."},{"Title":"Candide (Franklin Library)","review":"Being a fan of such authors as Charles Bukowski and Hunter S. Thompson, I admittedly found myself disheartened upon learning that Voltaire's \\"Candide\\" was on my summer reading list. I, as well as many, many other young readers, often find myself trudging through dreary and boring works of \\"literature\\", all of which are hailed by critics and scholars and \\"experts\\" (thus the reasoning for us to read them). It is because of such books that most kids these days hate to read and don't give books that could actually interest them a chance. But in reading \\"Candide\\", I found in Voltaire a thing almost identical to what I found in Orwell and his classic allegory, \\"Animal Farm\\" - it's not necessarily a staggering work of unimaginable genius, but what it is a work of great insight, fantastic adventure, wonderous charm, and upon finishing it, one will hardly feel their time was wasted.Candide is both the title of this book and the name of its main character. In the beginning of his life, Candide is born to the sister of the great Baron of Thunder-ten-tronckh (you'll often see foreign and confusing names such as this). In no time, he and the daughter of the Baroness, Cunegonde, fall deeply in love, and the Baron discovers this secret and immediately kicks Candide out of the castle, which is seated in the province of Westpahlia in Germany. During the breadth of his travels, Candide is always in want of his love Cunegonde.From thence forth, Candide is thrust into an adventure surrounded in the blood and bones of the many and the love and friendship of the few. From Portugal to Paris to the fabled city of El Dorado, Candide follows a magnificent road. Plans of passage to find Cunegonde are often devised during his journey, although he is equally as often sidetracked and then swindled out of the unparalleled riches he has amassed by the greedy and unkind citizens of the countries he enters.Along for the journey are a handful of Candide's wise friends, most of which he meets for the very first time, including a valet (somewhat similar to a servant) named Cucumbo, a miserable philsopher named Martin, and an old woman who is the daughter of the Pope and is now a poor and lonely soul. Another one of these friends is a man Candide had once admired - the Baron of Thunder-ten-tronckh's former philospher, Pangloss. From Pangloss, Candide takes the expression \\"all is for the best.\\" By the end of the book, it could be said that this outlook on life and Candide's generally \\"rose-tinted\\" view of life are altered.In the end, what we have, as readers, is a magnificent \\"coming-of-age\\" tale, in which the innocent, doe-eyed Candide witnesses, firsthand, the horrors not only of war but of life itself, and if not for the love in his heart, he would surely have chosen to end his misery sooner.And to all those who are reading this book because their school requires it: Do not be afraid of the perfect English and 18th century setting, because what you're about to read is a wonderful roadtrip of a tale about a starry-eyed romantic out to conquer whatever lies before him so that he may one day see again the lover with which he is so infatuated.When you think about the book \\"Candide\\", don't think Shakespeare, think Hunter S. Thompson. Don't think \\"Romeo and Juliet\\", think \\"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\\". Then you will begin to understand the unwholesome fun of which you are soon to discover."},{"Title":"Candide (Franklin Library)","review":"Candide is a very brief, yet wholly amusing satiric thrust at the Christian philosophy of perpetual optimism. Obviously Voltaire couldn't write anything without making a pointed statement of some sort, and in its entirety Candide is no different from his other works. It's a story, of course, but only secondarily; the writer left not a single word devoid of relevance to his point. In fact he tells his tale with very little attention to detail, only concerned with encompassing his main character's lengthy odyssey as quickly as possible. With such an approach, his sole aim was to simply get the message across. In Candide, Voltaire strives to refute the belief that we live in the best of all possible worlds. By documenting his young protagonist's horrendous sufferings and hardships, the philosopher more than implies that misfortune is certainly not part of any divine plan for us. And whether you agree with that or not, I'd still say this book manifests a great deal of provocative insight, not to mention a whole lot of dark, dark humor. I wouldn't call Candide a consistent knock-out -- most of its pages aren't quite laugh-out-loud funny -- but the whole of the story very well tickles the reader with its caustic narrative. So if you're just itching for a short read (most folks could complete this one in a single sitting, I'm sure), look no further. While it may be of very petite proportions, Candide is unarguably a literary classic, as entertaining and surprising and clever as one would hope."},{"Title":"Candide (Franklin Library)","review":"In Candide, Voltaire opens the door to self-discovery and the search for a true God by closing the door on what we perceive to be reality. With an unmatched wit he sets up an increasingly impossible series of events that force us to see with unlidded eye the ludicrousness of our attempts to reject that which is present and real, for that which is outside of us and fantastical. If his intention was to show the pain that is evident in all of our lives, he has succeeded. If it was to show to what considerable distance we as a people will go to avoid pain, he has again succeeded. The character I most identify with in Candide is the central character in the story, Candide. We can see the effects that his experiences with other people and their philosophies have had on his life. Candide, from the French candida, means \\"white.\\" This may suggest that he begins life as \\"a blank page,\\" a yet undefined form.At one time, we are all born a \\"blank page\\"; our existence is marked with no blemish, no experience that has defined who we are. Our minds are in essence candida. Yet, looking back into my past and opening up the pages of my existence, I can ever more clearly that I am not a self-made man. Personal experiences, past and present contacts with individuals, institutions and society have combined their respective influences and written that combination which is me, on my blank page. It is no longer white, but stained with the indelible ink of experience.As Candide's story progresses, we can see clearly how his pages are being written, step by step. Few of those pages in Candide's life are filled with what we might consider to be positive events. He begins as a young impressionable boy listening to the philosophy of those around him. Unfortunately, he has the estimable Dr. Pangloss, whose name literally means \\"all tongue,\\" as the tutor and former of his mind. He says that all things happen for a reason; therefore, it must be the best reason. In essence, Pangloss teaches Candide that the reason for his and others' suffering is for the greater societal good.How many of those persons who have influenced the person that I am today have been \\"all tongue\\"? Throughout my life, I have heard from every shade tree philosopher, \\"There is a reason for everything.\\" I would be inclined to agree with them if, by that statement, they mean that every cause has an effect. That is however, not the case. Like Pangloss, they are ascribing the \\"cause\\" to an entity, a God, or force outside of themselves as individuals and society. This excuses us from many things. One of those things that it excuses us from is responsibility. If things cannot be other than they are then my part, my action, was preordained and consequently I am not responsible for the effects of those actions. Voltaire saw that these people who spoke so often of a God, who was alive and called each of us to \\"personal responsibility,\\" were at the same time ascribing the \\"cause and effect\\" of their actions to Him. Candide was the vehicle that Voltaire used to show the mutual exclusivity of the belief in Free Will and Absolute Necessity.I can really identify with the questions that Candide asks in the midst of his suffering. After a series of painful experiences that Dr. \\"Paingloss\\" Pangloss covers over with his \\"Indispensable\\" defense, Candide is inclined to ask: \\"If this is the best of all possible worlds, then what can the rest be like?\\" I hear him saying that, if this is the best of all possible worlds, then why would anyone want more? When people tell me that there is a reason for everything, with the purpose of glossing over my pain, and that we will all find out in the \\"by and by,\\" I wonder what prevents them from finding \\"sufficient reason\\" to expedite their own end and thereby to circumvent the pleasure, pain and reality that they are in actuality trying to escape.Voltaire shows us that we all undoubtedly will suffer. Through his farcical style we see the reality of Candide's suffering. We are also made to see that the pain that he is suffering is suffered at the hands of man and nature. We see that Candide is being led through life by the will of others and that a large part of his suffering is brought on by because he is reacting to life rather than acting upon it. Candide does not see himself or others as an initiator of his pain. He still holds to Pangloss' philosophy that everything is for the best.In reality I have never believed that everything was for the best, yet like Candide I have spent a majority of my life in reaction rather than action. As I suspect is true with Pangloss, I have built up a series of impenetrable defenses. At one time in my life they protected me from that which I could not comprehend, and hence had some value. They were a reaction to experiences that I could not explain away. Yet as time passed, the defenses that had served me so well began to become increasing invalid with each experience that broadened my horizons.While Candide was still a resident of the greatest Hall, owned by the greatest Baron, who was married to the greatest Baroness, who had the most seductive daughter, as well as a son who was naturally worthy of his father, who were all taught by the greatest teacher in the town and \\"consequently the greatest in all the world,\\" his defenses served him well, for there were no experiences that could invalidate the theory that Pangloss was teaching. When these things were taken from Candide, Pangloss' theory did not protect him from real physical or emotional pain. But protection was never its intention. I have never needed protection from anything that did not exist. What people are attempting to do is eliminate suffering from existence. If Candide could only repeat Pangloss enough, then his emotional pain would disappear. He could invalidate pain as a feeling.A lot of people in my life have tried to teach me the same thing. It is not enough that they don't have to feel. Their lives can never be safe as long as the world is inhabited by people who do. Our contact with these people threatens their faux peace. When we cry out, they close the doors. When we are angry, they smile. When someone dies, we mourn in their midst as they say that God is going to make something good come out of this. What a hopeless world we are in when life cannot be other than it is. It would lead me to the greatest of desperations if I could not affect my life, for better or worse, by a thoughtful action.We all want the answers to the questions that suffering naturally brings. Why did this happen to me? Why will it not stop? How can I make it go away? I too have asked all of these questions and attempted to find the answers. I think that Voltaire knew that pain was unavoidable. I think he knew that we had not the power to control the world. He showed clearly that our choices are the determiner of our actions, that Free Will and natural disaster are the determiners of cause and effect. Not only will we try to alter reality so that it does not conflict with our opinions, but we punish, condemn, excommunicate and kill those who do not see our \\"reality\\" as being real.Why then do we ask why pain exists? Why do we ask to stop it? We are constantly throwing punches at those who we believe are of a lower social standard, of differing religious beliefs, dress differently than we do, or are of different color, yet still ascribe these actions as being the way things are meant to be. Do we not see that those punches are a source of pain for those at which they are aimed? Voltaire had \\"sufficient reason\\" to question the ludicrousness of this still commonly held belief. Candide's experience, although farcical, is consistent with the pain that we all feel and that we all try to escape. Voltaire asks us to look at the world with a realistic view. If we hold onto beliefs that we ascribe to whatever God we believe in, even though those beliefs are inconsistent with reality and in most cases contrary to the beliefs of our respective creator, we are voiding any real power that He has, and actually increase that pain which we are trying to eliminate."},{"Title":"Candide (Franklin Library)","review":"As a closet pessimist, I have often come across - and scoffed at - the notion that we live in the \\"best of all possible worlds.\\" The must be so, of course, because the great God almighty is omniscent, omnipotent, omnibenevolent - in short, perfect, and cannot make a mistake. Therefore, all the seemingly needless suffering, trials, and tribulations that are inherent in our world - i.e., airplanes crashing into buildings - are actually for the better, for the greater good, because everything, EVERYTHING - no matter how seemingly cruel and inhumane - is part of the Big Guy's Great Cosmic Plan. Every action has a purpose, and that purpose is (perpetually) benign.All of which is fine, except...Have you looked at the world lately? I have, and, it seems to me that there are, to put it delicately, Several Flaws In This Plan. I watched two airplanes crash into two major American buildings, needlessly killing thousands, and I find it somewhat hard to believe, to put it lightly, that this is the \\"best of all possible worlds.\\" I'm sure most you do as well... or else you probably wouldn't be reading this, now would you?And yet, in the 18th Century time period when this book was written, just such a philosophy was popular (perhaps \\"rampant\\" is a more accurate term) among the heavy, high-brow philosophers of the day. Candide (subtitled \\"Optimism\\") is Voltaire's refutation of the notion. The writing is heavily sarcastic and burlesque - not to mention dark - as any good satire must be. It contains much delicate gallows humor. It reminds me of nothing (and I realize this is an obvious case of putting the carriage years before the horse) so much as our dearly beloved 20th century Doomsday Prophet Laurete, Kurt Vonnegut. Certainly, as this was in essence an ephermal political satire of the time in which it was written, Candide is not, perhaps as technically valid to our present \\"modern-day\\" society as the work of a, say, Vonnegut. As the book is primarily a reaction to the notion in question (that of all-pervading and naive optimism), and not an explanation of it picking its faults specifically (which is to say, it does not explain the nature of what it is refuting, assuming the reader already knows), much of the sarcasm has been lost through the years. One would need a general knowledge of 18th century philosophy to appreciate all the points that the book tries to make. However, Voltaire's main messages are certainly clear enough, and just as valid today as they ever were - and always will be. Read Candide - it's a dark, funny, irrevently hilarous and enlightening satire on man and his naive, optimistic folly and fallacious outlook. Even if you don't like the book - unlikely, if you have already waded through my review this far - I guarantee that you will respect it, and that it will make you think - and, perhaps, get you to question certain notions that you may have held unquestioningly throughout your life. Essential 18th century literature."},{"Title":"Candide (Franklin Library)","review":"Candide is another one of those books I wish I'd been forced to read at some point in my education, whether in my comparative literature classes in high school (which as previously mentioned, wasn't very comparative if the teacher didn't care for the author) or in one of my several philosophy classes in university. Either way, it's been on my list of books to read for ages now, and seeing as David had it on a shelf, unread and lonely, I decided to pick it up and give it a go.Candide is a fast read, something that I was three-quarters of the way through after my commute on Monday (thirty-five minutes each way) and finished after another half-hour of light reading this afternoon after returning from the doctor's surgery. The only real way to describe it is to imagine what would happen if Camus travelled back in time and decided to write a book with Swift. Candide is funny, sarcastic, satirical, and incredibly entertaining, which is surprising considering I didn't exactly have the best translation in the world at my disposal. It's the story of a young and nave servant to a nobleman and how his journey in life, most of which is taken up with seeking after his unrequited love, is filled with sadness and joy, and how his outlook determines the course of his action.Like most satirists, Voltaire did not stop to consider friends or enemies: he took shots at everyone from the Catholic clergy to Protestants and even his own philosophers who continue to espouse beliefs even after they no longer believe in them because \\"it is the proper thing to do.\\" Brilliant, witty, and clever, this is probably one of my new favourite satirical works, right up there with \\"A Modest Proposal.\\" It's definitely not something that would be enjoyed in a required university class, but anyone who's studied comparative religion or philosophy, or is at least familiar with the absurdities in all philosophical systems, should enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Candide (Franklin Library)","review":"According to Woody Allen the world is made up of two types of people: the horrible and the miserable. The horrible consist of the crippled, the maimed, and the chronically disabled; the miserable are everyone else. Candide, who believes in the thinking of his tutor, the philosopher Dr. Pangloss, travels throughout the then known world in search of someone who is truly happy. Dr. Pangloss is of the belief that everything that happens to one--whether for good or for bad--is all for the best in \\"this best of all possible worlds.\\" Martin, a philosopher with whom Candide later becomes acquainted, like Woody Allen after him, subscribes to the belief that everyone is unhappy and is doomed to suffer one misfortune after another.Candide himself experiences one tragedy after another. Candide is swindled out of wealth that he accumulates in Eldorado, he suffers beatings, imprisonment, and endless humiliations. He is kicked in the rear end for kissing Cunegonde, his sweetheart for whom he searches the world over. He is even in a shipwreck and is forced to swim ashore. Candide calls out in despair to the absent Dr. Pangloss, for Candide hears only tales of woe from those he meets in his journey._Candide_ should not be taken too seriously. It is meant as a parable and a satire on religious beliefs and on human behavior. That people are greedy, selfish, dishonest, and enjoy inflicting pain on others should be no surprise to anyone who reads _Candide_. It is not unusual for characters in the book to be killed and later to return to life, or for a protagonist who is physically attractive to become aged and ugly, then later on to regain beauty. _Candide_ is an easy read with short chapters. It is rather entertaining, but can be very depressing at times. Its the message at the end--that love and friendship are what makes life meaningful--that is undeniably positive."},{"Title":"Candide (Franklin Library)","review":"One of the most popular philosophical ideas in Europe during the eighteenth century was that of \\"all is for the best in the best of all possible worlds\\". It was the catch-phrase for Leibniz's argument that because god had created the world, everything was made to occur for the best because god's creations couldn't be evil. So even events that seem tragic and pointless are actually part of some larger, cosmically good plan that mere humans can't see. Therefore we should all accept our fate, and know that everything happens for the best, because we live in the best of all possible worlds.Voltaire, a man who had twice been imprisoned in the Bastille and then exiled, thought this was a crock of you-know-what. Candide, subtitled Optimism, is his satirical response to this idea. Clearly humour was one of Voltaire's strong assets; Candide is quite funny. Many critics say that the characters aren't well developed, but I think that they're broadly drawn on purpose. I believe that one of the reasons Candide still works in our time is that we can identify the characters with people we know, and so we can follow their relationships and actions. For example, the old woman (who is never named) has seen what life has to offer, and cannot be surprised by anything anymore. I'm sure we all know at least one person like this. And Pangloss is basically a self-help guru, spouting out feel-good nonsense and getting paid a lot of money for his time. Candide is also somewhat short on dialog versus explication, but I didn't mind it.However, the major drawback is that Candide was written in the eighteenth century, when the idea of the best possible world was so popular. Therefore the book is not an explanation and then rebuttal of it. Candide is only Voltaire's shout of disgust with it, and so the original idea is not addressed in any depth. In order to recover a large amount of the sarcasm, one would have to be fairly proficient in eighteenth-century philosophy.Even with this weakness, I still found Candide a funny, enjoyable short read, and that Voltaire's basic ideas came through in the end."},{"Title":"Candide (Franklin Library)","review":"In response to the person who complained about the English translation of Candide featured in this book, I wish to point out a few things. Firstly, the French of the original version by Voltaire cannot be considered as 'modern,' even though it is perfectly understandable to the modern reader. There are a few archaic touches here and there, sometimes because the language has evolved, sometimes because Voltaire intended it so (e.g. the title of the first chapter, &quot;et comment il fut chass&eacute; d'icelui&quot; &gt; &quot;and how he was driven thence&quot;, or something like that, was archaic even for Voltaire). I find the English translation fairly accurate in that respect. This is the opinion of a native French speaker, though.Secondly, and consequently, the use of 'thou' in the translation is understandable. This is not the 'clerical' thou as can still be read in the English Bible and other 'flavoured' translations, but the older 'thou', which had become in Late Middle English the familiar, even contemptuous form of the deferential pronoun 'ye' (originally exclusively plural). The 'clerical' thou is a relatively modern device used in certain type of writings to convey an archaic language, but it is really an 'invention.' Therefore, the use of 'thou' in Candide, where the French has the familiar form 'tu,' is acceptable ; but it certainly can be misleading to the modern reader.That is not to say this is the perfect translation -- such a thing does not exist. Where Voltaire uses understatement to great comic effect I find the translator usually too emphatic. Also the French version is much more vulgar in places. I suppose this translation is quite old ; there are others, but I did not read them.To those considering purchasing or reading this book: do so, by all means. Candide is a thought-provoking, entertaining and humorous tale for readers of various tastes. It is a classic."},{"Title":"Candide (Franklin Library)","review":"Candide, is a satire, irony, sarcasm and hyperbole. In this novel he punctuates the naivete of optimism in a cruel, corrupt and bellicose world. In developing this theme Voltaire satirizes the philosophy of Leibniz who contended that earth is the best world possible inasmuch as it was created by a benevolent, omniscient, all-powerful God. Voltaire mercilessly ridicules Leibniz and his philosophy as simple-minded and unrealistic. Voltaire uses wit to mock the practitioners of bigotry, superstition and tyranny. This is a fairly easy read and I would recommend it."},{"Title":"Candide (Franklin Library)","review":"Check for ISBN: 0143039423.I read Candide years ago; however, while looking through the shelves of the local bookstore I stopped dead in my tracks when I saw this new presentation.

However, read the book, not just the cover, for one of the smartest satires ever written.Candide tells of the outrageous adventures of the nave Candide, who steadfastly believes that \\"all is for the best\\" even when faced with the injustice, suffering, and despair of the world. Following his eviction from his home for a tryst with his stepsister, he sets out to find the \\"best of all possible worlds\\" that his mentor Dr. Pangloss cannot stop extolling. Allthewhile Candide and his friends barely keep from being killed or tortured at every turn. Controversial for its time (the 18th century) and entertaining still today; Candide is a book that is relevant even now in our society, where \\"the mania for insisting that all is well when all is by no means well\\" prevails.I am an avowed classics hater who could never make it through a single volume of anything in any Literature class. Never in a million years would I have picked up this book if not for a recommendation by Kurt Vonnegut in one of his autobiographical works. He highly recommended Candide, and being my favorite author, I could not help but be intrigued. I found it in the bookstore and it was short enough to read in one sitting.The sight of this clever new edition brought a wonderful work of literature back into my mind and I could not help but read it again.

Their uncaring verdict on the loss of lives from the earthquake in Lisbon coupled with their arrogance and lack of tact in the time of suffering was fuel for Voltaire's fire.The book is fairly short and can be read in one sitting; it is laugh out loud funny in some places as the most absurd things happen to the major characters. I read it mostly because I like satire and not to get any particular message out of it. The story is pretty straightforward and I guess it does raise a few questions in the readers mind about what our purpose in this life is, how to find happiness, contentment etc... but it can also be read for the pleasure of \`listening' to one of the wittiest men that has ever lived (or so they tell me).I have not done justice to this book, and you can read longer reviews about it on this site, but I would advice you to read it yourself and then make up your mind.

That hurts!(reacting to the sorry metaphor of my subject line)I found Voltaire's famous satire surprisingly tepid. Perhaps I've become jaded in my old age, or perhaps I should have read this in the 18th century when it caused such a sensation because of the scandalous way that Voltaire satirized the church, the clergy, and just about everybody else in any position of power or influence. Reading it now, it seems a bit tame. All the horrors and stupidities Voltaire describes seem almost commonplace considering what we have experienced since he made his attack on optimism in 1759. Today we can look back at two world wars, at the Holocaust and Hiroshima, at the war in Vietnam, at terrorism and the latest stupidity in Iraq. Nothing in Candide can compare to these real historical events that have so sorely tested human optimism. We can even look back to the French Revolution and the revolutions that followed in the 19th century, which in a sense Voltaire predicted with his devastating critique of the corrupt and degenerate European society. Or we can recall the Catholic priests and Ted Haggard from yesterday's headlines. Plus ca change, plus c'est la meme chose.It is difficult to appreciate how deliciously scandalous this was in Voltaire's time since today we are free to criticize the church and our governments, whereas in Voltaire's time such criticisms could land you in the Bastille. Voltaire's legendary reputation for rapier wit and shocking turn of phrase can be found in these pages, but much of it seems diluted because his style has so often been imitated. We have read and reread his imitators, and we have even read some who have improved upon him in some ways, people in America like Mark Twain, Ambrose Bierce and H. L. Mencken. We tend to forget where they got their inspiration at least in part. An example from The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (episodic in structure much like Candide, by the way) is in the rascals that Huck and Jim meet on the river, the Duke of \\"Bilgewater\\" and the \\"King of France,\\" who, like the six \\"kings\\" that Candide sups with in Venice, are out and our frauds and represent the impossible, deluded aspirations of the average person.This is the work in which we have Dr. Pangloss and his \\"best of all possible worlds.\\" And this is the work which ends with Candide summing up all the philosophy he has learned in his travels with the words, \\"'Tis well said, but we must cultivate our gardens.\\""},{"Title":"Candide (Franklin Library)","review":"The style of exposition used in this book is reminiscent of The Misfortunes of Virtue by the Marquis de Sade. Voltaire presents a catalog of calamities meant to debunk the belief that our world is perfect, and that everything happens \\"for the best\\" according to some divine plan. While there is no doubt that Candide is persuasive in its comical misadventures, the style gets old just as it did in The Misfortunes of Virtue. The story becomes a trite joke that loses its potency with each subsequent catastrophe, so that half way through the novel the reader no longer cares what befalls Candide and begins to pray that some benevolent deity will put him out of his (and our) misery. If I were not so thoroughly desensitized to tragedy, and had I not already come to the philosophical conclusions that Voltaire is trying to lead his reader, then I might have found the novel to be more profound. Still the novel is well written, reads quickly if you ignore the endnotes*, and is fairly entertaining.* Every time I was compelled to read an endnote just to find out that Voltaire was referencing some long dead frenchman I wanted to fling the book across the room."},{"Title":"Candide (Franklin Library)","review":"This book is at once both hilarious and horrifying. To have a book possess both these features and still be well done is a noteworthy feat. Well, I guess that Voltaire has accomplished a noteworthy feat. The tale is about a young man named Candide who was brought up under the tutelage of a chap named Pangloss. Pangloss is a caricature of the philosopher Leibniz, who believed that ours' is &quot;the best of all possible worlds&quot; because it was molded and shaped by an omnipotent creator. The name itself is also a pun: Pan (which is Greek for &quot;all&quot;) gloss (which is French for talk): Pangloss = All-talk. At any rate, Voltaire finds out (and continues to find out) that this Pollyanna view of life can be rather troublesome to the senses. He experiences the horrors of war, separation from his beloved, shipwreck, unfortunate misunderstandings, robbery and a plethora of other misfortunes. He also makes it to the mythical utopia of Eldorado, only to find that it's not all it's cracked up to be, either. This is a first rate classic that deals with the meaning of life, the $60,000 question &quot;Is anyone out there really happy?&quot; as well as many delightful lesser questions.

In less than one hundred pages, Voltaire manages to skewer religion, politics, bigotry, love, hatred, optimism, cosmopolitanism, agrarian idealization, and everything else he could get his eighteenth-century hands on. The book is not perfect (I could have done without that slight anti-Semitic barb at the very end), but is scathingly brilliant and often laught-out-loud hilarious. A must-read for anyone who wishes to be worthy of the term \\"cynic\\"."},{"Title":"Candide (Franklin Library)","review":"To call this book a satire and suggest that it is funny, or well done, or relevant to recent times, may be true but that fails to point out what is obvious. Voltaire was a French Enlightment writer. He used wit to make his points. He made fun of the teachings of the Church but he was pushing for religious freedom. He had strong opinions and the book was a tool to presenting his thoughts. The book is considered to be one of the most significant works of Western Canon due to its portrayal of the human condition.The story is intended to satirize the idea of optimism. The approach was developed in the events of a trip. The events of the trip allow him to interchange the tragedy and the comedy within the various situations that occurred. This is a unique approach but it allowed him to develop a look at good and evil as well as the role of God and Government in men's lives. The satirical approach allowed him cover to focus his criticism.A simple story. Young man leaves his home but really he has to leave having been caught kissing the wrong person. Sill optimistic he joins the army. He is flogged. Later almost burned alive. He sets out to see the world but continues to believe, as he was taught early in his life, that he is indeed living in the \\"best of all possible worlds\\". It seems as though nothing goes well. One tragedy after another. Funny but sad. Then after what seems to be an endless ordeal he returns and settles for life in a garden. Even so, still optimistic perhaps, he says that \\"we must cultivate our garden\\".His book and his story challenge the idea that \\"all is for the best\\" in a world where it is often assumed that things \\"work out for the best\\"."},{"Title":"Candide (Franklin Library)","review":"Everytime Somerset Maugham set out to write a novel etc. he reread Voltaire's Candide.

Apparently, it's aged very well."},{"Title":"Candide (Franklin Library)","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading Voltaire's Candide. Voltaire's use of satire and irony creates timeless humor that can be appreciated by many readers. Candide, Voltaire's protagonist, is not necessarily a character with whom readers would relate. Like most of the characters in the novel, Candide is a caricature, an exaggeration of optimism, ignorance, and nave views. Voltaire proves through his novel that sometimes the best way to make a lasting effect on one's audience is to show something in its most blatant form. Voltaire's sarcasm and ridicule of a particular party or stereotype can seem a bit harsh at times. However, I think that Voltaire felt the combination of humor and tough criticism was the best way to bring to light his own disgust with hypocrisy within the church and government. The situations and conflicts that Voltaire places his characters in produce surprising illustrations of issues of the 1700's, such as war, poverty, and prostitution. Although this novel was written nearly 250 years ago, striking parallels can be drawn between the issues that Voltaire comments on and the issues that authors of our time choose to focus on in their literature."},{"Title":"Candide (Franklin Library)","review":"I had to read this book for my world literature class, and was absolutely blown away.

Definitely one of the best books I have ever read, though."},{"Title":"Candide (Franklin Library)","review":"&quot;Candide&quot; by Voltaire is probably the best non-fiction work that I've read in a long time. It serves as a satirical introduction the philosophical problem of evil and as an attack on the philosophy of optimism, which is still adhered to today, although perhaps not like in Voltaire's time.Voltaire eviscerates everyone's sacred cows. He satarizes everything. Nothing is not reduced to rubble by his vitriolic writing. In &quot;Candide&quot; Voltaire intelligently satarizes: Christians, Jews, Muslims, war, authority, religious intolerance and bigotry, free will, determinism, the Bible, priests, imams, monks, France, the Papacy, the Inquisition, the Catholic Church, the Protestants, the Jesuits, the Spaniards, the English, Frederick the Great, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibnitz, the so-called morals of religious figures, as well as optimism, and pessimism.There is no work of fiction that has a better grounding in fact than &quot;Candide.&quot; And the final statement of the book, that we must cultivate our garden, is the most universal task put to mankind. It serves as an answer to evil, and as an indictment: Life is a garden, your life is your own garden, YOU must cultivate it in order to reap its benefits. Thus, Voltaire ends his razing of life by endowing it with purpose and meaning.This book is a great adventure in philosophy, satire, religion, and life. It is an easy read, although it can spawn discussions and questions bound to confound almost any theologian. Too bad I can only give it five stars."},{"Title":"Candide (Franklin Library)","review":"Much as in The Autocrat at the Breakfast Table, in which ideas are thrown around under the premise of a breakfast room table conversation, Voltaire expresses his philosophical insights by having his character (Candide) engage himself in a number of conversations with a wide range of people.

But in order for one to experience the satire involved in the book, one needs to look at the time at which the book was read, and take in some other readings by Voltaire. To clarify one person's statement that Voltaire did not develop the character's or show the reader his (Candide's) travels, it was simply because he had no time. Candide was written under 48 hours by Voltaire and he was slightly angry when he wrote it (the night before he started, he had been jailed by the government and retaliated by writing a satire)."},{"Title":"Candide (Franklin Library)","review":"Writen hundreds of years ago it's just as true today as when Voltaire wrote it.

In fact, many of the greatest works of literature are both comedies and tragedies. Candide is probably the greatest example of such a work from a French author. Penned under a pseudonym by the great thinker, Voltaire, this work is superficially an adventure novel about the title character traveling the known world to find his love, while accompanied by Pangloss. In reality, the book is a parody of human society, culture, philosophy, and mentality. The result is a short, witty and insightful examination of the human condition.

The philosophy of optimism is silly! Absurd things happen! Cue another character who only stands for symbols and has no real personality!This is why I don't read satire very often.I gave this two stars rather than one because I recognize that one may potentially get a chuckle out of the some of the ridiculous situations, and that someone more well acquainted with the particular philosophies may find Voltaire's criticism more entertaining.

It's not a literary masterpiece, but a quick and funny satire. In style, it reads something like Swift's &quot;Gulliver's Travels&quot;, but its humor is more pointed and its satire more trenchant.Candide is an illegitimate boy expelled from his adoptive home for kissing the Baron's daughter. A simple and candid man, he resolutely adheres to his tutor's absurd theory that &quot;all is for the best&quot;. In coming years, Candide and everyone he meets suffer tortures, rapes, slavery, and death. Yet Candide remains ever the silly optimist, chasing the Baron's daughter around the world and giving Voltaire space to vent against the happy feel-good philosophers with their buzzwords, tautological reasoning, and empty aphorisms. The tutor, for example, demonstrates the &quot;necessity&quot; of syphillus, as having brought chocolate to Europe though &quot;it is to be observed that this malady is, like religious controversy, peculiar to our continent&quot;.Candide is a quick satire, silly and contrived, but we can read it with pleasure 250 later, long after the targets of Voltaire's wit have faded away."},{"Title":"Candide (Franklin Library)","review":"i should start by saying that i like voltaire very much but can't understand how this work has come to overshadow his &quot;alphabet of wit&quot;. if u can get a hold of this little book it will be well worth your time. far more amusing and intelligible than candide. voltaire could be a very funny man and there really wasn't a lot of humour in candide. i thought candide was a bit boring at times. also, he did NOT demolish the argument that this is the best of all possible worlds. with matter there are limitaions and the arguments are complex. this book deals with none of them. but i still adore voltaire."},{"Title":"Candide (Franklin Library)","review":"My personal opinion of the genre of \`fables' is that unless one is intimately familiar with the author's biography and is sufficiently versed in history, books like \`Don Quixote', \`The Alchemist', or \`Candide' should only be read before bedtime and to an audience of no older than 12 years of age.Like any other fable, \`Candide' raises a few of the basic questions of life: wealth, the issues of free will, religion, optimism in the hardest of times, metaphysics of life and of course - love. Expect that a lot is hidden behind the names of the numerous characters introduced by Voltaire. Some of the examples the author uses do not sit well with me - take the one with the raping Bulgarian warriors and their king (by the time the book was written, Bulgaria was into its 400th year of Ottoman slavery without any kings or queens).At times the book drags, especially with Candide's endless voyages, or recounts of seemingly impossible stories.I would've rather reread \`The Stranger' by Camus than read this one in the first place.- by Simon Cleveland"},{"Title":"Candide (Franklin Library)","review":"When I started this very short book, I expected it to be a drone-fest from the 1700s.

Voltaire is poking fun at things much larger than the Leibnizian philosophy that serves as the focal point for attack in this this novella; the central message (contained within the last few lines of the story) is that there are more pressing, immediate, and pragmatic concerns to life than philosophies, dogmas, and the like. Voltaire was the pragmatic's philosopher, the anti-philosopher in many senses. His rejection of blind followings, philosophical &quot;proof,&quot; and &quot;schools&quot; of thought is clear within this sharp-witted text.It's a great read for anyone who's been stomped on for thinking &quot;outside of the box.&quot; I would recommend that those readers with a more thorough background (and interest) in religious and philosophical literature and history look up Voltaire's magnum opus, the *Philosophical Dictionary.* Don't be fooled by its title; it's anything but dry, stale definitions.A great read with some light Mozart and good tea.=)"},{"Title":"Candide (Franklin Library)","review":"...

Candide shouldn't be read for it's character development - it should be read for it's message. One thing I must add is the virulent anti-semitism which is found in this book.

This discovery greatly lowered my opinion of him.Still, Candide is a must read for anyone interested in classical literature of important medieval thought."},{"Title":"Candide (Franklin Library)","review":"Flat out one of the funniest books I've ever read. I thought that Jonathan Swift was satirically vicious in Gulliver's Travels and \\"A Modest Proposal,\\" but Voltaire makes Dean Swift seem a mere Yahoo. One of the most astonishing features of this short, picaresque novel is the speed of the narrative. Works a few centuries old are usually not notable for being quick reads, but I found myself devouring sentences, paragraphs, and chapters at an alarming rate. Alarming because I'd reached the end with nothing more to read.The tale of Candide, the naive hero, who is separated from his love, the deliciously and vulgarly named Cunegonde, is a vehicle for Voltaire to skewer humanity in every way, shape, and form. No aspect of human endeavor is spared his rapier wit--religion, religious figures, the military, government, rulers, nationalities, philosophers and philosophy, sexuality, class dinstinctions, lawyers, the inhospitable natural world, drunkenness and gluttony, etc., and the humor is produced by the accumulation of detail that is used to describe the misfortunes of the various characters. To compound the irony, the tale begins with the pronouncement of Candide's inept tutor Doctor Pangloss that this is \\"the best of all possible worlds.\\"In the course of their adventures, the characters are kicked, slapped, raped, disemboweled, hanged, burnt at the stake, drowned, stabbed, bayoneted, impaled, blinded, amputated, and my favorite--eaten. The old lady with one buttock, a companion to Cunegonde, at one point says of herself: \\"Imagine the situation of a Pope's daughter aged fifteen, who in three months had undergone poverty and slavery, had been raped nearly every day, had seen her mother cut into four pieces, had undergone hunger and war, and now dying of the plague in Algiers.\\"Well, she survived, was bought and sold several times, and wound up with some Janizaries in a fort under siege by the Russians. \\"The twenty Janizaries had sworn never to surrender us. The extremities of hunger to which they were reduced forced them to eat our two eunuchs for fear of breaking their oath. Some days later they resovled to eat the women.\\" A compassionate Imam intervened, however. \\"'Cut,' said he, 'only one buttock from each of these ladies and you will still have an excellent meal; if you have to return, there will still be as much left in a few days; Heaven will be pleased at so charitable an action and you will be saved.'\\"All of this detail takes place in the space of half a page and is typical of the rest of the text--savage meat for the free-thinking mind."},{"Title":"Candide (Franklin Library)","review":"...in the convulsions of disquiet or the lethargy of boredom.\\"The subject quote from \\"Candide\\" is another version of the idea expressed in the Chinese aphorism concerning the curse of living in \\"interesting times,\\" that is, times that are \\"exciting\\" to read about if one did not actually live through them. Voltaire, a pseudonym, was one of the intellectual giants of the enlightenment. He was a prolific writer; this book is his most read legacy. A major impetus for writing this book was to refute Leibnitz's philosophy of optimism, best exemplified by Voltaire's character, Dr. Pangloss, whose continued philosophical touchstone is: \\"This is the best of all possible worlds.\\" For anyone who has lived through even a portion of the 20th Century, one would not think such a philosophy needed refuting. But apparently it still does, as witnessed by Barbara Ehrenreich'sBright-Sided: How Positive Thinking Is Undermining America. I first read \\"Candide\\" some forty years ago, and decided to re-read after portions of my own life experience have also helped refute Leibnitz.Candide, at a very youthful age, is kicked out of his own \\"Garden of Eden,\\" which is a German castle in Westphalia, after kissing his first love, and almost only love, Cunegund. Dr. Pangloss was a private tutor at the castle. Candide then commences a wild and extremely improbable romp across much of the known world. He is dragooned into the Bulgarian (Prussian) Army, is beaten, escapes, and meets Dr. Pangloss along the way, who is now a beggar, with syphilis. They join a generous Anabaptist, and take a ship to Lisbon, which had just been destroyed in an earthquake (the background event is historically correct; Lisbon was destroyed by an earthquake in 1755). Candide is only one of three survivors from the shipwreck. Dr. Pangloss is hanged by the forces of the Inquisition. Speaking of which, he again meets his first love, Cunegund, who has become a \\"kept woman,\\" on alternate days of the week (naturally!) by a Jew, and the Grand Inquisitor. Candide kills them both, and flees in her company, and that of an old woman, first to Cadiz, and then on to Buenos Aires. The old woman's story is also bizarre and improbable. She is the illegitimate daughter of Pope Urban X, who, inter alia, had half her buttock's removed by Turkish defenders of Azov, during their wars with Russia, so that they would not starve. Candide visits much of South America, including a kingdom where diamonds and gold are just so many pebbles. He acquires a few, which finances his latter journeys to Venice and Istanbul.Sure, this is satire, but for many a reader, the question would remain: Of what? Clearly it is not the best of all possible worlds, and a partial catalog of the evils of the mid-1700's does not seem necessary to confirm this. Way, way back there in high school, when I first read this, I had been taught that wild and improbable coincidences, such as appeared inThe Mayor of Casterbridge (Enriched Classics (Pocket))weere not good literature. Yet, in \\"Candide,\\" Pangloss did not actually die in the hanging, and Cunegard's brother was not actually killed by the sword that ran him through. Even making allowance for the objectives of satire, it does wear a bit thin.Voltaire was a scathing critic of the rigid dogmatism of the Catholic Church, and I say bravo to that. One of the biggest \\"takeaways\\" on the re-read is a footnote in my Washington Square copy that said that \\"Pope Urban X\\" was a fictitious name, since at the time the Catholic Church had so much power than even a critic like Voltaire did not dare use the name of a real Pope, even a deceased one. The evils of the world are acknowledged; Voltaire's advice to help us get through: cultivate your own private garden. That advice still resonates through the centuries. Well, I have to get ready for the spring planting. 4-stars."},{"Title":"Candide (Franklin Library)","review":"Candide by VoltaireThis is a great classic. \\"Candide\\" treats important philosophical questions in unusual way.

By experiencing murder, beating, torture, censorship, banishment, theft, and slavery this group of loosely tied adventurers inquire about the most intricate details of life's philosophies in the most lighthearted and witty quips centering around God's general plan for the betterment of society as a whole and the individual sacrifices and seemingly absurd happenstances needed to occur for this greater progress to occur.This seems to culminate in discussions around drunken card games held at baron's and other highly-esteemed officials pallaces where there thousands of dust-collecting books seems to be the ultimate symbolic farce of the pointlessness of societal mores and trivial critical establishments. Afterwards, after many unlikely events and quick turnarounds from despair to wealthy gleeming back to gloomy hopelessness, Candide and his journeyman Martin come across other mentors and enemies from his past, as well as his long sought after lover Cunegonde, to find them in the most deplorable conditions and with many regrets, but yet with unflayling blind optimism.The book greatly picks up from their journey into the utopian like village of El Dorado onwards and then gains the respect that has been hyped upon it. However, I still think this is overrated and maybe the translation has lost some of the supposed wit and fancy of the original Frenchman's work and his rhyme and prose style.In the end, we are all left to create our own Garden of Eden from whatever limited/superfluous environments affordable and available to us and make the best of the people, places, culture, and tools to us. You can loose your mind and you will be among the many who have lost their minds, certainly in the majority and only by crossing that boundary of supposed weakness can you transcend the peculiar weaknesses of the mind and body.A toast to Voltaire for his lively and everlasting work!"},{"Title":"Candide (Franklin Library)","review":"This is a &quot;laugh-out-loud&quot; funny book.

There are different versions and interpretations of the French satire, and I think that some is lost perhaps in our interpretation of the satire (as to what we perceive to be satire modern day, as opposed to the time period), and the French to English translation itself. Nonetheless, this is a great book and I especially enjoyed the smooth prose throughout the book.Candide travels all over Europe, Turkey, and SOuth America and finds himself having epiphanies on every adventure. This book makes me think of the things that we value in society and how are cultural norms and complacency can rob us of the will to take risks and live. One of my favorite quotes, towards the end of the book puts the novels' themes into clear perspective for me.The old woman says, \\"I should like to know which is worse, to be raped a hundred times by negro pirates, to have a buttock cut off, to run the gauntlet among the Bulgarians, to be whipped and flogged in an uto-da-fe, to be dissected, to row in a galley, in short, to endure all the miseries through which we have passed, or to remain doing nothing.\\" They inevitably conclude that \\" man was born to live in the convulsions of distress or in the lethargy of boredome.\\"This is a timeless book and a MUST READ."},{"Title":"Candide (Franklin Library)","review":"The book is for class starting soon, so not used it yet but it was in good shape and on time."},{"Title":"Candide (Franklin Library)","review":"I love the book, i would recommend it to my friends and family.

The short, sharp, effortlessly satirical style and wit of the work tends to distract from the scope which the work acheives.

As a comprehensable, logically structured novel it can be at times confusing.The great thing about \\"Candide\\" is Voltaire treats these characters in a way I feel satire works best. You need characters who are complete cliche, sterotypes of those being mocked. Satire I feel only works when you are without limits. Go overbroad, get crazy, but always remain consistant. Don't get serious on your audience when the first 50 pages did not. It breaks your flow. And Voltaire stays true to that form.In some ways \\"Candide\\" reminds me of the work of Homer. It is a grand epic where one absurb event after another takes place, but sometimes it leaves you scrathing your head wondering, \\"how did we come to this\\"? You can argue Voltaire, in an attempt to pass one by the censors of the day had to make the book seems \\"pointless\\" so the government wouldn't be offened, but, we come to ask ourselves, what side is Voltaire really on?He seemed to be for the enlightment, but Pangloss, who is a symbol for the enlightenment, is presented as such a fool, who repeated says everything happens for the best when nothing is working out. Is Voltaire saying the enlightenment has lost its way? If so, he never really provides a way for it to redeem itself.Many of his attacks on society can still be agrued today, especially his opinion of the government which makes the book a worthwhile read, but the structure of the story and much of the character set-up I found poorly done.In short the novel works well as an example of great social and political satire, but can be improved in story development.** 1\\\\2 out of *****Bottom-line: Voltaire's wit reminds me of Oscar Wilde.

Kurt G&ouml;del, humanity's greatest logician, had it exactly right when he bluntly asked, \\"Who ever became more intelligent by reading Voltaire's writings?\\" People too dense or disinterested to follow Leibniz's deliberations regarding the reciprocal entanglements of possibility, freedom (openness), complexity and contingency--which do not of logical necessity (or even logical implication) have anything whatever to do with Voltaire's pedestrian concept of \\"optimism\\"-- won't have a clue as to what Voltaire is attempting to mock. And they won't be alone. If we suppose that Leibniz was Voltaire's true target, then Voltaire apparently had no clue about that which Voltaire was attempting to mock.All of that may be, if only just slightly, too harsh. Voltaire (Franois-Marie Arouet) doesn't actually claim to even know exactly what Leibniz's philosophical treatment of \`possible worlds' was! While he mocks Leibniz by name, his treatise (if we may call this little catalog of misfortunes a treatise) assails a simple-minded caricature of Leibniz's \`possible worlds,' Voltaire merely batters a clownish straw man. Whatever Voltaire's target or motivation, this is no work of serious philosophy, and yet, so long as you don't irrationally expect anything of epistemological or general philosophical weight, this goofy little romp is modestly entertaining, and more memorable than more complex (and more rigorous) works which, unlike Candide, actually require critical thought. Perhaps one person has attempted Leibniz for every 5,000 that have enjoyed Voltaire's fluffy sarcasms. For every 10,000 that have read Candide, perhaps one has grasped Leibniz's \`possible worlds.'

Voltaire's humor, already delivered dryly, is lost to the same culprit, as is his sarcasm. Once stripped of those crucial elements &quot;Candide&quot; reads like the outline of a potentially great tale. But it cannot be considered a story, too much is lacking. 1. The tale is 90% exposition. Rather than showing us dear Candide's many wondrous travels, letting us come along, allowing us to feel the events unfolding, we are summarily told. 2. Though the plot takes many turns, some of them clever, there is no art to the writing. We are simply, and again summarily, hurried from place to place, twist to twist. 3. There is no character development. All we ever know of Candide is that he is naive, that he does not learn from his experience, and that he has some truly horrid luck. There is nothing to make us care about him, or any of the characters. At most we say, \`Oh, that's too bad.' But we say it without feeling or concern. 4. Of the final 10%, nine is dialogue. In this we get our only glimpse of Voltaire's intelligence. But as pleasing as that is to see, it cannot make up for the artless way he placed his words. Each character, regardless of upbringing or social standing, speaks in exactly the same manner as every other character, and I suspect that they all speak in a manner that was exactly as Voltaire may have spoken. The remaining 1% is spent, poorly, on some very minimal scenes. He spends so little time on actual scenes, that it seems he must have considered them a great inconvenience. Voltaire gives us no more than is required, which is wonderful in any descriptive passage, including the setting of any scene, but it's all done just as artlessly as the exposition and dialogue. The ending is good. There is a little moralizing, telling us to look to our own lives, but it's done with subtlety. This is the one place Voltaire's simple style pays off. This book is best suited to those of simple and undeveloped literary minds. Those who know anything about writing or good literature can find many better books, under and outside of the &quot;Classic&quot; umbrella."},{"Title":"Candide (Franklin Library)","review":"aside from it's ugly ass nauseating cover i liked everything about this book"},{"Title":"The Bell","review":"On the cover of my book it says &quot;Her (Iris Murdoch) wise, witty and compulsive novel.

It reverberates with sensuality. It probes our identity and reveals a broad spectrum of darkness and light.In The Bell things are not as they seem. Murdoch creates a world in which nothing is mundane. See for instance how she describes the transforming magic of the evening sun: \\"They came quite suddenly out of the wood onto the wide expanse of grass near the drive. The great scene, the familiar scene, was there again before them, lit by a very yellow and almost vanished sun, the sky fading to a greenish blue. From here they looked a little down upon the lake and could see, intensely tinted and very still, the reflection in it of the farther slope and the house, clear and pearly grey in the revealing light, its detail sharply defined, starting into nearness. Beyond it on the pastureland, against a pallid line at the horizon, the trees took the declining sun, and one oak tree, its leaves already turning yellow, seemed to be on fire\\".Imber Court is the site of a lay community of spiritual seekers. They are struggling on a path of sanctification - living lives of hopeful but naive becoming. Across the brooding waters of a mysterious lake is Imber Abbey; a cloistered community presumably of those who already have become. The Abbey is imbued with supernatural power and light, even as a dark magic lurks beneath the surface of the lake. None in the community of seekers will escape this power encounter unscathed - though in the end for some there is a kind of freedom.This is a classic in every sense of the word and one that can be read over and over again."},{"Title":"The Bell","review":"This story opens with Dora Greenfield, a creative spirit who has trapped herself in a marriage where the husband spends more time degrading her than nurturing her. She's ran away and shacked up with another free spirit but this doesn't last for long and she ends up following her husband Paul, an art historian, to a small community of God-fearing people who have set up a settlement out side a nunnery called Imber Abbey. This group is lead by Micheal Meade, a man with his own secrets and internal turmoil. Micheal owns the land outside the Abbey which the members affectionately call Imber Court. These two seem like the most unlikely duo to establish a relationship with one another but without knowing it they do.There are a host of other characters that affect their lives in both positive and negative ways. There's Noel the journalist, Toby the student, Nick the renegade, Catherine the future nun, Murphy the dog, and Gabriel... the bell. A reference to an old church bell buried in the sludge of the lake between the Abbey and the Court is made throughout the book giving it a position of an important character. Dora even suggests as much when the bell is finally unearthed. \\"She came near to the bell which seemed more and more like a living presence.\\"There are a number of strong issues throughout the Bell but the most dominant is religion. This is followed by a healthy dose of homosexuality, marriage and adultery. Some sources site a strong theme of good and evil (probably associated with religious beliefs) but I think evil is really too harsh a term. There are no real evil people or situations in this story. It's about a group of people trying to make it through this life as best they know how while dealing with the foreseen, unforeseen and exaggerated bumps they encounter along the way. Murdoch does use her philosophical background to insert interesting questions along the way like: \\"Could one recognize refinements of good if one did not recognize refinements of evil?\\"Iris Murdoch's The Bell is her fourth of twenty-six published novels. It was released in 1958 but takes place in England in the late forties. This is my second Murdoch novel and I found it flows and is much more vivid in detail than her first book, Under the Net. While I felt this book was certainly better than my first taste of Murdoch, as a whole it bored the heck out of me. Seriously, after the first chapter until they brought up the bell I was bored silly. I realized that is quite a subjective statement but if I had not committed myself to reading all her books I probably would have stopped here. Language differences often slow story down: \\"After breakfast he repaired as usual to the estate office to cast an eye over the day's correspondence (page 88).\\" Or just unusual, \\"From within the dog's barking was redoubled (page 53).\\" And while cliche is perfectly understandable to most I think it's the easy way for someone who was considered such an established writer.

An additional point however might be that Murdoch does not make-up fictions. Characters' and place names, historical happenings, religious texts, etc imbue fictional facts with two or three allusions. To recognize these parallels is an exercise of memory and astute reading because the reader gets entangled in the emotional excitements of Toby, Dora, Michael, and others as a swimmer in the lake's slimy weeds or a walker on the unexpected forest path. One replay occurs between the monastery's legend of the trespasser and nun and the penetrating actions of Toby and Catherine, who respectively go deeper beyond the cloister's outer wall and into the wood and lake. The reader knows the mental workings of main characters and perceives how their companions assess them. Murdoch however does not reveal everyone's interior, keeping opaque the minds of Nick, Catherine, the Straffords, etc, who nevertheless are assessed by the lay community members. All is contained in the whole -- the still lake through which the mechanical noise cuts, the judgments of fitting in or being out, restrictive rules and wild freedom, the mixed-up attraction of males and females, the invisible life within the cloister and the open-air visibility of the laymen, and the retreat into innocence and the running with experience. This novel packs in everything as if the author is creating the world, consecrating A to Z with love rather than assessment. Each evolving, imperfect character is acceptable and valid without extraneous impositions. S/he naturally heads in the direction of the good."},{"Title":"The Bell","review":"I read before Her 'severe head' and 'Italian Girl'.Although both were very interesting , my favourite one is the 'Bell'.

I liked this one better than the other one which one the Booker Prize in 1978. Murdoch was an extraordinary person who appeared ordinary to us but had an amazing mind. I think that's part of the problem. She expects others to be similar as well, cerebral or trying to get somewhere higher than lower. Her characters in both novels never really appear content with their lives. While I love the novel cover on both texts, I found Iris' writing to be superb in bringing to life about mundane characters. I think Iris was a great observer in humanity and what she saw as their failings. In life, she was happily married for almost 50 years to John Bayley and led a very active career in the colleges and publishing. Her novels are not set to be easy but an labyrinth of wonder, questions, expectations, and disappointments. Iris' wrote longhand and she wasn't viewed as typically attractive but seen as fun and intelligent beyond belief. She was one of a kind. I don't think it ever occurred to her to leave John ever. THeir relationship was a union based on mutual trust, respect, understanding, and intelligence. They talked about the radio soap, THe ARchers, and lived without a television but in a pigsty. Of course, it was their home. IRis wrote this novel which showed her enormous capacity to love humanity when it doesn't love itself. It's sad but I think Iris was hoping that we evolved higher and sought comforts in the cerebral world. Sorry but I don't most of us have it in us and we resort to settling for spouses, lovers, friends, and jobs much like her characters. Even in this book, Dora seeks happiness elsewhere than London and her marriage. You wonder how many Doras are out there. It's interesting but Iris in both this and The Sea The Sea never really explored children as characters. Both novels seem utterly barren without the presence of children or babies. Maybe because Iris had no use for them herself in her own life, she does not include them in her novels. Maybe the adult characters are the children finding themselves and what makes them happy, content, or satisfied. We know what makes people unhappy, discontent, and unsatisfied."},{"Title":"The Bell","review":"Like to think i know the Malvern Hills et al. areas of Glouchestershire pretty well but even so this book completely took me by surprise.

I've read it, probably, dozens of times, and it improves with each read. The language is of a poetic quality - my test for this is that it's best when read out loud.The theme of the book is the nature of human goodness, and the impossibility of human perfection. Murdoch was an Oxford Reader in Moral Philosophy at the time, and was well capable of producing a very dry account of this subject, but instead the book is a masterpiece of subtle comedy which gets its serious ideas across with great subtlety. The first two chapters, in particular, draw the reader into the life of the heroine with a piece of sustained artistry that is quite unparalleled, at least in my experience. It's a gorgeous piece of prose that I never tire of reading.Dora, the heroine (and I use the term deliberately), is presented as a totally amoral being (and therefore, like the dog, without sin). She is incapable of deciding to &quot;do the right thing&quot;, but also incapable of real wrong-doing. All the other characters are in some way struggling with their own moral turpitude, and in trying to intellectualize their struggle, accellerate their approaching doom. Dora meanwhile, guided only by her animal instincts, emerges as a Saint, cheered on at every stage by the reader (well, this reader at least). Furthermore, Dora's redemption occurs in spite of, rather than because of, the moral and intellectual strictures of Organised Religion. You cheer for Dora as she leaves the Chapel in disgust, just as you cheer for Austen's Elizabeth Bennet when she faces down Lady Catherine. It's that good!The Bell of the title is a symbol of untrammelled female sexuality that resounds throughout the book. This theme is explored, ironically, in a plot which takes place around the grounds of a convent. There's a disturbing painting by Millais called &quot;The Vale of Rest&quot; that I think must have inspired Murdoch. The picture of nuns digging a grave is a wonderful image of Victorian male sexual terror (conceived, incidentally, by Millais on his honeymoon). In the backgound swings the bell. When moved, it must sound.Apart from Dora, most of the other characters emerge from the events of the plot with their lives in ruins. Dora, in contrast, learns to value herself by finally detaching herself from the awful man she had married.I'm very conscious of the fact that not all readers would share my interpretation of the book, and in all probability Murdoch didn't mean it that way. She was on record as saying that if she'd known how readers would feel about Dora's awful husband, she would have treated him more sympathetically. But the book is as it is, and as a description of the triumph of the Human Spirit over priests and pedants, it's just fine for me.Incidentally, it was made into a very good television version by the BBC about 20 years ago. I hope they repeat it one day."},{"Title":"The Bell","review":"Iris Murdoch (1919-1999) spent most of her life working as a philosophy teacher at St. Anne's College, Oxford. During this presumably busy occupation, she wrote 26 novels, five plays, a collection of poetry, and five philosophical texts. I need to remember this the next time I have trouble getting out of bed because I am feeling a little tired. Just imagine writing 26 novels! And these are not simple tales banged out and published with a quick proofing. Murdoch wrote intricate, deeply emotional novels examining the psychological and philosophical implications of this crazy ride we call life. Murdoch's character driven writings work themselves out within carefully constructed, highly symbolic atmospheres full of intense sights and sounds. I once described Murdoch as a creator of universes, and that is exactly what she accomplishes in this highly acclaimed 1958 novel, \\"The Bell.\\" Unfortunately, Penguin got A.S. Byatt to do the introduction to the book. Byatt may be a highly regarded author, but her introductions are excruciating exercises in literary criticism that tax the hardiest souls. Skip the intro and dive right in.\\"The Bell\\" is a story about a group of very unhappy people living in a sort of quasi-religious support group home, called Imber Court, outside of Imber Abbey. The abbey is the home of a group of cloistered nuns who avoid having outsiders enter the abbey grounds. The big event for the abbey and the residents of Imber Court is the installation of a spanking new bell at the abbey. The bell will take the place of the long missing medieval bell lost in the mists of time. As the important event draws ever closer, Murdoch describes several of the residents of Imber Court in minute detail, leaving almost nothing to the imagination in her descriptions of the these fatally flawed yet likeable people.Several of the characters receive such loving attention from Murdoch that it is difficult to discern who is the main character. It is probably Dora Greenfield, as Murdoch opens and closes the novel with this seemingly shallow yet complex character. Dora goes to Imber to renew her relationship with Paul, her scholar husband who is staying at Imber Court in order to do research on manuscripts at the abbey. Paul is a jerk, a jealous, controlling twit who seeks to dominate every aspect of Dora's life. Dora likes to live the free life of the city, but oscillates between romantic affairs and the discipline she feels she needs from Paul. When Dora nervously arrives at Imber, she quickly becomes acquainted with some of the other lost souls rambling around the grounds. Arguably, the most important figure is Michael Meade, the leader of the community who has more problems than some of the people in his charge. A constant source of irritation to Michael is the presence of Nick, a man who Michael had an affair with years before. This affair resulted in Michael's expulsion from the teaching profession and a serious setback to his hopes of becoming a priest. Other characters fill the pages of \\"The Bell,\\" such as Catherine, Nick's sister who is in training to enter the abbey; James Tayper Pace, a jovial chap and potential rival to Michael's leadership; and Toby, a young lad doing service at Imber before he enters Oxford.While we go far into the heads of a few characters, Murdoch refuses to reveal to us the inner workings of other characters. This is not as frustrating as it sounds, for the depth of psychological insight we get into Dora and Michael more than makes up for the absence of other character analyses. Murdoch has a real flair for the workings of the human mind, and she makes her probing examinations so effortless that they leave the reader in absolute wonder at her abilities. You come to know these people better than they know themselves, seeing all of their awkward, painful foibles and the inevitable collisions they face in the future.Imber is a created universe, with Murdoch as all-knowing deity. The descriptive passages concerning the grounds of Imber are brilliantly detailed, putting the reader directly in the characters' world. Murdoch's creation is of such vivid totality that the occasional trips the characters take outside the grounds reveal a world of dullness and emptiness. Only when the characters return to Imber does comfort return. I cannot recall an author who has created this effect to such an amazing degree. It makes \\"The Bell\\" a fascinating book, more of an experience than a mundane read.Imber itself (meaning the grounds, the lake, the house, and the abbey) seem to me to be a microcosm of the world and the heavens. Imber Court represents the world, full of imperfect, lowly creatures yearning for salvation. The abbey is heaven, barely approachable except through occasional visits to a sealed prayer room and the rare glimpse of one of the nuns. Those that do go inside are quickly ushered out again, as though their imperfections prevent them from staying there for long. When carefully looked for, all sorts of religious symbolisms appear (the bell takes a dip in the lake before entering the abbey: is it in need of a sort of baptism before it can enter the abbey? The fact that part of the bridge crossing the lake from the house to the abbey was severed at one time is interesting.). Remember, Murdoch creates universes.Ultimately, only one character seems to find redemption at the conclusion of the story. Perhaps Murdoch is showing us that few among us ever find solace in this world. Whatever she is saying, it is worth reading \\"The Bell\\" in an attempt to seek it out. Murdoch is not for everyone, but everyone should make an effort to read one Murdoch book. This novel will stay in your head for a long time afterwards."},{"Title":"The Bell","review":"This profound and haunting novel features Murdoch's unique blend of religious preoccupations, sexual politics, and philosophy (or, as she more accurately referred to it elsewhere, \\"moral psychology\\")--but, in spite of its many-layered symbolism, it still manages to be surprisingly suspenseful. If you've never read a book by Iris Murdoch and are interested in finding a good place to start, read \\"The Bell.\\"A sort of psychological detective novel, the story is told through the eyes a leader of a lay religious community who is haunted by secrets from his past and also from the perspective of two visitors: a carefree woman returning to her boorish husband who is studying at a nearby convent and an innocent youth hoping to be inspired by the community's spiritual atmosphere before he goes to Oxford. The plot revolves around a bell missing for centuries and the community's plans to replace it with a new one, but I will say nothing else that might give it away.The first half of the book is a very British comedy of manners (and it is at times very funny), but then things get out of hand when the two visitors, both knowingly and unwittingly, set into motion a series of tragic events that shatter the faith and foundations of the group. Although I was constantly surprised by the book's twists and turns, when I finished the novel I felt that all the events were very nearly pre-ordained by the actions and ethics of its characters.Murdoch's genius is her ability to pose many complicated questions and provide just enough for readers to decide for themselves. Are the visitors responsible for destroying the community's equanimity or were they simply the catalyst that exposed the hypocrisies and self-centeredness of the commune's members? Must a person transcend selfishness in order to influence others for the better? Does it take tragedy to bring out the best in people? Is it ever really possible to wall oneself away from the rest of the world?It seems almost incidental in this day and age to acknowledge that the novel portrays two gay men in a sympathetic manner astonishing for a book published in 1958--yet another aspect that displays the power and forwardness of Murdoch's thinking."},{"Title":"The Bell","review":"The first fifty or so pages of Iris Murdoch's The Bell chronicle how the terminally confused but kind Dora Greenfield leaves her emotionally sadistic husband only to retun in a still more confused mixture of guilt, fear and love. Murdoch's tone here is gently satarical and distant. In that opening act I found her wit amusing, never involving. Alarmingly it reminded me of highschool, when the Literature was rich, witty and clinical. It reminded me of homework.It is only in the second act when Dora joins her husband in the religious community of Imber that it becomes clear the author is building to what will ultimatly become one of the most remarkable examinations of faith I've ever read. The novel achieves critical mass with the introduction of Michael Meade, the founder of the community. He has always struggled with his homosexuality, and deep down we sense that in a bizzare way he enjoys the struggle &quot;like the souls in Dante who deliberately remained within the purifying fire&quot;. He believes that the struggle is faith, where he gets to define his own morality. By contrast the community's other figure head, the large affable James believes in clear black and white terms &quot;Sodomy is not disgusting its just forbidden&quot;, unlike Michael he believes that innoccense and authority are the measure of faith. While this unacknowledged philosophical debate wages on, Imber's cast of characters get into such a tangled web of flirtations, jealousy and mis-understanding so brilliantly weaved by Murdoch that we only upon reflection do we question the character's motivations.Right across from Imber is the Abbey where a faceless, nameless order of Nuns go about their business. We meet three of these nuns, the powerful Abbess who seems to know everything and is always bearing a smile. Sister Ursula who is her attache, and who also is constantly smiling. Finally there is Sister Clare, and as she saves a woman from drowning, Murdoch takes the time to point out that she too is smiling. The nuns are ever present, watching, mocking these mortals who can not give up the world but sill seek the Hereafter. As Murdoch observes &quot;Violence is born out of the desire to escape oneself&quot;. And all these characters are desperatly trying to escape. This is coupled by the much darker suggestion that although God exists and is just, he can also be uncaring. Why would he create homosexuality only to condemn it? Late in the game Michael observes that there is God but he may not believe in Him.It is clear from The Bell that Murdoch is not only a novelist but a philosopher(and indeed this is confirmed in the sleeve notes). The ideas, reflections and themes are far too complex to discuss here. But there are sequences so perfectly and soulbearingly written that they warrant reading the book more then once. What starts as a gentle satire grows a heart without ever losing its sense of humour or even a sense of whimsy. Although sometimes distant, the novel is never tedious. And if there is a lesson, then its the lesson Michael learns &quot;Love ought to be given without fear of its imperfection&quot;."},{"Title":"The Bell","review":"I just finished this novel a half hour ago and am moved to write immediately. It was one of the most moving and staggering novels I've read in my life (and I''ve read countless of the &quot;major&quot; works). What begins as an almost Austenian comedy of manners becomes a glorious, compelling novel of ideas, of the relationship between action and meditation and of the complicated ways of love. Filmed once for British TV, it would make a splendid film, particularly now that homosexuality is no longer taboo. Michael and Dora emerge as unlikely, yet extraordinary heroes, whose lives I will wonder about for a long, long time."},{"Title":"The Bell","review":"I am studying 'The Bell' for A Level English Literature along with 'The End of the Affair' by Graham Greene and 'Loitering with Intent' by Muriel Spark. I enjoyed 'The Bell' and the fact that it is very easy to read probably attributed to this. The relationships between many of the characters worked well, especially between Michael and Nick. The links then between this relationship and Michael's feelings for Toby was also well constructed. Dora, as the main protaganist, is very skillfully developed and many parts of the book are written from her point of view. Another point which deserves praise is Murdoch's excellent physical description of Imber, this made the place seem realistic and also supports the intended images of the characters, for example Nick. Catherine is probably the only character that did not fully work, however this is mainly true towards the end. The plot is interesting and moves at a resonable pace with the main charaters becoming increasingly intriging. However, the book could be looked at on a deeper, more philosphical/religious level with characters such as the Abbess playing more of a symbolic part than the others. This is a book about community and the strive for perfection. The characters, though all very different, have a common need for salvation and through Imber have hope for this despite their pasts. 'The Bell' is enjoyable on several levels, it is both sad and humorous although I didn't find it quite as witty as the cover led me to expect. I would also highly recommend the other two books mentioned, especially if one wants to further investigate some of the themes raised in 'The Bell'."},{"Title":"The Bell","review":"This beautifully constructed novel begins and ends with a description of Dora Greenfield. I feel that it is Dora who makes this novel. All of the other characters are hugely inadequate, struggling as they are with the constant dilemma of how to deal with the pleasure of life. Dora has no qualms she knows that life can be full of fear ( the reason she returns to Imber Court and her estranged husband) but she desperately wants to live, to enjoy sensual pleasure. It is not possible to detach sensuality from fear in this novel. The bell is a symbol of this fear, it sits under the water, discovered by Toby. Toby has a sexual encounter with Dora which is interrupted by the bell resounding. Toby has a sexual encounter with Michael, who is obsessed with the new bell, seeing it as a source of liberation from his sexual imprisonment, from this sensuality which he despises.I really enjoyed this novel. It is almost perfect in form. The characters are explored slowly with wonderful skill they are slowly revealed to us .I would highly recommend this book for anyone seeking an introduction to Iris Murdoch's work"},{"Title":"The Bell","review":"After the burst of Modernist fiction in the first half of this century, it's refreshing to know that a novelist can return to a more traditional mode of writing in the Eliot-James lineage with success. &quot;The Bell&quot; is a great novel, with an admirable balance between direct dialogue, philosophical reflection, and psychological depiction, and between describing characters' motives with completeness and omitting enough so that the reader is surprised by the turn of events at the novel's climax. This is the way novels are supposed to be written."},{"Title":"The Bell","review":"This early ('50's) Murdoch novel is quite a surprise. I wasn't expecting such an entertaining read. One would not expect it from the plot (misfits gathered at a religious retreat), or the dated themes of religious piety and homosexuality. But I found it an absorbing and fast read.Murdoch seems to have a talent for getting into the minds of her characters such that their thoughts are our thoughts; one knows exactly where they are coming from because one would have the same set of thoughts. Never a false note tracking the internal dialogue of Toby and Michael."},{"Title":"The Bell","review":"Dame Iris Murdoch(1919-1999) was a Dublin born philosophy scholar from Oxford University. Not only did this brilliant woman produce several works of philosophy but she was also a first rate novelist. Her works are noted for being:a. Richly crafted scenes writtein in stunning prose rich with the smell, taste, feel and beauty of the English landscape.b. She deals honestly with real men and women as three dimensional characters.c. Her works are filled with abstruse and important questions in the realms of revealed religion and philosophy. She takes time to develop our understanding of the chief protagonist in her long elegantly written works.d. Her books are rich in symbolism. They can be read on a literal level but also in an allegorical and religious way.Synopsis of the plot of \\"The Bell\\" which was published by Murdoch in 1958:The long novel tells the story of a lay community of Anglicans who run a market garden near Imber Abbey. The Abbey may symoblize heaven and the commune of lay believers reflects our fallen world of sin, love, hate and death. The story concerns the installation of a new bell in the abbey. Meanwhile, one of the characters Toby discovers that underneath the lake separating the community from the abbey is the medieval bell once used in the abbey. The Bell is named Gabriel because it is said to speak with the voice of that august archangel. Legend has it that in the 14th century a group of Benedictine nuns lived on the Imber property. A young nun had a lover who died whilst climbing a wall to reach her. He fell and broke his neck. The nun refused to confess her affair. The Bishop cursed the Abbey. The guilty nun committed suicide in the lake (another near suicide attempt will occur in the novel). The Bell was then believed to have flown like a bird on the wing out of the tower to fall into the lake. This perhaps may symbolize a refusal on the nun to repent of her sins. The character Dora an amoral and sexy woman will also fail to repent of her repeated adulteries during the course of the novel. The novel ends with tragedy and the experiment in communal living is a failed effort. As the novel ends, the wall separating the Abbey from the Lodge still stands symbolizing the huge distance between earth and heaven. The nuns such as Sister Ursula and Sister Clare seek to help the community people reminding us of guardian angels.There are many minor characters but the major figures in the work are:Michael Meade-The founder of the community. Michael is a homosexual who has affairs with young boys. He wanted to be a priest but is also a disullioned and guilt ridden man.Dora Greenfield-The leading female character. She has been married to a gruff and academic man Paul Greenfield. Paul works on ancient manuscripts in the abbey and is a resident of the community. Their marriage is a failure. Dora grows into maturity as the novel culminates.Toby-A young lad who will soon enter Cambridge as an engineering student. He finds the ancient bell under the lake. He is an innocent man who discovers both hetero and homosexual love at Imber.Nick and Catherine Fawley-Nick is a gloomy man who had a fleeting gay affair with Michael Meade. His sister Catherine is a fragile young woman who is planning to enter the Abbey. Tragedy is to upset her plans.The novel is difficult reading and its slow pace and deep insights inito the lives of the characters will not appeal to those seeking a page turner. Murdoch demands your attention as an intellectual and a woman interested in the human spirit.She is well worth reading. Recommended for mature and discerning readers of fiction."},{"Title":"Columbus and Other Cannibals: The Wetiko Disease of Exploitation, Imperialism, and Terrorism","review":"I agree with both previous reviewers that the book is an extraordinary indictment of the dominant culture. But I got something else from this book as well. I read this that Forbes is saying that one of the reasons civilization is killing the planet is because of a spiritual illness with a physical vector. If I get the flu and then cough all over you, you might then get the flu, with all of its symptoms. If I have the cannibal sickness and I cough (or somehow otherwise transfer the disease to you) you will have to consume the souls of others in order to survive. You will become a vampire. Or to putthis another way, you will become a conquistador, a pornographer, a slaver, a businessman. I read this not only as a metaphor, but as a possible description of how things really are. And he makes a very convincing case. Wonderful and important book by a very wise man."},{"Title":"Columbus and Other Cannibals: The Wetiko Disease of Exploitation, Imperialism, and Terrorism","review":"An amazing perspective on the conditions of mankind. What Forbes tells us is that there is this negative consciousness, this spiritual sickness called &quot;The Wetiko Psychosis&quot; that gets passed on from being to being. It's an inherited twisted perspective on life, and feeling about life.. The bestowers for the last 500 years of the Wetiko disease have come from the European culture, although he mentions that many cultures through out history have endulged in Wetiko behavior, from Egypt, to Rome, to Russia, China. He's also mentioned that the once oppressed may carry on this mentality, this lunacy to a higher degree sometimes then the original oppressors/ colonizers.There is authenticity in this book that isnt found that often. The reader learns so much about Native American phylosophy. It stays the course with you from beginning to end. When I first read the book, I was thinking to myself &quot;hmm I dont know, thats stretching it isnt it? Cannibalism?&quot; But the way he describes it, and in the way he means it, now I understand. We need to take a more compassionate and loving path. A path of power now because we're running out of time. We're all enduring the effects of it today and will for years to come. He says it wont change unless we change and heal ourselves first."},{"Title":"Columbus and Other Cannibals: The Wetiko Disease of Exploitation, Imperialism, and Terrorism","review":"The previous reviewer missed the point of this brilliant book by Dr. Jack Forbes of UC Davis. It's about how the &quot;white culture&quot; (really referred to by Forbes as &quot;European culture&quot;) is predatory and planet-destructive, not how white &quot;people&quot; are. This book is brilliant and insightful, a clean revisiting of the history of the Americas from the point of view of indigenous peoples, and not at all racist. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Columbus and Other Cannibals: The Wetiko Disease of Exploitation, Imperialism, and Terrorism","review":"When I think of cannibalism I think of another person eating the body of another person. I don't think that way after reading this book, cannibalism has a totally different meaning to me.Could we call it cannibalism when a Christian missionary goes into a Indian Village and gives them no other choice but to see God his way? Why couldn't the missionary just be happy in his own church with his own followers?Is it cannibalism when a capitalist decides to turn a forest into two-by-fours? Wasn't the forest down the road that was turned into two-by-fours last week enough? Is the person with the chainsaw taking orders a cannibal to?Forbes makes it clear that there has been, and still are, a lot of people suffering from the cannibal sickness among us who want to consume all life around them. He claims you don't have to eat another person all you have to do is control their heart and mind, you've than consumed them. And to survive in the cannibal's culture you almost have to become a cannibal yourself. It's contagious. It's the sickness that creates the pecking order were all familiar with. It's actually kind of scary, this culture just might consume itself if it isn't careful.Forbes does show at the end of the book that there is another way. He shows that there has existed, and still exists, different &quot;paths&quot; to take that isn't offered by the cannibals.A great book to help heal a sick culture."},{"Title":"Columbus and Other Cannibals: The Wetiko Disease of Exploitation, Imperialism, and Terrorism","review":"I'd like to introduce you to Jack D. Forbes (1934-2011), the Native American writer, scholar, and activist who wrote Columbus and Other Cannibals. Forbes wrote to warn us of an epidemic of insanity, which he called w&eacute;tiko psychosis, the cannibal disease. It's a spiritual illness, or soul disease, that causes people to become predators, and to relentlessly consume the lives of others.When the white invaders washed up on the shores, the Native Americans were astonished by their bizarre behavior. They were unbelievably destructive whirlwinds who tirelessly raped women, rivers, forests, animals, peoples, and lands. \\"An Indian who was as bad as the white men could not live in our nation; he would be put to death,\\" said Black Hawk. \\"I had not discovered one good trait in the character of the Americans that had come to the country!\\" Sadly, no one could disagree with him.Forbes came to understand that the w&eacute;tiko psychosis began thousands of years ago, around the Fertile Crescent and Egypt. Later, it also emerged in Mexico and Peru. This soul sickness was extremely contagious. It could be seen almost everywhere today, and it continually spreads from generation to generation. He says, \\"We are made to be crazy by other people who are also crazy and who draw for us a map of the world which is ugly, negative, fearful, and crazy.\\"W&eacute;tiko was the essence of European culture, a nightmare world of bloodthirsty vampires and werewolves. European heroes tended to be warriors, emperors, and a wide variety of assorted thugs, hustlers, and psychopaths. Their \\"religion\\" was something isolated from everyday life, practiced indoors, away from the perfection of Creation. Their God was indifferent to every form of barbarism, and often encouraged it. No cannibal experienced the world as being a sacred place. While they raced to consume others, they were also eating themselves up at the same time! They had no spiritual connection to life.The w&eacute;tiko disease encouraged reckless living and overpopulation, and it flourished amidst consumer hordes. Most often, males were possessed by the worst forms of the disease -- they became monsters. Obviously, a world dominated by men was not a place of health and balance. But women were not immune. The w&eacute;tiko culture taught everyone to hunger for extravagance and excess, constantly cannibalizing other lands and other lives. We could never have enough. We could never find peace.Is it possible to eliminate the cannibal disease? Yes. Will it be easy? No. We need to create a just and healthy society, and insane people cannot do this. Healing must come first -- spiritual regeneration. We must redefine reality. The goal is to \\"live a life that is worthwhile, one that is filled with precise acts, beautiful acts, meaningful acts... the path that only a wisdom-seeker can travel.\\"Material things have no significance. \\"It is rather the quality of our acts, of our struggle, of our motives, of our love, of our perseverance which are truly significant.\\" \\"The Creator has given all of us good paths to follow, based upon good speech, love, and sacred songs.\\"We must remember profound respect for all life, the ways of our ancestors. We must remember how to accept responsibility for the decisions we make, and the acts we perform. We must remember how to live like human beings. We must return to the red road, the path of balance.Forbes generously provided readers with two chapters of guidance for the healing process. Healing is the most important challenge for the generations now alive -- and the generations yet-to-be-born.Richard Adrian ReeseAuthor of What Is Sustainable"},{"Title":"Columbus and Other Cannibals: The Wetiko Disease of Exploitation, Imperialism, and Terrorism","review":"This is the truth about history like I have rarely seen.

He asks the hard questions, and gives the gory details. This should be mandatory reading for all 3-5th graders and repeated in high school. The truth is plain and simple: columbus, cortez, pizarro, all the kings and partiarchs, the pope, and everyone who participated in the invasion and colonization of the americas suffered from the wetiko or some form of it. This book should be read immediataly following, \\"Against His-story, Against Leviathan\\" for a thorough breakdown of western civilization in a nutshell. The only critique I have is that his citations are often not cited, his primary sources are often misquoted, or quoted from other editions/translations, and in this new edition, he needs a freakin editor, and a proofreader who will \\"READ\\" EVERY page, what they get paid for doing. All in all, get this book for the content, the ideas, and the insight that Forbes and few others have.

It is probably going to be a short lived idea, be it that it flies in the face of logic, and is even despised by left-leaning intellectuals such as Noam Chomsky.Let us examine a few facts about this thesis: First of all, Pre-Columbian America was one of the most brutal, violent places on the planet before Europeans arrived; replete with slavery, genocide, cannibalism, and extinction of animals due to human predation. This is not even mentioning the genetic kinsmen of Native Americans, the Mongols, were the most bloodthirsty empire in the history of the world, who waged biological warfare against an unsuspecting Europe.Lets examine the indigenous genocide: The Gallina culture from the 1200s disappeared violently, most archeologists believe due to genocide from another tribe.The Aztecs enslaved their neighbors and sacrificed virgins to their gods. Cannibalism was also widespread.The American Mastadon was hunted to extinction by Native Americans before the evil Europeans came, as well.All of this paints an interesting picture, and we are left with the facts: Hunter-Gatherers cannot support a population as dense as agricultural people. There are millions of Native Americans \\"left\\" right now, most of whom are growing rich on casino money.The real question is, when Asiatics commit genocide against Caucasians, do they feel pity, as we do?I would imagine that the answer is no: the Asiatic Turks still deny the obvious and intentional genocide of the Armenians, and the Mongolians have a statue of Ghengis Khan in their capital city.So of course, with this argument demolished, we must remember who benefits from the lie: left-wing academicians at the expense of the true believers who swallow this bile (some of whom defend Joseph Stalin and Mao Tse-Tung without blinking an eye). Not to mention Indian tribes who get free college tuition paid for them, and hundreds of thousands of dollars in casino cash before their 18th birthday. The pity-me-hate-whitey culture is VERY lucrative for some people, and therefore, will never cease until rational people expose it for what it is: a Big Lie. Either that, or until European civilization crumbles, which will surely bring about an end to the free-money-white-guilt gravy-train, as well.Luckily the reasoning faction of the human brain is left intact for most people, who understand that European culture: Mozart, Goethe, Science, democracy, Plato, Da Vinci, etc (we could go on for pages here) has done more good than any other culture in the world, and not a single individual alive today (including the authors of this silly book here) would go back to a life without modern European inventions.

Forbes on her npr radio show, OUT OF BOUNDS. His thoughts truly resonated with me, as he was expressing so much of the spirituality that has become my daily experience, as well as so many of my concerns. I really recommend this interview: [...]Forbes discusses how we mis-identify our religion by broad denomination, e.g., Methodist, when we should be labeling it by our personal identity, as we each interpret the religious system to meet and justify our own needs. Such as, Jane Doe would claim she was a member of the Jane Doe religion. This reminded me of Rabbi Cooper's excellent book, GOD IS A VERB, in which the divine is not an entity but the divine force as God-ing, as we each are part of the divine through our soul's partication and processing divinity. In this lifetime, here and now I am Edie-ing. I also recommend Rabbi Shapiro's MINYON for his discussion of the divine as the Source and Substance of All Being, again the active process of BE-ing. In the interview,Forbes explained that Native Americans have no word for religion as we use it, and he emphasized the indigenous spirituality of oneness with all of creation, overcoming the Western World separation from nature and the divine \\"entity\\".

It begins with a corporate president interviewing three auditing firm representatives. The president asks, &quot;How much is two plus two?&quot;#1 replies, &quot;It's four.&quot;#2 replies, &quot;It ranges from three to five.&quot;#3 replies, &quot;What do you want it to be?&quot;Just guess who got the engagement. Given the recent fiasco at Enron, and the stuff that's starting to emerge over Arthur Andersen's ebola-virus-meltdown of an audit at Enron, &quot;Unaccountable Accounting&quot; might offer information that is as pertinent as ever in the book-cooking world of big business.P.S. It's a good thing Andersen is a partnership, and not a publicly-held company. That way, there won't be a whole lot of damage to the public when the firm gets sued into oblivion over this Enron mess."},{"Title":"Cybernetics of Cybernetics","review":"Originally published by Heinz von Foerster and the Biological Computer Laboratory at the University of Illinois, but out of print and unavailable for 20+ years, this, by far the greatest cybernetics collection between two covers, has been rescued and brought back into print by Future Systems. Articles, diagrams, definitions, illustrations, and aphorisms are collected and creatively indexed. Ashby, Bateson, Beer, Hardin, Maturana, McCulloch, Pask, Powers, von Foerster, and Wiener are all here, as are many others. This collection is not perfect (where is Maruyama?), but the cybernetic ideas live and breathe here as they do nowhere else. For the student who has heard the words but not yet the music of cybernetics, this is the place to start. For the professional cybernetician, of whatever stripe or trade union (and who may well have been on the lookout for this collection for decades), this is the place to return."},{"Title":"Cybernetics of Cybernetics","review":"I have two copies of the Cybernetics of Cybernetics--and wouldn't be without them. The C of C is a collection of key papers in understanding how everything in our world connects to everything else. If you try to identify what can be said on the most general level about how machines, humans, and nature interconnect, you have the science of cybernetics. This is basic information; you don't have to be a specialist to read it and learn! You do have to make an effort that will be well repaid. Oh, in addition to the key papers, there are non-technical definitions of basic concepts, marvelous short, even witty essays about such key ideas as randomness, pattern, cognition, etc. Still more, you get a \\"metabook\\"--a booklet which lovingly documents how the concepts in the book connect with one another--a graphic connector of the connections in the main book. The understandings in this book belong to us all, but they're in danger of being lost to specialization. I recommend this book to everyone who is interested in understanding what Gregory Bateson called \\"the pattern which connects.\\""},{"Title":"Find the Clock","review":"In many ways this is an above-average Keeler crime/suspense/puzzle novel, but it greatly disappointed me in one key way: I could guess the ending halfway through, and alas my guess was correct! Now, in general, guessing the final revelation in a Keeler novel is quite impossible because new characters and previously-unknown situations come right out of the blue in the last few pages, so that the ultimate \\"solution\\" (for any writer but Keeler) would be considered a cheat. But Keeler doesn't twist this one... the ultimate reveal, of the notorious Blond Beast of Bremen, who of course has been \\"hiding\\" in plain sight throughout the novel, is a very big letdown any way you look at it, even though the Beast is a kind of super-criminal, a gifted mimic, actor, ventriloquist, acrobat, war criminal, con man and wife killer, there is just no way he could succeed at the impersonation he is supposed to be accomplishing undetectably throughout the course of the novel's events.As usual in Keeler novels there's an insurance fraud, which is made possible by a highly implausible practical joke that quickly gets out of hand... and there's a baffling puzzle: why do two competing groups want the ordinary alarm clock that was the property of a wealthy man who recently died, when careful examination reveals nothing concealed within the clock? There's also a murder mystery--- who killed a certain Chinese laundryman, and why?There are quite a few loose ends in the final wrap-up, including several key characters who are frequently mentioned but never come on stage at all. On the other hand, Keeler's detailed depiction of the operations of a large-circulation Chicago newspaper seems to be knowledgeable and authentic. I'm therefore not at all sure how to rate this one in the context of the rest of Keeler's huge output of crime and suspense and puzzle novels."},{"Title":"Object-Oriented Programming with ActionScript","review":"This book is well written, and explains some concepts of ActionScript and OOP that will stand the test of time, but for the most part it is outdated.

I knew about Object Oriented design & structure, and about listeners & event engines and such, but this book made a lot of things very clear about the application of these concepts.

The writing is too full of weak coding analogies based on irrelevant stories from the author's past; it fails to provide concrete examples that would give form to the abstract principles of Object Oriented Programming. In short, it fails.The book will suit you best if you've trolled the Flashcoders list for the past few years, but for many more of us, the leap from 0-250 mph is far too jarring.

I was stuck in the intermediate level of flash development, using Flash 5 &quot;hacks&quot; to get the job done. I needed an advanced source of information so I could learn how to take my projects a step further. Without any formal education in the concept and theories of OOP, I had only a few online tutorials to turn to, and they were lacking at best. With the help of this book, I was bale to make the intellectual leap into the world of OOP, and creat really powerful and re-usable flash objects.

This book tries to change all that by making Flash development accessible to programmers. I believe the book is also designed for designers who want to understand OOP in ActionScript.After a brief introduction to OOP (which is all done through UML) and ActionScript syntax, the reader is presented with constructing an application from start to finish. I was particularly pleased that this example uses the famous MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern, familiar to many OOP programmers. After completing this chapter, the reader will have a good understanding of the basics of OOP in ActionScript.The next section of the book discusses many of the tiny details in the previous chapter in much more depth. There is discussion on using pre-built Flash components in your application as well as building your own components. Each of these topics are covered in sufficient depth to satisfy the reader.The final section of the book seems to be \\"everything else you need to know about Flash and ActionScript\\". This section includes a discussion on debugging your application, useful tips and tricks, and even an introduction to Flash remoting."},{"Title":"Object-Oriented Programming with ActionScript","review":"This is a useful book for pedagogical purposes. The authors write in a lucid style and generally the book is evenly balanced. I am critical of the lack of a CD though the files are downloadable from their site. While the authors talk about OO in Flash and work through examples of restricted OO applications, they also admit that Flash's Actionscript is really not an OO language. Hence while OO thinking in Flash may help some developers organise their code more effectively, the language is not sufficiently enriched (viz. the current programming semantics of Flash) to support the usual range of OO constructs found in Java, C++ or C#. The authors explicitly flag inheritance as, at the least, difficult to achieve in Flash and recommend its avoidance. Hence my comment that Flash is really not ready for OO yet - but as this book shows, it could get there.Programmers especially those from a Computer Science background, will find this book very useful as it gets to terms with programming in Flash (Actionscript) more directly than many others. For instance a reasonable though limited overview of fairly common data structures coded in Actionscript is presented, and that is a very welcome development. The section dealing with components introduces a layer of software engineering thinking that many books appear to avoid (or are ignorant of). However, it also clear that component development in Flash has a way to go yet, and I got a strong sense from the book that the state of Actionscript development is not all it should be.Despite its many fine points and admirable style, there are a few weaknesses. Firstly the whole area of combiming Actionscript with other APIs is largely ignored. When will someone plug this gap? Please email me if someone already has, as I have a number of postgraduates who would benefit. Secondly the section on XML and databases access through Flash Remoting is very potted and should have been spread over several additional chapters.I found this book to be very useful and certainly moving in the right direction from a programmer's perspective. In many ways however, and with no disrespect to the authors, it also struck me as a draft for a much better book that could emerge in few months time. Hopefully the authors will plug that gap sooner rather than later."},{"Title":"Object-Oriented Programming with ActionScript","review":"I would have payed double the price for the information inside.

Branden and Samuel are truly &quot;into&quot; Flash, ActionScript and OOP - the same kind of energy they brought to their sessions at Macromedia DevCon 2002 can be found in this book. I find their writing style to be engaging, and the information contained in the book to be very well thought out, and presented in a manner that is easy to follow. The fact that these two can give insight into the underpinnings of how Flash MX ActionScript works gives me a much better feeling as a programmer for why things work the way they do.One thing to keep in mind: this is not a book for beginning ActionScript programmers. I used &quot;Foundation Flash MX&quot; from friends of ed to get familiar with Flash MX and basic ActionScript concepts, from which I was able to leverage my own background to understand this book.But the bottom line is, if you're going to do serious ActionScript programming, this book is a must."},{"Title":"Object-Oriented Programming with ActionScript","review":"After buying the Colin Moock book, I had the basics down, and was ready to take it further.

This book provides everything you are looking for to take flash to the next level! I especially liked the way they explained components and the live preview feature. I read this book in two days...barely sleeping, and I am still in a state of shock about how much I learned. I couldn't stop reading it! If you buy this book and William Drol's book, then you will have all the tools to become the jedi master of coding in flash! If you are a beginner...this book is not for you. You should have a firm grasp of actionscript syntax, how to use movie clips and the timeline...and most importantly, how to think outside the box of how you would normally code in flash.

Sam and Branden have masterfully covered in these nuances in their book on the subject.For me, the best part of the book is that they assume nothing in the process of learning OOP, partially because, with Flash, you can't assume that your previous OOP knowledge will translate cleanly. The book is well organized, and the information on component use and construction is second to none.If you are a Flash coder and aren't using these techniques, you are probably wasting a lot of time in your development tasks."},{"Title":"Object-Oriented Programming with ActionScript","review":"The best part of Flash MX is the almost absolute control you have over Flash via ActionScript. People can get by without tapping into this rich functionality and still do well with the new non-ActionScript features but most Flash developers want more.Though I'm not a Flash historian, I believe Branden and Sam were critical in the strong hack-together OOP movement at the end of Flash 5's life and genesis of Flash MX's birth. This is the kind of insider perspective that, if you are interested in taking advantage of ActionScript MX-style, will prove very handy in your development.Branden and Sam have written this book with a kind of geek wonder and gee-whiz discovery that speaks to my programmer heart. They do a great job so describing hard-won ActionScript-specific coding practices and techniques along side actual code samples.I have been programming professionally for a while but the looseness of Actionscript is enough to drive me insane (i.e. AS's unwillingness to throw errors on undefined functions or variables combined with my horrible spelling skills). The author's tricks like the _resolve function on page 68 which can catch undefined function calls, as they as called, are a GODSEND!The book covers setting up a good Flash MX development layout, having data-aware components, XML, creating Heap structures, debugging techniques and building components from scratch with an Actionscript bent. It also has two great guest chapter writers: Andreas Hiem (Server Integration) and Nigel Pegg (Components).I'm definitely gushing here but there is no fluff or wasted space here.

This book is on par with Collin Moock's now famous book. In fact in some ways, this book is actually better!Flash MX has brought a lot more capabilities to the table - but implementing them isn't always very easy. This book explains OOP in a way everyone can understand, then presents real-world situations where you'd benefit from this development approach.Components are covered in depth, and even Nigel Pegg from Macromedia chimes in with some of his own chapters. The book covers OOP principles, how to conduct OOP in Flash, covers component creation, working with components that already exist, implementing live previews with components, debugging guidance, using ASFunction with text fields, passing variables to from, data structures, and they even close the book out with some useful bits of AS code you might be able to reference for your own projects.This is an amazing resource, artfully and precisely written, by some of the most talented coders on the planet.

(Some other books call themselves Advanced but often just briefly describe the Advanced features without giving real-life examples).The authors do a great job explaining the application of OOP techniqes in ActionScript. A warning to novices though: you'll get a lot more out of this book if you already have some knowledge of OOP!They cover many other topics in depth, with actual code samples, including:* Design Patterns for Flash, including a Model-View-Presenter sample* Events, Callbacks and Listeners, and how to define your own Custom Events* Data-Aware Components using the DataProviderClass* Anti-Distortion in FUI-style Components* Building your own Components, including Live Preview* &quot;Textfield Mangling&quot; and HTML text fields* Remote Debugging* Flash RemotingThere's a lot more too.

What is given to you, usually, is a how-to-code course for a language which is very similar to Javascript, and how to use it in the Flash environment. However, Actionscript can be a much more sophisticated beast in the rights hands, especially in its last &quot;MX&quot; incarnation. And here comes &quot;Object-Oriented Programming with ActionScript&quot;. This fine book is divided in three parts. The first is about Object-Oriented Programming in ActionScript: after a crash course in OOP, the ActionScript implementation of OOP is presented (and if you already had contact with OOP in your life, with Java for example, you could be surprised about some interesting features). A full example of game design with OOP Actionscript is then shown. The second part of the book is about Components, which is a new feature of Flash MX, and which is very important if you don't want to reinvent the wheel every time you have to program something. The final part of the book contains a collection of mixed and useful topics: debugging techniques, server integration, text fields wizardry, data structures, and more. Warning: this is a book for experienced programmers. You are supposed to know ActionScript pretty well in order to understand it (if you don't, New Riders also has some nice entry-level books about ActionScript).

This is certainly not a book for Actionscripters who want to learn OOP!The authors are clearly experts in their field but alas, an expert does not always a writer make!

I have researched and like many, thought and exchanged ideas on the implications of coding methods in Flash and what ramifications that has on the end product. This book is a must have for anyone who is serous about OOP with ActionScript or Component Development.Having coded using OOP principals for a while now I still found this book very informative. My Specific interests lie in the decision on how to implement certain code in Flash. The book mentions what methods the authors prefer when implementing OOP and the other available options and why they decide to do things the way they did. This is very useful information that would take many days to collect and does not exist in any single source anywhere that I know of.The coverage of components is also very good. I have built simple components and was looking to building more advanced components. This book covers all component principals from the beginning which just simple component to the complex components which use inheritance concepts....With all this I would also say that this book is very good for anyone who has no background in OOP. I read through the beginning chapters and still got something out of them. It takes you from the beginning and leads you to understanding what OOP really is, and how it is implemented in Flash.So now you are wondering who is this book not for? I would say anyone who has very minimal experience with ActionScript might want to hold off on this book (you will end up buying this book eventually though).

(5 chapters devoted to components)-Your just one strait-up actionscript guru, or close to it.-You find yourself correcting other people's grammar on the flashcoders e-mail listings because you spend so much fricking time there.-Your interested in understanding how Branden Hall debugs code. (If you care to know, he's the one to listen too)-You're going to name you first child after Sam because you're favorite flash immortal is Samuel Wan. Well theirs that and the fact that his presentation on OOP at flashforward was pretty sweet and has spark your curiosity in OOP.-You want to get in the big leagues of programming, and impress the java programmer at work with your understanding of OOP.This book is deep, not like a love poem, like a hole, a deep hole of knowledge from two experts (and a group of amazing technical editors) about flash MX. OOP is just the tip of the ice berg, check out the table of contents and you'll see. Be warned however that you might find yourself slipping and traveling down the hole of knowledge a bit to fast, just kick those feet out and climb back up, re-group then give it another go, I know I did. Especially with the OOP example, which is actually one of the first examples I have seen using real OOP principles."},{"Title":"Object-Oriented Programming with ActionScript","review":"first of all, I'm not a rookie on actionscript,I know pretty much of actionscripts,this book really helps me to push myself to anotheractionscripting level.FLASH ROCKS~~"},{"Title":"Object-Oriented Programming with ActionScript","review":"This is very good if you dont get bored in the first 20 pages."},{"Title":"THE COMPLETE ADVENTURES OF PETER RABBIT","review":"There are three stories in this book, the first of which is the Tale of Peter Rabbit. I think that this edition could be better organized, given its intended audience: First of all, you need to be able to read the table of contents to know where one story ends and the next begins. Also, the binding is very tight, making it difficult for the &quot;baby-preschool&quot; age group for which it is intended to flip through at the book independently. In my copy, at least, about half the story of Peter Rabbit is included a second time, presumably in error, after the third story. A small child might do better with a smaller, hardbound version."},{"Title":"THE COMPLETE ADVENTURES OF PETER RABBIT","review":"Over the years we have purchased many copies of this book from Amazon.

Francine Curro Cary, Executive Director of the Humanities Council of Washington D.C. proves otherwise. The book is a series of essays of Washington ethnicity starting with the original Native Americans &amp; working its way to the present. It is an interesting book, but hard to read at one sitting as it is more for a history scholar. My interest in Washington D.C. &amp; its history kept me going. It will not help the tourist much as a guide to the major landmarks &amp; monuments. It is more about the &quot;other Washington.&quot; The one people actually live in.

Her work was hallmarked by a traditional lyric grace and penchant for artifice that led to her work being considered old fashioned and out of style by many of her literary peers, yet won her the 1937 Pulitzer Prize. She was 36 years old at the time. Now under the deft editorship of Robert Phillips who has also provided an informative introduction, New Selected Poems By Marya Zaturenska presents a gifted poetry to a new generation of readers and students of American literature and poetry. I Know An Island: I know an island, pale in the green sea/Where the Atlantic waves grow lost in mist,/Of delicate violet and pure amethyst,/Where the gray sea gulls rise monotonously.//Green, green the shoreline, rises cool and green,/Small purpling hills archaic and serene/Through lingering rains that fall deep, endlessly.//Step on this greenest, softest, dreamiest turf/To breathe the mystery this isle presents/And you shall hear the sound of violence/Subdued and hostile as the rising surf.//Saints, heroes, kings, and martyrs, waxed and waned/In this their ancient seat, gray-toned yet wild/In haggard beauty, subtle as a child,/How many times adored, subdued, profaned. ..."},{"Title":"Plants in time;: Their history and mystery,","review":"Ms. Cosgrove is an extremely skillful and interesting source of information about plants and wild animals.

Happy Birthday surprise. oh well."},{"Title":"Grand Tour","review":"Written in the style of a traveller's guide book, the authors take you on an interplanetary cruise describing each body in detail. The book runs from the largest (the Sun) to the smallest objects (comets and tiny asteroids) in the solar system. The illustrations are either photos from spacecraft that have visited the various planets and moons, or are hypothetical paintings based on what the surfaces may look like. One particularly striking painting is of the surface of Pluto, with the sun as a mere bright speck in the sky.I'd recommend this book to anyone with a passing interest in astronomy or the planets, it's a great read and never gets obtusely technical. Ron Miller and William K. Hartmann are without a doubt the finest planetary artists around today."},{"Title":"Grand Tour","review":"An excellent book with stunning original hand-painted art. This book discusses the worlds of our solar system rather than the planets. Each body, no matter what pigeon hole or classification it has been placed into in the past, is treated as a unique world with its own landscape, sky, weather, and character. Planets, moons, asteroids, comets, etc. are organized by size rather than type, yielding some very surprising revelations."},{"Title":"Grand Tour","review":"This excellent coffee-table book is a fascinating exploration of the solar system. It is gratifying to see this book, now in its 3rd edition, revised regularly to reflect the many continuing new discoveries of the last 25 years.This survey, written for the layman, thoroughly covers all of the important worlds of our solar system. It also discusses our solar system's formation and what we know about extrasolar planets.Most books on the solar system introduce each planet in turn from Mercury outward to Pluto. This book starts with Jupiter and proceeds in descending order by size. This unusual approach emphasizes that these worlds vary as a continuum, encouraging comparison between small planets and large satellites, between satellites and asteroids, between asteroids and comets.Part I covers the 28 largest worlds in the solar system, from Jupiter to Ceres. Part II covers selected interesting worlds, such as Halley's Comet, asteroids Vesta, Eros, Hektor, and Chiron, and moons Amalthea, Mimas and Miranda. Part III discusses extrasolar planets. A glossary covers terms such as centaurs, differentiation, millibars, and retrograde.The illustrations and photography are especially worthwhile. Miller and Hartmann dramatically illustrate the wonder and majesty of space with a mix of actual photographs and artist's renditions.The book reflects the current indecision regarding Pluto. However, the authors opine that the solar system is most sensibly viewed as having eight planets, with Pluto the largest Kuiper Belt object and Ceres the largest asteroid.Two other newly-discovered trans-Neptunian objects receive a chapter: Sedna, possibly the first known Oort Cloud object, and 2004 DW (now called Orcus), the largest-known TNO at press time.Press time for this book was spring 2005. The book therefore includes a Huygens image of Titan taken in January, but just missed the uproar caused by the July discovery of 2003 UB313/\\"Xena\\".Surprisingly, there is no table listing the diameters, periods, and other vital statistics of the planets and moons. The only other drawback that comes to mind is that there is no chapter devoted to the Sun.On another plane, Miller and Hartmann use the solar system's diversity to emphasize our good fortune in having such a wonderful Earth, and remind us to take better care of our home. They also speculate about the possibility of past or present life on Mars, Europa, Titan, and extrasolar planets. They conclude by speaking of a Copernican revolution, away from Earth and humanity as the literal and figurative center of the universe, towards a humbler view of our place in the cosmos.The unorthodox presentation and the spectacular illustrations earn this book a place in any library on astronomy."},{"Title":"Grand Tour","review":"I prefer photographs (or images made from spacecraft) over paintings, and I bought this book to raise my kids' interest in space. Well, it was my prejudice. The book has loads of the newest images, including some from the Cassini-Huygens mission, and the paintings are great, in the sense that they are not fantasy, but \\"down-to-earth\\" renderings of wiews we could have if we were there. Much better than I expected. And it is not only the images. Great text, great reading."},{"Title":"Grand Tour","review":"'The Grand Tour' is a nice small-format cofee-table-type book, with a modest selection of actual pictures from various space probes and a greater number of pleasing artwork renditions of the varios planetary bodies (54 in all, according to the cover..I didn't count them myself), and a small number of simple diagrams. The accompanying text seems pretty up-to-date and accurate, but does not go into any great depth explaining subjects such as solar system objects' composition, evolution, atmospheric structure and dynamics, and possible exobiology; most of these subjects are touched upon, but only superficially, and there isn't consistent treatment from object to object, neither in text structure/organization nor content scope. The organizational scheme presenting the solar system bodies from largest to smallest is a novel departure from the standard closest-to-farthest scheme. Buy this book mainly for the artwork, as a visual complement to more scholarly books about the solar system in your library."},{"Title":"Grand Tour","review":"I purchased this book for my daughter, a professor of geology, after reading an interview with Peter Francis. He has an amazing varied background and writes to teach and share the information about these awesome events. Nature and how the marvels of geologic science. I am a novice but am enthralled by the content."},{"Title":"Grand Tour","review":"Of all the sciences, astronomy has always been my personal favorite, and it's typically a pleasure to look through a book filled with pictures of planets and stars. The Grand Tour by Ron Miller and William Hartmann is one such pleasure.The Grand Tour offers a look at the solar system (outside of the sun), but unlike most such books, does not opt for the standard start-at-Mercury and end-at-Pluto approach. Instead, Miller and Hartmann treat their book as a travel guide for some aliens from another star. Such visitors would notice the biggest objects first and work their way down to the smaller worlds.Thus, the book starts with Jupiter, providing some general statistics (gravity, size, etc.) and a small essay about the largest planet. The big feature, however, are the pictures: both photographs and wonderful paintings that offer views that we haven't received from telescopes or probes. The first in this chapter is an example: a view of Jupiter from the surface of Europa as the planet eclipses the sun.We then go through the other \\"major worlds\\": the remaining gas giants take the next three slots, followed by Earth, Venus and Mars. Then the chapters begin to alternate between moons and planets: Ganymede and Titan precede Mercury, and then five more moons are listed (including our own) before Pluto comes up in a chapter shared with its companion, Charon (this edition of the book was written in 2005, prior to Pluto's demotion from planetary status, though the debate is discussed). There are a few other major worlds, down to the asteroid Ceres, and then a section on selected smaller worlds (moons, asteroids, and comets).If you are well-versed in astronomy and want to learn more about the planets, the Grand Tour doesn't offer all that much that you haven't read before. (On the other hand, if you're unfamiliar with this topic, the material is well-written and informative.) But I don't think that's the real purpose of this book: instead, it is to provide both real and speculative views of the star system, and here it succeeds very well."},{"Title":"Grand Tour","review":"Quite a few astronomy books have a tendency to be either dry and boring or so technically advanced that they are beyond the grasp of the casual folks interested in space topics. NOT THIS ONE! The Grand Tour: A Traveler's Guide to The Solar System is a brilliantly fresh and exciting book full of engaging commentary and breath-taking photos, illustrations, and art. In every sense, it is a grand tour! It's entertainment and education wrapped into one power-package.For those interested in and / or beginning study in comparative planetology, this is an excellent primer, chock full of lots of foundation concepts. For those teaching solar system science, this is a must have resource! For librarians, this is a jewel for your collection! For artists and art-lovers who enjoy space themes, this book presents some fantastic material. For extremely advanced astro-folks, this book may not fully satisfy the hard-core science-minded, but hopefully, they can appreciate its value in generating excitement for space topics and exploration.I knew when I saw the book's cover I was in for a real treat--a holiday in the solar system, and I wasn't disappointed. A big fan of the Red Planet Mars, I was especially interested in the Tour's Mars commentary and images. I agree with the author's opening comments about the red planet: \\"Mars is unchallenged as the planet of intrigue. Rover's have crawled its surface, robotic arms have reached out and analyzed its minerals, and orbiters have sent back data from overhead--and Mars just continues to grow more fascinating and provocative, in terms of its possible similarities to Earth-like conditions\\" (84). I absolutely love the eerie, other-worldly space art view of Mars from its moon Deimos, page 85. The section called \\"Phobos and Deimos: Moonlets of Mars\\" is very impressive (pages 248-253).Other note worthy illustrations (I offer descriptive labels here for your information. In the book, the author comments on the images in well-placed captions) are the following:\\"Pluto eclipsing the Sun as viewed from Charon\\" page 3 / space art\\"Saturn seen from Rhea\\" page 34/ space art\\"Ribbon like Clouds\\" page 36 / Voyager photo\\"Magnificent View of Saturn by Cassini Spacecraft\\" page 37 / photo\\"Saturn's Rings as possibly viewed from its atmosphere\\" page 39 / space art\\"Titan illustrated--then and now\\" page 117 / space artThis tour is well-worth the \\"ticket\\" price, and you don't even have to pack! :)"},{"Title":"Grand Tour","review":"I remember when I was a kid, this book was the first book I read from cover to cover.

In fact, I wrote it. It has hardcore and classic suggestions on trails. I worked hard on the writing, and when I used the book on the trail the directions were always right on. The maps are good. The other reviewer may have been thinking about my other guidebook for the area that had hand-drawn maps. As I wrote this eons ago (in guidebook years), some of the information is surely out of date now, but it shouldn't get a lousy review because the trails have changed."},{"Title":"Son of the Mountain Bike Adventure Guide Twin Falls Ketchum Stanley and Beyond","review":"Another very old book for the area.

Through these events, she winds up caring for a dog that has been mistreated and left tied to the tree.As the book unfolds, the dog from the &quot;wrong side of the tracks&quot; turns out to be a refined gentleman who keeps revealing clues about his past. This \\"gentledog\\", Libro, aids the lady author in healing from past and present relationships with boyfriends. Libro helps Louise move beyond her comfort zone - way beyond - try new things, and venture into new relationships with people from all walks of life.The book starts well and unfortunately slows down in the middle. The end was a disappointment because clues about the dog's past become very intriguing and it is not explored further. Overall, this book helped in understanding someone who is not from the Midwest, who is a non-dog person in a big city, and who has not a clue in handling dogs. It does provide insight in the difficulties of having a dog in the city. Who would have thought of walking a dog down four flights of stairs just for him to use the restroom!Despite the differences of raising a dog in a city versus a rural or suburban area, the common ground with dogs is the impact they have on humans.

Well, that, and I have a hard time believing that this woman adopted this Boxer and the dog never chewed anything or got on her nerves.

It was a struggle; although the author describes the dog quite eloquently and I grew to care about him, I could not bring myself to care about the author. She rescued this abused animal and for that she should be credited. But sadly, the dog did not redeem her. She brings home a limping, hungry, neglected, and abused dog and yet does not take him to a vet? FOR A YEAR?! She mentions that she is concerned about her bank balance; I can relate. However, she then goes on to describe lunch and dinner dates throughout Manhattan. Her social life does not suffer, but the dog . . . ? How about checking to see if the dog had a microchip? To see if some family was missing him terribly, if they'd somehow got separated? We'll never know because Louise never bothered to check.And then we get to the part where she kicks the dog because he ate pages out of her address book. Kicks, \\"hard\\". Any feeling I had for her self-centered, neglectful personality went right out the window. When she finds out her boyfriend is a lying cheat she shuts the dog up in the other room \\"because I was afraid I would hit him.\\" Again, the dog who only wants to love you and be loved in return bears the brunt of your problems? Why? I think I hate this woman.Libro deserved far better."},{"Title":"Bark If You Love Me (Harvest Book)","review":"This was a pleasant book to read. The author shares how she unsuspectingly became one of &quot;those&quot; people who has a dog as part of their lives. She does this reluctantly and as she shares her story, I don't think she realizes at first that she has become a dog-lover. The underlying current of this story is that she is a lonely person and her dog gives her love when no one else is. Additionally, there are some things hinted at but not thoroughly developed. They are just hinted at probably because it is hard to identify negative qualities in one's own personality. By this I mean that the author may be a bit mean, a bit too aggressive, a bit too in need of a male presence in her life, and perhaps a bit too snotty. However, these are just minor things hinted at and the story of how she opens her heart to this lost dog is truly touching and enjoyable. This story shows what having an animal in your life can do for you not just for the dog.

It's a very good read."},{"Title":"Bark If You Love Me (Harvest Book)","review":"Ms Bernikow writes her true story about rescuing a dog (Libro) in a park in NYC. What makes this such a charming, funny, heartfelt story is that she has never had a dog...not even as a child, and is able to share her experience..this love affair with her beloved dog, in a way that every dog owner will recognize. She is not hesitant to admit mistakes made, and I appreciated her honesty; even though you had to cringe when she got mad at her dog and struck out, she was able to evolve from that, and you knew that Libro had found a good forever home. I loved both the author and her dog, and it was an extremely enjoyable evening spent reading her book."},{"Title":"Bark If You Love Me (Harvest Book)","review":"This is not your typical human finds dog, dog redeems human story. It is a \\"warts and all\\" look at a NYC female who thought she did not particularly care one way or another about dogs, but obviously had some semblance of compassion deep within her that Libro brought out. For the most part, it is quite humorous to read and keeps the reader wanting to find out how things turn out (for the outcome is sometimes questionable). As you read, you realize you are seeing an evolution of a pair of souls here and you do feel there may be hope for this author and Libro, even though the kicking incident made me cringe terribly and almost made me put the book down permanently. However, do keep reading, for it does get better. The throwing up incident was a great punctuation mark to the author's stage of life at that point. In summary, this book is not an altogether easy read for the truly soft-hearted animal lovers out there (of which I am unashamedly one of them). However, it is a good story and one which in the end is satisfying.

The only thing that kept me reading it was that I was dying to see if Louise ever got poor Libro's bad leg checked out. I could have skipped to the last chapter to find that out but the story does give one an insight on dog ownership in New York. It is a completely different experience than anyplace else. The author is far too self-centered to own a pet. The dog seems more like an accessory that the author values less than her little black book. Maybe Libro can teach her a thing or two about unconditional love and the difference between love and lust. I never got the impression that Louise loved Libro. He was more like a puzzle to figure out and cope with. Even the title tells him to bark if he loves her.

Bernikow and Libro make quite an engaging couple."},{"Title":"Bark If You Love Me (Harvest Book)","review":"When started reading this book, I realized that the dog run in Riverside Park, the characters and the author herself all sounded very familiar. Then I heard the dog's name: Libro. I definitely knew this woman, I realized. I am one of those people she's writing about.This book is actually very entertaining and not nearly as slow and boring as it could be. She makes mundane experiences with her dog fun to read. BUT, I do agree with one of the other reviews- this book is very self congratulatory and judgemental. Ironically I ran into the author in the park just 2 days ago. When I told her that I'm reading her book, she got very excited and told Libro that he is the most famous dog in Riverside Park. She very loudly announced that he is &quot;the king of the dog run&quot; and &quot;everyone's favorite dog&quot;. That reminded me of the last time I ran into her (before I knew about her book). Again she was saying these things and it was honestly annoying- especially to people who have there own dogs that they think are &quot;everyone's favorite dog&quot;. Hence, I'm sorry to say that knowing her has made me like the book a little bit less."},{"Title":"Bark If You Love Me (Harvest Book)","review":"I am a dog lover and usually I find books like these to be entertaining and sentimental. This one has a mock heroic, self-congratulatory air about it. It also makes some nasty, judgmental remarks about people who own dogs in the author's neighborhood, and who in the author's &quot;mind&quot; are neurotic and have instilled neurosis in their pets. A thoroughly awful read!"},{"Title":"Bark If You Love Me (Harvest Book)","review":"What an amazingly lovely story, almost like a fairy-tail (excuse the pun) about a sophisticated city lady, who meets and falls in love with a pooch who changes her take on life. She has finally found the unconditional love we don't usually find in our fellow humans. Another stunning example of inter-species communication. Sexy single lady meets Benji. Highly recommended for pet owners, future pet owners, and those who don't know what they're missing!Arlene Millmanauthor of BOOMERANG - A MIRACLE TRILOGY(The tale of a remarkable Boston Terrier)"},{"Title":"Bark If You Love Me (Harvest Book)","review":"I'm not ordinarily a reader of woman-meets-dog books-- I picked this one up planning to give it to a friend who recently became the wildly enthusiastic owner of a poodle puppy.I ended by reading it myself, and with more interest than I would have expected, given my own dogless state. At first, I just wanted to find out more about the mystery surrounding Libro, a fifty-pound hunk whom the author found cowering in Central Park in pitiable condition. (The eventual solution to the mystery, while incomplete, is surprising and touching.) Then I got pulled into the book's deftly-drawn portrait of the existence of a contemporary single professional woman on New York's Upper West Side. Libro's new owner isn't a sweetie-pie; she's actually a pretty tough cookie for whom caving in to love, mutual dependence, and emotional intimacy with both humans and dogs is, at least at that point in her life, not the easiest thing in the world.Bark If You Love Me, the literary result of her struggle, is kind of an offbeat book in its genre--it's nowhere near as cuddly as its title suggests, and some of the narrator's efforts to cope with the trials of being a first-time dog owner may distress some dyed-in-the-wool pet owners looking for the printed equivalent of a warm puppy. But Libro's an extremely likable protagonist, and the story of his fate as an adoptee and the author's as his somewhat ambivalent adoptive owner held my attention to the end. In sum: a tough, sophisticated, very New York woman-meets-dog story that's as much about a certain kind of contemporary American woman's existence as it is about a very, very nice dog."},{"Title":"Bark If You Love Me (Harvest Book)","review":"Anyone who's ever owned a dog knows that there's a lot more to it than patting Fido and filling up a food dish. It really is an entry into an enormous club, filled with veterinarians, new friends, neighbors you've never known until your dog starts sniffing them, and relatives you thought you knew right up until the time they start giving you unsolicited opinions about ringworm. Louise Bernikow relates her entry into this club with light-hearted humor in her new book Bark If You Love Me.This is a non-fiction book but a light read that is very much like a novel. In the first chapter, Ms.Bernikow does something her mother always warned her not to do: she brings home a strange male. This time, it's a boxer she names Libro. You don't need to own a dog to laugh at the quirky characters she and Libro meet. At times, she realizes with some surprise that she feels motherly toward him. There is a lover (human), and a mystery over Libro's past, but through it all, she laughs gently at herself and learns what a trusting, reliable relationship can mean to a single woman, even if it is with a dog.Berkinow is a journalist whose writes about women's history and the nature of being single in contemporary society (see: The American Women's Almanac : An Inspiring and Irreverent Women's History.) Her latest book will make you laugh and if you don't own a dog already, might make you think seriously about getting one."},{"Title":"Bark If You Love Me (Harvest Book)","review":"WOOF!I'm barking. I loved this story.Basically, a woman takes in an abandoned dog.Not so basically, Louise and Libro need each other. They grow to understand each other. They take care of each other. They both make mistakes (Louise's perhaps worse than Libro's). A human-to-animal relationship is different from a human-to-human relationship in that, with animals, love really can conquer all.And Louise's reaction to Mickey -- classic! and beautiful!I laughed out loud. I gasped. I sobbed. I finished the book and emailed a long-lost friend with whom I renewed contact this evening. I emailed him to suggest that he read the book immediately.&quot;Bark If You Love Me&quot; was referred to me (cat person) by my brother's girlfriend (dog person at the boxer level). It was every bit as wonderful as she said. When I return this to the Bookmobile, I will strongly suggest that the librarians recommend this book to people of all ages."},{"Title":"Bark If You Love Me (Harvest Book)","review":"I've been buying copies of this book for all my dog-loving friends and all my friends who are ex-Manhattanites and miss it every day. I'm also giving it to my struggling, beginning writing friends who want samples of really fine writing. And then there are those folks who just love a good read! There is so much to like about this book it's hard to know where to start. I love the way she evokes the upper west side. I've lived there, long ago, and recognize the smells, sounds, and sights and the long and short views immediately. In addition to capturing the sense of a very specific place, she succeeds in evoking the idea of place as character. I love how, when she &quot;accidentally&quot; becomes a dog owner/lover/keeper for the first time in her life, she discovers that in this neighborhood she's called home most of her life and assumed intimate knowledge of, she suddenly discovers a parallel universe--the world of dog people. They've been there all along! And suddenly what was most familiar is brand new. I love how this writer, whose career I have followed for decades, finds a new way to be politically active, alive, accountable. Most of all, I love the writing -- the sheer professionalism of a skilled writer whose craft has been honed to the point of complete invisibility and absolute beauty. If I were teaching writing, this is the book I would use to show students the marvelous variety of sentences we have available to us. I would use this book to talk about subtlty, evocation, urbanity, subtext, and disciplined style. I'm not a dog lover but I'd let Libro give me a kiss. I might even kiss him back -- if his keeper had brushed his teeth recently."},{"Title":"Bark If You Love Me (Harvest Book)","review":"I agree with the other reviewers that the book is a fun, light read - for the most part. I was enjoying the book until she wrote about the dog having chewed up her appointment book and she &quot;kicked him. hard. in the ribs. he ran for cover under the sink.&quot; I couldn't read anymore. I understand that the book is about how the two of them came to understand, trust and love each other. I just would have preferred NOT having to read about her abusing a dog that was so loving and had, most likely, been previously abused."},{"Title":"Bark If You Love Me (Harvest Book)","review":"Having just gotten my first dog at the age of 29, I was really enjoying this book. Until I got to the part where the author's dog eats part of her organizer one day when she is out. The author writes, &quot;I kicked him, hard.&quot; I was appalled! This woman adopted an ABUSED animal and then beat it the first time it did anything wrong? Anyone who has ever lived with a pet knows that you have to be flexible with regards to housetraining and chewing and all of that, and I just couldn't relate to the author at all after reading that passage. I reluctantly applaud her honesty for sharing that bit of information with her readers, but I frankly wish she'd spared us."},{"Title":"Bark If You Love Me (Harvest Book)","review":"Who knew that adopting an abandoned dog could open up a whole new world? With this memoir, which is about so much more than dogs, Bernikow takes us on a tour of the strange continent of dog people who inhabit her New York City neighborhood.Eccentricity may be the defining characteristic of this Manhattan microcosm. Friendships, love affairs, and animosities ebb and flow in and around the dog park. And it's not just dogs doing the socializing. Indeed, the common bond of dog ownership brings together disparate folks -- professors and entertainers, gay and straight couples -- whose lives become inextricably entwined. Indeed, a dog-induced romance stands at the center of the plot.Dogs bring out the best and worst in everyone, it seems. In a city that can often be anonymous, passers-by inquire into the dog's age, well-being, and history. Tough-looking men turn into mushballs. And presumed friends deride bad doggie manners.The politicized factions that emerge in response to the City's crackdown on dogs are described with humor and affection. Only in New York could an organized band of dog-lovers agitate for greater off-leash privileges!Bark If You Love Me is, of course, a great gift for dog-lovers and New Yorkers. It's also a delightful read for anyone who appreciates a light-hearted and well-written slice of life."},{"Title":"Bark If You Love Me (Harvest Book)","review":"I love dog books. I bought this one on the basis of a quick glance at a few of the sentences. The writing looked clean, unsentimental. I don't require much in a good dog story.My mate, my dog, and I went away to a cabin for a few days and I looked forward to indulging in this book. There, blithely reading along, doing my best to ignore the author's self-centered narrative, waiting for the part where the dog redeems her and she finds herself and becomes less Manhattan-shallow, suddenly she makes a confession that makes me ill. She comes home one day to find the dog in the bathroom, where she sends him when he is bad. Apparently, he knows he's done something wrong. She goes into her office where she finds her datebook chewed to shreds. Furious, she storms back to the bathroom and kicks the dog, \\"hard.\\"Ugh. Even thinking of it now it's like I've been kicked in the stomach. How can you kick a *dog*? How, especially, can you kick a dog that you've already seen cower from past abuse?It's great that she confessed, and I hope she never did it again. But I didn't stick around to find out.I tried. I tried to pick up the book I thought I was going to be reading and keep on. But it made me sick, and finally, I realized I couldn't keep reading a book written by a woman who abused an abused dog. I don't care if it was just once. If you kick a dog who already knows it's done something wrong, a dog that has already cowered from past abuse, there's something wrong with you and you should not be owning dogs, much less writing about them.If you want to read a good dog book, there are plenty of others.

It contains dialogues which are way beyond a beginner's level, very sparse and incomplete vocabulary lists (which are located AFTER the exercises, so you have to flip ahead just to learn the words), and very few pronunciation guides. One exercise in unit 2 (I didn't get much farther than that) instructs you to translate sentences full of words that the book hasn't taught, many of which aren't even in the glossary, let alone the vocab lists -- I had to look in a dictionary just to complete the exercise. I kept re-checking the cover to make sure that this was supposed to be a beginner's course. By the time I finished the second unit, I was exhausted, frustrated, and angry; I shortly gave up and got a Berlitz book, which was like a breath of fresh air. Now I'm happily making progress in my French studies, no thanks to &quot;Access French.&quot; I don't know what the authors of this book were thinking.

I have trouble enough hearing the French even when I *know* what the words are.I purchased this text because an alternative language school designated it for beginning French. Interestingly, they barely use it, instead coming in every week with copied material from other sources.A note on the book itself. It is made of very slick paper with a lot of pictures and color graphics (see Sesame Street above) so don't get it wet.

I admire Mr. Eco for his pedagogy and effort in the advancement of the field of semiotics. That said...Umberto Eco reminds me of the neurosurgeon who's invited to dinner at the plumbers' union. He can't seem to lower himself to the level of his audience, and despite the fact that he has much to offer succeeds in conveying only a portion of it to his listeners. This is assuming his intended audience is the general public and not a tiny niche of linguists. The subject of this book is interesting, but is unfortunately largely lost in arcane vernacular. It needs an additional level of translation.Obviously it is difficult to communicate clearly in an specialized field without the use of specialized vocabulary. Any professional can leave the average person stone cold with a bunch of techno-babble, but in the end there has been no real communication. The trick is to educate strangers to the field while elucidating the finer points of same.Often hindering this process is the mindset among intellectuals that the student should raise himself to the level of the professor. This idea is horribly flawed and lurking behind the sentiment is often self-aggrandizement on the part of the academic. Stephen Hawkings, probabably the most gifted physicist alive, admits that his first book was a debacle and resolved to change that. His subsequent works, which soared to the top of non-fiction lists world-wide, were in layman's language.

After all, if Pinocchio turned into a boy for being good, why couldn't the other donkeys turn back into humans after regretting being mischievous? :(I actually read the 1988 edition which was a reproduction of the 1948 edition. The story is dark and Pinocchio is a bad puppet from the start, not the sweet innocent puppet that Disney created. The story is well written, fun and a short read; less than 200 pages."},{"Title":"PINOCCHIO THE TALE OF A PUPPET","review":"I first read this title in a hard copy dated 1965.

In the free Kindle copy, the men \\"began to scratch and bite and slap each other\\" which is close, but not as funny.The tale overall is much darker than Disney does it, just like most of its older classics (like Bambi, Snow White, etc.) tend to be darker in the books. It is perfect reading for an older child who tends to turn his nose up at the baby-ish versions. This book makes Pinocchio much more naughty, and shows more raw emotion, which I think highlights the character development to a greater degree when he finally comes around and stops being naughty. It is a perfect read for older children, particularly if they liked the \\"Stories for Demented Children\\" series (free Kindle downloads!) and perfect for those into classics."},{"Title":"PINOCCHIO THE TALE OF A PUPPET","review":"From a longer review on my 5cense site:Pinocchio is not nearly the moralistic tale that Disney paints it to be. Collodi's Pinocchio is far from innocent, but is more of a Huck Finn type, most of the time a mean-spirited brat. he is a wood puppet, but unlike McOcchio, who is endowed with a life force by some blue fairy waving a wand, the real McCoy Pinocchio is possessed with life before he is even carved into a puppet. & the story doesn't start with Geppetto, but before that even there is a carpenter named Cilegio, a raging alcoholic with anger management issues & a bulbous red nose, who finds this possessed piece of wood. this pine log is too much of a handful for Cilegio so he takes it to his 'friend' Geppetto (an aspiring puppeteer). not only was Pinocchio perhaps the first instance of children's literature, before the genre even existed, but perhaps this is the first story of a same-sex couple 'having' a baby. of course this is not directly said in the book, but you can surmise this from the way Cilegio & Geppetto bicker & fight like a married couple (in chapter 2 they basically beat the stuffing out of each other & then make-up after). not surprising that Disney decided to take Cilegio out of the picture. & Geppetto is not exactly the provincial model citizen, but lives in poverty, on the fringes...."},{"Title":"PINOCCHIO THE TALE OF A PUPPET","review":"Sorry folks, got this for my step-mother's Kindle Fire so haven't really got the chance to read the book, so this is not a good review for your selections help, however, it is a classic story I think everyone knows (part of the reason Disney made a movie out of it) so it could be worth your time, espicially sense the download is free, thanks for reading, have a nice day!"},{"Title":"PINOCCHIO THE TALE OF A PUPPET","review":"The tone of this book is of a father angry with his son. The faults of a typical boy are blown to ridiculous sociopathic proportions. There many speeches about how little boy's hate \\"this-thing-that-is-good-for-them\\". If viewed from that angle this book becomes especially scary with all the horrible things that happen to Pinnochio (hanging, dismemberment, drowning, threats of being used for firewood, or eaten, attacked by ASSASSINS).Fairy tales have morals, everyone who reads or sees a movie adaptation of one not only knows it but expects it. Most fairytales are a short two to three page read with the moral stated ONCE at the very end. Collodi's multi-chapter story beats you over the head with a multitude of them. Every chapter has at least one moral rant.Yes, Disney's version was less violent, less weird, but it was also less preachy. Disney's Pinnochio as a character was new to the world, naive, and thus easily led astray. Collodi's Pinnochio was EVIL from before he is even carved into a puppet. As a BLOCK OF WOOD, he attacks and nearly lames Gepetto.It is nice to see where Disney got the idea. The only bright points are when you can point to an event and say \\"that was in the movie\\".Do not read this book to children, they might take the wrong parts too seriously."},{"Title":"PINOCCHIO THE TALE OF A PUPPET","review":"This is a review for the free Kindle edition. The e-book version is well-formatted without any noticeable mistakes. It doesn't have any front matter (no preface or introduction) nor a table of contents, but the work is divided into chapters and as a whole is fairly short (novella-length, \\"1441\\" locations). The only annoying part is the old-fashioned one-sentence summary of each chapter that you have to learn to skip over (lest you find out what's about to happen).The story itself is wilder and weirder than the Disney movie. It's a little more violent, a little more moralistic, but still an entertaining read. The classic components of the story that most people know are here (Geppetto, the extending nose, and even an unnamed talking cricket, who is not treated quite as gently here), but there are other characters and events that are classic in their own right (the fox and the cat, the girl with azure hair). Though the story can have a grab-bag, incohesive feel at times, the last sequence of events (beginning with the trip to the \\"Land of Toys\\") is compelling. A fun read!"},{"Title":"PINOCCHIO THE TALE OF A PUPPET","review":"Pinocchio is one of the most beloved and recognizable of all children stories characters. The story of Pinocchio, written by Carol Collodi and originally published in 1881, has been published, republished, retold, and adapted countless times over the last 130 years. However, most people today are probably primarily familiar with the adaptation (and the depiction) of Pinocchio from Disney's movie. It is nonetheless always instructive and worthwhile to go to the original story because, in my opinion, most attempts to \\"improve\\" any given story inevitably end up subtracting rather than adding to its value.This is a free, short and very readable Kindle edition of the Pinocchio story. It is an excellent opportunity for anyone to get reacquainted with this talking marionette, and an even better chance for all those who have never read or seen the story in the first place. The original story is much more colorful, but also darker, than the more recent adaptations. Pinocchio, Geppetto and other characters often get into physical confrontations. For the most part these incidents are amusing, but they oftentimes quite literary result in a loss of life or limb. Reading the original story also brings forth the fact that \\"Adventures of Pinocchio\\" was very consciously written as a morality tale. Its aim is to teach children (and especially boys) some of the basic character-building lessons: it's important to obey your parents or other authority figures, it's important to study and work hard, chasing after easy life and cheap thrills inevitably ends in a disaster. The forcefulness of such admonitions may seem a bit quaint today, but I for one think that they have a place even in the modern world.Overall, this is a very fun little book that people of all ages will enjoy reading."},{"Title":"PINOCCHIO THE TALE OF A PUPPET","review":"This is a review for the free Kindle edition.Read it! Collodi's original story is light years away from the saccharine, bowlderised Disney version. For example, Disney makes the talking cricket into a funny little man who sings schmaltzy songs like 'When You Wish Upon a Star'.The book is a lot tougher. Pinocchio kills the cricket in Chapter 4, it then reappears as a ghost and appears again at the end of the story.The original is dark and dangerous throughout. The moralising is laid on a wee bit thick, but the story swoops and weaves with the most amazing plot (much of which is missing from Disney).The formatting of the free version leaves a bit to be desired, but the story is so strong it doesn't matter. And for the price who can complain?A classic. Brilliant!"},{"Title":"PINOCCHIO THE TALE OF A PUPPET","review":"Very well put-together edition of this classic tale.

Soap opera? Well, sort of -- it's Nobel Prize Winner John Galsworthy's sprawling family epic \\"The Forsyte Saga.\\" While it has a distinctly soapy flavor, \\"Saga\\" retains its dignity and look at turn-of-the-century mores and society.The Forsyte family is determinedly regal and hard-nosed, almost to the point of a fault. One staid family member, Soames Forsyte, becomes obsessed with the beautiful but poor Irene, and finally gets her to marry him -- on condition that if their marriage doesn't work, she walks. Well, their marriage doesn't work. Soames is frustrated that Irene shuts him out of her life and her bed -- even more so when he learns that she is in love with sexy, arty architect Bosinney, who is building them a new house.Soames rapes Irene and ruins Bosinney. His marriage falls into ruins, and Bosinney is killed in a car accident. So Irene leaves permanently, living in an apartment by herself. Then Soames announces that he wants to marry a pretty French girl, Annette, and Irene weds Soames' cousin. But the problems of the older generation get inherited by the younger one -- Soames's daughter falls madly in love with Irene's son, but their parents' secret pasts doom their love.Three novels (\\"A Man of Property,\\" \\"In Chancery,\\" and \\"To Let\\"), connected with two short stories (\\"Indian Summer of a Forsyte\\" and \\"Awakening\\") -- it's a pretty big story, sprawling over three generations and four decades. It's a bit soapy, with all the scandal and family weirdness, but the dignified writing keeps it from seeming sordid.It's a credit to Galsworthy that he can communicate so much without ever getting into his characters' heads. He displays emotion in undemonstrative people like Irene through little mannerisms and twitches. At the same time, he can give us heartrending looks into aging patriarch Old Jolyon's lonely mind. His writing is very nineteenth century, dignified and with plenty of furniture/clothing details. It's pretty dense, but all right once you get used to it.Galsworthy was a solid supporter of women's rights, and you can see in Irene and Soames' relationship -- Soames, who sees his wife as another piece of property, and the determined Irene who only wants her own happiness, but can't afford to live on her own. Their respective kids Jon and Fleur are nice but kind of boring beside their darker, more intense parents.For a look at the social shifts that helped define the twentieth century, take a look at the \\"Forsyte Saga.\\" Or if you just want to soak in a tale of family woe, love, hate and dark secrets, \\"Saga\\" still works."},{"Title":"The Forsyte Saga","review":"The first volume of \\"The Forsyte Saga\\" contains three novels and two interludes between each. It chronicles the lives of the Forsyte family between more than 30 years. In his narrative, John Galsworthy deals not only with the family's fortunes but also the society of their time, and its changes.\\"The Man of Property\\" is the first novel of the monumental Forsyte Saga and in the beginning the writer spends some time creating his environment where those Forsyte will inhabit.The first chapters turn out to be the more descriptive in the book. Not only does he introduces the most important members of the family, but he also describe their moral-social relationships -- that count much more than their blood relations.Once Galsworthy feels that his characters are established -- and it doesn't take too many pages, as a matter of fact -- he starts the narrative per se, although a slight plot has been developed from the beginning.\\"The Man of Property\\" concerns more on old Jolyon Forsyte's life and his son and his nephew Soames and Soames' wife, Irene (one of the most unforgettable characters in the saga). Soames is the man of property, but not only has he got unanimated properties but he also considers himself the owner of Irene. She will involve herself with another man, and this love affair will affect the all Forsytes in some levels.This novel is a great beginning for Galsworthy's saga, with vivid characters, a well-built plot and charming writing. While the writer is developing the family affairs, he has the chance to portray the changes in the high society life in the early XX Century in England.In the second installment of \\"The Forsyte Saga\\", the writer reassumes the life of the Forsyte family. \\"In Chancery\\" is situated a few years after the events told in \\"The Man of Property\\", in a few pages recaps some of the most important facts of the first book and their aftermath. After that he is able to move on.And on he moves -- but the narrative still concerns on young Jolyon, Soames and Irene that forms a love triangle. While the remaining Jolyon become a close friend to Irene, her ex-husband --from whom she hasn't divorced in all those years -- fells jealous and considers claiming his wife back.Needless to say that this is not the only plot in the novel. Galsworthy develops more family plots. It is impossible not to have the feeling that while he is sometimes depicting the shallowness of the elite from his time, at the same time he has an indulgent look upon the rich and wealthy -- which is not a bad thing as a matter of fact.Those who like \\"The Man of Property\\" will certainly find more pleasure in \\"In Chancery\\". He finishes the book with the perfect hook what will come next.For those who liked \\"The Man of Property\\" \\"In Chancery\\", \\"To Let\\" is a treat. At this point we are in a transition. The old school of Forytes (Jolyon, Soames...) is about to \`resign', while new folks are starting to assume the power and the money (Jolyon's third son, Soames' daughter...). The very old Forsyte school, by the way, is already history.\\"To Let\\" is a novel of transition; it is as if the parents are passing the command to their kids -- at least in terms of narrative. That is why old plots (Irene, Somaes, Jolyon) and new ones are in the center of the narrative.The story is set some twenty years after the ending of \\"In Chancery\\", Soames' and Jolyon's kids are virtually adults but they don't know the plot involving their parents (the story of the first and second novel) and are ready to fall in love. It is not surprise that Fleur (Jolyon's French kid) will fall in love with Jon (Jolyon's third son also named Jolyon).But their main obstacle is not the fact that they are cousins, but the relations from the past. The narrative will focus on this Romeo and Juliet-esque couple whose union --or separation-- lies in a secret hidden in the past.Those who have reached the third installment in the saga are those who have liked it and are looking forward to see what will happen to the Forsyte. So it is no mystery that Galsworthy exploits the family changes as a shadow of the change in their society --set about the 20's of the XX Century. As Britain Empire declines, so does the power of the Forsytes that cannot avoid their hidden skeletons."},{"Title":"The Forsyte Saga","review":"I really had trouble putting this book down. It is excellent for summer reading, especially on a cruise to Bermuda during martini happy hour. The rise of an English middle class family to power and prestige is fascinating to me because no matter how sophisticated they become they are still very practical about money and investments, unlike the old aristocracy. The compromise of the beautiful Irene for the sake of wealth resulting in the unhappiness of her nightmarish first marriage to Soames, is something with which modern women, who must often compromise their personal wishes for financial reasons, can identify. Soames is a character whom everyone despises and yet I felt myself pitying him in the end, because in spite of his great wealth he is cheated of true love and so is his child. If anything, this book shows how the mistakes of the parents can truly damage the lives of their children. My favorite character was old Jolyon, whose love and generosity ennobles him in a way that money never can."},{"Title":"The Forsyte Saga","review":"I was very happy to receive the book I purchased in such good condition. I am pleased with my purchase."},{"Title":"The Forsyte Saga","review":"Everyone's heard of \\"The Forsyte Saga,\\" the BBC family epic of the late Victorian Age. Fewer have read the Galsworthy book, and that's a shame, because it's fascinating on so many levels.On the surface it's the story of Soames Forsyte, the quintessential icon of the growth of the upper middle classes and the decline of the nobility during the Victorian era. Descended from a farmer in Dorset in the not-too-distant past, Soames is a lawyer and a man of property. He buys wisely, sells more wisely, and husbands his wealth and that of the family. He is in control of everything that affects him, except one thing--his wife. Desiring to possess the sensitive, beautiful, genteel but poor Irene, and with the help of a callous mother, Soames pressures Irene into becoming his wife. From this single mistake, the one time Soames let passion rule, his life and the lives of his family and their descendants are changed in unpredictable and frightening ways. Galsworthy's theme is the constant tussle in life between property and art, love and possession, freedom and convention. In the fine tradition of family sagas, these themes play themselves out over and over with each generation.On another level, this is the story of an age, the story of the British Empire at its peak. Galsworthy packs his book with allusions to the great crises of the time, the Boer War and WWI, the rise of Labour, the death of the Queen, the spread of \\"democracy.\\" The Forsyte homes are meticulously detailed, from the French reproduction furniture to the dusty sofas to the heavy drapes, to the fireplace grate, to the electric lights in the old chandeliers. Soames collects art, and Galsworthy showers us with the opinions of a British gentleman of the great and not so great art of the day.The saga was written over a period of many years, and on yet another level I found the the changes in Galsworthy's style from the rather clipped, detailed recitations of events and commentary typical of the 19th century to the more expressive style of the 20th. Especially in the first volume of the three, family relationships are painstakingly laid out, the rounds of dinners and family gatherings carefully chronicled. By the third volume, To Let, Galsworthy reveals the love of the countryside and the pain of repressed emotions that the family members a generation ago would have hidden. The writing is very beautiful--as in this sentence: \\"Fleur raised her eyelids--the restless glint of those clear whites remained on Holly's vision as might the flutter of a caged bird's wings.\\" It took me a good six weeks to plow through The Forsyte Saga, but it was worth it."},{"Title":"The Forsyte Saga","review":"When I first started reading this book, I simply could not get into it. I ploughed through most of \\"The Man of Property\\" before I finally was able to get into the story, and even then I find myself wondering if I only finished the book because I have never not done so.As for the characters...Soames is nothing short of detestable, and Irene simply got on my nerves. Out of the rest of the characters, the only two who truly stuck out to me were the Old and Young Jolyons, and I am sure I only liked them because they were the least \\"Forsyte-ish\\" of the whole cast.This novel may have been named one of the great romantic sagas ever, its author may have won the Nobel Prize, but I simply cannot place it up there with works by the likes of Jane Austen and Henry James."},{"Title":"Carrie Stevens: Maker of Rangeley Favorite Trout and Salmon Flies","review":"This is a superlative book on a par with The Art of the Salmon Fly by J.Bates.

The novel begins with the 1736 Porteous riots, in which disgruntled citizens of Edinburgh storm the local prison to take revenge on a needlessly cruel official. With Anglo-Scottish relations in a tailspin and Queen Caroline levying a rash of punishments against Edinburgh in the background, the action of &quot;Mid-Lothian&quot; commences.The principle heroes of the novel are Jeanie Deans and her longtime suitor, Reuben Butler. The two rustic born youths are from differently oriented Presbyterian ancestry - their parents' religious differences force an almost interminable delay in the progress of their affections. Butler's extensive formal and ministerial education notwithstanding, his financial position is such that he cannot comfortably propose a union to Jeanie's father. Further complication arises when Jeanie's younger and more impulsive half-sister, Effie, is seduced and later accused of murdering her child. The majority of the novel details Jeanie's attempts to question the impropriety of the judgement against her sister, and her interactions with the world outside of provincial northern Scotland.As always, Scott deals with a range of social, economic, political, and legal issues. Among these in &quot;Mid-Lothian&quot; is the right of the Scottish to control their own internal disputes - are Scottish law and British law compatible? On a related tip, the novel calls into question whether the governors of the people have sufficient sympathy with and understanding of all the people they govern. Scott also examines the nature of language - with plain English, various Scottish dialects, and quotations from classical Latin and the Bible - the characters in the novel often have to understand each other before they can adequately communicate.&quot;Mid-Lothian&quot; has a number of quirky and interesting minor characters: from the soft-spoken, yet intently-staring Dumbiedikes, to the hardline theologian-father David Deans, to the rake George Robertson, to the tragically mysterious Madge Wildfire, to the courtly, wistful Duke of Argyle. These minor characters add substance, humor, and diversity to Scott's intricate plot. In &quot;The Heart of Mid-Lothian,&quot; Jeanie Deans, an unpretentious young woman, takes on a world beyond the enclosed experience of her home, bearing the troubles of her family, her community, and her nation on her back. The result is a great, if sometimes gregarious novel which you will certainly enjoy."},{"Title":"The Heart of Midlothian","review":"Having been asked to spend a few weeks at a remote Naval base in the former &#8220;German Democratic Republic&#8221;, I had plenty of time on my hands to read Walter Scott&#8217;s &#8220;Heart of Midlothian&#8221; in the Oxford World&#8217;s Classics edition (with notes, 580 pages), something that whiled away the time more than satisfactorily, this novel being perhaps the best that Scott ever wrote. In his previous Waverley novel, &#8220;Old Mortality&#8221;, he had described the unruly, extreme tendencies of Covenanter Calvinism. In this book, he shows us the other side of the strict Biblical piety he had got to know during his own childhood. The novel is based on two true stories, the Porteous riots in Edinburgh, and the heroics of one Helen Walker, a simple Scots lass who walked to London to save her sister from an unjustly imposed death penalty for child murder. Scott&#8217;s way of combining these two stories, making the leader of the riot to be the father of the child that had disappeared, is neither historical nor particularly convincing, and the fate of the child is, indeed, a horrible one. But for me, the most interesting aspect of the book was the description of the Christianity practised by Lowland Scots at the beginning of the 18th century. Davie Deans, the father of Scott&#8217;s heroine, is something of a Cameronian or strict covenanter, and it is, perhaps, his very strictness which drives his young daughter Effie to the worldly pursuits that he so much abhorrs. But Davie Deans is an honest soul, and despite his wordy arguments with his neighbours, emerges as a very sympathetic figure, who, towards the end of the book, reaches something of a compromise to enable himself and his elder daughter to live in fairly comfortable circumstances; this, surely, is a picture of how Scott sees the development of theological Calvinism, forced to come to terms with the political and social realities of a Scotland dominated by &#8220;prelatist&#8221; English interests. Jeannie Deans, Scott&#8217;s rather romanticized version of Helen Walker, is an equally strict believer, but her faith expresses itself not in words but in actions, and this is what makes her both a charming heroine and a symbol of what, according to Scott, is best in Christianity and Calvinism.As for the rest of the book, it is the descriptions of the Porteous riots and the storming of the Edinburgh prison, the &#8220;Heart of Midlothian&#8221;, at the beginning which make the greatest impression, followed perhaps by the trial scenes and then the interviews in London with the Duke of Argyll and with Queen Caroline, wife of George II. The last part of the book, which is due entirely to Scott&#8217;s imagination and has no basis in reality, is more disappointing, as though Scott thought he could not publish a novel without at least some scenes in the Highlands, scenes which here do not ring absolutely true.Reading Scott is never easy, but the World&#8217;s Classics edition makes a brave attempt at facilitating the procedure with copious explanatory notes, a historical overview and a glossary which, while not containing every difficult word, is comprehensive enough to help the reader through the intricacies of Scottish legal Latin and Lowland dialect."},{"Title":"The Heart of Midlothian","review":"Heart of Midlothian is best known today in Scotland as the name of a football team from Edinburgh. Many may be aware that the team took its name from a novel, but Scott's story is little read nowadays so few indeed are aware that the novel took its name from a prison. This prison was situated in the centre of Edinburgh in the county of Midlothian, until it was torn down in 1817, and no doubt a certain irony was intended when it became known as The Heart of Midlothian. Scott's novel focuses on the prison firstly in its description of the Porteous riot of 1736 when a mob stormed the prison in order to revenge itself on a prisoner who it seemed was to escape justice. More importantly it is to this prison that Effie Deans is sent for the crime of child murder, because she has kept the fact of her pregnancy secret and cannot produce the child. Effie faces the prospect of execution even though there is no evidence that she has killed her baby. The law considered her secrecy as evidence enough of her guilt. This leads to a terrible dilemma for the novel's heroine Jeannie Deans. If she would merely say that she had been told of her sister's pregnancy, Effie would go free. Jeannie will go to any lengths to free her sister, but she will not lie. In her search for justice Jeannie must walk to London and her extraordinary journey takes her to the very top of 18th century society.Jeannie Deans is the greatest of Scott's heroines. She is strong both physically and morally. While she may not have the education of some of those she meets, she more than matches their learning with her own common sense. It is the investigation of her character, which makes the novel so interesting. The story is well told and is often exciting with lots of suspense and emotion, but Scott is less concerned with romance in this novel than in some of his others. The story of Jeannie's love for her childhood friend Reuben Butler is important, but told in such a way as to emphasise Jeannie's morals and sense rather than her romantic inclinations. If there is a romantic heroine in the novel, it is Effie, but her wilful, petulant nature together with her involvement with a rake is contrasted unfavourably with the behaviour and character of her sister. Heart of Midlothian is a long novel perhaps too long, as the fourth part is not quite as good as the first three. It is also quite a difficult read with a good deal of difficult legalistic language and a greater than usual amount of Scots dialect. The best edition of the novel is undoubtedly that edited by David Hewitt and Alison Lumsden. The editors have gone back to Scott's manuscript and the first edition of the novel in order to correct numerous errors and restore a number of important readings, which have previously been lost. The result is a stunning example of modern editorial scholarship, which provides the reader with a text, which is easier and more enjoyable to read. This edition moreover has an extensive set of notes and a full glossary both of which are essential if Scott's text is to be fully understood. Heart of Midlothian is perhaps not the best place to begin reading Scott. But it is a novel, which anyone who reads Scott should aim towards, for it is quite possibly the best of the Waverley novels."},{"Title":"The Heart of Midlothian","review":"The Heart of Midlothian by Sir Walter Scott (1771-1832) is the best novel in the distinguished series by this author called \\"The Waverly Novels. (The series title derives from the name of the title hero in the first of these novels: the young English soldier Edward Waverly.)The plot is simple. Jeanie Deans is a young Calvinist lass who is engaged to be married to a poor schoolmaster named Reuben Butler. During the 1736 riots in Edinburgh, in which Captain Porteous a tax agent was murdered by hanging, Jeanie's younger sister Effie is accused of murdering her newborn child. Effie is imprisoned and condemned to death. Jeanie seeks to save her life by appealing to Queen Caroline in London who is the wife of King George II of Great Britain. As Jeanie travels on her long jaunt from Edinburgh to London the reader meets a broad crosssection of Scottish and English persons who assist the young girl on her quest for justice. Jeanie is one of the most appealing heroines in all of British fiction.The book is not only fascinating for this heartwarming story but also lluminates:a. The relationship between poor Scotland and wealthy England in the immediate years following the union of the two nations in 1707.b. A look at the religious differences between episocapcy supported by the English and the sternCalvinist Presbyterianism in Scotlandc. A nostalgic look at Scottish life as it moves from an agricultural to an industrialized age.d. Like Charles Dickens, Scott was good at drawing eccentric minor characters which add richness and humor to this long novel.And now for a caveat. Scott's novels are always difficult reading! He relishes in making authorial comments on the characters behavior and retards the action with long digressions on politics, religion and other aspects of Scottish life which may not have been familiar to his English readers. This material is often interesting but adds too many pages to his tale. The last quarter of the book needs editing as the decision regarding the fate of Effie Deans has already been decided by that point.Scott's books require a glossary of Scottish words, customs and phrases which are necessary to aid the 21st century reader's understanding of the novel. Scott was the first major historical novelists in the English language. His novels broke new ground by interesting male and young readers in exciting epic fictions. He was widely popular in his own day. A resurgence of interest in this important author is long overdue. Scott is an excellent writer but it takes concentration and study to enjoy his books. The Heart of Mid-Lothian was published in 1818 and has never been out of print."},{"Title":"The Heart of Midlothian","review":"Written in 1818, \\"The Heart Of Midlothian\\" is one of the most famous works of the great Scottish Writer, Sir Walter Scott. It is set largely in Scotland in the time between the Jacobite rebellions of 1715 and 1745 and revolves around the Edinburgh riots of 1736 that saw the lynching of John Porteous, Captain of the City Guard, and the subsequent retaliation by the English Crown. Intimately connected with this is the story of Effie Deans, condemned to death on the assumption of having had her child killed, despite a total lack of evidence and the efforts of her sister Jeanie to see her freed. Incidentally the \\"Heart of Midlothian\\" was the Edinburgh Tollhouse or Jail, which was later pulled down and removed.It is a longish read at 507 pages, but by no means long compared to many of the bloated works of recent years. It took me a very long time to read, not because of its length but because its style was so dry and tedious and so full of unnecessary detail as to prevent me reading more than a chapter or two at a time, and there are 52 chapters. A random example:\\"There was not a window in all the lofty tenements around it, or in the steep and crooked street called the Bow, by which the fatal procession was to descend, that was not absolutely filled with spectators. The uncommon height and antique appearance of these houses, some of which were formerly the property of the Knights Templars, and the Knights of St John, and still exhibit on their fronts and gables the iron cross of these orders, gave additional effect to the scene in itself so striking.\\"There's nothing wrong with this language, and the excessive detail may be interesting to some, but for me it makes dreary read.Scott was a lawyer by trade, and he carries his work with him in this novel. Not only does it read as though declaimed by a barrister at the Assizes, but it is full of lawyers, would be lawyers, lawyer's humour and lawyer's Latin. For example:\\"He has been a candidate for our remedium miserabile\\" said Mr Hardie, \\"commonly called a cessio bonorum. As there are divines who have doubted the eternity of future punishments, so the Scotch lawyers seem to have thought that the crime of poverty might be atoned for by something short of perpetual imprisonment. After a month's confinement, you must know, a prisoner for debt is entitled, on a sufficient statement to our Supreme Court, setting forth the amount of his funds, and the nature of his misfortunes, and surrendering all his effects to his creditors, to claim to be discharged from prison\\".\\"I had heard\\", I replied, \\"of such a humane regulation\\".\\"Yes\\", said Halkit, \\"and the beauty of it is, as the foreign fellow said, you may get the cessio when the bonorums are all spent. ...\\"The characters Halkit and Hardie and all their legal carry-on in the first chapter are entirely unnecessary as is the character Bartoline Saddletree, who's utterances throughout the book are tedious in the extreme, not only to the reader, but also to the other characters who are forced to listen to him. Obviously Scott had not the art of self editing, being entirely unable to cull his own dross, and the book is much the weaker for it.And now we come to the matter of religion. There is a great deal of religion in this book, and in my opinion at least, a great deal too much. I know that many folk in those days took the cult of Jehovah far more seriously than they do today, but it makes for boring reading. There can surely be few indeed who care a fig about the Cameronian Covenanters and their nit picking issues with the Protestant Church. For example:\\"There remained a third stumbling block - the oaths to government exacted from the established clergymen, in which they acknowledge an Erastian king and parliament, and homologate the incorporating union between England and Scotland, through which the latter kingdom had become part and parcel of the former, wherein Prelacy, the sister of Popery, had made fast her throne, and elevated the horns of her mitre. These were the symptoms of defection which had often made David cry out. \\"My bowels, my bowels! I am pained at the very heart!\\" ...These oaths were, therefore, a deep compliance and a dire abomination - a sin and a snare, and a danger and a defection. But this shibboleth was not always exacted.\\"...There may well have been people like the tiresome David Deans, and modern students of Christian history may be fascinated with the intricacies of Protestant doctrine but for the rest of us it just gets in the way of the story.Scott may, perhaps, have excuses for the above flaws, but what he can not excuse himself from is the books greatest flaw: the one dimensionality of the main characters. Jeanie the heroine is, to put it baldly, a drip. A courageous, do it herself woman, willing and able to risk her life and honour to save her sister. A steadfast Protestant willing to let her sister be sentenced to death rather than tell a lie before God. A loyal lover, prepared to wait years for her boring boyfriend to get a decent job before marrying him, meanwhile denying the suit of the local Laird. A fine cheesemaker and exemplary housekeeper. Wise confidant, providential saver, loving mother, dedicated Christian and dutiful wife. She never puts a foot out of line, never learns anything and never has any fun in the entire book! What a drip!Much the same can be same of her eventual husband Reuben Butler. A struggling school teacher and cleric. He has a smaller part but is similarly a paragon of virtue and dull as dishwater!The characters of people like David Deans and Bartoline Saddletree are \\"enlivened\\" by making them tiresome. The Duke of Argyle and the Queen of England are paragons of nobility: generosity, judgement and grace. Too pat and one dimensional Scott!It is the people of arbitrary morality that have the most rounded characters, such as Jem Ratcliffe, George Staunton, Duncan Knockdunder and Effie Deans herself, yet in the whole book it is only Duncan that has any real zest for life.Inexcusable Mr Scott, to fill a book full of dull characters. Surely 18th century Scotland can't have been THAT dreary!!!The other inexcusable flaw in this work is the way it all turns out. Not only is it predictably pat, but it is RELIGIOUSLY pat. Any character that has done wrong comes to a bad end. (With the exception of Ratcliffe). Obvious villains like Meg Murdockson and George Staunton are executed or die in battle. Misled unfortunates like Staunton's heir and Madge Wildfire die in misadventure. Even Effie Deans, guilty of nothing more than sex before marriage, cannot escape the misery of her sins and ends up in a convent. Meanwhile the religious zealots are elevated and live long and rewarding? lives. It's enough to make one want to vomit. Considering Scott came from a legal background and was a deputy sheriff I fail to see why he should exhibit such a narrow minded fundamentalist Christianity. Alas for this book.OK, enough knocking, is there anything good about this famous novel? Well yes of course, fortunately there is.Firstly, although dry and boring, it is very well written. Scott was an intelligent, educated man, and although his view of the world is narrow, it is, at least historically accurate and detailed.Secondly, for those of us who love Scotland it is wonderful to hear the Scottish dialect, that permeates almost every page. For example the worthy Duncan:\\"Fat ta deil, Mr Archibald,\\" answered the Captain of Knockdunder, \\"wad ye hae them ring the bell before I am ready to gang to kirk? I wad gar the bedral eat the bell-rope, if he took ony sic freedom. But if ye want to hear the bell, I will just show mysell on the knowe-head, and it will begin jowing forthwith.\\"Or the loyal Jeanie:\\"But when the hour of trouble comes to the mind or to the body - and seldom may it visit your Leddyship - and when the hour of death comes, that comes to high and low - lang and late may it be yours - O, my Leddy, then it isna what we hae dune for oursells, but what we hae dune for others, that we think on maist pleasantly. And the thoughts that ye hae intervened to spare the puir thing's life will be sweeter in that hour, come when it may, than if a word of your mouth could hang the haill Porteous mob at the tail of ae tow.\\"Thirdly, although Scott has done his best to obscure them, the events themselves are quite interesting. In better hands this book could have been a ripping yarn.And that's it folks.To conclude: I am giving this book 4 stars because it is a classic that has stood the test of time. Scott pioneered the historical novel. His work must be taken in context with its time, it cannot be judged as though it were written last year. Had it been written last year, it would not have been published and I would not be bothering to write this review.This book is indispensable if one is interested in Scottish literature. It would be a fascinating read if one were interested in old Presbyterian dogma or 18th century Scottish law. If you want a ripping historical page-turner I suggest you look elsewhere.The flaws exhibited in this novel are very serious, including the fatal crime of boring the reader, but the erudite may find them counterbalanced by Scott's learned prose and punctilious historical detail. In the end however it is the weight of history and this book's place in it that makes this book worthwhile."},{"Title":"The Heart of Midlothian","review":"The fact that this monster of a novel was a bestseller at its time (1818) possibly tells us that 'progress' has reduced the time that we are willing to spend on reading. So for me. I was looking for the usual half dozen pocket books to take on a trip of a few days. This one was the last Scott that was still in my shelf. For lack of space I relegate books that I have read and that are not top favorites to either box storage in the garage or to 2nd hand book sales at school charities. This one I had not read yet. I will probably never have the stamina for it, unless I am marooned on the proverbial island and it happens to be in my hand luggage.I did read the introductions and browsed through some chapters. Maybe another time. Possibly never, though I do remember that Scott's mansion Abbotsford near Edinburgh is one of only four writer's houses turned museum that I visited. The other three are Goethe's birth house in Frankfurt, the Joyce museum in Dublin (of which I can't remember for certain right now whether he ever lived there), and Nabokov's childhood appartment in St.Petersburg.I think my Scott time is over, so if you wait for the next instalment of my Melville excursions, don't worry, I am not sidetracked. Redburn will be next, but I am travelling a lot these days, and I don't take hardcovers on trips.Why then do I post a review on the 'Heart'? I was impressed by the editor's story of his trouble with identifying the right text for this publication. The writer, Scott, was a highly literate man in a modern society of his time, who even owned the publishing house himself, indirectly. The book was an international bestseller despite its folksiness and the excessive use of 'dialect' English. Finding out 200 years later which text is 'authoritative' can be damned hard.You see what I am driving at. Text reconstruction is hard and often impossible. How then can a text that was transmitted orally for decades, if not centuries, before it was committed to paper, have an 'authoritative' version that has any plausible relation to its 'author'?The 'Heart' is in a box in the garage now, in case you wondered."},{"Title":"The Heart of Midlothian","review":"Aside from Ivanhoe (and I have my doubts about even that), Scott is woefully under-read today, probably because reading him is a challenge just as reading Shakespeare is a challenge. As with Shakespeare, the Waverley novels are filled with riches, and I have found that the effort of reading them is repaid many times over.The Edinburgh Edition of the Waverley Novels seems to have received little publicity, but I cannot praise too highly the herculean efforts of the editors. With the historical background, extensive notes, and glossary provided in each volume, Scott comes alive. The editors have outdone themselves with The Heart of Mid-Lothian, in particular. The sheer quantity of historical references, and the extensive use of Scots dialect, are enough to intimidate the bravest readers. I can imagine reading and enjoying this novel without notes and without a glossary, but the supplementary material enables the novel to be truly appreciated as one of the great works in literature. At its core it is a simple story of love and humanity. It moved me to tears, and really that is about the highest praise I can give.A note on the use of Scots dialect: In the early stages of reading this novel I wasn't entirely sure I would get through it, even with the glossary. I had previously read The Pirate and survived the Scots in that, so I doggedly persevered and soon found my comprehension growing and my reading becoming much faster. Scott could have written this entirely in standard English, but the use of Scots adds a realistic dimension that elevates it and--to use a visual analogy--turns it from 2D into 3D. I would suggest making a short definition list of the most commonly encountered Scots words (e.g, \\"muckle,\\" \\"ain,\\" \\"gar\\") and using it as a bookmark. Soon you will be speaking (or at least reading) Scots like a native!"},{"Title":"The Heart of Midlothian","review":"The Heart of Midlothian (Oxford World's Classics)In high school I read The Talisman and Ivanhoe and loved them both. This book is not that type of adventure story and is not always so accessible because of the dialect dialog. That, however, does not detract from the plot and characterizations. Scott does a marvelous job of bringing the major events of the novel to life. The picture of the riot is fantastic. What sets this novel apart for me is how the author is able do bring vividly and realistically to life so many aspects of society from the common folk to the nobility. To read this book in terms of women's rights and the strength that women display in times of trial makes this novel a valuable part of the history of women's place in society."},{"Title":"The Heart of Midlothian","review":"A tough read but the book is particularily rewarding for the notes in the back.

Scott might have had an interesting idelogical point to make about religion, but the story he found to tell it through was not worth 580-odd pages. Jeanie Deans story is more like a poor attempt at Jane Austen, who will she marry, how does her marriage go. Scott's interest is clearly in the supporting players, Douce Davie Deans and Dumbiedikes, who are aligned with whatever religious movement Scott didn't like. Honestly, if you don't care much for religious differences, you'll be skipping as I was. Too much character description and not enough character in action; the story doesn't fit the concept, and tells a story in 580 words what probably deserved 220 or less, for economic reasons, to sell the full three volumes (according to the introduction).Scott is famous for being immensely popular: but unlike Dickens, I'm struggling to see why. I will give him another chance some day. I've got Waverley, Old Mortality and Ivanhoe sitting on my shelf - I haven't given up on him yet."},{"Title":"Gentle Rosie","review":"Wait till you see how cute rosie is!

While reading you tend to fit your own Aunts, kids, Uncles , parents,. etc. into the characters making the story a very personal one to the reader.Aside from all of that, there is constant mystery involved that would keep anyone turning the pages until completion of the book. I put it down for kitchen trips only. Bathroom trips were WITH the book in hand, as well as the bedroom and my Drs. office.I would have to compare the page turner style with a DAN BROWN,while the storyline would compare more to a \\" A great big fat Greek Wedding\\" or maybe a \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\" by Mitch Albom.It was touching, familiar, refreshing and a page turner all in one.Kudo's and Encore to the Author and the publishers who found her."},{"Title":"Maltese House With the Bright Yellow Door","review":"I thought I won't like this book, because i usually only read horror stories but I decided to broaden my reading scope and was really glad I did.

I was also annoyed by the large number of mistakes in the book, there are several name swappings which make it quite confusing.While i can only encourage Mrs Anderson to keep on writing, I would be a hypocrite in saying that i found this book an inspiring read.

Parker","review":"Well, I'm a fan, and I saw this movie script as a hardback languishing in a second-hand book bin. It's got several of his calling cards: troubled gorgeous female love interest; laconic detective (although this time a cop); a bad guy who isn't all bad. You can see it's written for film: the climax, for example, revolves around a suspenseful air/sea chase that - being that this is merely a script - is entirely left to our imagination.I think it could have made an OK film, perhaps a good one with the right cast and director. As a read understandably it's in a different league to his dedicated novels. Where he really soars in a novel though is in his descriptions - the way he sets a mood, or describes a character or scene, but for a film this is largely up to the skills of the crew. As a fan I suppose I was disappointed - not because the script was bad, but because that vehicle largely suppresses the distinctive aspects of what I enjoy in reading Chandler.By the way, one thing that did stand out as a cultural change was the way that pashing a girl without her consent was seen as romantic (as opposed to sexual harassment). Also amusing that some minor characters are denigrated because they only give attention to the heroine because she's a babe, yet the hero's affection is supposed to be authentic and deep the moment he spies her across a crowded room. Movie conventions - there's so little time, what can you do?"},{"Title":"The African Queen","review":"I love C.S. Forester's Hornblower series.

Charlie Allnutt, an English boatman, picks up Rose Sayer as her missionary village is taken over and scattered by their German occupiers. Charlie and Rose take his boat, \\"The African Queen\\" down the Ulanga River to get as far away from the Germans as possible. On their journey, Rose hatches a plan to use homemade torpedos to charge the African Queen into a German boat patrolling a far off lake, thus striking a blow for England. Can she convince Allnutt to sacrifice his only possession he cares about? On this river journey, besides the infighting between them about their \\"quest\\", they encounter river rapids, a German outpost, boat crushing rocks, swamps, and much more.I have not seen the movie, so I cannot compare the book to the movie as others have. I did enjoy the novel, and the personalities of the two main characters. The transformation of the selfish, fearful Allnutt is the most dramatic. C.S. Forester definitely brings to life the vivid setting of the African jungle, as the progress from the river to the lake. Now, I need to find the movie to compare."},{"Title":"The African Queen","review":"Although personally I do not believe the writers best work (Hornblower is just incredible), it is still a fantastic read. One of the best writers I believe in anything associated with maritime and naval stories.This story has only a few elements to work with but creates a great light read. The story is so good there is no need for any major complex twists, turns or tricks making it very digestible. A welcome read if you have just spent the last few books in heavy intense thrillers or of the like.The writer obviously knew what they were talking about as some of the details are not only incredibly interesting, but also incredible at creating suspense. The details do not bore you at all and treats you like you are intelligent enough to understand what is being said, which is a massive relief from the spoon feeding of other writers.The book is a well written breath of fresh air. Like tea on the porch in the fall. lol."},{"Title":"The African Queen","review":"Seen the movie, now read the book. This is an adventure tale about Charlie Allnutt and Rose Sayer set in WWI and was written by C.S.Forester in 1935. The book has been over shadowed by the 1951 film which starred Humphrey Bogart and Katherine Hepburn. The book stands on its own as a classic and centres on the relationship between the unlikely match of Charlie and Rose with the war as a backdrop. Charlie is a gin loving engineer and Rose is a religious missionary who manages to convince Charlie to take his rickety old boat, The African Queen, down a treacherous river to destroy a German gunboat patrolling the lake at the end of the river. The inter play between the two characters is developed beautifully as they influence each other to form a formidable team. Forester may have meant it to be many things, but to me it is a great love story. Two people who shine in the presence of each other. The novel is relatively short and keeps the suspense and sense of adventure high throughout. The ending of the book turns out to be more realistic and poignant than the film and just by reading it you will appreciate the brilliance of Bogart and Hepburn even more."},{"Title":"The African Queen","review":"I really loved the movie, but just want to warn you that the last part of the book is wildly different than the movie, and pretty much of a bummer....... Neither of the characters come off as being very likable. I was very disappointed and wished I hadn't read it. I am a big fan of C. S. Forester's Hornblower series, but it's obvious that he has a very cynical view of women and married life, and it comes through much more strongly in The African Queen."},{"Title":"The African Queen","review":"Rose Sayer, bent on avenging the death of her English missionary brother, enlists, or drafts, the cockney Charlie Allnut, captain of the steam launch Afican Queen, down a mighty river in 'German Central Africa', to enter \\"Lake Wittelsbach\\" and there, with makeshift torpedoes, sink the Konigin Luise, the German Navy steamer that then controls the lake for the Germans in 1914.Thanks to John Huston, Humphrey Bogart and Katherine Hepburn, everyone is familiar with the titular film, which is virtually the only cinematic representation of the East African Campaign of 1914-18. Stretching himself, CS Forester rises above his usual stock characterization in filling out the figures of Allnut and Rose, the latter being somewhat (and thankfully) more attractive than Katherine Hepburn. He really excels at describing, in an engaging way, the exhausting journey down the 'Ulanga/Bora' river, with all its attendant perils - heat, crocodiles, mosquitoes, hippos, leaches, etc. This is 'Heart of Darkness' but written in such a way that you can and want to finish the book.Once the African Queen reaches the Lake, there to confront the German gunboat, history intrudes. It is also at this point that the film, wisely, diverges. Without naming the actual participants, Forester introduces the fascinating story of the real-life Royal Navy expedition that, through incredible exertion, crossed Africa with 2 motor gun boats and fought the Germans for naval supremacy on Lake Tangayika in 1915. CS Forester's conclusion to this story, after effectively building tension and also spinning quite a nice little romance between his two heroes, is distinctly anti-climatic. Forester also includes several minor historical inaccuracies, such as the Germans arming their native troops with Martini rifles, and that these same native troops were rather dimwitted and rather cowardly. Given that the Germans, only a few hundred strong, fought a successful guerrilla campaign in WWI East Africa with only about 7,000 native troops, puts the lie to Forester's account, even if fiction.Michael Kitchen does a fine job in narrating this tale."},{"Title":"The African Queen","review":"The first C. S. Forester novels I ever read were the eleven volumes comprising the Hornblower series of nautical adventures in the British navy. Years before encountering those, which, by the way, are superb reading and far better written than the Aubrey/Maturin maritime novels of Patrick O'Brian, perhaps their closest competitors in readers' affections, I saw a movie entitled \\"The African Queen.\\" I was far too young then to know or care about the inspiration behind that 1951 film and was not even acquainted with the novels of C. S. Forester. That film must have made quite an impression, though, for, decades later, I can still hear the throbbing of the steam engine driving the Queen down the Ulanga and Bora River, so, when I chanced to encounter Forester's novel, there was nothing else to do but dive into it.The story line in THE AFRICAN QUEEN rushes along even faster than do the plots of the Hornblower novels. The story, set in Africa at the beginning of World War I, is replete with deathly disease, conquering Nazis, and never-ending derring-do amidst cataracts and rapids plunging down boulder-strewn canyons toward huge Lake Wittelsbach, whose waters are patrolled by the Konigin Luise mounting the Nazi iron cross flag. Oh yes, we mustn't ignore the love element that evolves between the spinsterish, virginal Rose Sayer, steeped in her brother's missionary zeal and stern religiosity, and her companion, Charlie Allnutt, a cockney with a highly questionable past. Primarily, however, this begins and remains an adventure story, and there's just enough love element to spice things up a bit.The novel is not without its flaws. There are undoubtedly critics who take it to task for the ease with which Rose loses her austere countenance (not to mention her virginity), given her strict, traditional upbringing and her circumscribed life. Her assuming almost instant command of the steamboat, her fanatical self-imposed mission, and her sheer strength of mind and unwavering determination appear too atypical for someone of her background. For our other protagonist, Allnutt, his ability to repair or cobble together everything the couple come to need as they careen down the racing Alanga or laboriously pull their boat across the stagnant delta of the Bora is nothing short of phenomenal. The reader's credulousness is sorely tested when Forester has Allnutt create a workable forge on the banks of the river and repair a kinked drive shaft and a broken propeller in the middle of the jungle.Still, this is adventure fiction, and the reader must not be overly critical of characters who find themselves in dire straits with only their imagination and ingenuity (or at least with the imagination of the author who created them) to succor themselves. I dare say that THE AFRICAN QUEEN, written in 1935, has yet to be bested by any more recent adventure stories--equaled perhaps, but not bested. The book is a very fast read and is not easy to lay aside, and I feel that any reader, from adolescent to antiquarian, who enjoys the vicarious mystery, challenge and excitement of a fine adventure story will not find THE AFRICAN QUEEN lacking.And just who is the real African Queen, the steamboat or Rose Sayer?"},{"Title":"The African Queen","review":"A Great read.

Cockney boat owner Charley Allnut lets her ride along with him on his creaky old boat and Rose gets the brilliant idea to use the explosives on the boat to torpedo the K&ouml;nigin Luise and convinces Allnut to go along with it. Why he goes along with this is any one's best guess (I was sure scratching my head over it). But to get to that point, they must travel the river, avoiding the Germans and their guns, shoot rapids that no one has ever shot before to reach the lake where they will find their target.Shooting dangerous rapids in a creaky boat, being fired upon by evil German soldiers and risking all to strike a blow for freedom and Britain. Wow, that should be even better as a book, right? Not. Boring, boring, boring.I just never bought into the relationship that develops between Rose and Charlie, nor could I fathom why he'd merrily follow along on her cockamamie plan to blow up the Germans. How a sheltered on-the-shelf missionary managed to learn how to hold the tiller and guide them through rapids like no one has done before them really stretched the credulity meter, but even worse is how it all ends once they reach the lake and the K&ouml;nigin Luise. I won't spoil, but if you're expecting a big bang like in the movie, think again - it's a snoozer, albeit a mercifully short one. This was so dull it almost put me to sleep on the treadmill, and I only finished as it was I needed an Africa book for a reading challenge. Not recommended."},{"Title":"The African Queen","review":"The lady has the will, and the cockney has the ingenuity.

Weak. Good, but weak. The movie may have won an academy award but the book comes up short. More of a novella, or screenplay than a book. The author could have doubled the text and it may well have been a good book. I appreciate the drama of the two people pulled from separate worlds that are changed dramatically by unfolding events and raise themselves to previously unimagined feats of character and bravery. Still, it was a wasted effort, two little to hang it all on and a pointless ending."},{"Title":"The African Queen","review":"Forester's novel appears to be a fairly straightforward adventure tale, set in German Central Africa during WWI. Rose is the sister of an English missionary, who dies at the beginning of the novel after the Germans have driven off his &quot;flock.&quot; She is picked up by Allnutt, a Cockney mechanic who works for a Belgian mine, running supplies up the river in the flat-bottomed &quot;African Queen.&quot; He's basically a coward who will follow the path of least resistance, and so allows himself to be browbeat into a harebrained scheme by Rose. She intends to pilot the boat down river, through rapids that are generally agreed-upon to be unnavigable by a boat like the &quot;African Queen,&quot; and onto a lake the Germans dominate thanks to a giant gunboat. There, they will rig some explosives Allnutt has on board and ram the ship, blowing it--and themselves--up, thus striking &quot;a blow for England&quot; and avenging Rose's brother's death. Depending on how you read it, this is either the stuff of great derring-do, or a critique on the futility of heroism in WWI. As an adventure tale, the characters are rather too flat. Allnutt is drawn as too pliable a character, especially for one who has somehow ended up running a boat in the middle of Africa. Rose somehow becomes an expert pilot in a matter of a week, managing to master the nuances of a creaky and unwieldy vessel in extreme poor conditions. Along the way she sheds her proper upbringing and godfearedness with rather unlikely alacrity (unless, that is, Forester was trying to say that such beliefs are rather ephemeral anyway). Their love affair more or less works in the context of the adventure they're on, but it's very hard to imagine it continuing in the outside world. The ending is somewhat more interesting, foreshadowing some of the bleakness of Pierre Boulle's novel Bridge on the River Kwai."},{"Title":"The African Queen","review":"I was shocked to learn how bad this book really is. The title is so beloved by many as the Bogart/Hepburn classic, and one would expect the book to not only match the Hollywood translation but to dwarf it with typical literary superiority. Not so. The basic plot itself is brilliant enough in its simplicity: two unlikely characters (the archetypical Cockney grease monkey and the chaste maiden) have an adventurous float down an untamed river on a cocked-up mission to sink a German gunship. Ok so far. What Forester does with this promising seed is ridiculous and leaves the reader wondering whether this was all just a vehicle for Forester to deliver a little saucy \\"maiden-missionary-loses-her-virginity\\" stuff mixed in with his clearly evident views that missionaries are idiots. Forester's story is outrageous on all levels. From the timely and chance first meeting between Rose and Allnut, to the mere minutes that it took for Rose to hatch her ignorant plot to sink a German warship, to Allnut's agreement to participate, to the absurd success of the journey, to the ridiculous \\"Cockney ingenuity\\" with which Allnut fashions a propeller out of a coconut or some such stunt, Forester lays a number of eggs. The creme de la creme is Rose's glorious fall from grace. This whole angle of the book borders on soft porn, at least by 1930's standards. Are we to believe that this apparently devout missionary woman has maintained her purity for all these years just to give it all to this unbathed louse? Forester clearly delighted in this stuff: at one point, he actually describes Rose's 'chests' as literally levitating with her newfound vigor and energy - having replaced her former existence of Christian bondage with a new life of unbridled jungle boogie. Come on. Last criticism, with a SPOILER ALERT: the movie's ending is much better than the novel's. Whereas the movie made the boat (the very namesake of the book) into one of the main characters that ultimately sunk the German gunboat, Forester sinks the Afican Queen early and unceremoniously, and then takes the reader through an irrelevant account of Belgian naval manuevers and German military justice. Anyway, I've written enough: stick to the movie."},{"Title":"The African Queen","review":"C S Forester knew his business. He knew a plausible method of turning an old river steamer into a torpedo, he knew the hellish consequences of losing a prop blade, of mooring in a mangrove swamp, of finding still water in a rapid.. And as he has proven so many times in the Hornblower novels, he knows the way of knaves and gentleman... This is a book for any age."},{"Title":"The African Queen","review":"There is really not much to say except that the Hollywood movie is not really very much like the book. (Why does this not suprise me?) The story and the characters are much more human, possibly because they are not &quot;Katharine H. and Boogie&quot; and this is not Hollywood. The thundering falls, the hunger,the heat, the gloomy swamps, the smother lake of water lillies, the endless toil and hours...and then, in the end, to see their mission fail. As heart breaking and riviting as any book ever writen."},{"Title":"The African Queen","review":"Some authors have the gift of putting words together in a way that entertains and enthralls the reader. C. S. Forester is one of the best. When Forester tells a story, the reader feels personally involved. We feel like we know the characters in a personal, intense way. If you have read Forester's Hornblower novels, you have read Forester at his best. The African Queen was made into a memorable movie starring Katherine Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart. The book is more intense, darker, and far less triumphant than the movie. If you thrill to the successes of Horatio Hornblower in Forester's navel novels, you might find African Queen a little depressing at times. If you like depressing novels (and apparently many readers do) you might give this book five stars. The story is set during World War I and involves the attempt by a missionary lady and an alcoholic English boatman to travel down a river in Africa to do battle with the Germans. The interaction between the characters and the river creates a riveting story. Like Hemingway, &quot;I recommend Forester...&quot;"},{"Title":"The African Queen","review":"I will not reveal the ending; I will say only that it does not end with the German captain of the Louisa marrying the protagonists just as the ship impales itself on the overturned African Queen's torpedoes. C. S. Forester's ending requires less suspension of disbelief, less \\"deus ex machina.\\" Throughout the voyage of refugees Rose Sayer and Mr. Allnutt down the Ulanga and Bora Rivers in German Central Africa at the outbreak of war, the reader is treated to C. S. Forester's literal, high resolution realism. Forester would not have felt the need to depart from that realism to enhance the final drama. Forester reveals the characters of protagonists Rosie and Allnutt as successive adversities beset them on their voyage. Their steam launch, The African Queen, is their vessel in both senses of the word: if course it is their boat, but it also represents a container in which the protagonists' spirits are blended in a purposeful collaboration. it is a touching human drama, and the realism is such that the reader's ears ring unceasingly with the high-pitched whine of mosquitoes."},{"Title":"The African Queen","review":"Throughout most of the book, I found myself thinking, \\"This is one case where I like the movie better.\\" Although the plot for the first 3/4 of the book is the same as the movie's, the characterization is a bit different. For example, the movie portrays Rose as a determind, principled, yet prim woman who slowly learns to love; in the book, she comes across as a bit immature, supposedly the result of being repressed by men her entire life, and is so thrilled with the freedom earned by her brother's recent death that she decides to kamikaze a German boat. Personally, I found the movie's Rose more realistic and likeable; the book's Rose felt too much like a poster child of feminist propoganda.In general, most of the novel is a bit heavy-handed is describing the character's motives, characters, and thought processes, and leaves very little to the imagination. Subtlety, apparently, is not Forester's strong point.The only thing keeping me from giving this book a lower rating is the ending. Forester truly redeems himself in my eyes with the ending, which is far darker and more realistic than the movie's. The ending calls into question everythng that you assumed that Forester was trying to tell you -- all the notions of heroism, patriotism, and true love. The last line is probably one of my favorite of all last lines,(Spoiler space)forcing you to ask yourself: Are Charlie and Rose truly soulmates, or has an extreme situation simply brought them together and instigated passion? While in the movie it is clear that Charlie and Rose truly love another, the book suggests that their \\"love\\" may simply be due to the arousal that arises during a near-death situation. For me, this very human, bittersweet ending enabled me to forgive Forester for his earlier heavy-handed treatment of the characters."},{"Title":"The African Queen","review":"When her village in German Central Africa is destroyed at the start of WWI, a missionary is rescued by a gin-loving river miner. Their perilous escape on the beat up launch, the African Queen,turns into an outright battle against nature, the Germans, and each other as the tempestuous pair realize they have fallen in love. With this love they conquer the impossible, and by a miracle they survive to see the destruction of their enemy"},{"Title":"The African Queen","review":"I find it impossible to discuss this book without referring to the 1951 movie. The first 80 percent of the movie and the book are mostly similar. The endings are quite different. I slightly prefer the movie's improbable ending, although the endings of both have serious flaws.Reading the first 80 percent of the book is a joy after having seen the movie. If you are like me, you will see and hear the movie in your mind as you read the book.In the first 80 percent of the book, you will find more in the book than in the movie. C.S. Forester is able to tackle interesting themes in the book that were too delicate for Hollywood. Also, he employs an amazing mastery of the technical details in describing the African Queen's voyage down the Ulanga and Bora rivers into Lake Victoria. You will almost feel like you are reading science fiction from the time of H.G. Wells, as Allnut and Rose keep making something out of nothing.To me, the best part of the book is that the contrasts between the &quot;civilized&quot; conventions and the &quot;natural&quot; instincts are drawn in extreme and fine detail. It will make you re-examine how you think about what is the right thing to do in your own life, which is what good literature should do.To me, the weakness of the book is that the attitudes that The African Queen challenges are very far removed from our experience today. What was very scathing then now seems quaint. Somehow, the outrage behind the story is diffused into a dreamy period piece. Are there many women now of 33 who are so completely dominated by their brothers that they do not lead their own lives? Would many people today be inflamed by love of country to want to strike a personally fatal blow against the oppressor against all odds? Does the arrogance of colonialism seem believable, or just a silly notion to caricature?Ultimately, Rose's instant rise from docile creature to Wonder Woman does seem to strain credibility. It's inspiring fun, though, like any book about brave heroines who are undaunted by the odds and convention.After you read this book, think about where your assumptions about what you should be doing have not been re-examined by you in a while. What are you doing because someone else tells you it is a good idea? What should you be doing because you think it is a good idea?Take the initiative to do the right thing with full speed ahead!"},{"Title":"The African Queen","review":"&quot;The African Queen&quot; is a very decent classic which I enjoyed very much. Rose Sayer and Charlie Allnut are very developed, hilarious characters who give you an understanding of classes, religion, technology and love. The boat-handling information is very thorough. This classic is for almost any reader; I was very satasfied."},{"Title":"The African Queen","review":"I stumbled into \\"African Queen\\" from \\"Shantaram\\", the self indulgent mess of a book that purports to be an adventure based on the real life exploits of its author. I felt like Charlie and Rose, having escaped the lilies or the mangroves... Here is an author who knows when description is called for and when action must take the lead; when relationships must be built, and when the setting needs a nod. And Forrester does it so well. What a delight.\\"The African Queen\\" is a road trip, where a cockney steam engineer and a British missionary's sister take a boat down a fictitious river, over countless literary waterfalls and onto a make believe lake with a gunboat that never existed; along the way, necessity insists that they discover themselves, and each other, and, being that it was written in 1935, there's not a lot of hullabaloo about it, they just look up, rather Monty Python-like and go \\"Oh, okay\\" and get on with it. And there you are, reading it all, and lapping it up. Unlike the movie, there is nudity, and sex. Unlike \\"Shantaram\\" both are very nearly erotic. Although I couldn't get Bogart and Hepburn out of my mind so I was somewhat impaired...Sadly, by the last two chapters, the author has developed cold feet. It seems he feels wicked for leading us on this ridiculous tale and he attempts to make up for it by creating new characters and events that will make everything right, at least very realistic, albeit off the mark of the original plot. Forrester is so convinced that his story won't hold up, he wrote a new forward to the 1940 edition (which I read) saying how the editors removed the last two chapters, for the first printing, and celebrating how he put them back.Forrester was SO wrong.Fortunately, there is the movie. Where Forrester got cold feet, John Huston knew a story when he heard one, and the movie fixes the ending, although the book's version is still very nice.\\"African Queen\\" is a very good story, very well written. For an English author of the period, it's also very concise and efficient, yet still melodic in its use of the English language. I enjoyed reading the book as the written word as much as I enjoyed the story."},{"Title":"The African Queen","review":"Being a fan of Forester I thought I had read the African Queen a long time ago, turns out I had not. I did see the movie a couple of times so I could compare the book and film. Unlike many of todays movies it followed the book very closely until you get to the end. I like Forestor's version much better than the movie. I really enjoyed the book as I have everything else I have read of Forester."},{"Title":"Roumeli: Travels in Northern Greece (Isis (Hardcover Large Print))","review":"I first encountered Fermor in his riveting accounts of his walk across Europe as World War II began descending. I was fascinated by his encyclopedic and poetic narrative. He made you feel you were walking alongside him. Now, his travels take us to Roumeli, the old name for northern Greece and Macedonia. Again, Fermor takes us on a poetic and detailed odyssey through villages and rugged Greek countryside, meeting interesting people and telling their tales. He has an uncanny ear (and eye) for the temperament and culture of the Greeks and one can sense his affection for the people he helped defend while a British commando on Crete during WWII. This is a travelogue of the old sort: careful attention to detail, wanderings off the well-trod tourist paths, and vivid description of the sounds, smells and history of this fabled land."},{"Title":"Roumeli: Travels in Northern Greece (Isis (Hardcover Large Print))","review":"I only discovered Fermor a year ago, and began with Roumeli, which I think is his masterpiece. The book title is somewhat misleading, since the book forays into Crete (the fabulous center section, I wish he had expanded into a book of its own), and ranges all across the Greek world through history as well as geography, although Northern Greece, and some of her strangest corners, are well served. The prose is gorgeous, in a sort of Edwardian fashion, and very erudite. Fermor is obviously a polymath, and his understanding of Greece (and apparently the Greek language) extraordinary. This is a book I treasure: I've bought multiple copies to share with relatives and friends. If you are the least bit interested in modern Greece, and smart enough to do a crossword puzzle, I suspect this could become one of your favorite books as well. Just buy the damn thing!"},{"Title":"Roumeli: Travels in Northern Greece (Isis (Hardcover Large Print))","review":"All of Patrick Leigh Fermor's books are of an unusual beauty, but this is without doubt the most beautiful of all. But the author is not for just anyone. I have a friend who bought Roumeli and got only ten pages into it before deciding she didn't like it. But there are reasons for that. She has a journalism background and she lives in New York. Appreciating Leigh Fermor involves taking the time to savor elevated language and imagery emanating from several sometimes unfamiliar realms of meaning. Sorry, folks, but the dumbing down process stops here.In the first chapter we have a description of the author's travels in Trace and in particular the area around Alexandroupolis, which, interestingly, is named for the Russian Czar Alexander II and not for Alexander the Great. The focus here is the people he calls The Black Departers, or the Sarakatsans, a mysterious and little-studies nomadic group who some say are descendants of the original Greeks who came into the peninsula.Then there is a delightful chapter centered on the monasteries of Meteora and the holy but realistic Father Christopher, the abbot of St. Barlaam, who has a few tales to tell about the foreign occupiers and their mindless cruelty and how the monks outsmarted them on a few occasions.Chapter three deals with the famous difference between Hellenes and Greeks (or Romios) that has been used as an analytic model by many serious writers who take an interest in modern Greece, including Robert D. Kaplan in his Balkan Ghosts. This is the division or polarity existing within every Greek you meet on the streets and it shows the distinct pulls of the Eastern and Western orientations that still abide in the Greek collective consciousness and which give, sometimes, the impression of a split personality. Mention is made of George Soteriades the archeologist who insisted that Romios should be used only in the pejorative sense of a mean, vulgar, and sordid man. But the word has also had its very distinguished defenders.Also worth noting is the fact that this book contains the very elegant and entertaining essay called Sounds of the Greek World, of which I cannot resist giving a few examples here:Chios is a cakewalk on a cottage piano. ....Hermoupolis is the filioque. .....The Plaka is a drunken polyphony at four in the morning in praise of retsina and the tune of a music- box perched on a photograph album of faded plum velvet with filigree clasps at five in the afternoon.Yes, this book is beautiful. Take the time to read and enjoy it."},{"Title":"Roumeli: Travels in Northern Greece (Isis (Hardcover Large Print))","review":"Everything in this book is good, but my favorite part is the last chapter, a brilliant prose poem in which the author knits together dozens of Greek place-names and makes them sound like music, resonating with all sorts of subtle historical and literary associations. This book is essential reading for anyone interested in Greece."},{"Title":"Roumeli: Travels in Northern Greece (Isis (Hardcover Large Print))","review":"I'd previously read A TIME OF GIFTS and BETWEEN THE WOODS AND THE WATER and I'll admit , I found them the more interesting books.Partly that's because I'm more interested in Eastern and Central Europe than Greece.But they also strike me as tighter, more controlled books.Parts of ROUMELI are fascinating.Yet , the fascinating parts do tend to alternate with extended ,dullish ,passages.Fermor had a great eye and does a brilliant job of evoking a rural Greece that must have been disappearing even as he was observing it, in , I think the 1950's.Of particular interest are his descriptions of the Sarakastans, a group who if they still exist in any sense ,must be utterly transformed , and the Vlachs.Also I found the apparent persistence of the cult of Lord Byron in Greece surprising, funny and endearing.I suspect the modern Greece that emerged is a much duller place. Yet, nostalgia seems inappropriate.You need only read Fermor's descriptions of Sarakastan life to realize two things : 1) Sarakastan life was beautiful and romantic 2) it must also have been --awful."},{"Title":"Roumeli: Travels in Northern Greece (Isis (Hardcover Large Print))","review":"Patrick Leigh Fermor's Roumeli gives us a glimpse at many ancient customs of Greece that were still practiced at the time of writing.

While many of the authors have excellent scholarly credentials (I'm one of the few that don't) as should be clear from the title, the purpose of this book is to present the subject from a particular perspective, namely the perspective of Jews.As with many investigative endeavors, your preconceived notions can frequently influence your conclusions. While I like to think that my perspective is fairly objective, I am sure that who I am as a person has influenced my conclusions about Jesus. When it comes to rather fuzzy topics such as the historical Jesus, you can be sure that we generally find the Jesus that suits our needs or perspectives.So, don't buy this book thinking you are going to find definitive answers to the question, &quot;Who was Jesus?&quot; However, if you are like me and like hearing different perspectives on a subject then I think you will find the book interesting. Yes, some authors repeat the same theories that have been around for some time. Yes, all authors are subject to their own biases. But who isn't? I still enjoyed reading the many essays of my co-authors just as I enjoyed reading works by those with radically different perspectives than my own."},{"Title":"Jesus Through Jewish Eyes: Rabbis and Scholars Engage an Ancient Brother in a New Conversation","review":"I was fascinated by this well written collection of essays about Jesus. Some of the rabbis who wrote these articles are courageously concessionary in the things that they write about Jesus.Another writer sees Jesus as not greater than Moses and the Prophets, but as being a failed messiah, one who desired to bring in the messianic age, but couldn't. This same writer also suggests that Jesus may be considered as a figure who helped to prepare the way for the world to worship the one true God, and who helped to pave the way for the coming of the Davidic Messiah.Others see him as a Jewish sage who needs to be reclaimed and restudied by Jews in order to understand the Christian mindset, and yes, to a certain degree, their own Judaism.One writer even suggests that the issue of Jesus' messiahship remains unresolved.There is also a great essay by Lance Flitter, where he shares that he never thought much about Jesus until he started dating a Christian woman. He comes to the conclusion that whatever else one may say about the historical Jesus, one thing that comes through clearly is that Jesus was Jewish and that one of His priorities was teaching equality amongst God's people.Some of the writers are adament that Jesus is not the Messiah, but for the most part, I was very impressed with the openness in these essays. Get this book."},{"Title":"Jesus Through Jewish Eyes: Rabbis and Scholars Engage an Ancient Brother in a New Conversation","review":"I came across this book in searching for reading material for a discussion group \\"Jesus from a Jewish Perspective\\" that I plan to lead within a Jewish congregation this Fall. What a find! This is the perfect book for my use, but almost anyone, Jewish, Christian, or otherwise, would benefit from reading it, provided they do so with an open mind, willing to at least temporarily put aside their preconceptions of Jesus.The fact that the different contributors often have conflicting views of Jesus is a real plus since, as a number of them point out, it is impossible to clearly see Jesus through the haze of 2,000 years, particularly given the lack of written accounts during his life and the agendas that most writers brought to the task once it was undertaken. The contributors' different viewpoints help one to synthesize a more complete picture and, in my case, added some interesting new possibilities that I hadn't considered before.One of the things that struck me about this book, and which I feel is sorely needed in the world, is the obvious respect that two, often opposed groups demonstrate for each other. The Preface makes it clear that Maryknoll (the publisher) highly values the views of these Jewish scholars and they, in turn, show tremendous respect for Christian beliefs.Viewed from the perspective of my youth of fifty years ago this book is a miracle. In that pre-Vatican II environment, I and many of my friends were routinely beaten up as Christ killers. We returned the compliment by holding a highly derisive view of Christianity and Jesus. The idea that Catholics and Jews could show this level of respect, even admiration, for each other's religions was unthinkable. Thank you Maryknoll, Beatrice Bruteau (the editor), and all the contributors. While the lion has not yet lain down with the lamb, I feel I have witnessed the beating of some swords of my youth into the ploughshares of today. May tomorrow's harvest be bountiful."},{"Title":"Jesus Through Jewish Eyes: Rabbis and Scholars Engage an Ancient Brother in a New Conversation","review":"This book was a reading assignment for a joint class taught by a Professor from my Protestant Divinity School and a Rabbi from a nearby Rabbinic School. I must say, I thoroughly enjoyed it.It is not a particularly long book, and was a fairly quick read for me. It consists of a collection of essays from Jewish scholars and secular writers. Each essay focuses on how the writer sees and experiences the historical Jesus, whom Christians revere as the Christ, the Son of God.This book was eye-opening for me. I felt I had a good grasp of the basics of the Jewish faith, history and society, and there is nothing in this book that contradicts what I thought I knew. What is new is how this book illuminates and deepens my own faith. Yet, I learned a great deal about my own faith - not only by seeing how Jews view it, but also by how many of the essayists in this volume use techniques and tools that are more or less unknown to the average Christian in their evaluations of what Jesus means to them.The book does alot to help us see how Jewish Jesus really is. It gave me a new perspective on his teachings, which we see through the authors' eyes: as stories squarely within the realm of what we now know as the rabinnic tradition. A tradition where multiple layers of meaning are excavated from the original text in ways that are both surprising and enriching.Many of the essays also help us understand how painful being Jewish was to many of the authors, and helps us better appreciate how \\"obvious\\" assumptions we make as Christians,a nd which we believe to be relatively benign and unthreaening, may not be seen by others in the same light.An excellent book, and one I strongly recommend for any Christian seeking to gain a better understanding of Modern Judaism, and the challenges that Jews face, and have faces for millenia, in struggling to maintain their existence and traditions as a small cultural and religious minority living within cultures that are at best insensitive (if not outright antagonistic) to their presence.Despite it's wonderful insights, and although most of the essays are excellent, there are one or two that just don't make the grade. Not that I feel any antagonism towards those particlar authors, but raher that they did not seem to fully appreciate the purpose of the book, and/or perhaps did not have the depth of thought or knowledge to write an essay as illuminating or thought-provoking as those of their peers. Even so, these are minor blemishes. I'll rate the book at 4 stars: well worth taking the time to read despite some minor disappointments in the quality and depth of a couple of the essays."},{"Title":"Jesus Through Jewish Eyes: Rabbis and Scholars Engage an Ancient Brother in a New Conversation","review":"Editor Beatrice Bruteau is a Catholic, with an abiding interest in Vedanta, Teilhard de Chardin, and \\"spiritual evolution.\\"This collection contains 19 fairly brief essays (plus an introductory poem, \\"A Jew Writing about Jesus the Jew\\") from a variety of Jewish thinkers (fourteen of them rabbis); perhaps the biggest \\"names\\" are Michael Lerner (editor of TIKKUN) and Lewis D.

Cook's historical essay, \\"Evolving Jewish Views of Jesus\\" is an excellent overview.Here are a few representative excerpts from the book:\\"Jesus arrogated to himself the authority to teach outside the framework of Pharisaic authority. The dispute over the observance of the Sabbath is an example.\\"\\"It is very difficult to find clear instances of Jesus actually transgressing the Torah. His disciples, not Jesus himself, are accused of disergarding the ritual washing of the hands. This was not a biblical requirement for the laity.\\"Michael J. Lerner: \\"A healthy appropriation of the Jewish Jesus will avoid the kind of reverential tones that one sometimes hears from Jews who want to emphasize interreligious dialogue so much that they talk of Jesus as a prophet and healer in order to show Christians that now we can be nice to him.... When we can come to that point, Jesus will regain his rightful place as a respected and sometimes insightful teacher of the Jewish people.\\"This collection will be of great interest to those interested in Jewish perspectives on Jesus, the historical Jesus, and Jewish-Christian dialogue."},{"Title":"Chevrolet by the Numbers 1955-59: The Essential Cheverolet Parts Reference","review":"This book has turned out to be a great reference guide for me, most importantly with the extensive part number/cast number information covering all major powertrain components.

These are Esau and Jacob, who struggled with each other even in the womb of their mother. Genesis Chapter 25, verse 23, \\"And the Lord said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the younger.\\" Later, Esau, the hunter sells his birthright to Jacob, the farmer for a simple meal.I don't know if my tribal history of well over 3,000 years ago is an apt resource for creating allegories regarding 19th century Brazil, but Machado de Assis gave it a shot anyhow. The entire novel is a rather tedious allegory of Brazilian society at the time. In my opinion, it would have made an excellent short story while a 287 page novel is far too long. The two boys born in 1871 to a wealthy Rio de Janeiro family are alike as two peas in a pod, though their temperaments differ. Their mother, named Natividade ( in case you don't \\"get it\\"), represents Brazil, the loving figure who nurtures her twin sons, two contradictory spirits who represent conservative and liberal forces in society. These boys conflict throughout the novel, loving the same frail girl (the future ? the present ?) who never consumates marriage with either. Ah, poor Brazil ! What could the future hold ? The author avoids the question as to which brother is the elder and which the younger by making them identical twins. The novel's title alludes to the Bible story, but the narrative bears only some relation to it. Are petty political chicanery, romantic quarrels, suspicious behavior, and useless arguments based on personal pride or ambition, a mess of pottage ? In fairness, it is a clever idea, but I feel it was over-ambitious and ultimately only partially successful. If you take the novel as a simple story about late 19th century Brazil, it is without much life---a girl who can't choose between two jealous and quarreling brothers, some other plot features found in the author's other works. The style of the novel is the same in the two better known books \\"Epitaph of a Small Winner\\" and \\"Dom Casmurro\\", with many small chapters with titles that pilot the narrative. There is very little description and much lyrical philosophy, attempted irony and wit. These do not sparkle as in the above mentioned novels. ESAU AND JACOB is not up to the standard of the other two, and will attract only the most dedicated readers; perhaps those who are studying Latin American, Nineteenth Century, or Brazilian Literature. I cannot imagine any average reader undertaking this for pure pleasure in the 21st century, because both style and topic are too far from modern sensibilities. You also need to have a fairly comprehensive understanding of Brazilian society in the last quarter of the 19th century. My final word---J.M. Machado de Assis wrote many better works. Try them."},{"Title":"Contract Bridge for Beginners and Intermediate Players","review":"This is a great introduction to Bridge by one of the premier personalities in the field.

So how should he be viewed? I submit that there are 4 ways to do so and all of them are mutually important. They are 1) Economic, 2) Intellectual, 3) Political and 4) Moral.Marx based his economic views on the premise that all value of a good produced comes from the labor that goes into it. Intuitively this seems wrong. What of the capital, management, demand (by the way Marx does not like the idea of supply and demand either) etc. Our experience shows that all of these and more play a role in determining what value a thing has. Iteratively the Marxist model of economy then suffers from its imperfect premise. His contention of lack of sustainable profits etc make sense if you agree with his premise but that is not how it shapes out in the modern World. All in all it seems that Marx misses the point about how economy works, and given his incredible intelligence, you wonder why.I think the reason is in the intellectual workings of his mind. Now it appears that most of human experience happens in shades of gray or on a spectrum. Very few things actually are definite \\"this or that\\". This is particularly true of psychology, sociology and also economics. Perhaps the very fact that so many variables come to bear on any given situation that it would be impossible to reproduce that situation again reliably. Hence much of these fields are understood along a spectrum and minor variation in observation is to be expected from event to event and from time to time. Unfortunately many people tend to think of the World as an absolute. For this, against that, regardless of the circumstances (abortion, death penalty, taxes etc come to mind). Marx takes the notion of value of labor from Adam Smith and particularly David Ricardo and fixates upon it as the only determinant of value of a good. Intellectually it boxes him in an inflexible position where he has to stick to his position. Eventually this inflexibility dooms him.Marx built upon his economic position to develop a political scenario that just did not happen - not sustainably. I think here the folly is not that the position was wrong but rather that when he makes his predictions: \\"....exploiters will be expropriated ...\\", he never says how it would come about. This would not be so bad if more of his writings actually had some sort of road map of how you get to this utopia, but they don't.Finally, is he as bad as I have made him out to be? Well, you be the judge. This is a man writing at the tail end of the initial experience of the industrial revolution. He devotes a large part of Capital to vivid descriptions of young children being dragged out of bed at 2 and 3 in the morning to work in horrible factories, of starving mothers giving up their children to horrendous working conditions in phosphorus match factories where they would die within a few years or were horribly afflicted, of terrible lung diseases in potters or resistance to reducing the average work day to a mere 18 hours. He sees all these and cries out. What follows may be flawed but is grounded in a deep human sympathy. And his experience resonates today with us when we think that perhaps the working poor ought to at least get a living wage, or people must not have to make a decision between rent and medicines and children ought not to die because access of healthcare was not affordable."},{"Title":"Capital: A critique of political economy","review":"I am not exactly sure how to sum up a book like this. I put months of effort into it and got back a huge cache of historical, economic information that I am still synthesizing.What is Capitalism? Why did it arise and how? What was the transition from Feudalism to Capitalism like and what is the nature of the workers struggle and alienation?I think I will need to read it again and next time I will use David Harvey's video guide to help me focus more. I might also self-abridge my copy next time because there was much in this edition that I think is no longer needed. Maybe I will pick up an abridgement and compare it.This is an incredibly important work and it is a tragedy that so few people read it. As with many works from the 19th century I start and never finish, I have to blame our education system. We are just not prepared to read works this dense.I would say that in general, this book is a lot like Algebra was for me. It starts easy and fun and then gets hard and stays that way for a long time. If, however, you stay with it, you will be able to understand how it ends and it ends beautifully.This book and its ideas are not outdated and have not been superseded by anything that has come later. It is still incredibly relevant and the reader will recognize the laws and tactics of capitalism today as being the same as the laws and strategies of capitalism at the height of the industrial revolution.Read it, but use a guide or use David Harvey's videos which I did not discover until I was half way through, sadly."},{"Title":"Capital: A critique of political economy","review":"I think it was the poor French philosopher Althusser who claimed that Marx had discovered a new continent of thought called &quot;history&quot; equivalent to the continents of thought discovered by Pythagoras (geometry) and Aristotle (science). I would use a different metaphor. It is as if Marx invented a pair of x-ray glasses that allows you the viewer to see the exploitation hidden in every commodity, no matter how beautifully it is packaged. I guess the only book it is really comparable to would be the Bible, edited and created in the year 207 by the North African Roman citizen Quintus Septimius Florens Tertullianus. On the narrative level the books are quite opposite. The one starts with a single savior who comes to save the world, but ends up being exploited, abused and killed, thus needing saving, the other starts with a class that is exploited, abused and killed, but ends up saving the world. Of the two, Marx is definitely the more optimistic view. But if we could resurrect Marx as we resurrected Jesus, would he still have his optimism?"},{"Title":"Great Paper Quilling","review":"This is a very good book for beginners and intermediate quillers.

As the title implies, this book is simply among the best. The authors are marriage counselors and psychotherapists from back in the days when \\"psychotherapy\\" was a thing. Their main contention is that a \\"relational marriage\\"- one in which the partners are more than just roommates, but intimate friends, confidantes, and allies- is a desirable goal, and that it can be attained with hard work and unflagging emphasis on the marriage as the priority.Each chapter addresses a common \\"problem area\\" between spouses. Some of the sections are a bit outdated- the social drinking section, in particular, seems very '50's- but the main point of each is still extremely serviceable to those who wish to make their marriage the first priority of their relational life. The authors are never skimpy with reminders of the rewards of putting your marriage first, and the consequences of not doing so. They don't necessarily offer \\"solutions\\" in the usual sense of the word- they mostly just identify conflicts and then remind the reader to keep the priorities in order and the end goal in mind. This is definitely not a book for someone who wants to blame their problems on their spouse or control them- however, it's great for anyone who wants to grow as a person and as a spouse.I read a great quote once: \\"People need to be reminded more often than they need to be instructed\\". I've found that a \\"dose\\" of this book is an extremely effective reminder to keep my priorities straight and ignore the trivialities that sabotage my marriage.As a side note, the authors are Christians (at least I think so- Catholics, I believe) and have nine children, but I believe this book would be a helpful addition to anyone's library, whatever their beliefs. The authors do not attempt to indoctrinate the reader into converting to their religion or having a bunch of children- in fact, they are so emphatic about the irresponsibility of having children for the wrong reasons and perpetuating religious attitudes that harm your marriage that a casual reader might even assume they were anti-children and anti-religion! They consistently advocate making reasoned, mature decisions or not doing the thing at all. This book is definitely a safe choice, and a solid addition to your shelf."},{"Title":"The genius of George Washington (The Third George Rogers Clark lecture)","review":"On the copyright page, a small disclaimer appears alerting the reader that this book consists of one lecture and portions of Washtington's letters and is NOT intended to be &quot;fresh contributions to the scholarship of the American Revolution.&quot; I will not argue this but will praise Edmund Morgan on clearly and straightforwardly explaining an his theory that George Washington's understanding of power was far beyond any of his contemporaries' or of any other American historical figure. As examples, shows the reader examples from Washingtons' life and letters with regards to national power, military power, foreign relations and the comperative power of nations and the power that comes with honor or respect.This is a slim work, consisting of less than ninety pages, but these pages have done a great deal to flesh out my understanding of Washington the person. Morgan has convinced me that Washington is a genius with regards to the understanding of power and the remoteness and aloofness that historians often find puzzeling is less an arrogant flaw than a deliberate calculated example of his understanding of power.

This is a very slim volume, consisting of one very interesting lecture on Washington as a military and political leader (arguing that Washington understood the nature of power better than anybody else in his day in the colonies or the states), and a selection of Washington's letters that provide corroboration for Morgan's arguments and insight into the pertinent topics. Where needed, Morgan provides a brief introduction to each letter. I enjoyed it, but it isn't going to make anybody outside of the two groups I mentioned above very happy."},{"Title":"The genius of George Washington (The Third George Rogers Clark lecture)","review":"This book contains the November 17, 1977 Clark Lecture given by Professor Morgan, followed by a number of excerpts from Washington's letters.He begins by saying, \\"What was extraordinary about the (American) Revolution was the talent it generated, the number of men of genius who stepped out of farmyards and plantations, out of countinghouses and courtrooms, to play a leading role in winning the war and then in building a national government... if one were to make a list of the great men of American history, by whatever standards one chooses to measure greatness, an astonishingly large proportion would be found whose careers began or culminated in the Revolution. It would be hard to find in all the rest of American history more than two or three men to rank with Washington, Franklin, Jefferson, Hamilton, Madison, or John Adams.\\" (Pg. 3-4)He observes about Washington, \\"He was not a bookish man. He contributed nothing to the formal political thought of the American Revolution, nor did he produce any treatises on military strategy or tactics. But he did understand power in every form.\\" (Pg. 6) He notes, \\"Washington's appreciation of geographical factors made him not only wary of being trapped like Cornwallis but also averse to defending any particular point, including cities. The British armies were much more powerful than his and capable of taking any place they wanted. It was therefore not worthwhile to erect elaborate stationary defenses.\\" (Pg. 9)He records a speech of Washington to Congress, \\"I am heartily disposed to entertain the most farourable sentiments of our new ally (France) and to cherish them in others to a reasonable degree; but it is a maxim founded on the universal experience of mankind, that no nation is to be trusted farther than it is bound by its interest; and no prudent statesman or politician will venture to depart from it.\\" (Pg. 16)Washington wrote in a letter dated April 21, 1778, \\"I do not mean to exclude altogether the idea of Patriotism. I know it exists, and I know it has done much in the present Contest. But I will venture to assert, that a great and lasting War can never be supported on this principle alone. It must be aided by a prospect of Interest or some reward.\\" (Pg. 51)Obviously not a \\"detailed\\" treatment of the man, this book is a highly interesting overview, and contains some genuinely interesting insights; the letters included are very illuminating, as well."},{"Title":"Anatomy, descriptive and surgical","review":"I got more than what I was looking for.

The amount of information contained in this book is impressive and it is small enough to carry in a briefcase for reference. The text is clear and comprehensive. It has a through rundown of all the human systems and extremely detailed breakdowns of the human anatomy itself. Two things I'm not so impressed with, however - which are very important - are: 1. Illustrations are bountiful...but are in black and white and it is VERY hard to differentiate between structures....and little lines that point to specific structures dissappear in the drawing, instead of quickly mapping things out. 2. There are VERY few full size/system illustrations....for example, there is not a picture of the entire anterior/posterior/lateral skull, abdominal cavity, chest cavity, or appendages for quick reference...instead, all the illustrations are piece by piece...one page has the mandible, one the eye bones...it is all broken down into little sections.

With all editions, it is important to understand that this is a systems based atlas - not a regional atlas. If one wants to trace every branch of an artery, it is very helpful. To understand the relationship between a vessel and nerves in proximity, it is lacking. However, unlike most atlases (Netter, Clemente, Sobatta, Grant's, Thieme, Pernkopf, not to mention the numerous but little helpful photographic atlases), it has considerable text in addition to labels. As a general surgeon (and trauma surgeon for war wounded), I would always pick a regional atlas in preference for clinical work.

In fact, glands are comprehensively covered in this encyclopedic text. Unfortunately, there are many obscure Latin words in the text, particularly referring to parts of the body, for some reason, and it would much more preferable and less confusing if future editions were written in plain English. In many ways the book is similar to the series of Haynes DIY auto manuals that enable the amateur car mechanic keep their ailing old bangers, such as the type I Ford Escorts and Morris Marinas on the road. As a result, for those interested in reducing their medical expenses or impatient with long hospital waiting lists, the temptation is after reading this book is to \\"have a go yourself\\" and remove your own appendix or transplant a kidney. I should say at this point that modern surgery is a lot more involved than simply \\"knowing where all the bits are\\" and this should be strongly discouraged. Only those who have completely read the whole book should think about taking on a craniotomy on the kitchen table and only then with another responsible adult in the room who can act as an anesthetist. For those who are animal lovers sadly this book is destined to disappoint there are not a single description of the dissection of any thing other than the human body, this narrow minded unanthropomorphic view of the subject matter will surely deter the more wholistic readers who believe that looking at the map of a cat or lion or even the nasal cavity of a proboscis monkey, Nasalis larvatus, could bring in new insights to modern surgery."},{"Title":"Anatomy, descriptive and surgical","review":"This book is the definitive in human anatomy .

Surely it will come with his superb 12th novel, Blood and Guile, a partial sequel to the equally laudatory Tidewater Blood (1998).It begins as a time of conviviality - a hunt high in the mountains, the pursuit of ruffed grouse. Drake Wingo, owner of Grizzly's, a sporting goods store, and an avid woodsman, has organized the party, inviting two life long friends, Walter Frampton, a timid, low key attorney practicing in Jessup's Wharf, Virginia, and Cliff Dickens, an aspiring artist who shocked Richmond society with an exhibition of homoerotic photos. The three have been pals since boyhood, once swearing their fealty to each other in blood.To round out the foursome Drake has brought along Wendell Ripley, the quiet owner of Drake's rented hunting property and a stranger to the other two men. A member of The Watchers, a small religious commune, Ripley is congenial but appears withdrawn.The outing ends abruptly in tragedy when Cliff accidentally shoots Ripley to death. The man, Cliff contritely explains, had suddenly stepped in front of him and caught the shots intended for an elusive grouse.However, a savvy county sheriff isn't quite satisfied with that explanation, and begins an investigation of his own. Soon, to Walter's surprise, Cliff is arrested on a charge of murder. Walter stands by his friend and is determined to free him, although he finds Cliff's story puzzling at times and Drake's behavior even more of a conundrum.There are secrets being kept from him, Walter is certain of that, yet he persists in championing Cliff, which draws him into a Machivellian scheme and in danger of losing his own life.Mr. Hoffman is a master builder of suspense, drawing one along from a cabin in the West Virginia hills to the midst of Richmond's gay community to the sun washed street of Fort Lauderdale. Just as Walter uncovers shocking interrelationships, long hidden secrets, the reader is captured not only by these revelations but by the author's tightly woven drama which leads to a spine tingling conclusion.If only a first rate mystery, Blood and Guile would rest on its merits. However, the generously talented Mr. Hoffman laces his tale with memorable scenes of Tidewater communities, landscapes of nature's abundant growth, and beautifully poetic descriptions of incredible wild creatures.Reading William Hoffman is such a rich and rewarding experience that writers in his genre pale beside him. He delivers a banquet, others a box lunch."},{"Title":"Blood and Guile","review":"Narrator Walter &quot;Raff&quot; Frampton, a small-town Virginia lawyer, sets the tone in this fine Southern novel of buddies, secrets and death. Walter, a non hunter, is on a grouse hunt in the West Virginia mountains with two of his childhood buddies and a fourth man, the owner of the land - who ends up dead. Walter sees nothing to doubt in his friend Cliff's version of the accidental shooting but the country sheriff raises questions that culminate in Cliff's arrest.A mild, correct man with social hankerings and a lonely but comfortable routine, Walter begins probing when his legal maneuvers fail. The real hunter of the group, Drake, brushes off his questions and Walter is wounded to discover Cliff confides more confidently in Drake than his lawyer.The town's lofty pretensions and grubby secrets unfold as Walter doggedly pursues his case. A man who has invested his high opinion unwisely, reserving a low opinion for himself, Walter finds unsuspected reserves of quiet determination. Atmospheric, written with perfect pitch, Hoffman's (&quot;Tidewater Blood&quot;) novel successfully combines literary themes with suspenseful pacing."},{"Title":"Blood and Guile","review":"After Tidewater Blood, the first of William Hoffman's novels I read, I was primed to enjoy this new one. Sadly, Blood And Guile suffers from a too-languid pace that detracts from the plot line. The primary character, Walter Frampton, who stood as a fine piece of believable characterization in the previous book, comes across here as ineffectual, even dull in a doomed-romantic fashion. It's a pity, because this tale of a supposed hunting accident has possibilities that are never fully realized-all as a result of Frampton's failure to step off the pages as he did so compellingly in Tidewater Blood. Certainly, Blood And Guile is worth reading, but it's just not on the same level as the preceding book."},{"Title":"Blood and Guile","review":"Four men spend a weekend together, hunting in the West Virginia mountains. Three of the men are life-long buddies, one is an acquaintance - an outsider. A shooting accident while out hunting sees the outsider shot dead. The local sheriff is not inclined to believe that the shooting was an accident because the facts don't match the story. The story is told from the perspective of one of the three friends, Walter Frampton. He is a lawyer and is drawn into it both on a professional and personal level. He begins to realise that he didn't know his friends as well as he thought.Once the excitement of the hunting accident passes, we seem to meander from scene to scene without achieving much. There is a side-story which doesn't have any bearing on the matter at hand and, ultimately does not resolve itself. Plotting for his next novel, perhaps? While interesting it loses momentum midway through, consequently my interest began to wane, I'm glad I borrowed this from the library, rather than bought it."},{"Title":"Blood and Guile","review":"\\"Blood and Guile\\" is a rather leisurely read; if you're expecting lots of action and thrills, you don't get them. However, Hoffman has a strong command of his environment, and even though there are many flaws in this why did they do it?, it's still worth reading.Four men go off hunting, and right away we find out that one of them has been killed in an unfortunate \\"accident.\\" Hoffman is to be commended for not making the West Virginia law enforcement the typical hillbilly buffoons. Bruce Sawyers is a modern, healthy, young efficient sheriff whose investigation leads to the possibility that the accident was indeed a murder.Although Walter is certainly not the most stalwart of heroes, his emergence at the end makes up somewhat for this lack of bravado. Along the way, we meet some interesting characters including Phyllis Duke, a woman with a very strange history; Drake Wingo, the he-man hunter who has found his newfound \\"fame\\" pivotal in his decision making; Cliff Dickinson, a rather foppish artiste type who is the supposed murderer; and Boomer, a clerk at the Grizzly store whose brevity does not diminish his interest. Unfortunately, the main female focus is Josey, and she comes across as being rather selfish and uninteresting. The inclusion of the Prince from Arabia story only serves to slow down the otherwise engrossing story.There aren't many surprises; you can pretty much figure out what is going on, but it doesn't dilute the quiet impact of this story. Drake's exposition while hunting in the last section is a hauntingly realistic expose on how we refuse to face the truth.RECOMMENDED."},{"Title":"Blood and Guile","review":"a level headed lawyer and his boyhood blood brothers go grouse hunting with a fundamentalist landowner who winds up shot dead.

Peter Kerr writes about his life in Mallorca, having moved from Scotland to get a taste of a more idyllic lifestyle and away from the rat race. Except for the occasional familiar Spanish expressions and terms, this book tries to emulate the style of Peter Mayle's hugely successful and popular series on Provence. In my humble opinion, it failed quite badly. Peter Kerr tried to describe very minute details which may not interest readers. He tried to be humurous- marginally successful at times. If you want a good read of life in a foreign countryside, pick up Peter Mayle's A Year in Provence, anytime. I may have been biased and it could be possible that I may like Peter Kerr's books on Mallorca had I begun with his first book on Mallorcan winter. Sometimes, the first book of a series is usually the best and as the series progresses, the author suffers from fatigue. So do readers."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This is one of those books I pushed myself to get halfway through, thinking it would get interesting, only to force myself to finish it since I already read half of it. While there may be no accounting for taste or I'm just missing something, I'm not sure how anyone can enjoy reading this. It ultimately boils down to some sisters trying to marry (up, for the most part) in the world. I guess, if I try real hard, I can see some people imagining themselves in the scenes and enjoying the idea of living in the same town, wearing the same clothes, going to the same events, etc., but nothing really ever happens. It just goes on and on and on, only to lead this sister ending up with that guy, this sister ending up with that guy, etc."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I am so disappointed. Being a fan of classic literature I was looking forward to reading Pride & Prejudice. But what I got was moderately-well written chick lit. Think of Pride and Prejudice as the Bridgit Jones of the 18th Century.The story-line is predictable - you know how the whole novel is going to play out after the first couple of pages. The only thing that kept me going was the hope that there would be some little twist. Maybe Jane would end up with Darcy, or something a little more interesting. Unfortunately not.I honestly think Austen was writing a parody of women. The only concern of every female character in the book is to get married to a rich, well-to-do gentleman. Of course, some will argue that Elizabeth is different, but as she states herself, her interest in Darcy is only aroused when she sees what a wonderful estate he owns and considers that she may be the lady of it. Each of the female characters are shallow, self-centred (Jane excepted) and vacuous.On the positive side, some of the characters are interesting - Mr. Bennet is amusing, and Darcy started out being intriguing before turning into a school girl-like idiot.Perhaps, if you're a fan of straight-down-the-line, predictable romantic (semi comedic at times) novels then you might enjoy this. But don't expect to find a masterful tale, expertly told. Unfortunately that is what I was expecting (it being a \\"classic\\" and all) and I was totally disappointed. I really think this is one of the worst books I have ever read."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Most people will probably hate me for writing this review about a classic, but I found Pride and Prejudice a terrible bore. Everyone knows what it's about, so I won't use up my time telling you. But the book is really sort of a nightmare that never ends. It is not romantic or charming in the least bit. The main character comes through as arrogant and at times even stupid. It is a completely forgetable book, and I have no clue as to why so many people find it romantic. The writing is good, it has it's moments, but it in no way makes up for this book's lack of everything else. Wuthering Heights and Little Women, other classics that are just about in the same genre, are by far superior. I was so disappointed I have not read another book by Austen, and I'm not planning on it."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"god forbid i be so bold as to trash a classic. and yes, maybe because of all the raving reviews from my friends and from the book's great reputation, i entered it with high expectations. - which the book however did not satisfy. yes, it is a good comedic parody of the upper class of the time, a lampoon of the courtship ritual, and of course oh so witty, blah blah blah, but it just wasn't my cup of tea. the main character was likeable, but that aside, i found it completely insufferable to read through, and absolutely painfully boring. every subsequent event from the very beginning could be predicted, let alone the ending. not that anything really ever happens - the entire book could be summed up with, \\"then they walked and talked and had tea and walked and talked and had tea, walked and talked and had more tea, then got married and lived happily ever after.\\" the entire novel was a headache of girly gossip and mental drama. it would save more time just to watch a chick flick. so if you're interested in the relationship fiascos of fictious characters, witnessing the agony over who's going to marry who (even though the reader could already predict the happily-ever-after match-making light-years in advance), then this is the book for you!! if not, then i suggest picking up some dan brown."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I am new to kindle books and found this book for free. Boy, make sure you go in and READ about the book before you even download it. I can read a book in a day this book took me over a week to read. I COULD NOT stay with this book.

I am so glad I did not have to purchase this I would of wanted my money back."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I have wanted to read this novel for a long time because of all the great reviews. Finally I had the chance to read it and personally I am disgusted. I tried really hard to see what people love about the book. I cannot see it. There is no true love in the book, the characters are shallow and there is absolutely no story. It talks through the entire book of these five sisters marrying. I think that they are al pompous and rather annoying. I do have to say that Elizabeth is my favorite character as she doesn't seem to be as sucked in to the society nearly as much, but I do not see what there is in this book that has given it all the wonderful reviews. Though I do encourage all to reaad it and see for themselves what it is like. From the reviews people either LOVE it or HATE it there are no in-betweens.

And that is perfectly fine we are not all a like and have a right to our own views and opinions. Nevertheless, I must speak out and let my opinon be heard even though most of you who can't say enough about this book wouldn't want to hear.I am forced to read this book for my lit class and I find this book repulsive. I have never read such a novel that is completly incompetant, complete nonsence, the smallest talks of all the small talks in the world, it is about nothingness, and how several nothings trying and wanting to get married to other nothings for all the wrong reasons in the world. It is about people pretending to be inteligent and pretending to be civilized. It is a book where they compliment women as being handsome and men as being well...also handsome. It is quite contageous I might add because I find myself helplessly imatitating the language that it was written in. I am offended by every paragraph that I read. I have never felt such contemt for any work that I read. I pasionately despise this novel and I could write an entire paper on why. The 17th century English aristocracy and the way the people cary and behave themselves and think so highly of themselves and so low of anybody who is different, is offensive and without merit. You may think &quot;that I simply don't understand this work&quot; well I don't and I am not going pretend that I understand this &quot;classic&quot; Perhaps I am incapable of comprehending this novel. I do know however that there are a lot finer book writen in the 17th centuries and earlier and after, which are better, more meaningful then this book and are also classic but some of them are notoverated enough as much as this book is."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This book is a classic.

The style is clumsy though the author strives to impress with an aristocratic pompousness so typical of social climbers of her day. The characters are cold, their development dull and boring and Austen's every attempt to portray the most basic of human relationships falls well short, getting completely tangled in ridiculously elite language that was in its day and remains still completely outdated. Commoners did not speak like that then, nor do they now. I would rather endure a daily root canal than read this book again. It was almost as inspirational as witnessing a mountain top removal to mine coal. It doesn't surprise me that her original manuscript was rejected as it should have been and now I wonder to what extent politics played a role in her eventual success? Perhaps zero of five stars would be more accurate..."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is an awesome book.

But the real dilema however is when Lizzy finds herself in love with the nastiest, most proud man she has ever met. Go and read this wonderful novel the first chance you get."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I have to agree -- Pride and Prejudice is a wee bit, well -- BORING.I don't know what it is. Maybe I just didn't get it -- but that's not like me at all. I don't find classic in general very hard to understand. I've read plenty of classics and both loved and understood them.No, it's not that I didn't understand, it's just that the story takes so long to kick off. It begins with our shero Elizabeth and her pathetic clan of sisters who struggle to appease society by appearing either beautiful, accomplished, well-connected or all three.As most main characters do, Elizabeth stands out from her sisters. She doesn't attempt to be pretty or accomplished and could care less about impressing any man. Her main concerns are caring for her family and remaining witty, independent, and free. She further scandalizes the neighborhood with this rebellious nature by -- gasp! -- walking a few miles in the rain and mud to care for her sick sister! The nerve!And meanwhile, the famous Mr. Darcy seems if anything cold, distant, and rude. He has a slight interest in Elizabeth, but that seems to be all. For this reason I was slightly shocked when I saw the commercials for the movie version of this book -- why, Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth were kissing!I must have read more than half the novel and they didn't so much as shake hands! I finally gave up and moved on to more interesting works of fiction -- but, hey, if you like and understand this novel, then good for you! Meanwhile, the rest of us would like to get back to the more admirable Miss Jane Eyre."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I have read this book a number of times, and tried to like it; but; the characters lack depth. Lizzy, and to an extent Charlotte are the only two who are 3D. Jane Austen\`s ideas of poverty are laughable, large house complete with servants is not poor. Mr.Darcy great on video but passionless in the text."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I wish that I can rate 0 star, not the novel itself but the book and it's quality. The cover is very nice, but the pages inside are of very very poor quality.... If I had known it would be that kind of, I would definitely buy a better edition."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This was indeed one of the most foolish novels I have ever read. I found the conflict boring and without point, and the theme horribly expressed (was there any at all). Such that I find it amazing that the behaviors of an aristocratic woman in the 19th century wound actually be of interest to ANYONE. The themes are indeed NOT universal, and if anything, it should be derived from simple everyday life - there is no need to write a book about it. The infamous character portrayals seem hugely worthless. Such a book is suited at best for the coffee table. Two stars because I never had the energy to finish the entire book, so I might have missed the so called \\"good parts\\" of it."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"An Ok book for anyone who's into that sort of thing i suppose but come on, it isn't very believable in some places. Take for instance the supposed intelligence of one Elizabeth Bennet who is initially so incredibly blinded by her own prejudice that she cannot see Mr. Darcy for who he really is. Am i the only person who thinks that were Elizabeth so intelligent then she must be able to look at things from both sides of the coin as the saying goes. To be honest with you for it's time it is an excellent Romance novel but it's just the niggling little things like that that kinda make you think that had more thought gone into it it could have been so much better..."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"The font is too small. I'm not sure what point the author is trying to get across with this tiny font, but it fell on deaf ears, mostly because I couldn't read the book.

In other words, I wanted to read Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, but in order to prepare I first purchased and read Pride and Prejudice.Pride and Prejudice sucks. Basically, it is extremely boring, even for a character-driven story. I consider myself an open minded person and I have read and enjoyed some character driven stories such as Jane Eyre, Crime and Punishment, and The Great Gatsby. With all of those books I could tell why the books were classsic; they had well developed characters who interacted in a way that was either entertaining enough, or had sufficient underlying philosophical or social subtext, that a person could read these books with a sense of interest.The problem with Pride and Prejudice is that it essentially seems to amount to a story about a fictionalized idealized version of herself as an intelligent somewhat socially unacceptable woman in the context of English upper class society who is able to tell people off in socially acceptable ways, be smarter than her sisters, and meet a grumpy, intelligent socially unacceptable man to marry. It is boring because it basically doesn't have any social commentary or philosophical suspect besides for \\"smart chix roxxorz\\" or perhaps \\"nerds for t3h win\\" and it is basically a self-referential story which continues ad nauseum. I cannot understand for a moment why Pride and Prejudice is considered a classic and not the literary equivalent of trashy internet fan fiction with a Mary Sue lead character. Actually, I recall reading somewhere that Charlotte Bronte basically panned Pride and Prejudice in a review as being boring as hell.I would recommend reading Jane Eyre over Pride and Prejudice because even though Jane Eyre is essentially another self referential fantasy about being a slightly socially awkward smart woman in the context of English society there are actual physical events that happen in the story that can somewhat hold your interest and actual entertaining fleshed out characters besides for the main character, whereas I get the feeling that Pride and Prejudice is basically a gripe about how everyone else is so shallow. If you're going to do that at least be entertaining about it like in The Great Gatsby. Trying to finish off Pride and Prejudice just caused me a lot of stress and pain and I had to force myself to keep reading. And I've read a lot of things in my lifetime that would bore most people into depression and somnolence.Actually my real recommendation for if you want a good piece of classic literature with developed characters, but you don't want to deal with the anemic pale flabby social dissatisfaction of a book like Pride and Prejudice, you should instead read something by Alexandre Dumas like The Count of Monte Cristo or The Three Musketeers. Those books are written in a convoluted classical style (read it in French for extra points!), they have real characters, they have character interaction, but they're also event-driven rather than exclusively character-driven; actual physical events, rather than conversations at dinner parties, drive the story lines. The lead characters actually do things like engage in hand to hand combat, pilfer fine wines, and manipulate international politics, whereas the people in Pride and Prejudice just bad mouth each other at a dinner table. (Jane Austen doesn't even tell us what they're eating and drinking; at least Alexandre Dumas tells us how his heroes infiltrated no-man's-land and were taking fire but had brought a picnic basket with food and wine from a specific region and were having lunch and making fun of the enemy from behind cover.) And given how busy modern life is, do you really want to spend hours of your precious time reading about pale anemic English people bad mouthing each other over dinner over ridiculous inconsequential things, and not about musketeers taking fire while making snarky comments and knocking back wine? I mean, seriously."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I did not have a favorite chapter but the chapter that I found most interesting is chapter eight because in that chapter Elizabeth and Darcy meet again at the Bingley's house and Darcy feels dumb because Elizabeth had rejected him, and they had not seen each other since that had happened.I feel that this book is for the age group of 20-40 and I think that it's more for girls then guys. I'm not trying to sound sexist, but I don't think that guys would find the story interesting.One literary device that I appreciate is the conflict between Elizabeth and Darcy. Elizabeth does not like Darcy at first, and she rejects him when he proposed. But then she falls in love with him.I found the book all right; it was not that boring. However it was really long and I did not have enough time to read it and understand it well. I would not read this book again because it's not my type of book. I would rather read about action or something that relates to me, or that is interesting to me.BY Manuel Rosales"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Starts off very slow, but comes into its own near the last 100 pages.

So well cast &amp; produced you are able to focus on the story &amp; not be distracted by production issues (e.g. &quot;THAT's different from the book...&quot;). My ultimate test for the relevance of a story is how many lines I plagiarize from it to use in normal conversation, and this story has some classics.

I couldn't help but root for Darcy."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a thread of ammunition in today's literary cannon. Being that it is, I felt I should read it. The plot in the book is very straight forward. Having been produced in the 19th century and entailing the reader with a striking and classic love scenario gives it historical leverage. What other 19th century novel can intertwine social class, love, and crazy parents?Austen's portrayal of social class played a responsibility in the novels greatness. Binding social class and love conveyed it to the current time. I especially enjoyed when the book started to occlude and Elizabeth was confronted by Lady Catherine regarding her love for Mr. Darcy. That moment was significant because it showed that social class does not dignify a person's love. Imagine you were teaching this tale to high school students: They could feed off of it in so many ways.I will admit that this work of fiction was complex at times, but the more I asked questions, the easier it was to understand. I watched the movie (2006 version) after I finished the book. Everything that I had envisioned the book to be about was correlated directly in the movie. The benefit of watching the movie was that it sufficed some of the minimal elements in Austen's book I was unsure of. I may read this book again, and if I do I would like to have a group to read it with. It always helps to talk out-loud distinguished novels like Pride and Prejudice so readers can pin-point missed segments and unlock blocked thoughts."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This is a pleasant classic with a wonderful story.

The story is about Elizabeth Bennet who is a strong willed and outspoken young woman as she tries to find her true love. The most interesting aspect of the story is not Elizabeth's hunt for love, but her relationship with her parents. Mrs. Bennet is a flighty woman whose main goal in life is to have her daughters wed to wealthy men. While, Mr. Bennet is a sarcastic and cynical man with no interest in martial affairs. Elizabeth's contrasting parental figures is detrimental to all of the daughters and even places them in danger.Most people identify this novel with the relationship between outspoken Elizabeth and cocky Darcy. However, there is much more to the story than their love.Still, I am looking forward to reading Linda Berdoll's sequel titled Darcy Takes a Wife."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"For the first time ever, I liked the movie (w/Colin Firth version) way better than the book."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I'm not really qualified enough to give the comments for this wonderful classic book.

Throughout the book you are triggered into seeing if Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth are ever gonna get hooked up.

I wanted to read this because everyone was saying that it was such a great book and that its timeless and yadda, yadda, yadda.So I was a little iffy on the first volume, but I could handle all the cliches, the social ranks, and the writing. Around the middle of voume two, i started screaming at the book (screaming at inanimate objects-never a good sign) because i was so fed up with it. I couldn't get myself to get really into it like my fellow peers. Maybe its because I'm 14, but I don't get it. The writing is boring, its too cliched, too old-fashioned, annoying and I know that the lovers are supposed to be in passionate love and all, but it feels cold-no love or passion, just boring. I found myself falling asleep in the middle of every chapter after chapter 16. Maybe its just me, I don't know, but I did not like this book, at all. I can understand why people of Jane Austen's time would adore this book, but i don't understand how people of OUR time can enjoy this. If you're looking for a good British classic romance, Wuthering Heights, not Pride and Prejudice."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Elizabeth is twenty years old, living in the Victorian ages in England. Life is a bit tricky for her. She lives with her overbearing mother, disinterested father, older sister Jane and three younger sisters, Mary, Catherine and Lydia. They are a reasonably well-to-do family for the moment, although once Elizabeth's father dies, their estate and any fortune he has left will go to a male relative, as he was unable to produce any sons. With the prospect of becoming destitute looming over her, Elizabeth's mother is desperate to get her five daughters, all in their late teens or early twenties, married off to wealthy men.The first man to come to her attention is Mr. Bingley, an eligible man who becomes their neighbor. Sure enough, he shortly becomes captivated by Jane, and everything seems on track for the two of them to become engaged. When there is interference from his sisters and his best friend, Mr. Darcy, Elizabeth's family is thrown into turmoil.Mr. Darcy is almost universally disliked. He doesn't dance at the neighborhood balls. He doesn't engage in polite conversation or otherwise make himself seem social. After overhearing an unkind comment about herself from him, he loses any favor he might have had with Elizabeth. She goes out of her way to describe his odious nature to all who will listen. Despite his earliest impression of her, though, Mr. Darcy soon comes to find Elizabeth quite enthralling. What measures will he go to in order to change her mind and win her admiration?I liked the intertwining of lives in this story and some of the descriptions of what life was like living in the countryside back in the day. However, the story is limited by the time and style in which it was written. The plot drags along and the narrator spends far too much time dwelling on unemotional descriptions of scenery. I'm not sure if it was the intention of this story, but my strongest impression after reading it was that the life of those living in the upper class in England at this time had the most excruciatingly boring lives I can imagine. The characters in this story seemed constantly looking for anything to break the monotony of their day-to-day lives, and that impression didn't add much excitement to the book."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I understand that Pride and Prejudice is an honored classic. However, for me personally, I finally listened to myself and put the book away after reading about half of the story. The problem is that the characters are shallow and pretentious, and are simply not very likable or compelling. I think the novel, with all its gossipy nature, is the 1812 version of celebrity gossip television shows.I have read most of the English classics from the 1800s, including truly great romance novels such as Wuthering Heights or Tess of the D'UrberVilles, but sadly, found Pride and Prejudice to be boring and not worth my time. Full disclosure, as a middle-aged male, I may not actually be the target audience for the book. However, it should appeal to young women about the same age as the protagonists.Updated years later: Forced myself to finish reading the novel; I stick with my original \\"thumbs way down\\" assessment. The characters are all air-headed twits, shallow and stupid. A waste of my time, and I have no idea how it became a classic. Guys, this book is not for you - it is for young women."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a story on how one family of five girls try to fall in love all in one year. Drama starts when the young Elizabeth Bennett crosses upon a gentlemen by the name of Mr. Darcy who soon falls madly in love with her. While thats going on, Elizabeths older sister, Jane has fallen in love with Mr. Bingley, the \\"new neighbor\\" in their town. This book is full of love triangles, gossip and old fashion \\"love talk\\".I don't really like this book because, it was hard to follow because the wording was dated far back. There are also too many conversations going on in just one page! I would reccomend this book to adults and teenagers above the age of 15. If you don't like romance novels, don't even dare to pick up this book.I still think Jane Austen is a good author. She demonstrates a lot of personality in one person and sometimes it feels like you were almost in the book."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This book made me laugh, it makes fun of the 18 century society and mocks all their greatness.

Great way of telling the story and it is bitchin' how all falls into place at the end."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Although it started out very slow in the first few chapters, the rest of the book made it all worth reading. It captivates you and takes you on a ride of emotions."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"First, let me be clear: I love the story behind Pride and Prejudice. Yes, it has a simple \\"nothing much happens\\" plot, but so do some of the best stories ever written. The storyline of P&P; gets 5 stars from me.But the book...while I love and deeply appreciate Austen's vivid imagination and deep understanding of human nature, her writing style is just plain boring. I think of it as Dickens-esque, back in the day when writers were paid by the word. Descriptive detail in a book, when properly used, enhances the story. And details that give background information can generate major interest and hold a reader's attention, again, if done properly. But dry descriptions, needlessly strewn in and testing the limits of patience, detract from the plot and feel of the book. No doubt in the early 19th century, when this book was written, people were fascinated by every last little word on the page -- after all, their lives were filled with the same tedium that fills the book.The adulation for this book reminds me of a sycophantic love-fest. It is \\"known\\" that this book is a paragon of English lit, and if you disagree with that opinion, you just don't \\"get\\" quality literature, or you aren't sophisticated/educated enough to appreciate it. Well, I definitely \\"get\\" it, and I'm not afraid to say that it was dull, and say furthermore that the book could have been cut in half and suffered no major losses.P&P; stands out for me, because it is the almost the only instance where I prefer the movie ('95 mini-series, anyway) version to the book. That never happens for me, normally the book is indescribably more satisfying than the screen, but this book is the notable exception. The mini-series distills down the storyline (which, again, I think is one of the best in English literature) to its heart, and whittles away everything that is superfluous until all that is left is one of the greatest love stories of all time. Sadly, the book falls short of imparting that level of satisfaction."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"People who order this cassette should be wary!

Mr Bennett is the epitome of patience, (a characteristic obviously developed by years of coping with his wife's &quot;poor nerves&quot;.) And Lizzie and the arrogant Mr Darcy? What can I say about them that fellow readers don't already know? For those of you who are thinking; &quot;What does she mean?&quot;; go and buy the book and READ it!

Granted, there are many ommision for this two hour audioplay, but essentially, it retains the very essence of the story."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Austen has created a very believable world in P&amp;P. Although the book's official theme is marriage, it is also a statement on human behavior. The problems suffered by the characters are the result of their own folly, and no one else. The love story woven into the book is also wonderful, as it shows the characters concerned getting to know each other's positives and negatives before committing, instead of simply jumping into bed as the characters of modern novels do. This book is smartly written, with much humor. It is lighthearted and easy to read, although it was written over 200 years ago (the first draft of the book was written in the late 1700s, but not published until after 1800). I highly recommmend it to a reader of any age. It is, as Elizabeth Bennet would say, a &quot;happy thought, indeed.&quot;"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"It feels a little strange and even presumptuous to review Jane Austen online. I was prompted to do so when reading other reviews dismissing Pride and Prejudice as nothing more than a silly romance and a relic of a bygone era.It would be silly to suggest that the social mores and manners that Austen skewered are unchanged. Young women are no longer dependent on a husband simply for food and shelter, and I have no intention of spending my life in a drawing room trimming hats and sewing screens. But it would also be silly to suggest that Austen's tale offers nothing to the modern reader. Even in our enlightened age, young women in indelicate situations are pressured by their humiliated families into unfortunate marriages. Manifestations of social standing may differ, but money, education, and other modern expressions of social class still play more of a role in the choice of spouses than most of us would wish to admit. And to this day, young men and women alike are mortified by their families in public situations, justified or unjustified.To fully appreciate Austen's sense of humor takes a bit of effort on the reader's part, but once acclimated to the language the hilarity of the book becomes apparent. Pride and Prejudice proves that classics need not be dull; Austen had a lively and sharp wit. If you are truly put off by the language, and don't get the humor, it's actually worthwhile to find a good production on video and rent it. The BBC version produced in the 1990's is long, but a very faithful and extremely well-cast adaptation that does an excellent job of translating Austen's humor onto the screen."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I love this novel. It has everything you could possibly want in a book. Love, hate, comedy, and more. Every time Lizzy and Mr. Darcy are in the same room you can expect some kind of comedy. Lizzy's bizarre family (not counting Jane) would drive any man away.If Mr. &amp; Mrs. Bennet were real I wouldn't be able to understand how he could possibly stay married to this rude and ill-mannered woman. But since they're only characters in a book I would have to say that they are a perfectly matched couple. Each one posseses what the other does not.If you can get past the old English that Jane Austen wrote in, this is a great read and a wonderful romantic comedy."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I always love reading about romance in England. Especially in the 17th &amp; 18th century. This book was no exception. Jane Austen dwells deep into human nature. How Elizabeth's pride is damaged, when Darcy refuses to dance with her &amp; becomes prejudiced against him by Mr. Wickham. How Darcy slowly finds himself falling in love with Elizabeth. All this is potrayed marvellously by Jane Austen. I loved it so much that I've read it about 5 times till now!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is Jane Austen's masterpiece and it deservedly bears this title. Pride and Prejudice is the perfect love story. It starts out with the Bennet family. Mr. Bennet has five daughters of marriagable age, and a wife who is in a hurry to marry them off. When rich Mr. Bingley moves to town, bringing his even-richer friend Mr. Darcy with him, Mrs. Bennet plans to have two of her daughters married within a matter of months. Things don't go quite as planned, though, when Elizabeth Bennet, the heroine of the story, meets the prideful Mr. Darcy. Elizabeth is unlike any other young woman of her time (except perhaps Jane Austen herself). Elizabeth is smart, sharp-tongued, and stubborn. When she meets Mr. Darcy she considers him to be the most disagreeable person she has ever met. But sometimes first impressions (which was fittingly the original title of the book) aren't always right, and the story unfolds from there.I was reluctant to read this book at first because I was afraid I wouldn't understand the language. It was a little difficult at first, but the more I read the more I got into the rhythm of the language and the more I understood. What inspired me to read the book was the new movie version starring Keira Knightley, which I loved. Watching the movie before I read the book made the book easier to understand. Not only did I love the story, but I loved the rich characters who brought life to musty, early 19th century England. Everyone in the story has more to their character than meets the eye, and that made all the characters more realistic. I also liked how the book was very decent. It was refreshing to read a book that didn't have any profanity or graphic scenes. For those who are easily bored, this may not be the book for you because it is rather lengthy and tends to drag in places. This book is probably more enjoyable for girls than for guys, but by no means does that make this novel a Harlequin Romance. All in all, I was very pleased with Pride and Prejudice, and I am glad I got over my own prejudice of old fashioned language enough to read this gem of a book."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Austen has become of the most renown authors around the world for her witty and classic characters. It doesn't suprise me that she is able to write such a wonderful novel as Pride & Prejudice.It is a story of a young woman named Elizabeth Bennet ,a.k.a. Lizzy, who has a great dislike for a handsome and rich man called Mr. Darcy. The story takes Elizabeth through twists and turns and some how she ends up in love with Mr. Darcy."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I've watched the movie a few times and read the book twice, and I'm still as excited as the first time I read it! The characters are awesome, and I feel my heart all aflutter just like Elizabeth's when she finds herself in love with Mr. Darcy....*sigh*.A classic that can really never go out of style."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I think Jane Austen wrote a very good novel. I liked the characters in the novel and the plot. My favorite character in the novel was Elizabeth Bennet. I liked how she acted towards all the other characters with her quick wittedness and her cleverness. She was a very honest person who rose above her class bound society. She holds to what she thinks and believes in. For example in Chapter 3 she has a disliking toward the Bingley sister's, while Jane finds them &quot;charming&quot; Elizabeth still holds her feelings of dislike towards them.Another character I enjoys throughout the book was Mr. Bennet. Mr. Bennet was the only man in a house of six women. The women wore him out and all of them were very difficult to deal with. He would always give me a good laugh throughout the whole book by his sarcastic humor. I like him also because he reminded me of Elizabeth because of their quick-wittedness and also they were the two closest in the family since they were the two smartest. I thought the two of them were most close in Chapter 13.I enjoyed the novel's plot because of the girls and how they turned men down of proposals and the different down falls and happiness of all the girls' love lives. All the girls have disappointments and confusion with the men and people they love; yet not all of their situations work out the way some of the girls had hoped. Elizabeth holds strong and but she will not promise anything against her own happiness. Throughout all of the confusion, Jane and Elizabeth are happily married at the end."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I was forced to read &quot;pride and prejudice&quot; for a high school english class...but i immediately fell in love with it...it has everything from love, humor, stereotypes, and anything else bundles into one heartfelt, lovely story. If you like anything dealing with romance, this book is a must read. I recommend it to people of all ages, races, genders because it truly emits a universal message!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I loved Austen's Pride and Prejudice. I have read it so much that the cover is worn. The BBC movie version was almost as great at the book and very very close to the accuracy of the book. I have read Emma and Persuasion and loved them both, though not as well as Pride and Prejudice. You'll want to buy it so that you have it to read again and again!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I wanted to read Jane Austen's Pride and Predjudice after a friend told me the book was so good. I bought a copy, and I can't say I was disappointed; this is a masterpiece. Austen did a really nice job talking about issues that you and I have trouble with--love, relationships, reputation, pride and prejudice of course--just to name a few. She did well tying in the love story with Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy with all the other characters--even the most frivolous of characters had their part in the story.I really liked the fact that Austen developed the characters/story line between Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwililam Darcy well. It is evident that the two were made for each other, but Elizabeth, after first bad impressions concerning Darcy and stories by Wickham, never noticed the true character of Darcy because of her predjudice (blindness) towards him. Darcy was just too full of himself until rejection by Elizabeth brings him back to his senses--not so proud now, are we? The roads to the happy ending were often bumpy, but Elizabeth and Darcy (along w/Bingley and Jane) arrived safe and sound, concluding the novel with a sweet ending. At times, the passages are really long/tedious, but in the end, it's worth it."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"The chapter that I liked the best was chapter one because it talks about the Bennet family and describes how the mom (Mrs. Bennet) is really desperate for her daughters to marry a wealthy man. The reason that I liked chapter one is because it gives a brief opening about the book. It was important for the daughters to marry a wealthy man because they wanted to have a better economic status and be exposed to a better society.The literary device that I appreciated more was comedy. Comedy is a story that ends with a happy resolution of the conflicts faced by the main character. In many comedies the conflict is provided when a young couple who wish to marry are blocked by adults.I recommend this book for people that like to read books and are interested in how people were in the 19th century.I like the book because it tells us how families were in the 19th century. The reason that this is important to me is because we could see and compare cultures back then and how we are now."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a love story between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, an uptight man who has too much pride. Their first impressions gave a big start to this story that developed into the major conflicts and story line. My favorite chapter was the first one because it sets the tone for the story. It gives us the setting and the introduction to the characters. We really get to see Mrs. Bennett as an excruciatingly loud mother who lives only to search for husbands for her daughters. We can see Mrs. Bennett favors Jane as her first priority for finding a husband because she is the eldest and most beautiful one of all. One instance is when Mrs. Bennett found out Mr. Darcy was moving into a neighboring house. When she found out he was single, she automatically suggested/recommended Jane as a potential future wife. In contrast we start to see and understand Mr. Bennett's attitude towards his wife's plea and towards his defense of his daughters. He doesn't critique his daughters when it comes to men.I would recommend this book mostly to women/girls between the ages of 17-50 because this story deals with the trouble girls go through and it deals with five girls living in the household, to which we can relate. The daughters were not that old, yet they were mature for their age. Teens will enjoy it because we all go through these teen stages of boys, and women can relate because of the maturity level that is in this story.One literary device that was used in the story was analogy. It is used to describe two characters (Elizabeth and Darcy) that are alike by comparing them. We are able to see their differences, but along with it their common interests start to show. For example, they both come from a different social background and yet are both intelligent, and have a tendency to judge harshly.Overall I can say that I liked this book, Pride and Prejudice, because it was an interesting story. Nowadays we read about homicide detectives and mysteries happening with murder, but this story is nothing like this. It builds its own suspense through character's personalities. It's based on feeling rather than action so we can all relate to this story psychologically. It captivates us in an imaginary world in the early 19th century that reminds us of their rules and regulations that were used back then. For example women were just expected to marry wealth and make a family. They played no other role whatsoever, so since we don't live in that type of environment anymore, we can just picture how life was back then and see what they went through, and their approach through these situations."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Chapter 12 is my favorite chapter because it talks about what happens around the lives of the family, like when Elizabeth is alone with her sister, and her mother is in another place. The appropriate age for this book is 15 years up because it has words that are difficult to pronounce and comprehend.The literacy device, which l most appreciate, is characteristic because it is the way to know more about the character. This book l like because it is well written and lets you know about how entailing affected the family in those days, which means the women could not inherit property only the male or brother of them. As a consequence the daughters marry someone they don't like so their husbands could inherit the property."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I am trying to read more classics because I never really paid attention to them in high school. I started reading this one and at first I was having a hard time getting into it, it is a bit slow. But by the second half of the book I couldn't put it down. Terrific love story, literature at its finest."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"There aren't too many books that I absolutely never get tired of reading, but this is definitely one of them. Fabulous characters and the perfect romance. Even though it's become a bit cliche with all of the take-offs on the market right now, I will always love this book."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I have always wanted to read this book and I am sad to say that I was spurred into reading it because I wanted to read \\"Pride and Prejudice and Zombies\\" and decided that to be fair to the humorous version of this book I should read the original.This was a very enjoyable book. It starts out a bit slow as Austen has to set up all the family relations. It takes a bit to keep all of the names thrown at you sorted out; it also takes a bit to get used to the manner of speaking used. There are many times when a characters is trying to say \\"no\\" but they take a whole paragraph of finely crafted language to do so.Despite the above; the language is clever and the story (after page 80 or so) is very engaging. I was actually surprised by how much I enjoyed it. The plot has a lot of surprises and mis-direction and much attention is paid to characterization.It is not a quick read, you really have to pay attention to what you read. But for those who like victorian stories, this story should hit the mark. In fact this story seems to be what all the more recently written victorian fictions I have read are striving to be. Definitely a good read if these kind of humorous victorian romances are your thing; this is the original.Although I don't think I will be reading a ton more Jane Austen; I did find this to be an enteraining book. I am also looking forward to reading the spoof on it \\"Pride and Prejudice and Zombies.\\""},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Of course Pride and Prejudice is fabulous in any form, but I do like this edition. Barnes and Noble Classics are hardcover with a nice dustjacket. Pages were a nice thickness, and what I especially liked, had that cool binding effect that makes it look like an older edition book where all the pages are different widths at the side."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Prior to reading Pride and Prejudice, I had seen excerpts designed to paint Jane Austen's writing as stuffy, obtuse, and generally boring. One joke says that Ms. Austen's novels are like active mysteries that engage the reader in trying to find the hidden verb in each sentence. But these criticisms are not only unfair, they're entirely inaccurate: just a few pages into Pride and Prejudice, Austen's writing style ceased being an obstacle to my enjoyment and began being a central part thereof. The manner in which she builds sentences and paragraphs is pure a delight to the modern reader, even 200 years after the fact.Austen's true accomplishment here is that she makes a novel in which \\"so little\\" happens, by modern standards at least, so darn interesting! As one critic put it, this is a 367-page story in which the central events are a man changing his manners and a lady changing her mind. But oh how the web of intrigue is weaved! The subtleties of character development and plot construction are never forced and always as natural as they are glorious. This truly is a literary triumph, and the first great novel that places women and their happiness at the center; that focuses on dialog and feelings more than swordplay and seafaring. Its interlocking characters are so rich and well-defined, unlike anything in the preceding novels onThe Well-Educated Mind's reading list. And even though the story ends up exactly as you know it will from Page 1, it's still all so satisfying!Is the book pretentious? Elitist? Maybe. But consider it a study of a particular class of people during a particular point in history. That's what it is. The heroine, with whom I agree with the author when she described her to be \\"as delightful a creature as ever appeared in print,\\" is bucking social conventions, but she can only do so much. She can't emancipate Woman in one fell swoop, nor is that her motivation. But Elizabeth's actions and this novel in general were one small step for Woman, at least, and an incredibly enjoyable read if nothing else. Five stars all the way!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This has to be one of my absolute favorite books of all time. I love the characters who are all written exceptionally well. I love the language and Austen's style. I love the book.I've read it 4 times including the first, which was less than a year ago. Despite that, I still dislike reading certain scenes in public because they have me laughing or smiling like an idiot. At one point, I was reading, and I had to shut the book grinning like an idiot to walk around a lose some of my pent up energy.Elizabeth Bennet is an intelligent character. But she has her flaws. She thinks highly of herself and her wit, and she forgets that even she can make a mistake. Jane is the kindest character in the book, and more gentle-hearted than anyone I know. But it works with her and I have no problems relating to her. Darcy is a proud, shy man who dislikes social situations. But he is caring, just, and thoughtful. Bingly is his exact opposite.I should probably stop describing the characters. But they are what make this book a classic. Jane Austen is a master of characterization. I can relate to them centuries later despite living in a completely different country and culture. Elizabeth and Darcy leave me grinning like an idiot and distracted for days after I am done reading the book. Obviously, it's why I'm posting this review nearly a week after I finished reading it for the fourth time in full!This is a must read for anyone who enjoys a good romance, and even those who don't."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This book is considered a classic for a reason. Some books just stand the test of time, and this is one of them. Jane Austen has an impecable manner of getting to the core of human (and especially women's) emotions. The focal point of this novel would be not to judge a person at first glace. Their true character may surprise you."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I read quite a but, but this book is undeniably my favorite. I first picked it up my junior year of high school, and while the first couple chapters failed to capture my interest I decided to keep reading. I am SO glad I did, after a while I could not put it down.This book has just about everything- satire, reflections on women in society and family, wit, humor, romance, irony, constantly twisting and turning with surprises... the list goes on. Most of all, it just has this inexplicable quality that keeps you enraptured throughout the whole read.I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"The author takes us through life in the 1800's and the lifestyles filled with chivalry and of course, pride and prejudice. It was initially difficult to comprehend due to the older style of English writing. However, once you sit with this book for a couple of chapters, it's easy to get the hang of it. It's a page turner. This is the ultimate original chick lit. Beautifully written, young, whimsical, and provocative. Will remain one of my all time favorites!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"After seeing a number of adaptations, I finally decided to read all ofAusten's novels. Northanger Abbey was not bad, and Sense and Sensibilityis excellent. However, this is the best so far. While there is a lot ofinsightful comment on the custom of English society of the time, anddiscussion of the character's motivation, the book just sparkles duringthe interchanges between them. While those between Elizabethand Mr. Darcy are justifiably famous, I would say that many of the othersare at the same level. My favorite are perhaps the interchanges betweenLady Catherine and Elizabeth. I am very much looking forward to readingthe remaining three completed novels."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"My mother has been trying to foist this book off on me for years, but I always resisted. I thought that the stodgy language, Victorian morality, and melodramatic romance would be tiresome and trite. I could not have been more wrong. I instantly fell in love with Elizabeth Bennett, the young heroine of this novel and the \\"prejudice\\" referred to in the book's title.Of course, the \\"pride\\" is the insufferable Mr. Darcy, who looks down upon Elizabeth, her four sisters and her ridiculously self-absorbed mother. However, what begins as outright animosity between Lizzie and Mr. Darcy blossoms into appreciation and finally true love. (I hope I didn't spoil the book for anyone, but if you didn't see the ending coming, you need to read more!)The language in this novel is terse, elegant and hilarious. Elizabeth can tell anyone off in such a way as to make the object of her wrath want to shrivel up and fall off the planet, all the while using beautiful language which contains not one bit of profanity. The characters in this story are also lovable and hilarious even with all their flaws: the narrow-minded and antagonistic Mrs. and Mr. Bennett, the cunning Mr. Wiccam, and my favorite of all characters--the youngest sister Lydia.The language contained in this novel is not an obstacle to reading it but is instead an absolute delight. If you have any sense of humor and romance whatsoever you will fall in love with these flawed characters and their absurd predicaments. Definitely a quick and enchanting read that made me laugh aloud!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austin, is a story of how a girl learns that the outward appearance can be deceiving. In this story many believe that a young man is quite awful. The two main characters, Elizabeth Bennet and Mr Darcy, end up effecting each others lives and changing their ways of seeing. Jane Austin's story truly tells a story with many turns in the road.With great surprises this book is not easy to put down. When things happen sometimes the least expected people are the ones who are helpful. I found this an enjoyable story with a few exceptions.Although I didn't really mind the style of writing it may be confusing to a reader. The reason is because of the style used when the book was written. In some parts it was easy to lose concentration, but it would grab my attention again.This was a wonderful story and perhaps one that would be best to read over and over. Not all people would enjoy this book. I found that it told a good story that gives the message to never judge a book by its cover.This book may be considered a love story. It truly told how being prejudice doesn't mean you are right about someone. The lesson learned in this book should be a lesson we all know about so maybe we can save ourselves from making the mistake of judging one another."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a classic love story. When I first decided to read it I had no idea that it would be such a good book. The love conflicts between the characters really make you think about how important getting to know someone is before you marry them. It also makes you realize how much your views on someone can change when you are forced to become close to them. After reading Jane Austin's Pride and Prejudice, I realize why it is considered to be a classic. You can imagine that you are Elizabeth, or you can imagine you are watching as Jane Bennet and Mr. Bingley fall in love. I recomend this book to people who would like to read a wonderful and emotionally stimulating novel."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is quite possibly the best book ever written. The plot is as real today as it was when it was written. The characters are strong and vivid. Its like stepping back in time to a place you've never been. If you enjoy the book, A&amp;E and the BBC made a wonderful mini-series adaptation of the story starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. Also for a more modern take on the same premise, read Bridget Jone's Diary by Helen Fielding."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Austen knew what she was talking about, way before a time were women had many rights. Her characters in this book are witty, charming, and well spoken. Her characters are well developed and the interaction between chacters are better then watching any movie, you are hooked from page one."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"You are going to read many a review of Austen's PRIDE & PREJUDICE [P&P;] wherein the author of said review will, with great superciliousness, state that this novel is NOT just a chick book, NOT just a piece of fluff, but instead a work of such great sociological importance that its message cannot be ignored. I'm here to tell you different. P&P; is most DEFINITELY a chick book, ...This isn't to say that P&P; has no value to its readers. Certainly it must or English instructors would stop putting \\"OPTIONAL: AUSTEN OR THUMBSCREWS' on their syllibi. But what IS its value? The great moral lessons it imparts? Its grave lessons in proper deportment? Of course not. P&P; retains its value simply in being a good read. This is perhaps the most finely crafted love story of all time. Without the aid of a tip sheet from Harlequin, Austen manages to hit all the high points of a typical romance [excepting the lamentable lack of a sex scene], & still provide enough social commentary & moral/ethical guidance that even the most unromantic among us cannot but be interested. It is in this manner that Austen has for years been able to fool Academia into believe that her work is anything but a sweet little love story, albeit a decidedly complex one.Novels are read for different reasons. Some novels are important, and they are knighted with the celebrated title of \\"literature\\", and though no one truly knows why, or what makes them good literature, there is the vague idea that such works much teach you something. That nebulous idea of imparting some great knowledge or insight into our existence is imperative-it's one of the 3 miracles needed for a work to achieve the saintly shroud of \\"literature.\\" Some novels are just ..., but are read by the masses on the sly, tucked into their laps as they ride public transportation; the half-dressed, windswept maiden & man or the bloody, dripping knife on the cover safely hidden from view. Austen's P&P; truly fits in neither of these categories, though its square peg can be stuffed into \\"literature's\\" round hole with little abrasion. It is simply an ESSENTIAL novel, a must read for every generation, owing to the fact that it is an excellent story. It doesn't have to teach us anything. It simply has to be entertaining, and PRIDE & PREJUDICE is, to the utmost degree."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a wonderful look at the customs of marriage, love, and financial and social status in Regency England. It's message, that love is more important than financial gain, and that first impressions aren't always the best to base attitudes on, still ring true centuries later."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I have been hooked on this book since I was 15 and read it for the first time. I have read it at least once a year since then and just hope for my Darcy to find me as well.The movie first got me interested in reading the book, but I must admit that I much prefer to read the book to watching the movie (although Colin Firth does have a lot to offer).

I have never had a problem seeing the Bennetts as my contemporaries. Anyone who reads this book will immediately recognize these characters and their situations.

It does differ from the movie in that Mr. Darcy really was haughty and prideful in the beginning instead of merely misunderstood, and Elizabeth Bennett was prejudiced, but both of course reconciled and became better people for each others' accusations. Also, there were a couple additional characters and some of the dialogue was switched between characters, which made more sense than even in the more recent version of the film.

Pride and Prejudice is by far my favourite novel and I love the movies too, but this kindle edition was killing me.What's with the caps lock where italics should be? I imagined everytime there was a caps Elizabeth would be screaming. It was just irritating.Also, there were a few errors here and there.I recommend buying the paperback or hardcover version of Pride and Prejudice if you really get annoyed by errors like I do, but overall it's still for free, and let's face it, Mr. Darcy in print is good no matter what."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"It was different reading this book which I must have read nearly 30 times..this is my first experience reading it via my kindle.

It's easy to see why this book has inspired so many other authors to draw from it and adapt the story to give it new spins... it's almost an archetypal \\"boy meets girl\\" story, including the wrinkles at the beginning that make them think they are all wrong for each other, when it's all just a matter of perception.Highly recommended, to anyone that reads!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Really enjoyed reading this book and would encourage others to read it.

I would reccomend this book highly!!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This is considered the Jane Austen masterpiece and is one of the most popular books of English literature and I can see why. Jane Austen paints a gorgeous picture of what life for a woman in 19th century England was like. Her characters are beautifully developed and the main character Elizabeth is how I would hope I would be if I lived in that era. Smart, a freethinker and not afraid to show little gumption.This is one book that I will read again and again throughout my lifetime. I can't recommend it enough."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I can understand why this is considered a classic of literature. I saw the movie first and then just read it. The story is more for women, I think, but I confess I got into the drama once Darcy and Elizabeth started interacting. I could have done without some (or all) of the sisters, but I guess they were an essential part of the novel to show what silly girls were like in those days."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I have always wanted to read the classics but never took the time. Having a Kindle has allowed me to read a LOT more than I used to, I carry it everywhere.

I dove into the book like I have never read before and cannot express in words the joy I felt when I was finished. It is by far the most wonderful book I have ever read and do not know how I have lived 47 years without having read it.There will NEVER be an author born the likes of Jane Austen. Give the gift of reading to all people you hold dear, it is a gift they will cherish forever!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is undoubtedly one of the most beloved classic novels in history -- it's had countless adaptations, sequels and homages lavished on it over the years.And Jane Austen's grand opus is still beloved for a good reason. While it's rather stuffily written much of the time, it has a vibrant core of witty dialogue and strong characters that shine like lanterns in the night -- and the best part of it is the interplay between the two strong-willed main characters, whose initial dislike of one another blossoms into love once they learn how to overcome his pride and her prejudice.The Bennett family is in an uproar when wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, and Mrs. Bennett is especially happy when he takes a liking to the eldest Bennett daughter Jane -- since their estate is entailed and there is no Mr. Bennett Jr., a good marriage is considered essential for at least one of the girls. But her forthright, independent sister Lizzie immediately butts heads with wealthy, aloof Mr. Darcy, who scorns the rural village and seems haughty about everything.A flurry of proposals, road trips and friendships happen over the course of the following months, with Lizzie fending off her slimy cousin Mr. Collins, and befriending the flirty, hunky Wickham, who claims to have been wronged by Darcy. Lizzie believes Wickham's account -- and she's in for a shock when Darcy unexpectedly proposes, and reveals what Wickham won't tell her about both of their past lives, and what Wickham did to offend Darcy.And finally things take a scandalous turn when Lizzie's idiotic younger sister Lydia elopes with Wickham, while staying with a friend in Brighton. The family is plunged into disgrace, which also wrecks any chances of a halfway decent marriage for the other daughters. The only one who can set things right is Darcy, who will do whatever he must to make amends to Lizzie -- and unwittingly establish himself as the man she loves as well...Reading \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a bit like watching someone embroider a piece of cloth with subtle, intricate designs. Lots of balls, dances, visits and drawing room banter between Lizzie and virtually everyone else, and interwoven with some rather opinions from Jane Austen about haughty aristocrats, marriages of security, entailment, and the whole idea of what an ideal woman has (intellect and strength).The only real problem: Jane Austen writes very much in the style of her literary era -- it's rather formal and stuffy much of the time, and the narrative is kept distant from the characters. So, not for casual readers.But despite that formality, Austen's brilliance as a writer is evident -- she slowly unfolds the plot one act at a time, with several intricate subplots that tie together and play off each other. She also wrote some unbelievably sharp-edged dialogue with plenty of witty banter between Lizzie and Darcy (\\"I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine\\"). But Austen also weaves in startlingly romantic moments between them (\\"No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think anything wanting\\").It's hard to imagine a better fictional couple than Lizzie and Darcy, despite their rocky start (a major-league snub at a dance). Both are witty, smart, and a bit snotty in their own ways, with quick minds and even quicker tongues. Darcy is a selfish, rather haughty man man who gradually becomes warm and kind, while Lizzie is strong, independent, and Darcy's equal in every way. And neither will marry for anything but true love.It also has a solid supporting cast: the painfully practical Charlotte Lucas, slimy clerics, virtuous-looking rakes, sisters ranging from saintly to snobby, and the lovable Mr. Bingley and perpetually optimistic Jane. Lizzie's family also adds plenty of color to the story, including the screechy and hilariously mercurial Mrs. Bennett and the barb-tongued Mr. Bennett (\\"Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do\\").Despite its mildly stuffy style, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the ultimate Jane Austen novel -- a powerful and romantic story about two people who grow and change because of love. An absolute must-read."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Kindle owners hopefully are aware of the wealth of free editions of the classics which are available through Feedbooks and other sources.I obtained a copy of P&P; from feedbooks originally and while it was easy to get and the price was right, the overall quality of the text is not great. I've found several typos, presumably the result of OCR errors and it's somewhat distracting.Since P&P; is one of my wife's favorite books, I was delighted to seePenguin had released an electronic edition for $0.50 complete with the usual footnotes, essays and maps that one's used tofinding in textbook editions of the classics.The table of contents is pretty minimal.

Just wonderful. You can get this \\"book\\" public domain, for free and get it on an ereader, but this version is formatted so well, and has so many extras about the author, the time in which she lived and habits of the day that it is worth the money.

I found this book in the library and just wanted to re-read it. Little did I know how much I would enjoy it!Like the editors, I love this book. Like them, I've watched the 1940's, A&E; and 2005 versions of \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" as well as the movie \\"Bride and Prejudice\\".The editors have put comments in the book which includes annecdotal info about the movies, the story/characters, the history, some religious themes, romance and their own loving commentary. It made reading the book kind of like reading it with a friend who loves the story too. In fact, at times I wished they had given more annotation. Examples of the annotation include information about the different carriages families travel in (comparing it to modern day cars).

The humor, the elegance of diction, the insolent, but addictive mother, Mr. Darcy and Lizzy's beset relationship, and the inteligences of the plot.I will read this book again, and again and again. Also,I prefer the A & E adaptation of the book(Double DVD). The version with KEIRA KNIGHTLY is o.K, but the former adaptation has actors that are more creditable as their characters."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is probably the most well-read book written by Jane Austen.The story revolves around the Bennet family that has five daughters, and a mother seeking to get them married to rich men. Elizabeth Bennet, the energetic and charming second daughter, is the main focus and heroine in the novel. She meets rich and stuck-up (or so she thinks) Mr. Darcy at a ball, starting a very interesting, and tumultuous relationship. Upon their first meeting Elizabeth and Darcy lets prejudice cloud their impression of each other. And later on, both were too prideful to correct the other's wrong assumption. Hence, the title Pride and Prejudice.This novel can be aptly considered a classic since readers have always been fascinated with the in and outs of the relationship between Elizabeth and Darcy. But other than the captivating story line, Austen also writes wonderful descriptions depicting the 19th century life of people in England. Even though her description without dialogue may seem long, her subtle humor makes it lively and interesting to read. Seeing its success, it is hard to imagine that Pride and Prejudice was rejected by publishers initially.Armchair Interviews says: If you have not read this book, you are missing out on a great novel."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is Jane Austen's most popular novel and it is remarkable that it has sustained such a high popularity 200 years after it was originally published. The primary plot of the story follows Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy in a highly contentious courtship that begins with mutual contempt but evolves quite unexpectedly for both into very different feelings. Subplots involve her sister Jane and Mr. Bingley in a courtship of their own as well as the romantic entanglements of various other sisters and friends. The story is a bit of a roller coaster ride with soaring hopes and crushing disappointment in store as events unfold. I won't reveal the ending for the handful of people who haven't read it but suffice to say that the novel concludes in a way that leaves the vast majority of readers well satisfied.Darcy and Elizabeth are complex and multi-layered characters who both grow and change somewhat as the book progresses. They are the heart and soul of the book and about as well fleshed out as any characters you are likely to see. The supporting characters, however, are considerably less deep and are more caricatures than anything else. Some are good and kind like Jane and Mr. Bingley, and others are ridiculous and vain like Mrs. Bennet but none are remotely as substantial as Darcy and Elizabeth. So, does this ruin the book? Hardly. These secondary characters offer a wealth of material for the author as she plays them off of Darcy and Elizabeth.This novel is almost certainly the one where Austen best displays her sharp-edged wit both through Elizabeth's dialogue and in the narrative voice describing some of these characters and their actions. If some of them were less ridiculous, the potential for the satire would be weakened considerably. And make no mistake, Pride and Prejudice is as much a satire of the time it was written, as it is a romantic drama. Even today, the prose is quite funny and enjoyable. The Enriched Classics edition is also nice because it includes footnotes explaining some of the language and/or references that were well known at the time but confusing today's readers.In summary, this is a great novel. Admittedly, there were times where I thought a character's behavior was a bit over-the-top but the overall story is so riveting and the book so compelling that I just can't find serious fault with it. Pride and Prejudice is deserving of its reputation and I highly recommend it to Austen fans and newcomers alike."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I'm sure there are a multitude reviews on the actual story of P&P;, to which, I'm sure, I can add very little. I will, therefore, just say that this is one of my favorite books. I read it several times a year. This is, without a doubt, one of the best novels ever written.I mostly wish to comment on this particular edition of the book (Robert Frederick Ltd.). I just bought it, today, at the local used book store. I already have another copy and decided that an illustrated edition would be a nice addition to my book collection.The hardback book is of fair quality. I'm not sure if this book originally came with a dust jacket or not, but this one doesn't have one. There is a picture of a man and woman, dressed in Regency period clothing, walking on a wooded path. I'm sure, if there is a dust jacket, the picture is probably the same.The spine is a bright pink color and the title on the cover is surrounded by a bright pink oval.Inside, the pages are made of good quality paper. There are black and white illustrations. They are well drawn. There is a picture placed above every chapter heading, either of a scene from the previous chapter or the forthcoming one. There are also pictures placed randomly throughout the book.I would say this book would make an excellent first copy for a young girl."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Great read!

I was even slightly dissapointed when I read Sense and Sensibility because it didn't come close to Pride and Prejudice. The well developed characters and plot and emotions of P&amp;P (as Austen refered to it)soar above her other novels. Although I did enjoy Emma and Northanger Abby quite well.However, I have read the Jane Austen Book Club, a new book, and I would just like to NOT recommened that book."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Austen has started to write this truly accurate novel before she reached the age of twenty-one. It is remarkable the way she brought off the mercenary and ignorance of the people-a common criticism of the 18th century.I can assure that those who have a taste for the classic and the romantic are going to have such a pleasant reading as I had.What I've found most interesting was the constant presence of an utterly charming, engaging and fast 'war of wits' among characters.It certainly has a great theme and we can still see its content applied in todays world. Pride and Prejudice was elegantly-written by Jane Austen and I can say that it was very worth it as well as inspiring to me reading this novel."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"It doesn't get better than Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. Whether you're the hopeless romantic or you just love the classics, you're going to love this book. Though I am only sixteen, I consider myself to be moderately well-read. I love reading, and, when I am between books, my life feels desolate and empty. One day, while in the most barren pit of ennui, I picked up Pride and Prejudice at my mother's recommendation. I do not ordinarily like my mother's taste in reading; her favorite books tend to be very dull, but so deep was my boredom that I succumbed to her suggestion. I wasn't displeased with what I found. I fell in love with the book at the first sentence. I brought my beloved book to the dinner table, to my classes and late into the night. I love everything about it. I love the characters; especially Elizabeth Bennet! I love the Victorian vernavular which works so well for this particular novel. I love the scintillating plot and the suspense created by knowing that Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy should be together but their pride and prejudice (hence the title) are temporarily keeping them apart. The language that the novel is written in might be a little more difficult to read than contemporary literature, but once one gets accustomed to it, it makes the novel even more pleasurable. I cannot imagine Elizabeth or Darcy or Bingley or any of the other characters speaking any less eloquently; it would ruin the whole experience! The flowery language completes the whole effect of reading a Jane Austen novel. If a disgruntled female reader put down Pride and Prejudice, pick it back up! I strongly suggest it because it may prove to be tedious at first but if read again, it would probably read more easily. I can offer no suggestions to the male reader, however, because generally this book, in ever essence, is a female novel. I am not saying that men would definetly not enjoy it; I'm simply saying that I have yet to meet any male who has not addressed this book in a very vehement manner. I simply love this book in its entirety, and I know it won't be too long before I pick it up again. Jane Austen surely knew what she was doing when she wrote this one! Her Pride and Prejudice will always have an honored spot on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I purchased this edition of Pride and Prejudice based on the assurance that the hard returns in the edition had been fixed. This is not the case - every sentence has a hard return - a large space or gap between it and the next sentence. It is quite annoying to read and I will be tossing it off my kindle and going with another version. My first kindle disappointment."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This book is precious to say the least. I'm reading Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice as if it's hot off the press in 19th Century England. It's easy to read as the words are not too small but your eyes still have to adjust a little at first. It has a lovely pink pattern all over the book, which makes it gorgeous, simply gorgeous. It fits very nicely into any medium size hand-bag, which makes it perfect for \\"on the bus\\" reading. Even if your not a reader, and your styling your room in a classic style - place it on a vanity table!! If you love classics, you will love and appreciate reading a classic in this little pocket book."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Austen did a wonderful job of keeping the reader interested (I read it in 5 days)and never lets the reader down at the end. The anticipation of seeing if Lizzy will end her 'prejudice' against Darcy will keep you glued to your Lazy Boy. Between the self absorbed Mrs. Bennett to the stupidity of Mary, and Lydia, Austen creates a fun chemistry A story where you can see your family in and want to give advice on every page. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"It took some adjusting to get used to the 19th Century writing style - authors were much more subtle then (and there were different societal norms). Once I did, I was richly rewarded with this tale of mistaken intentions. For those of you on the edge, take the time to appreciate the style, you wont regret it."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I hesitate to assign such titles but this is my favorite book of all time. Austen is so witty and subtle that each re-reading garners more laughs and more cringes as the Bennet family unconsciously embarasses themselves in polite society. Darcy is an ideal, a supremely satisfying hero for the headstrong, opinionated, and likeable Elizabeth. The A&E miniseries adaptation is also excellent (a nice excuse to curl up on the couch for several hours on a rainy day), as was, to my surprise, the later Keira Knightley version."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I often think Pride and Prejudice is mistaken as merely being a well written Mills and Boon romance novel-when in reality it is a penetrating social commentary on class, gender and human nature interspersed with Jane Austin's actualy quite cruel, barbed wit and humour. Every time you read this novel it renders a different interpretation and a myriad of observations. It is a bit sad that people sometimes dismiss this as chick lit and can't see past the frocks, ribbons and stately homes. However judging by the amount of reviews it is clearly well loved. Jane Austin is a genius of a writer her other novels are also very good, incorporating many issues of the time. Her humour, and wit is particularly stong in \\"Emma\\" and \\"Mansfield Park\\" studies many social issues of the time such as slavery, poverty and class."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I was supposed to read this in high school. Didn't happen.Then I was supposed to read it in college. Again, didn't happen.It's about a bunch of girls sitting around a drawing room, right? Probably noteworthy from a historical perspective, but what does it have to do with me, or with the 20th or 21st century?Everything, it turns out. And strangely enough, I should have seen that just from the title: this is about how pride and prejudice make us blind to the things under our noses. It is about how, in our closed mindedness, we sell others, and consequently ourselves, short. And it is about how we deny ourselves happiness in this asinine fashion.Notice that I don't say \\"this is about how Elizabeth, the heroine . . ..\\" Certainly Elizabeth is guilty of the sins that form the title of this book, but Austen cleverly allows us to make the same mistakes as Elizabeth does, and being human, we make them. Admittedly, we come around to the truth quicker than Elizabeth does, but I think that that only makes it more obvious what our mistakes have been. We sit, watching Elizabeth agonize over truth, wondering if this careful, intelligent, strong young woman will ever figure it out, and we reflect upon ourselves: where have we been proud? Where have we been prejudicial? Whom have we sold short, and what has been the result?So there is a moral, but equally important is that neither the story nor the author preaches to us. We are free to draw our own conclusions, though what those conclusions are is obvious, for most anyone with half of a brain.Of course, all of the good moral in the world is useless without a skeleton of prose, but how marvelous this prose is. I would say that the novel is worth reading for this prose alone, even without the moral, but the two are not even intertwined, they are the same: Austen's genius is to show us Elizabeth's life, and convince us that it is a mirror of our own life: 200 years later we're still making the same mistakes, celebrating the same victories, living the same lives, and it's always nice to read about ourselves.So yes, it's about a bunch of girls sitting around in a drawing room. And it has everything to do with the here and now.(A little aside, for those who wonder: how did I ever read this book? I read somewhere that Patrick O'Brian's (author of the Aubrey/Maturin books) favorite author was Jane Austen. Even more, I read that the comparison of his work that most pleased him was to Jane Austen's work, so I figured that there had to be something to this author, after all - and not just something from the point of view of high school literature class.)"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Such a great love story!

I felt so blessed and superior that I escaped sitting around mending bonnets all day, waiting to go on a walk- how boring and pathetic! Upon rereading this years later, I was able to let go of these old prejudices and more objectively view the characters in the situation they were in. That was when I realized Austen is a genius: I saw how much she understands and subtly, humorously conveys, and how little I'd understood before. Now I actually consider this to be a work of rationalist literature, in addition to a brilliant romantic comedy.In my previous reading, I thought that the only intelligent, reasonable character was Mr. Darcy, and that everyone else's problems was brought on by their own idiocy, of which their unjust hatred of the virtuous, blameless Mr. Darcy was only further evidence. This time around, I realized that he caused some of these problems himself. Mr. Darcy's arrogance caused problems he could've easily avoided by being slightly nicer. Instead, he prided himself in his bluntness and in his own virtuousness, thus causing people to resent him, because who likes someone who thinks he's better than you, even if he actually is? Similarly, Lizzy demonstrates all of our tendencies to like and be less questioning of information coming from someone who flatters us. This causes us to have errors in judgment and believe things we would otherwise be more critical of. Mr. Darcy shows an amazing ability to step outside personal biases and view things from other's perspectives- a rationalist romantic hero! Austen understood the female wish: a rich, moral, loyal man completely rational about all things, except for his irrational love for his weird woman."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Truly one of the best stories of all time.

I did not find the plot particularly interesting, nor the characters particularly engaging. Then why give it four stars?Because, dear readers, it is perfectly possible to not enjoy something and still hold a great deal of respect for it, and there are very few reviews that acknowledge this fact. Personally, I have never been particularly interested in domestic drama of the 19th century, but this is an important work, and should be read on that merit at least. Many readers seem to forget that at the time of writing, women did only have the choice to marry, and for an upper-class young lady, marrying a rich man was her only option. After all, she could not work, because there was a universal horror of being \\"in trade\\" (witness Mr. Darcy's extreme rudeness to Elizabeth having relatives who actually worked). Mrs. Bennett, shallow and stupid though she was, did have a legitimate reason to be worried, since the extremely sexist inheritance laws meant that she and her daughters were to be turned out of their home and onto the charity of relatives the moment her husband died. Small wonder that marrying each of them off was her only concern.Even if one can not enjoy the book, modern women can still look back with a thrill of horror over this idea of being birds in gilded cages - being essentially the property of their fathers and husbands, with nothing to do but stack up \\"accomplishments\\" (see Mary Bennett). Jane Austen recognized the whole thing as the barely disguised slave market it was and wrote biting criticisms, smuggled into stories about romance and marriage. And that is why, though I do not enjoy her subject matter or her writing style in particular, I hold the greatest regard for her as a writer and would recommend the book on technical merit and historical interest in the very least."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"What a wonderful book! This book was even better the 2nd time and now that I have brushed up on my P&P, I will hopefully be reading Mr. Darcy's Obsession next month. I love the book, \\"pride and prejudice\\" it's a wonderful story about a family in the 1700's and the classes of society. Reminds us how different things were. Has a Dramatic story with a beautiful classic love story intertwined. If I was to chose a modern day version of this book it would be Bridget Jones Diary, because she is in love with the man who is not who he seems to be, despises another man who she sees so wrong. Ends up falling in love with the man she thought of as a horrible man. What a great read. I also love my new book light! Target 9.99 was the best investment ever. I was surprised I was able to finish this book while we had company here, but with a few sleepless nights I breezed right through this book. I give this book 5 stars"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I have to start off by saying that the book description here is awful. Will sister Jane marry Mr. Bingley? Will the arrogant Lady Catherine de Burgh's intrigues be foiled? WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO SISTER LYDIA?Who cares?!Unfortunately, that's actually not that unfair a representation of the book's contents. I read it well over a decade ago, maybe just out of high school, and that would about sum up what I thought of it then. I thought I should give it another chance, though---and to be fair, there is a bit more substance (and style!) to the novel than that. It did take me a while to get into, though---it is rather dry for stretches, and nearly every character is not just unsympathetic, but almost intolerable. But by the end, I was very interested in the fate of Elizabeth, who was the only almost wholly likable character.Thematically, I have mixed feelings...on the one hand, it's nice that Elizabeth wants to marry out of affection, and not just for reasons of family, connections, wealth, etc. This comes out especially in her conversation with Lady de Burgh toward the end when the latter comes to exact her promise not to marry Mr. Darcy (which was the best part of the book). However, you still have to kind of wonder whether Elizabeth would have fallen in love with Mr. Darcy and wanted to marry him if he weren't quite so wealthy...when one of her sisters asks her when she started falling in love with him, she replies, \\"When I first saw the grounds at Pemberley!\\" (Mr. Darcy's estate), or something to that effect. She is joking, of course...but maybe not entirely.Also, I found it depressing how almost every other female character in the book made connections based primarily on those reasons of connections and such, or worse...Elizabeth's friend Charlotte accepts the proposal of a man she clearly doesn't love (just two days after he had proposed to Elizabeth) and who is utterly obnoxious, just to gain a bit of security; her sister Lydia is basically forced at the age of fifteen to marry the biggest scoundrel in the book, whose own consent to marry the girl is bought off him for an exorbitant blackmail bribe by Mr. Darcy (who does this for love of Elizabeth---how is this supposed to be a romantic gesture again, exactly?). Of course, I realize Austen did these things as foils to contrast with Elizabeth's own case, but to me it was still rather unpleasant and somewhat undercut the romance of the story.But the main storyline involving Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy is nice, and there is a lot of genuinely amusing wit in Austen's writing (particularly in the character of Mr. Bennett, who you have to wonder why he married the incredibly annoying Mrs. Bennett in the first place---Austen pretty much just chalks it up to a youthful mistake on his part). On the whole, worth reading once, or maybe twice if you were too young to appreciate it the first time around, but I doubt I'll be revisiting it again...at least not for another couple of decades!Three and a half stars."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I doubt I'm saying anything here that someone somewhere hasn't already said... but, here it goes! In my own opinion...Perhaps one of the best books ever written, Austen takes us into 19th century rural England, where a woman's primary duty was to marry and marry well, since inheritance was out of the question. This novel tells the classic story of the rich, eligible bachelor, Fitzwilliam Darcy, who could have anyone he wanted, and young, but outspoken and bold Elizabeth Bennet, the second eldest of five girls who's family lives fairly well but ranks rather low on the social class spectrum. Hence, it's expected that she would marry should she be offered a reasonable and comfortable home, regardless of how she feels.Elizabeth Bennet may be one of literature's best heroines. Her complex and genuine character, her honesty and courage to remain true to herself regardless of the situation, makes her a lovable heroine, and one that can be related to regardless of time period. And let's admit, she is just downright witty. Darcy, while mistakenly perceived as proud and arrogant, turns out to be one the most gentlemanly and courteous men, a kind soul and romantic heart once he lets down his guard and exposes his true self. His qualities are ones women still crave to find in men today.The characters, realistic and well-rounded, the accurate portrayal of 19th century British social life and setting, and Austen's superb writing creates a masterpiece full of romance, pride, social status, family values, and prejudice. This timeless romantic tale is one of the best love stories of all time, a true classic!

What I can say is this: this is probably my all-time favorite book and seems to be the same for countless others.Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy are the two main protagonists and are surrounded by the ill-matched Mr. and Mrs. Bennet, the fatuous Mr. Collins and his condescending patroness Lady Catherine de Bourgh and the unscrupulous George Wickham. As the story unfolds, there are twists and turns in the plot as the reader keeps wanting Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy to give up their own pride and prejudices about each other.A wonderful portrait of nineteenth century English society as well as an entertaining satire on Jane Austen's England. A must read."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Women in Regency England had few options in life except to marry well. They usually received little, if any, formal education, and their aim was to become \\"accomplished,\\" proficient in the social graces like music, needlework, sketching, whist and &quot;acceptable&quot; literature. Considerable pressure was placed on women to marry in order to obtain financial security, not just for themselves, but also for their immediate family. Love matches were rare. Ms. Austin writes, &quot;It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.\\" So there you have it. The men and women of the Regency period, nobility and emerging middle class alike, were very focused on the business of marriage.Our story opens in the small community of Longbourn, Hertfordshire. Word is out that the empty Netherfield Estate has been leased to a new occupant - a wealthy bachelor. Mothers and daughters suddenly upset their daily routine, and shatter the local tranquility - buying dress material, sewing, embroidering, planning and fantasizing about balls and marriage. Nowhere is there more excitement than at the Bennett home, where five very marriageable daughters anticipate news of their neighbor. The Bennett's have a particular reason for wishing their girls settled. The Bennett estate, Longbourn, is entailed. It can only be inherited by a male successor. Since the Bennett's have no son, their entire estate will go to Mr. Bennett's cousin. The girls must be married well, so they will have a secure home when their father dies. If their mother should outlive her spouse, they will have to provide for her also.There is a ball in honor of John Bingley, the new resident at Netherfield, and for the friends who accompany him. Bingley is very taken with Jane Bennett, the eldest daughter, and a lovely young woman with a sweet disposition. The feelings are reciprocated and the two form an attachment. It is at this ball that Elizabeth Bennett, the family's second daughter, meets Bingley's friend, the aristocratic Fitzwilliam Darcy. Darcy, is much richer than Bingley. He is a handsome, intelligent man, and the Lord of Pemberly, a large, sumptuous estate in Derbyshire. Darcy, however, is the epitome of haughtiness when he arrives on the scene, and looks down his nose at the local yokels. Elizabeth Bennett, is quite different from most young women of the Regency Period. She had been encouraged to use and develop her strong intellect since childhood, and she has become quite literate, and enjoys fine books and literary conversation. She is bright, with a sharp wit, much more independent than her sisters, and very pretty. Darcy is attracted to her immediately, but snubs her unknowingly. She responds in kind, thinking him to be boorish and far too proud. Thus she is prejudiced against him from their first meeting.The novel is filled with Ms. Austin's humor and delightful characters, including: George Wickham, a handsome military officer who further prejudices Elizabeth against Darcy with tales from their mutual past; William Collins, a pompous clergyman, cousin to the Bennets, and probable heir to the family holdings; Charlotte Lucas, a young neighbor and dear friend to Elizabeth and Jane; and Lady Catherine De Bourgh, the quintessential aristocrat. Jane Austen weaves her plots and sub-plots with elegant prose and wit. Her clever use of irony, reveals her characters' charms and flaws. At one point, Mr. Darcy actually insists that Elizabeth is the proud one. It is pure pleasure to read her narrative and dialogue. And the characters are so believable that is difficult to remain disinterested in their lives and foibles.Mr Darcy learns more about Elizabeth with each chapter. He discovers her wit, intelligence and charm. She almost always spurns his awkward attempts to woo her. When she finally admits to herself how much she admires Darcy, he puts his foot in his mouth. He tries to tell Elizabeth of his deep feelings for her. However, he explains that his strong emotions go against his social background. He is prepared to marry someone of lower status, prepared to suffer hostility from his relations, and society in general, in order to be with her. All of this, sounds condescending to Elizabeth, and he infuriates her. It is as if Darcy is doing her a favor by loving her. He also tells her, honestly, that he has sabotaged the relationship between her sister Jane and his friend Bingley, because he fears Jane wants to marry Bungley for his money. So, once again, Elizabeth rejects him because of his pride.If the young couple would be able to understand and let go of their shallow pride and prejudice, a wonderful love and friendship could form and flourish. Elizabeth also exhibits her prejudice against her close friend, Charlotte, when she marries for convenience instead of love.Ms. Austin paints a vivid picture of various relationships, and the marriage mores of Regency England. She portrays the relationships of the senior Bennett's, of Charlotte and her new husband, and of young, frivolous Lydia Bennett who marries at fifteen. Ms. Austin stresses the necessity of compatibility in a marriage, since divorce is almost impossible. She demonstrates the various forms compatibility takes in her characters' relationships.This much beloved Jane Austin novel is one of my favorites. It reads like a dream and is difficult to put down. I can't recommend it highly enough. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"A novel I have read and re-read, and will continue to do so with great gusto - every time, falling hopefulessly in love with the characters all over again. It is by far, my favorite.Published in 1813 and premiered under the title First Impressions, Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" stands as one of the most universally loved and admired novels of English literature. Not only is it a tale of rural romance, but also a witty and shrewdly observed satire of English country life.The story takes place in a remote Hertfordshire village, in George III's England. Mr. Bennett, a country squire of no great means, endeavors to marry off his five vivacious daughters. At the heart of all this all-consuming enterprise are his headstrong second daughter, Elizabeth Bennett and her aristocratic suitor Fitzwilliam Darcy - two lovers whose pride must be humbled and prejudices dissolved before the novel can come to it's splendid conclusion."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Someone once said that a classic work of literature is one which everyone loves to be able to acknowledge having read but which no one actually enjoys reading. To be fair, there is some justification in this sentiment, as many classic novels are not readily accessable to readers not versed in various literary devices, symbolism, and so on. Fortunately, Pride and Prejudice does NOT fall into that category. It is a novel which has an interesting, captivating story that is easily accessible and humorous yet intelligent, insightful and extremely witty--in short, it's a novel which is a joy to read and re-read. It is also my favourite Austen novel.Briefly, for those unfamiliar with the novel, the story concerns Miss Elizabeth Bennet, a spirited, quick-witted and intelligent (not to mention beautiful) young woman from a family of modest means, and the wealthy Mr. Darcy, a handsome but very reserved and indeed proud young man. Darcy falls in love with Elizabeth albeit against his will (for he deems her to be socially inferior and cannot abide her silly mother and sisters). Elizabeth (who displays a quickness to judge others based on appearances and \\"first impressions\\"), however, does not care for the arrogant, proud, ill-mannered Mr. Darcy. It is the tension between these two main characters that comprises the central story and gives it its spark. I won't say any more, for I don't wish to give the story away. Suffice it to say that although it takes place some 200 years ago, it is every bit as relevant today as it was then, for human nature is no different now than it ever was.Now to address the merits of this particular edition. (As reviews unfortunately are posted next to all editions, regardless of the one to which they may apply, the edition to which I refer is the hardcover Modern Library edition with the picture of Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle on the cover). Generally, when one is looking to purchase a hardcover of one of the classics it is because one is looking for an edition that will be a more permanent addition to his or her library--one that looks nice and that can, perhaps, be passed on to future generations. Personally, my first choice for hardcovers of the classics are those published by the Folio Society. Having said that, this edition has a lot to recommend it. Most importantly, it is printed on acid-free paper, so it will last without the pages turning brown (unlike those nice-looking but disappointingly cheap-quality bargain hardcovers one usually finds on the sale table in one's local bookstore).Secondly, the print is beautifully crisp and clear. The print is not as large as one might hope for in a hardcover, but it is a vast improvement over the cheap \\"mass market\\" type paperbacks. Actually, I was surprised to find that it's only minimally smaller than my Easton Press edition, although the lines are further apart in the latter edition (which does make a bit of a difference).As if that's not enough to recommend this edition, it has the added benefit of being housed in a very attractive dust jacket which looks beautiful alongside the BBC/A&E; video collection--the definitive dramatisation of the novel and definitely a must-see. (This edition was initially released as a companion to the video collection).In conclusion, I give 5 stars for the story, and I have no hesitation in giving 5 stars for the Modern Library edition of the novel--it's a lovely edition. Considering the quality, it is very well priced--definitely good value for one's money. And for those who've steered clear of the classics for fear that they must necessarily be dull and incomprehensible, give this novel a try--I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Austen is a literary genius. Her writing is full of delightful irony and witty dialogue. There are so many things that I love about this book that it is hard to know where to start. You have to love the characters of Elizabeth and Mr. Bennet they both have such a great sense of humor that they keep me laughing the whole way through. Elizabeth is such a feisty and intelligent character, and she is so full of energy and love of life that you cannot help but fall in love with her--I can definitely understand why Mr. Darcy falls in love with her despite her poor connections. I also surprisingly love the character of Mr. William Collins, who is so absurd and stupid that I cannot help but laugh myself silly over the things he does and says. His marriage proposal to Elizabeth is one of my most favorite events in the book. Another classic scene is Lady Catherine deBourgh's confrontation with Elizabeth over Mr. Darcy. She is another rather absurd character, and it is really great that Elizabeth has the tenacity to stand up for herself to that woman. There is only one thing in this book that really depresses me--the fate of Charlotte Lucas. As much as I love to laugh at Mr. Collins I would absolutely hate being married to him. I really feel sorry for Charlotte Lucas despite of the fact that she is able to arrange things so that she spends as little time in his company as possible. Also having to put up with Lady Catherine's constant lecturing and prying must also be hard. Despite this one semi-depressing aspect, this book really is as close to perfection as one can get. Another really good aspect of this book is the fact that in many ways it is a very accurate portrayal of what a woman's life was like in the early nineteenth century."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I particularly love the opening sentence of this novel -- \\"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.\\"Indeed this opening sentence has been claimed as the greatest in English literature. It certainly sums up the central concerns of the main female characters and the tensions of the novel in extremely short order.I wish the same could be said of the closing chapters of the novel, as they are in my opinion one of its major flaws, they tend to drag. The other that always strikes me when I reread this novel is how superior and full of pride seems the novels heroine, Elizabeth Bennet. For indeed the novel is well titled, it is full of characters who display both pride and prejudice.When we first see Darcy, our hero, he is described as a \\"fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien.\\" We also hear he has \\"ten thousand a year\\" -- more than enough to raise the avarice of those that might wish to marry for money. Not enough, however, for Elizabeth who clashes with Darcy who answers his snobbish indifference to her with angry pride.From this point we have a novel that unfolds as Elizabeth and Darcy go through far reaching assessments of themselves and thier social pride and prejudices. Through this they also gain different views of each other, dragging the reader along.Elizabeth Bennet was Austen's favourite of her own heroine's, it is not hard to see why. She is sharp witted, intelligent, reasonable and a thoroughly modern woman. Her attitude to Mr Collins is a perfect example, while he praises her \\"modesty\\" and \\"economy\\" she denies these and at the same time spurns the then middle class ideal of a woman as submissive and domestic. When she tells Lady Catherine that she could certainly marry Darcy as \\"he is a gentleman, and I am a gentleman's daughter\\" she is rejecting her attitude of class through social and family connections.The novel has all of Austen's typical strengths, good characterization, compelling plot, a sharp wit and a wonderful eye for the detail of the life of English rural gentry. This novel and \\"Emma\\" compete as the favourite among readers (I'm an \\"Emma\\" fan myself) while it competes with \\"Mansfield Park:\\" among critics as her best work.When you're deciding which edition to buy I would recommend the &quot;Penguin Classics&quot; edition for Vivien Jones' excellent introduction (which should be read after the novel unless you already know the entire plot from a previous read or a movie.)"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"THIS IS A WONDERFUL LOVE STORY THAT HAS EVER BEEN WRITTEN.

The margins are tiny and the text is packed onto every page, making the book only 253 long, hard to read pages (when properly set it should be at least 350 pages). Yes to Jane Austen, no to Tribeca Books, who basically are just ripping off a public domain book and typesetting it horribly.

And then resolve to read more than two and check out her other novels, because they are great as well.The A&E; miniseries for P&P; is outstanding and comes highly recommended.No, I don't own stock in A&E; but I am over the age of 13... in a few weeks."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (originally titled \\"First Impressions\\") is a witty, smart, sharp, and insightful comedy/romance of the 18th century. The plot, centering around the playful, but sensible, Elizabeth Bennet and the grave, haughty Mr. Darcy is dellightful, as they both learn to overcome their pride, artificial sensibilites, prejudice against eachother, and the economic and social differences of the time. The language is not hard to understand, unless you are completely unnacustomed to good, well-written fiction. The dignified and often unwilling chemistry between the two protaganists is spellbinding, and the humour sharp and astute. The lesser characters provide much of the humour, from sheer stupidity, sarcasm, and blatant ignorance of what is sensible or dignified. This book is for any age (I read it at 12 years old and enjoyed it) and the enjoyment in it increases after several readings. I hightly recommend it as one of the most well-developed, well-written, and amusing books I have ever read.Also, if you like the book, I suggest buying or renting the A&B; mini-series, Pride and Pejudice starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. If you read the book, watch the movie, and read the book again, it is even more enjoyable in my opinion than reading it without having watched the series."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This is a wonderful and timeless classic.

Just think of how many stories you've read or seen that have the two main characters disliking each other, bickering and finally realizing that they love each other. If you just can't get enough of Pride and Prejudice, I suggest reading Pamela Aidan's series which tells the same story from Darcy's point of view."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"The main plot of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" by Jane Austen is about the relationships of people and the misperceptions we sometimes make on them.

She resides in the country with her family; her obsessive mother, quiet spoken father, and her four other sisters, her elder and loving Jane, sentimental Mary, and the two flirtatious Kitty and Lydia. When a prosperous man named Mr. Bingley arrives near the Bennets, Mrs. Bennet's first idea is that Jane shall marry Mr. Bingley. At the ball which he first makes his appearance, he brings along his friend Mr. Darcy, a man who is even richer than Mr. Bingley. It is soon discovered that Mr. Darcy has somewhat of a prideful air about him, and after saying an offensive statement about Elizabeth, she is prejudiced against him. The book goes on to show how Elizabeth and Darcy grow closer to each other, from her finding out about his past to him helping her family out when Lydia elopes with an officer in the military. The ending is probably no surprise to anyone, but the way the book progresses is so fascinating that you want to keep reading it to find out how everything will turn out.My personal thoughts on the book are thus; the characters are very involving, as is the plot. The choice of words and dialogue are a bit hard to comprehend, but that's how people spoke in the 18th century. The book is more enjoyable than the movie adaptations I've seen, although the A&E; version was great in my opinion. I think the way Jane Austen was able to capture each character's feelings and actions as she did in the book is so fascinating; mainly because she did that by observing all the people in the countryside she resided in. Personally, my favorite characters so far are Darcy and Elizabeth, the latter being a close second. I just feel I relate to both of them well in the way that I speak my mind and am misunderstood at times. I believe people interested in the behaviours and relationships of people during a certain time period would best like this book. Compared to books written today, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is totally different. It has small humour, an interesting plot with many sub-plots, and great characters where there is a type assured for anyone."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I have read this famous Jane Austen's classic when I was a kid. I remembered I loved it so much and it remained as my favorite for a long time. This second time is even better! Can't say enough how I enjoyed reading it. The conversations between characters are so vivid, and the stoy flows so smoothly on. It was such a pleasant journey and I can't stop reading until I finished."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I must say I am not overly taken to reading romantic novels but I made an exception in this case.It was singularly refreshing to read about a female heroine, especially one as well developed as Elizabeth, written at a time when women were seen as nothing more than a means to wealth or progeny through the institution of marriage.We see in this novel the undercurrents of societal bias and the expectations put on women to marry in light of their limited role in society at the time. The novel comments on a wide variety of marital arrangements ranging from those of pure convenience to those based on love each with amusing consequences.In reading this one is rewarded with a wide variety of well developed characters written by an author who has an eerie command of the english language.I was so impressed with the attention to detail and psychological commentary ( hence the title pride and prejudice ) that I have resolved to read the other 5 novels written by Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"When I opened up my copy of Pride and Prejudice, I didn't know what to expect. I had heard from my friend that it was good, but I really didn't trust her taste. I am forever thankful to her.Elizabeth Bennet, a young woman in a middle class society, and her sisters must marry in order to be guaranteed a comfortable life. When Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy (two upper class men) come into town, Mrs. Bennet is determined to make the men fall in love with her daughters. This leads to conflict, etc (sorry I don't want to give away too much!)I think the main reason why I love this book is that it is difficult to put down. Austen's witty characters bring to Merrytown, never knowing what is going to happen next. This book was, \\"Impossible to imagine; it was impossible not to long to know\\"(59)."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"The Bennet family has five unmarried daughters and when Charles Bingley, a rich bachelor, arrives at nearby Netherfield, Mrs. Bennet sets her sights on him as a prize catch. At a ball at Meryton everyone agrees they like the openhearted Mr. Bingley, who has developed an affection for the Bennet's oldest daughter, Jane, but they find his friend Fitzwilliam Darcy to be an arrogant and disdainful fellow. For their part, Mr. Darcy and Bingley's sisters are repelled by the Bennet's lower status and the embarrassing Mrs. Bennet. At the ball, Elizabeth Bennet, the second oldest daughter, overhears Darcy the man say she is not handsome enough to prove a temptation to him. However, when Jane becomes ill on a visit to Netherfield, Lizzy arrives to nurse her sister. Mr. Darcy is impressed with her lively mind, but cannot see himself falling in love with someone from a poorer family.The Bennet's estate at Longbourn is entailed to Mr. Collins, a clergyman who is Mr. Bennet's nearest male relative. In search of a bride, Collins arrives to consider the Bennet daughters while prattling on about his patron, Lady Catherine de Bourgh. Meanwhile, Elizabeth becomes infatuated with George Wickham, a handsome and charming militia officer, who has apparently suffered great personal wrong at the hands of Mr. Darcy. Elizabeth now considers Darcy to be not only proud, but cruel, and she is only to happy to have her own prejudice against him confirmed by Wickham. Bingley is removed to London, where his sisters and Darcy can keep him away from a heartbroken Jane and when Elizabeth refuses Mr. Collins's proposal of marriage, he is accepted by Charlotte Lucas, Elizabeth's best friend, who sees it as a calculated move of social advancement. Even more shocking, Elizabeth receives a second proposal from Mr. Darcy, who speaks disdainfully of her family and ruefully admits he has been unable to conquer his imprudent affection for her. Of course, Elizabeth rejects this insulting proposal as well. But then she begins to learns things that call Wickham's character into serious question, and have her rethinking her low opinion of Mr. Darcy.&quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; is probably the most popular of Jane Austen's novels, with its emphasis on character and her comic look at the human condition where considerations of class are ultimately no match for true love and a temperant meeting of similar minds. Certainly we can point to more important novels in the history of Western Literature, but we would be hard pressed to find as important a novelist as Jane Austen, with her rejection of the tenets of Romanticism. Whereas the romantics celebrated the power of emotions, Austen's work embodies a strong belief in rational thinking, which finds no better embodiment than in the character of Elizabeth Bennet. The selection of this as the one Jane Austen novel to read if for some silly reason you decide only to read one in your entire life would be justified on that character more than the plot line."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This will certainly be a classic forever. In this book, she proves how well she can manage a story almost entirely on pure dialogue, for she isnt that very descriptive about her characters or the places they inhabit- she sticks to the basics- but wonderfully constructs all the dialogues throughout the story. Not only are the dialogues very well elaborated and the ones that keep you reading, but in them she very subtly gives a critique about society - reflecting, most probably, her own opinions about her own time and the way society worked. A good critique of her own era.And what to mention of the story itself!!! The dislike between Darcy and Elizabeth , Jane's impossible love for Bingley, Bingley's horrid sisters... she keeps you turning page after page!In any angle that you analyse it, you'll find it to be an excellent book!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This is the first novel of Jane Austen that I've read, and I began here because it is such an often quoted novel....and I wasn't disappointed. Granted, I am forty years old....most begin reading JA when they are girls, but I am happy to say that my advanced age did not spoil my enjoyment of the novel.Jane Austen is a superb storyteller with a wonderful sense of humor and insight into the social conventions of her era and the timeless and often humorous relations between men and women.By the time I finished the last page and saw Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy happily married, I sighed and then immediately picked up another Jane Austen novel to read....and intend to continue doing so until I've read all of her novels and hopefully the biography by Carol Shields.Other reviewers will tell you more about the plot....I want to convey the enjoyment you will recieve by reading Jane Austen. Yes there are happy endings....but there is also a lively social satire, conveyed through dialogue and narration, and writing that is beautifully crafted into plots that keep you turning the pages. So start with Pride and Prejudice....and begin a life-long love affair with a great author."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I sent my niece this book as a primer for the Jane Austen world. It is easy to read and understand, with a great type face. I recommened it for readers eager to immerse themselves in a simpler yet more complex time."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I've read Pride and Prejudice nearly every year for a decade and I have to say the Penguin Classics new clothbound edition is the best read I've had yet! The look and feel of the book is beautiful. It's an extremely gratifying read, a delight for the senses, and the appendix is a wonderful essay by Tony Tanner, the original Penguin Classics edition's introduction. While it is lengthy, it actually doesn't get tedious at all and is highly informative and insightful. The new introduction, while I haven't read it fully yet, I believe will prove to be equally revealing. The notes are well-balanced, neither vague nor overwhelming- I've looked at annotated versions of Pride and Prejudice that sucked all the joy out of the story with notes that covered half of each page! Anyway, this edition is absolutely delightful, and I can't wait to purchase Wuthering Heights and Sense and Sensibility in the same edition, and possibly more."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"A treasure of a read. I certainly had some negative precognitions regarding this book but slowly these were eroded as were Elizabeth's sentiments and towards the end I was happy with the characters."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I re-read this book, at least once a year! i just love how Jane Austin gave true strength and a mind to women in an era where we believed to only be good to have children, she made us so much more. I truly enjoy Elizabeth and Mr.Darcy go in circles about each other, as well as the the girls mother uncanny view on life. A great classic to read over and over."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Really enjoyed reading P&P by Jane Austen. The dialogue was relatively easy to follow except for the occasional English coloquialisms and the characters were superbly fleshed out. Her social commentary regarding gender roles was definitely ahead of its time. Did find some text discrepancies/typos(they could have occured during the download, I'm not really sure?)but most enjoyable reading nevertheless.

She makes the words \\"good book\\" into flesh and blood. This is prime Jane Austen, complete with dry humor and convoluted relationships. The book itself is ok. I bought it from Amazon because I was close to the $25 free shipping rate. But a used Pride and Prejudice anywhere would be fine, as the gems are inside the book, and reading them is the whole point."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I have read Pride and Prejudice several times. I think that this is most definitely one of the best novels written in the English language. Jane Austen explores the relationships between different sets of people. At the age of 16, I was never really into the \\"Classic novels\\", but when a friend recommended the book, and I saw the movie (which does not do the novel justice), I decided to try. I instantly fell in love with the characters and Jane Austen's works. Elizabeth Bennet is truly an inspiring character as the story is told through her, and her interaction with other characters clearly shows Jane Austen's view on all kinds of love.

When I was younger I found her books to be too sugary for my taste but now I find her work to be very enjoyable. Perhaps it comes with age :-).

I would recommend for anyone to read this book. Jane Austen was an amazing writer."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This is a classic, a favorite among my family and peers and a story that never gets old. In a time when being proper was taught, and social standing was what you were born into somehow true love sometimes prevails. Jane Austen, although never married, can write with the soul of a true romantic. She uses wit and twists on what was considered &#34;normal&#34; in her time period and made a masterpiece that lives on through the ages.This is a love story about a girl named Elizabeth Bennet, who lives in a less than grand social stature with her sisters, her father, and her outspoken mother. She is witty, lovable and in a word headstrong. Although she does not realize it, the love of her life, Mr. Darcy is fighting with his own sense of propriety and moral guidelines to put a halt to the love he feels for this young woman.Engaging, with characters you love and in some cases cannot help but love to hate bring together a truly remarkable novel that will be hard to put down,"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"who doesn't love this book?

I read at night before bed... and there were some nights I stayed up until 4 reading."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"No piece of literature explores the turbulent journey of a young courtship better than Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. The novel centers around Mrs. Bennet's feverish efforts to marry off her five daughters to the wealthiest and most well-suited men as possible. Elizabeth Bennet, the protagonist of the story and the second eldest Bennet daughter is a truly genuine, captivating, and refreshing character. In the novel Elizabeth encounters the most horrible creature of a man named Mr. Darcy. His haughtiness is outweighed only by his pride. On the flipside, however, Darcy is extremely attractive and wealthy to boot. The odds are definitely against these two throughout the book-especially because of disapproving family members and some ill-timed, hurtful comments. The reader's biggest question throughout is, will it work out for these star-crossed lovers? Sharp, well-developed characters and a beautifully woven plot coincide resulting in nothing but greatness. The 19th century-clad and somewhat frilly language could be considered tedious to some readers, but I believe it completes the effect of the novel. Subtle, witty dialogue constantly adds intrigue and humor. This novel guides the reader through the ups and downs of a love story with wonderful class and style. To say Pride and Prejudice is a masterpiece and a great work of art would be an understatement."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"\\"I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.\\"When first hearing the title Pride and Prejudice written by Jane Austen one might think that it would be another dull romantic book written ages ago. When in reality, Pride and Prejudice is a book that I could say I have actually enjoyed so much that I have read it myself several times. Pride and Prejudice is the type of book that draws the reader in deeper with each chapter, giving you new characters and personalities to make the book so compelling.The book starts off with a family known as the Bennets who have five daughters all with intentions of marrying to a young man with good fortune, except for one. That one is Elizabeth Bennet who wants to marry for love or to retire an old maid. It causes a great stir when a young man of great fortune, Mr. Bingly, has just bought a large estate in Loungbourn. This brings high hopes for Mrs. Bennet who has intentions of one of her daughters to catch his eye and to marry him. With surprise and great excitement Mrs. Bennet later finds out through gossip that Mr. Bingly has a friend whom makes twice as much as Bingly, Mr. Darcy. Mr. Bingly very quickly notices the eldest daughter of the Bennets, Jane. Mr. Darcy on the contrary refuses to dance with Elizabeth at their first meeting. In return this shocks Elizabeth of how someone could be that proud and that sets her opinion of him very low. Elizabeth reassures herself that this opinion of him could never change, but what if she is mistaken?Throughout the book Jane Austen never lightens up or falls short of her humor. Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy have many amusing conversations about how she believes he is proud and how he believes she is prejudice. This classic book will always remain one of my favorite books with the distinctive way Jane Austen writes."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I read this book to meet page requirements for my sophomore English class. And in the months since have re-read it several times. This book tells the story of Elizabeth Bennet, or rather Elizabeth's mother's detemination to have all of her girls sutibly married off. At first I was a bit put off by this stereotypical image that the only place for women in the early ninteenth century was married and in the home, but the story was very sweet, and beautifuly written [if a bit wordy] with a perfect happy ending."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I recently found out about Jane Austen and I love her. She Has a great writing style and knows what it takes to make a good book. The clashes between Darcy and Elizabeth are pricless and add zing to the book.I wish she had written a sequel though. Looking forward to reading her other books!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride and Prejudice was originally written by Jane Austen in 1797, but it was not published until 16 years later. Jane Austen was born in 1775 in southwest England. She was born to a middle-class family, and her background greatly influenced her writing, which is evident in Pride and Prejudice.Pride and Prejudice is the story of Elizabeth Bennet and her family. Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth's mother, wants nothing more than for her five daughters to be married off to wealthy men as soon as possible. Lydia and Kitty, the two youngest daughters, like to flirt with the officers that are stationed in a nearby town. Mary is content to sit at home and read books. Jane, the oldest daughter, grows attached to Mr. Bingley, a wealthy, single man who recently moved to town. Elizabeth is a lively girl who always speaks what she feels. She begins to have a relationship with Mr. Darcy, Mr. Bingley's extremely wealthy friend. She denies a marriage proposal twice in the book, much to her mother's dismay.The title Pride and Prejudice is an example of some of the issues Jane Austen talks about throughout the novel. Most of the characters in this book show signs of pride and prejudice in their behavior. Characters in all classes have prejudices against each other. Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth are prime examples of the pride and prejudice that occurs during the novel. They both have a tendency to judge harshly, even against each other. Their pride keeps them from expressing their true feelings.This was an excellent book, and I recommend it to anyone looking to read a great classic. At first it seemed a little slow, but the book became more interesting as it went along and I truly enjoyed reading it. Though I don't normally enjoy such flowery language, it seemed to fit this story and the characters very well. Once I got used to the language of the book, I really got into it and it was fun to read. This book had interesting characters and a happy ending. I would definitely choose Pride and Prejudice as my favorite classic book."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I just started reading Jane Austen, and already I'm a life time fan. At times it can be a bit difficult to understand, only because of the old english used in that time. Besides that it is a wonderful story. It has it all, characters you will love and love to hate. I could not put it down, and when I was finished it was bitter sweet. I felt as if I knew these characters personally, and in me ending this book was like ending our friendship. That may sound silly but ask anyone who loves Jane Austen and they would agree... All of her books are beautiful and if you are serious about reading you will love it."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"If you haven't read the book Pride and Prejudice, it is one I would quickly recommend. I am at the moment reading classics and currently in the middle of reading most of Jane Austen's books. All her stories are delightful, but I can honestly say that this one is my favorite so far. It has a good and interesting storyline, as well as some very likable and some unlikable characters. You will quickly grow to like Elizabeth and her sister Jane, while their mother and younger sisters may annoy you to no end. All in all though it is a good book.For those of you who are not familiar with the story, it is the tale of Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy, who at the beginning of the book seem to be polar opposites, with the only thing in common being their great dislike for each other. The story also involves Elizabeth s sister Jane and Mr. Darcy s best friend Mr. Bingley, though Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy are by far the main characters. Besides having quite a bit of witty dialogue, it has a few surprising turn of events that seem to make the book even more interesting. At first like Elizabeth, you too may greatly dislike Mr. Darcy, but as the book goes on he tends to grow on you, and by the end of the book, you'll be firmly in love with both of them.A good lesson can be pulled from the book as well. Elizabeth jumped to conclusions and let some people prejudice her against Mr. Darcy, while at the beginning of the book Mr. Darcy was as proud and arrogant as could be. Which can teach that we need to be careful on judging other people, because the way they act and what we may hear about them may be entirely false. It s also a good illustration on how pride can really mess up your relationships with others.If you're interested in reading this book then go for it, and don't let the fact that it s quite a long book deter you. Take the book in strides. I know I usually read very fast, but at first I read it rather slowly and I honestly didn't really enjoy it until I got to section two of the book. So even if at first you don't like it, try to keep reading, it gets better as you go on. It really does! Don t let the fact that it's a classic, written in the early 1800s bother you either, broaden your horizons a bit and learn to appreciate classic literature- it's truly a delight. After all, they had to become famous classics for a reason! So enjoy your turn at Pride and Prejudice, I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Austen is undeniably important in the history of british culture and the central themes of this book fully justify her position, particularly the idea of female emancipation. That said great themes do not make interesting reads (e.g anything by Hegel). What makes this book is the writing, the prose is light and fast and you can't deny she has a sense of humour.

Since I had to read Sense and Sensibility for my college course, I went on to reading all of Austen's novels. I am currently on my last one; Persuasions. Pride and Prejudice is the most popular of Austen's novel, I think, and for good reason. The characters are funny and interesting, the plot is original, and the social satire of England in Austen's time is hugely enjoyable. Elizabeth Bennet, Austen's own favorite character, is a headstrong, affectionate girl who represents the \`prejudice' of the title. And Fitzwilliam Darcy (aka Mr. Darcy, but I like his name O_O) is the \`pride' and is filthy rich, arrogant and rude. It goes without saying that I fell in love with him at first sight (or first mention of him in the story). Mr. Darcy, Mr. Knightly and that hero from Northanger Abbey are the cutest heroes of all Austen's novels!!! (=^-^=) &lt;Purrrrr)Anyhoo, enough drooling. (Mentally slaps face-get your act together--!!)The characters of the novel, though the most colorful and animated, are also the least believable. They are larger than life, great for the story, but I don't see them as flesh and blood people. Mrs.Bennet, with her obsession for marrying her daughters is perfectly understandable, but her happiness even when one girl elopes with a good-for-nothing, and the way she won't understand her husband's complete disapproval is just mind-boggling. The stupid characters are soooo stupid, Elizabeth's father- even though he is very likeable- is actually a pretty bad father concerning his duties towards his daughters and fear for their welfare, though all that changes near the end.In any case, I loved the book, it was funny and highly enjoyable. I'm glad I read it. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in reading a classic, and even those who are not. If you don't mind quaint-sounding passages and writing that is sometimes a bit confusing, try out Jane Austen. Once you get the hang of the language you can really enjoy this great book!! Buy it now!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"i am fourteen years old. i am an avid reader. i read pride and prejudice when i was in 8th grade. i have now read it atleast 4 times. my friend had let me borrow her book telling me it was good. i just started reading for the heck of it. i finished it in a week, which is hard considering how much work i usually have. but, anyways, the book is excellent. elizabeth is the perfect heroine for any novel. she is witty, intellingent, kind, and pretty. she is the perfect female. mr. darcy is a man. proud yet sweet in his own way. they are perfect. mrs. bennet is a character of her own. lydia is amusing. the whole book is great. it has humor, romance, wit, and a great plot, all in one book. it isn't overly lengthy like many other jane austen novels. it is has more brevity than other novels. it is certainly sweet. it allows you to relate to characters in your own way. maybe it could be the siblings, suitors, parents, loves, or anything. but it definitely worth it. if you haven't read it you must. if you have read it and don't own it, you have to buy it. i have already read it 4 times, and i can't get tired of it. it is just a satisfying read."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Though I have heard much praise of Jane Austen, this is the first time I've actually sat down and read one of her books. I was impressed. Though the plot would seem shallow now (it centers around marriages); then that was central to most women's hopes and desires. Besides the plot, the characters are amusing and Elizabeth is finely drawn. She is very self-confidant and will not allow others to look down on her for her ill upbringing. I don't believe men would enjoy this book, because the male figure is not drawn very realistically. I seriously doubt that all men thought or talked about were marriage and love. Walter Raleigh phrased it correctly by saying that &quot;Austen's men wouldn't be allowed in any club in England!&quot;. I didn't find it to be at all boring, rather, a page-turner to see how everything was going to turn out (though in the end it became predictable). The formal language is confusing at times, but provides a bit more color with it's detail. Though many parts of the book are obviously contrived, and I feel as if Austen is trying a little too hard to invoke emotion within me, in many ways the book is ahead of it's time, and for that, it is commendable to be certain."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"PNP was a delight to read. I'm not a fan of Jane Austen. I was in fact, dismissive of her work as being too boring and feminist (though I insist that the two are not necessarily related!) which led me to pick up this novel to see for myself. For a story so well told, it's surprisingly well paced with little attention to insignificant details and events. I would have though Jane Austen novels spent page after page describing beautiful English scenery but it's feelings and relationships that are the focus of PNP. I can now understand why it's hugely popular with women; it reads like a very sophisticated soap opera. There are handsome young men and ladies, a dodgy character or two to make things interesting, and romantic entanglements aplenty. I quite enjoyed following the relationship of Elizabeth Bennet and the enigmatic Darcy. Things change a lot in 200 years, but not when it comes to love. The language could be hard for many to grasp, but that is my only reservation. Pride And Prejudice is a fine book and one I recommend to anyone."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Good book for females only.

They all hold up beautifully: gloriously pompous, spectacularly arrogant, continually conniving and of course proud and prejudiced. There is so much to enjoy: language, wit, style and plot all converge to create, to my way of thinking, the best novel of the 19th century.Academicians all seem to prefer Emma, some folks like Sense and Sensibility more. But for me, P&P; is a cut above. Call it what you will--a comic novel, a novel of manners--there is such energy and joy in Austen's humor and wit. Never censorious, even the most pompous and disagreeable have a reason for being--not really harmful, they just move the plot along to its terrific denouement.If it has been awhile since you have read it, give it another read. Not only will you not be disappointed--I think you will be continually amazed that two hundred years later, Pride and Prejudice still works its magic."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I absolutely loved this book!! Personally I am very picky about books. And in order to get on my favorites list it has to be exeptional. And trust me this book definatly was!! The story is told from the point of Elizabeth, who is the second oldest daughter of the Bennet family. She shows awsome analytical skills, but as the story continues you realize that there has been a prejudice made in the story. And you also realize how you, yourself got outsmarted &amp; realize you made a huge prejudice too. This story is happening in a setting of old England. Whith balls, &amp; horse drawn carriges &amp; the ladies only wear dresses. It is a wonderful story of romance &amp; life in general. But always very entertaining. I recommend this book to everyone!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"And the Penguin editions are always the nicest!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride and Prejudice takes place in a small village called Hertfordshire, around the late 18th century. The story is based on the Bennet family, which consists of a mother, a father, and five daughters. Mr. Bennet is a country squire who is not very wealthy. Mrs. Bennet is a house wife and her goal throughout the book is to marry her daughters off to wealthy gentlemen. The main plot of the story is molded around Jane Bennet and Elizabeth Bennet finding their husbands, through both 'trials and tribulations.' Jane marries the wealthy Mr. Bingley, and Elizabeth marries the handsome and wealthy Mr. Darcy.Jane Austin did a wonderful job of writing Pride and Prejudice. She wrote so that you could feel the love that Jane was feeling, and you could feel the hate that Elizabeth felt. She also wrote descriptively so you could imagine the storm that Jane went through, and you could see the gorgeous house that Mr. Bingley lived in. Whenever I read this book I wished I had admirers like Mr. Bingley. I must admit that while the book had a happy ending, it made me sad because I wanted to be in Jane and Elizabeth's shoes.When I think of classic books, I think of stuffy old libraries where stuffy old people go to read books that were written back when the dinosaurs roamed the earth. Reading this book made me realize that these old stuffy books are called classics for a reason.This book was not a boring read! I am the sort of person who loves to watch and read teen stories. You know, the stories where the guy and the girl meet each other and fall in love. Jane Austin did a great job of keeping my attention. Reading the book mixed up the same emotions as Freddie Prinze Jr. and Rachel Leigh Cook did in \\"She's All That.\\"Pride and Prejudice is a classic love story that everyone that believes in love should read. I believe that people of all ages could find it as emotional as many of the best love stories. Jane Austin wrote a real winner that every school, bookstore, and library should have a copy of."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"In the whole history of fiction, at least as known to me, there has never been an opening sentence that more fully encapsulated the entire novel than Austen's in this stunning work. And the succeeding paragraph adds the seasoning, the zest, introducing the setting, the key players, the theme more fully than most novels do in their hundreds of pages. I suggest that no civilized person can read these without a smile and a committment to finish the piece."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Of all of Austen's works, this is her most polished and important accomplishment. Pride and Prejudice masterfully blends excellent humor with a very strong social critique of many of the follies and vices of her times. Within its pages, the reader will find characters that are loveable, and characters that he will love to hate. The ending, while typical of a romance, is brought to its conclusion through the effects of a very tightly spun plot. This novel surpasses the high bar set by Fanny Burney's Evelina, and is a must read for any fan of Victorian literature, of any of fan of literature in general."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This book is about the Bennett family.

It is a very funny, interesting story and any reader has to give Jane Austen credit for satirical view of the world around her. But, come on. Great Literature? It is a fluff book that leads the reader to no great revelations about their life or enviroment. To me, a novel is only as great as the thoughts it provoked. My &quot;great thoughts&quot; coming out of the novel were only &quot;I'm glad Darcy and Elizabeth fell in love&quot; and &quot;Gee, I hate Lydia&quot;. Don't misunderstand me.

Thanks for the prompt delivery before Christmas."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen is a very romantic story about Elizabeth Bennet and Darcy and the pride and prejudices of the various characters in the novel.My favorite chapter is nineteen of volume three because everyone is happy. Elizabeth is married to Darcy and Jane is married to Mr. Bingley. Mrs. Bennet is happy because three of her daughters are married.Pride and Prejudice is appropriate for people 15 years and older because it is interesting and romantic. I would really recommend them to read the novel because they would really like the novel.One literary device that I appreciate was how Jane Austen uses the letters in the novel to advance the plot in the story. For example the letter from Darcy to Elizabeth told the reader that they might get married because now Elizabeth would know that Wickham was a liar. The way that she did that was when Darcy wrote to Elizabeth to tell her that Wickham was not saying the truth about him and that Wickham was a liar . Another example would be when Jane wrote to Elizabeth to tell her that Lydia had run away with Wickham. Lydia has to marry Wichham so that it wouldn't be a disgrace for the family.I like the novel because it makes us think about pride and prejudice against others, and about knowing people before we judge them. This novel is also very romantic for people who like romantic novels. I would recommend everyone to read it."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"\\"It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possesion of a good fortune must be in want of a wife,\\" or so begins PRIDE AND PREJUDICE by Jane Austen. PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is one of the most highly regarded classical novels of English literature. More than likely, throughout high school and college, you will read this book. PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is relatively short for a classic, only around 350 pages. It is a medium-difficulty reading though, as the dialouge is a bit hard to keep up with and the language can be a bit \\"sophisticated.\\"PRIDE AND PREJUDICE tells a tale of a tangled love story. The book centers around Elizabeth Bennent, the second oldest daughter of the Bennent family. Her eldest sister Jane falls for Bingley, a rich and polite gentlemen. Elizabeth meets Bingley's friend, Darcy, who is even richer but has horrible manners. When Bingley departs suddenly, Elizabeth finds out it was Darcy's doing. Elizabeth finds herself falling in love and hating Darcy at the same time. The novel concludes the love tales in a brilliant conclusion that makes everyone satisfied.PRIDE AND PREJUDICE isn't the most exciting novel, and it might be questioned why it is better than today's novels made by King, Grisham, or Sparks. It is because it is a classic, and that there is a multitude of messages in the novel. PRIDE AND PREJUDICE criticizes the social class system, as Austen also criticizes the marriage process which can be a non consensual process. The book is an excellent example of a satire. The book has lively characters, and about 70 percent of the book is the well thought dialouge.The book falls short of other classics though, i.e. A TALE OF TWO CITIES, OLIVER TWIST, CALL OF THE WILD, and a few others, but altogether a brilliant work."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I am ashamed to admit it, but, yes, I have been reading for over 25 years and this is the very first time that I have ever read Jane Austen. None of her novels were required in high school, no literature class that I took in college used any as a text, and I had never thought to pursue her for sheer entertainment. It is quite sad, actually, for I find Austen much more accessible than some of the classic that I did have to wade through, including Wuthering Heights and The Scarlet Letter. Austen has recently seen a resurgence in popularity, likely due to the recent BBC and Hollywood adaptations of her books, including the Emma Thompson vehicle Sense and Sensibility.Pride and Prejudice was Austen's second novel, following the success of Sense and Sensibility. Its original title was--and I'm not making this up a la Dave Barry--First Impressions. To my taste, this would have been a much more apt title, but it had been used by another author before Austen could get this book in print. The story is about the five Bennet sisters, who, while not orphaned or penniless, have few choices as to husbands because their father's estate is entailed on a male heir, and they have no brother. The father seems to have resigned them to their fate, but their mother wastes no opportunity to arrange a good match for her daughters. The two oldest--Jane and Elizabeth--are level-headed and quite understand the position that they are in, but the youngest three are flirtatious and giddy, a bad combination in winning society's eye. Disasters ensue when eligible bachelors Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy come to town, as well as the officers of the ---shire regiment.The reason First Impressions would have been a better title is that each character--not just the main two, Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy--is constantly assuming things about other characters based on their initial reception of them. Mr. Darcy, in the country, is too proud to dance with any of the young women because of his mistaken impression that they are all declasse; Elizabeth forms her prejudices about Mr. Darcy because of her first meeting with him and this dance snub. The townsfolk think the best of Mr. Wickham because his first impression on everyone is quite favorable. And on and on and on.Very interesting, but it goes on forever, as the characters can never be quite direct given the mores of the time. That does not mean that they can not be insulting, as a particularly vicious exchange between Lady Catherine and Elizabeth shows. I'm glad that I have now broken my Austen fast, but I think that I can wait awhile before digesting any more."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"The Bennet girls are having a problem with primogeniture. They feel that it isnt fair that the first male in the family gets to inherit the estate after Mr.Bennet has passed away. Since there are five girls and no men there cousin Mr.Collin's gets to inherit the estate. Mrs.Bennet takes it apon herself to find gossip on all the men in the town that are making a reasonable amout of money and hook them up with one of her daughters. This continues on thoughout the movie. Mrs.Bennet and all of the Bennet daughters get tangled up with all of the gossip and mishap,and this complicates everyones lives.Towards the middle of the movie one of the Bennet daughters(Jane) gets introduced to one of the wealthies men in the town, his name is Mr.Charles Bingley. Mr. Bingley has his eye set on her and they begin to like each other. Mr.Bingley's best friend Mr.Fitzwilliam Darcy also takes a liking for one on the Bennet daughters(lizzy). Mr.Darcy is hard headed and does not show his liking for lizzy at first. He is rude and does not show much respect for her, in lizzy's eyes. Mr.Darcy is jelous of something and tries to break Mr.Bingly and Jane up. This creates lizzy to have more dislike for Mr.Darcy.The actors that were chosen to play in this movie were very perfect. They understood and comprehended what they had to do and did the job quite perfectly. I really admired how well the plot and characters where chosen. The scene designers and director chose the perfect places to shot the movie. I liked how the two wealthies men's estates in Pemberly and Netherfield Park were placed. This made it seem very realistic. I would defintley recommend this movie to others. It kept you wondering thoughtout the whole movie whether or not Mr.Darcy and lizzy , and Mr.Bingly and jane were going to get together. I feel it was more a chick flick,but would also suggest it to males as well. It might teach them a thing or two on how to approace a woman, and make them feel wanted and loved dispite what others say.Throughout this movie &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; was a really wonderful message. I feel the message was not to give up hope and try to persue your dreams. If something was ment to be it will always work out at the end."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"My sister's been raving about this book for years. It's not until months ago did I have the guts to pick it up. It's been sitting in my mini-library since I got it too... Then my sister once again kept asking &quot;Have you read 'it' yet?&quot; So, to stop this question from coming up in every turn, I decided to read it. I honestly expected this book to bore me to death considering the author is from the late 17th century. What fun could a writer be of that time, huh? Oh not to mention, the author was unmarried. What does she know about romance, right? Well, I was mistaken. I enjoyed this book sooo much, I ordered the DVD movie of it. There was some &quot;slow&quot; moments in this book however, I think it's the over-description of everything. But once you got through that, the book flows with lots of humor and intensity. I liked Elizabeth from the start. Mr. Darcy was kindda hard to like in the beginning but as soon as the book progress, you would love him and would want him for your own :-) The Dialogue in this book was my favorite of all. Uppity, Humorous, Lyrical, Heart warmer and truly of its time.I have read more than 80 historical romance novels in this year alone and I honestly think most of the ideas and formulas (marriage mart) were derived from this book (did i dare say that?).

It all starts when Mr. Bingley, a rich man moved to town. His friend, Mr. Darcy, moves in with him. When they attended a ball they meet Elizabeth Bennet, a very prejudice woman, and the story changed drastically. Will they ever set aside there differences? Will they ever fall in love...?In this book the characters vary a great deal in their personalities. Elizabeth Bennet is the very prejudice character. She often will voice her opinion but she normally won't show her true feelings when she likes someone. Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy is very proud; partly because he is rich and partly because he is very argumentative. He, like Elizabeth, doesn't show his true feelings toward someone. Jane Bennet is the character that is always in a good mood and tries to see the silver lining of any problem. Mr. Bingley is a rich man who is good natured and is a very welcoming person. He has very good manners and is very gentleman like. All of theses characters make this a very unique, well thought-out book. The author, Jane Austen, makes this story believable because things that happen in this story are just like real life.The plot of this story was definitely the love and drama of life. It shows the tough spots you can have in life. An example of the main theme was when Mr. Darcy tells Elizabeth he loves her and his affection is denied by the young girl. This book shows how life isn't perfect. There is definitely going to be rough patches along the way. That is why this book is so great, is because it isn't a fairy tale where every thing is perfect. That is why we believe this book is such a wonderful classic.The main style of Pride and Prejudice is old English. The author,Jane Austen, made this very clear early on. Some of the things that happen during this book, because of the style, leaves great pictures in your head. Jane keeps you interested in this book by making believable when she uses real life situations. That is what makes this book a one of a kind story.We rated the book Pride and Prejudice around 4 stars. The old English language in this book is harder to understand and must be fully understood. The many humorous parts in this book help make it a classic. Jane Austen helps you connect to the women's point of view in the 1800's. The author did very well on this book by showing how to love and be loved. We would recommend this book to anyone who can understand the style of Pride and Prejudice. This book is not only for the women, but wonderful for men, because in our book circle we have four boys and they each enjoyed this book as much as the girls did. This book is truly a timeless classic that can be enjoyed by all."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"One of the only reason why I have read this book is because I had to pick a British Author to read about and then write a paper on. At first I didn't pick Jane Austin, I was unaware that she was British, then when my teacher passed out a list of authors I saw her name and automatically thought 'Pride and Prejudice' and I wanted to research Jane Austen. I first saw the movie when I was younger and I didn't understand it. Ever since then I have had an interest in it. When the newer movie came out with Keira Knightly came out, I wanted to go see it but ended up not going. I took this oppertunity to read the book. As I began to read this book, I had trouble understanding it. I am not good at the old English and by the end of the book, I still didn't fully understand it but I managed to get the full story. I did use Cliff Notes to help me understand each chapter because it didn't always make sense to me but after I read the summeries of each chapter I was able to understand the story.I found the story very romantic. I thought it unusual how Mr. Darcy acts in the beginning, by ignoring Elizabeth and saying rude comments about her then when she stays at the house for a couple of days because her sister is sick, he starts to like her. It is charming to read about a guy who like this girl so much that he'll do anything to get her. In my opinion that is one sign of true love. Elizabeth isn't too fond of Mr. Darcy because of what he said about her, but he goes on in the book to prove his love for her and in the end win her over. Mr. Darcy has to go throuhg Elizabeth liking Wickham, Mr. Collins proposing to her, being turned down by Elizabeth with his first marriage proposal, and the critism from other older women about not marrying Elizabeth. The book shows how much one guy can love a girl and make everything happen."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"One never gets tired of reading Pride and Prejudice. I cannot remember how many times I have read it, but each time I do I enjoy it more and more. Jane Austen's Books never cease to take you back to a time when people cared about good manners, and people were expected to behave politely. Of course, the emphasis placed on marrying based almost exclusively on material things shows us what a long way we have come in some respects, but how little we have changed in others. Ultimately, this story is one about the triumph of true love despite obstacles, and is timeless in that sense."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Austin was a fascinating author! Pride And Prejudice is by far one of her best novels. Her characters are so enduring and spontaneous. Every reader will not be able to help him or herself from falling in love with Elizabeth and her down to earth behavior. This is a romantic comedy as I see it for I found myself laughing at the humor and humiliation through out the whole novel. You don't have to love romantic novels to want to read this book. Pride And Prejudice is filled with the \\"Battle of Sexes\\" and the \\"Battles of the Richer and the Poorer!\\" You can be 13 or you can be 35 and you will still love the novel ever more. It is a story that has stood proudly against the tests of time and will continue to astonish its readers for years to come!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Written in the early XVIII Century, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is Jane Austen's most popular and loved novel - but not really her best. One of the first works she wrote, the novel is sometimes a little undercooked compared to her most complex works, like \\"Emma\\" and \\"Persuasion\\", however, it is still a joy to read. In this book, she created her most famous romantic hero in Mr Darcy, an unforgettable stubborn who makes a perfect match to Lizzie Bennet. They were meant for each other.The only problem is that they haven't figured it our. On the other hand, any reader can realize it from the first moment the couple meet. In other words, we do know how the book ends, so why do so many people keep reading, and rereading this novel? One reason is that Austen has created some very believable characters - and also very endearing. That's because they are very human. Lizzie and Mr Darcy have very wrong first impressions of each other when they met and that's why it takes so long for accepting their mutual love.In this sense, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a story about overcoming our prides and our prejudices acquire in the first impression, and changing one's mind. Both Lizzie and Mr Darcy realize before the end of the story they were made for each other - but the problem is that their wrong impressions lead them to make choices that become barriers to their love. The path they will have to follow in order to find the fully accomplishment of their mutual feelings is the strongest plot in the novel.At the same time, the reader is fed with details about class and courtship from the time the book was written. In Jane Austen's work, her characters are sometimes like small figurines that represent the whole world - or at least England. And the writer does it with charm and style. Her books are a document of a time, tackling its fashions, moral and behavior.Peguin Classics is probably the best edition, since it has many notes and an extensive introduction, dealing not only with Austen's works in general, but also with an detailed essay on this book. \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is one of those books that will be read forever, and should be read from people in different time of their lives. We find different approaches, and understanding as we grow older."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I love this book. I first read it when I was 16 and thought it was fantastic. Now, ten years later, it still remains my favorite book. I also love Austen's other novels."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"My wife is a Jane Austin fan so I gave this book to her for Christmas. We were teasing each other one night and as I lark I told her I would read it instead of the Star Wars and fantasy books that I usually read. So I actually did read it..... and strangely enough I loved it. This book is definitely geared towards women but there is more than enough substance that any man with any character would enjoy it as well.While you can tell that it was written nearly 200 years ago it's still easy to comprehend what's going on just like any modern day book. The characters are so rich and the twists and turns are so amazing that I just couldn't put it down. I really loved Elizabeth and her responses to people, especially to Lady Catherine near the end. It's amazing that Jane Austin was able to come up with all that witty dialogue. The conclusion for Elizabeth and Darcy and all the characters for that matter was just perfect. It's no wonder it's been a classic all these years.... it will be around for a long time still to come."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I am not one of Jane Austen's fans, not really. I love all kinds of books, but hers tend to bore me, with a glowing exception: \\"Pride and prejudice\\".I read \\"Pride and prejudice\\" (1813) more than 15 years ago, and I loved it immediately. I didn't have to read it for school, I just happened to buy it based on a whim. I didn't know who Jane Austen was, but I risked disappointment and tried a \\"new\\" author. Thankfully, I found a book that was well-written, but also thoroughly entertaining, engaging enough to catch the attention of a 12-year-old and keep it without difficulty.The plot is not overly complicated, and it tackles wonderfully themes such as relationships, love, class distinctions, and of course pride and prejudice, all from the point of view of what happened in 18th century England.The story begins in the small town where the Bennets live. Mrs. Bennet has five daughters, and her mission in life is marrying them off. Mr. Bennet is an intellectual, who often escapes to his library in search of silence and to avoid Mrs. Bennet's nonsense. The two more important daughters, from the point of view of the story, are probably the eldest, Jane (extremely beautiful and amiable) and the second, Elizabeth (witty but perhaps too proud).The dynamics of the town are changed when \\"a single man of large fortune\\", Mr. Bingley, arrives to Netherfield Park, an estate not far from town. Mr. Bingley comes with a friend, Mr. Darcy, and the Bennets meet both at a ball. While Mr. Bingley immediately caughts Jane's eye, and is considered nice by Elizabeth, Mr. Darcy has not such luck. By sheer chance, Elizabeth overhears him making a negative comment on her, something that hurts her pride and spurs her to consider him a hateful man. But will that change? And if so, how will that happen, given that Mr. Darcy is extremely conscious of his high social standing?Truth to be told, I liked the story, and the way in which Austen fleshed out the different characters through dialogues, instead of long winded descriptions. I also liked Elizabeth, and even though she was prone to mistakes, I preferred her to Jane, her extremely nice but too perfect sister. Moreover, I enjoyed reading about what sometimes happens to \\"hate at first sight\\" when time passes by, and how the main couple dealt with that, despite the fact that pride and prejudice made it difficult for them to really understand each other.Finally, I would like to highlight that I reread \\"Pride and prejudice\\" from time to time, and each time I am astonished by the amount of social criticism Jane Austen managed to include in what a first sight might have seemed an innocuous book. The author, who wrote \\"Pride and prejudice\\" in 1813, weaves in the story many themes that were relevant in 19th century England. Considerations of class are present throughout the book, and I think that the fact that Austen depicts so well their importance makes it easier for the modern reader to comprehend how constrictive they were. Austen also makes the attentive reader realize that the idea of marrying for love was a luxury very few women had then, as most had no other choice than to marry the first man that proposed. Elizabeth, who wanted to marry for love, was an exception rather than the rule.In my opinion, \\"Pride and prejudice\\" is the kind of book that never loses its charm, notwithstanding the age of the reader. All in all, I highly recommend this book as one that you will enjoy reading not only once, but many times. So, go for it :)Belen Alcat"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"When I first started reading Pride and Prejduice, I was 13 years old, and didn't understand it much.

I have read it many times, and love it more and more with each reading.Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy's journey to find each other was brilliant. The witty dialogue and the entertaining characters make this book quick and so much fun to read.Jane Austen does a brilliant job of portraying the 19th centuty woman's plight in Pride and Prejudice through Elizabeth and Jane Bennet. It was a time where women were only expected to do one thing in their life: marry and marry well. An outspoken and intelligent woman was looked down upon. A woman was not supposed to think, only to please the men in her life.Jane Austen was many years ahead of her time in portraying the unjust social restraints that women had to endure. Her books were the medium that she chose to express her feelings about the social situation of women.

One can learn a great deal about oneself by reading this book as it examines the complexities of human relationships and emotions still valid today, almost 200 years after it was written. Other priceless titles by Austen that rate a '10' are Emma and Mansfield Park. Don't miss them, you'll kick yourself if you do"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride and Prejudice isn't Jane Austen's most popular novel for nothing. The story, which is set in pre-Victorian rural England, is full of elegant wit and humor fit for all ages. Though its romantic themes are directed more towards women, men too can enjoy this tale of first impressions and first loves. Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is a classic love story that will hold you in its grip from the first page to the last.The story begins when a handsome bachelor named Charles Bingley and his friends move into the neighborhood where the main character, Elizabeth Bennet, lives with her four sisters. Elizabeth's older sister, Jane, and Mr. Bingley fall in love at first sight. What makes this novel so captivating is that Jane and Mr. Bingley are persuaded by others to bury their feelings for each other. Throughout the novel, the reader is kept guessing as to whether or not they will end up together.Elizabeth, meanwhile, attracts the attentions of Mr. Bingley's best friend, Mr. Darcy. However, her first impression of his arrogant demeanor forms a prejudice within her that prevents her from returning his admiration. Likewise, Mr. Darcy's pride makes it hard for him to reveal his feelings to her. As Amazon.com's editorial review on Pride and Prejudice claims, \\"The point is, you spend the whole book absolutely fixated on the critical question: will Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy hook up?\\" Although the plot is built to answer that question, it contains more than just 18th century romance to keep you interested.Conversation keeps the pages of this novel flying by. Whether you're listening to Mrs. Bennet grind on her daughters, or you're in the room at Netherfield hearing Caroline Bingley talk trash about Elizabeth, you will beg for more. You'll be somewhat satisfied to witness Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy duke it out, but you will not be able to stop until you find out what happens next.Pride and Prejudice is an essential classic for teen and adult readers alike. It explores the world of love, the dangers of preconceived notions, and the negative affects that self-gratification can have on relationships. Tyler C. Powell, who posted his review on Amazon.com, stated that through Pride and Prejudice, Jane Austen \\"has lived up to the hype surrounding her name.\\" I concur completely, and recommend reading this novel and others by the same author."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"It's a legendary and outstanding claasic but let's discuss not the novel itself but the book and it's quality.

To my surprise, I kept reading on. Usually when I read a book, I read a couple of pages then something came up. I never went back to finish the book. This book is different. The desire to know more about Elizabeth Bennet who was played by Kiera Knightly and Mr Darcy kept me going. During my lunch time at work, I read. At home, I would read until 3 or 4 am.

I admit that if I had been assigned this novel in high school or college, reading it would have been an ordeal and I would have cursed the teacher or professor all the way through. Maybe it's my relatively advanced age or the fact that I just saw the movie that caused my mind to open and made Pride and Prejudice difficult to put down and exhilarating to read. Besides the seemingly stilted language of the period, Austen leaves much, including emotions and dialogue, to the imagination. The former lessens more and more as the pages go by and the latter actually makes the story more sensual and exciting. I found myself rereading chapters for the sheer enjoyment of trying to get in the minds of Mr. Darcy, Lizzy, Jane, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Collins and all the others. The characters are unforgetable and I will revisit them from time to time during the rest of my life.

Egerton, Whitehall, and is a classic tale of love, hate, and heartbreak. Its realistic fiction genre makes this 360 (or so) page story able to relate to today. You can imagine some of the emotions throughout and although there are no illustrations, you can use your own mind to picture the story. The tale takes us on turns and elaborates on the drama in the lives of Elizabeth Bennet, Jane Bennet, and their romances with the men in the book. Jane Austin, who is a widely recognized author today, was not recognized much during her lifetime. She was born in 1775 and unfortunately passed away 1817 because of an illness. In that time she wrote many books, one being Pride and Prejudice. Her family was compassionate of her writings and took it into their own hands to try to get them published. Only a few managed to get published, however. During the 20th century Pride and Prejudice, and many of Austin's other works, finally became recognized and were seen as great novels by many readers. They were published and became best sellers among many companies. Pride and Prejudice is one of the most read books today by adolescents and adults of many ages. Many people enjoy this roller coaster tale and it's occasionally comical characters.The characters in Pride and Prejudice have very distinct personalities, which contribute to the ups and downs of the story. However, to truly understand the customs of the four main characters in this book, you must put yourself in the beginning of 1800's, during the Napoleonic Wars (1797-1815), in the town of Hertfordshire. The setting explains the way in which the characters act. The characters personalities make for many moods; including love, hate, passion, loss, and urgency. The main character is Elizabeth Bennet and she is also the narrator of the story. She is the second eldest of the Bennet daughters and her smart, quick wit sometimes makes her perceive people too quickly. Elizabeth occasionally fails to dig deep into a person's true story and she keeps her guard up at first impressions. Jane Bennet is the eldest of the Bennet daughters and is known to be the most beautiful. She is pressured throughout the story to marry soon because of her age and her relationship with Mr. Bingley shapes the book. Mr. Charles Bingley is a young man of wealth and looks, who comes to Hertfordshire. He owns the Netherfield estate and when he meets Jane he falls in love with her. The last main character is Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy. He owns the Pemberly estate and is seen throughout the story as a proud, judgmental man. Towards the end of the book these portrayals change and we find out Mr. Darcy's true character. Some other side characters include: Mr. and Mrs. Bennet, the other Bennet daughters, Mr. Darcy's sister, Mr. Bingley's sister, Mrs. De Bourgh, and Mr. Wickham. All the characters have elements that are special to their part in the book. They are all unique.The beginning of this love story starts out with the arrival of Mr. Charles Bingley, in the town of Longbourn. He moves into the Netherfield estate accompanied by his sister, Miss Caroline Bingley, and his friend, Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy. The Bennets, another family of Longbourn, hear this news and they set their hopes high that Mr. Charles Bingley will marry one of their daughters. Throughout the first few chapters, we see how attached Mr. Bingley becomes to Jane, who is the eldest of the Bennet daughters, and that Mr. Darcy, too, shows a strange attitude towards Elizabeth, the second eldest of the Bennet daughters. In the middle, the conflicts arise that shape the ending of the book. The Bingley residence surprisingly moves away to London and Jane is heartbroken. Elizabeth goes to visit her friend there, that summer, and although she does not see Mr. Bingley, she does have a few interactions with Mr. Darcy. Darcy's stubborn, selfish behavior unfolds at these points and we learn that he is actually in love with Elizabeth. Elizabeth does not feel equal love towards him because of her own stubbornness and failure to look at a person's true identity. Towards the end of the book, Elizabeth realizes how blind she had been about Mr. Darcy and begins to love him back, realizing that they are actually very similar in character. Mr. Darcy and Mr. Bingley come back to Longbourn and Mr. Bingley confesses that he still loves Jane. Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth reunite confessing their love as well. The rise and fall of the different emotions in the plot make for many exciting climaxes.Sometimes the difference between what your heart feels and what your brain thinks can make things confusing. That is what happens in Pride and Prejudice. A good theme for the book would be that you shouldn't judge a person or come to assumptions about them until you know their real story. Poor Elizabeth feels a roller coaster of emotions towards Mr. Darcy throughout the book, from love to hate, then back to love. She just doesn't understand why he acts the way he does. He's confusing to her. He acts as though he is very proud of himself in the beginning and he is not very kind to people who he doesn't know. Later he warms up to Elizabeth; however it may be a little late for him, since she has already established her feelings towards him. The turning point of the story, when we really see how the theme fits, is when Elizabeth goes to Pemberly while the thinks Mr. Darcy is away. She realizes that her feelings have changed because she knows his real story. She read Mr. Darcy's letter, which explained a lot, and she knows then why he acts the way he does. It begins to make sense to her. What Elizabeth originally thought about Mr. Darcy was all different now. She just needed to know the real him. The theme really makes for an exciting realization at the turning point of Pride and Prejudice.Have you ever been on a kiddie roller coaster, that had its ups and downs but those hills were really not exciting? That's how I felt about this book. It was slow moving at times and it never had an enormous climax. Rather, it had a few small ones, which were very predictable. While reading the book, I discovered that I felt as though Pride and Prejudice had a little too much description and narration, instead of dialogue. The lack of dialogue made it difficult to truly feel the characters emotions. I had a hard time putting myself in the characters shoes. The love story was not portrayed as very romantic because the characters never really connected on that level. Overall, I did not care for the book Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austin."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austin, who was born on December 16, 1775, is a classic novel that is loved by many because of its heroine, Elizabeth Bennet. The book was published in 1813, but Miss Austin actually intended it to be published in 1797, but sadly, it was rejected. Jane Austin has also published Sense and Sensibility, a story about two sisters with a meager amount of money, Mansfield Park, and many others. Although Miss Austin produced many great works, she had to leave the world sometime. She died in 1817 by a sudden illness. Even though Jane Austin died many years ago, her books are regarded as some of the best books ever written.In a town called Longbourn, sometime in the 19th century, Miss Elizabeth Bennet lives with her family, Mrs. Bennet, a foolish woman who only cares if her daughters marry, Mr. Bennet, a sensible man who runs the house, but is in an unhappy marriage, Mary, Caroline, Lydia, a snooty girl who only cares about herself, and her favorite sister, Jane, who is madly in love with Mr. Charles Bingley, a wealthy man who purchases Netherfield, his estate that is close to the Bennet's house. Elizabeth is a sensible young lady in her mid-twenties, but sometimes let her pride makes her think in prejudice ways because she likes to ponder on the character of others. Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy is one such person that Elizabeth believes has a bad character, although she doesn't know him very well. With so many characters about, sometimes it's hard to remember who is who, but after a while you get quite used to it.The main conflict in Pride and Prejudice is the feelings that Elizabeth has for Mr. Darcy. In the beginning of the story, she utterly hates him, but near the middle, she starts doubting her way she views character. Because of the interchanging turmoil in Elizabeth's heart, she isn't sure what to feel about Mr. Darcy. Another conflict is Mr. Bingley's feelings for Jane, who isn't even sure of his feelings for her. The plot pretty much centers around those two main conflicts. Although, there are many other mini conflicts that the plot focuses on also. One example would be Mr. Collin's conflict with Elizabeth. He wishes her to marry him, because he is supposed to take over the estate when Mr. Bennet dies. Mr. Bennet, a cautious and humorous man, is not so happy that his cousin is going to take over the estate. Even though this is how I perceived the book, I'm sure it's very close to what the critics say.When Mr. Darcy proposes to Elizabeth, the whole book starts getting more thought provoking. Will Elizabeth say yes? Or will she say no? Either way, there is more than just her answer. Why did she say what she said? Well, I guess you'll have to read to find out. While you are wrapping that around your head, let me tell you about the theme of the story. There are several themes in Pride and Prejudice but a main one is reputation. Reputation really matters in this book. Mrs. Bennet, with her obnoxious manners and comments, disgraced the family several times throughout the story. And when a certain someone runs away, the family is in danger of being condemned forever in disgrace. And while the Elizabeth endured all of this, the family hardly noted that any of this was occurring, maybe because they only care about getting their daughters married, since that would bring them money. Either way, reputation really matters in this book.All in all, I really didn't like this book because it was really boring. I know the book is a classic, but it made me go to sleep. The book is written beautifully, don't get me wrong. But it didn't keep my attention very well. Yes, I did finish it, and let's just say I could see the finish a mile away. While the beginning was slightly compelling, it just wasn't something I was willing to read. I had to forcefully work my way through this book. Elizabeth, who was an interesting person, made too many prejudices that it got on my nerve after a while. I will say though, that maybe if I tried harder, I could've eased into this book much better if I wasn't rushing to read it. On my scale of buy, borrow, or skip, I would say borrow, but only if you are really into classics."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"It took my third try to finally get through Pride and Prejudice. I'll start with the good: the writing is fantastic. I can't argue with that...I love the language. You can pretty much diss someone or compliment someone in so many different ways that I wish our language wasn't so abbreviated. In a few years we'll all be talking in acronyms at the rate we're going, but anyway, back to the story. I understand that women during that time really didn't have a place in society except to stay home and make babies...but what I couldn't stand from the book was that it was a bunch of people sitting around just talking or singing around a piano. It's a love story between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennett, but I really couldn't see the love. It was more infatuation or a little crush so the fact that they \\"SPOILER ALERT\\" got together in the end seemed so forced. I didn't even like Elizabeth because she had this holier than thou sort of attitude, but I guess that's just her pride and prejudice.

I am not a big fan of other period classics as such but there's something about Lizzy and Mr Darcy that get me every time."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"My mother used to read me a chapter a night of this book when I was about eight. I didn't get it. For reasons lost in the mists of history, I picked it up on my own in my 20s and found, to my delight, that I couldn't put it down. Since then, I have bought, read, and reread everything Austen ever wrote, and was a member of the Jane Austen Club back in the early '80s, loooong before she became so fashionable.What I've learned from my frequent readings of her works is that each time I read them, I get a little more than I did the last time. Her language appears convoluted to us, yes, partly because she wrote with the voice of her time and partly because we are probably like, you know, as inarticulate a people as ever lived. So do we denigrate Shakespeare or Chaucer for their voices?The themes of Austen's works are all similar - they all relate to the difficulties of women finding their own places in a rigidly structured society in which women were defined strictly by the men in their lives. In fact, when I visited her burial place in Winchester Cathedral, I was surprised to find a 6-foot marble slab fully engraved with a lengthy narrative about her, until I realized that there was NOT ONE WORD about her writing - she was described and defined strictly in relation to her father and family. So she definitely knew whereof she spoke; in her time, there was no life for a women outside of marriage, and the frantic attempts of parents - and the girls themselves - to marry off their daughters, which appears funny to us in our more enlightened age, is actually painful and somewhat pathetic. (Almost as pathetic as the efforts of many women today to find their own rich, indulgent Mr. Darcys... especially in light of their many other options.)One of the characteristics of Austen's writing that I find most interesting is that while she writes in great detail of the lives of her characters and their immediate surroundings, there is not one word about the greater world. I doubt that the word &quot;London&quot; appears in any of them except briefly in &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot;; they all take place in small villages somewhere in the middle or south of England, and rarely wander further than the distance of a post-lunch walk. The novels were written at the end of the Napoleonic era and the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, so there was plenty of upheaval, social and otherwise, occuring all over England and the Continent, but nary a whisper of it ever rears its ugly head in her works. She holds her magnifying glass very close to her own garden gate; her perspective is entirely microcosmic without being claustrophobic - that's part of her genius. She can turn over a rock and document the frantic scurrying underneath it in its own terms, drawing no inferences from the activity under the rest of the tree. Good? Bad? I don't know, and I think it doesn't matter - but there is probably not a better, more detailed, or more honest picture of time and place in all of English literature.I am torn between being glad that students are exposed to literature, and sorry that the teaching of it is so pedantic that all the humor and magic of great books is buried. I only hope, for those who were force-fed on Austen and others of her ilk, that they will pick up these works on their own later in life and derive from them the pleasure that is there for the asking. Meanwhile, I strongly recommend periodic infusions of all of Austen's works, of which I believe &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; is the most accessible."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I enjoyed this classic totally. I thought the way Jane Austen developed the characters personalities was incredible. I have reread it many times. I am amazed at how much an author can get across without the overuse of sex and violence (that we see way too much of today). I have also enjoyed her other works Emma and Sense and Sensibility. I have not read the others.I have found the Pride and Prejudice movie from A&E; with Collin Firth to be one of my favorite movies and I think is an excellent addition to have. The Annotated Pride and Prejudice is very helpful and enjoyable by David Shapard. The World of Her Novels by Deirdre Le Faye is also very helpful though at times seems a bit heavy. It gives you a real feel for the era and thus the settings of the book.A word of caution. When you enjoy something you don't want it to end. Of the countless spinoffs of the original I totally disliked one and am in the middle of another. Mr. Darcy takes a wife is unbelievable and totally devoid of character. Seems there are sex scenes on almost every page in the beginning. I grew disgusted. The account of things from Darcy's point of view by Pamela Aidan has been enjoyable. I am only half way thru the first book, however.The Annotated Pride and PrejudiceJane Austen: The World of Her NovelsMr. Darcy Takes a Wife: Pride and Prejudice ContinuesAn Assembly Such as This: A Novel of Fitzwilliam Darcy, Gentleman (Fitzwilliam Darcy Gentleman)"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"The \\"truth universally acknowledged\\" that begins Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is one of the best opening sentences in English literature; its irony, subtle and caustic, perfectly sets the tone for the novel, which is about the manners of courtship and the classist attitudes toward marriage in Regency England. The message Austen is conveying is that the rules of the marriage game are, at least to the propriety-conscious gentry, more interesting than the romance that leads to marriage.The novel's heroine is Elizabeth Bennet, the second, and the wittiest and liveliest, of five daughters in a middle class English family. Her mother, a simple and silly creature whose greatest desire in life is that her dowry-deficient daughters should marry well, is ecstatic when she learns that a wealthy single young man named Mr. Bingley has moved into a nearby house; she imagines him a potential husband for one of her daughters. Bingley turns out to be charming and friendly, but his friend, Mr. Darcy, also wealthy, single, and young, snobbishly appears to consider himself superior to the Bennets.Jane, Elizabeth's older sister, falls in love with Bingley, but Darcy tries to discourage his friend from courting a girl of a social status lower than his. Elizabeth and Darcy develop a strangely flirtatious relationship that is partly affectionate and partly adversarial, provoking the jealousy of Bingley's attention-starved sister, who is attracted to Darcy. Elizabeth must also fend off the affections of her cousin, a clergyman named Mr. Collins who is amusingly persistent in his marriage proposals to her; fortunately, her rebuffs finally cause him to marry her less attractive friend instead. Collins shamelessly panders to his patroness, the haughty, imperious Lady Catherine de Bourgh, who practically demands that Darcy (who happens to be her nephew) marry her diminutive daughter, and Elizabeth had better not get in the way.A charming young soldier named Mr. Wickham, whose father was employed by Darcy's father and who became Darcy's father's ward after his own father's death, enters the story. To Elizabeth he claims that Darcy is withholding money from him that is due him; Darcy responds that Wickham is a freeloader who is not entitled to any more money than he has already gotten. Wickham risks damaging the Bennets' reputation when Elizabeth's youngest sister Lydia, who is as prattling and frivolous as her mother, impetuously decides to elope with him.If the \\"pride\\" in the novel is Darcy's self-regard, the \\"prejudice\\" is Elizabeth's initial opinion of him as an insufferable snob, because by the end she learns that he is quite honorable and charitable after all. He reveals to Elizabeth that he was raised by his parents to feel superior to the lower classes, but her willingness to stand up to him and his conceit has taught him modesty and humility and endeared her to him. It is this transformation of character, similar to a gender role reversal of \\"The Taming of the Shrew,\\" that distinguishes Austen's novel as a special achievement of 19th Century English literature."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This is truly a classic, the book is the apex of Ms. Austens writing. The characters are so vivid and they stay with you. The heroine Elizabeth Bennett is such a modern thinker and she is resolute and always true to herself. Ah and Darcy, he is such a great creation; at first glance, distant, shy, seemingly full of pride. The way the book evolves into one of the great love stories in literature is wonderful, it's a jouney everyone should take. Even if you have seen the great A&E version or the new Kiera Knightly version, you still should read the book. Ms. Austen is a great writer and though the two afore mentioned films are well done, they still can't match Ms. Austens proes, it's such a shame she died so young and we did not get to see her writing evolve, to think she died in her thirties a spinster, I suppose it takes someone like that to write such an uplifting, romantic book and not be, dare I say, cynical about romance and waiting for that one love...maybe she found her Darcy after all."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"\\"Vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may be proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves; vanity, to what we would have others think of us.\\" Jane AustenI let my own foolish pride, my own ignorant prejudices; deter me from ever picking up a Jane Austen achievement until about a month ago when I finally decided to give her a shot. This classic novel was definitely not on my \`must read' list, but somehow, someway, it landed on my lap one afternoon and I decided to at least take a quick peek at it while no one else was looking. After all, a man's man like myself (whatever that means nowadays) has no time to read early 19th century Chick Brit Lit., let alone a sweet, love story like this one. Especially during football season! I could almost hear Bukowski's ghost laughing at me when I opened up the first page and read those unforgettable first lines regarding man and marriage. However, I forged on, just Jane and I, and when it was all said and done - I can't believe what a fool I've been all these years! Yes, this classic is a thing of beauty. And like Jane's main protagonist and narrative voice in the novel - Elizabeth Bennet - I too learned a valuable lesson about not judging a book by its cover. Isn't evolution great?Don't make the same mistake I did. I love classic literature, but for too long now I avoided such greats as the Bronte's, Wharton, Cather, et al... because of my foolish male ego, my ridiculous machismo pride. My biggest regret though, was avoiding Austen all these years. Now, I may not go out and rent the movie anytime soon (of course the wife made me promise that I would watch it with her after I introduced her to \\"Scarface\\" the other night), but I will definitely be purchasing some more of Jane's classics (Emma, Persuasion, Mansfield Park, etc...) and if they are anything like this pleasant surprise, I am going to be one happy camper.Never a dull moment, never a page not worth perusing, simply put - Austen is awesome!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Miss Jane Austen (1775-1816) was born into the home of a clergyman at Steventon Rectory, She is the gem of all English authors in the realm of domestic romance and comedy. Jane needs a few middle class and wealthy families living in a rural setting to set her genius afire. Pride and Prejudice published in 1813 is justly the most famous, liveliest and perfectly plotted of all her few novels. You must read Pride and Prejudice if you have any claim to being a well educated person. The book is the grandmother of all the thousands of books that have been set in the Regency period featuring a love story between a young lady and a rich Byronic hero. None of these books can match Pride and Prejudice in its witty dialogue and insights into the human heart.The main characters are:The Bennet Family-Mr. Bennet is a fuddy-duddy bookworm of a clergyman. He is a poor father more interested in spending time in his study than it helping raise his rambunctious girls.Mrs. Bennet is a fatuous fool. An ignorant, self-indulgent, flippant idiot she has one goal-getting her five unwed daughters wed in prosperous matches with the local gentry and soldiery.Jane Bennet is the oldest \\"Miss Bennet\\". She falls in love with Mr. Bigley. She is an innocent, sweet young lady.Elizabeth Bennet is the novel's heroine and the most delightful young woman in all of English fiction! She is witty, wise, lively and beautiful. Elizabeth is probably based on Jane Austen. Her love is for Mr.Fitzwilliam Darcy whom she is preudiced against due to what she perceives as his rudeness to her; his suppposed effort to break up the affair between Jane and Darcy and his putative mistreatment of soldier Wickham.Lydia and Kitty are younger daughters who are man-crazy, brainless daughters. Lydia elopes with the cad soldier Wickham.Mary is the bookworm daughter who is made fun of by Austen for her overly serious demeanor.Charles Bingley-the love interest of Jane Bennet.Fitzwilliam Darcy is the prideful scion of great wealth who falls in love with Elizabeth. He resembles characters in such fictional products as those penned by Samuel Richardson; Fanny Burney and women authors enjoyed by the young Jane Austen.Hilarious minor characters include the odious clergyman Mr. Collins who weds the impecunious Charlotte Lucas. Charlotte is on the verge of becoming an old main so she weds the ludicrous Collins. Collins had earlier proposed marriage to Elizabeth but had been refused.Lady Catherine DeBourgh-Darcy's aunt she is cruel and hateful to everyone she holds in disdain. She is one of those old dragons which populate the pages of great classic English fiction.The novel was written during the period of England's life and death struggle against Napoleon but there is no mention of the nation's affairsAusten keeps her keen but restricted focus on the lives of her ordinary people living in the retired village of Maryton.Many famous novelists list Jane Austen as their favorite author. No wonder this is true! Janeites have adored her beautiful writing and well crafted stories for generations! Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen. This was the first English classic book I read while getting my University degree. Pride and Prejudice was a part of my English Literature. What began as a course syllabus, ended as a love affair with English classic, specially books by Jane Austen.This book strengthened by belief that love withstands everything. The characters of Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy are so excellently chalked out, that it makes us fall for them instantly. The magic of this book is amazing.This book lead me to buy and read all Jane Austen's classics.Must read for all who love to read.."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I was a little nervous when I first decided to put this on my summer reading list. The book was 367 pages of text, close together, justified and not written in easy language (i.e. modern English). I was optimistically hoping to finish it within a month.But I really liked the movie with Keira Knightley and wanted to see how closely it compared and if it was as good as the movie.Two weeks later, I am done, and I am pleased with the ride.Plot:Mr. Bingley, an eligible, wealthy bachelor, moves nearby the Bennett family, who have five unmarried daughters. The Bennett family must secure good marriages for their daughters since they will inherit nothing when their father dies. Romance is in the air between Jane Bennett and Mr. Bingley, while the first sparks of love appear between the proud, wealthy Mr. Darcy and the exuberant, Elizabeth Bennett.Good:There are so many good parts to this book! I don't quite know where to begin!The characters are believable and real. Elizabeth is a well rounded character. She starts out proud and prejudiced against Mr. Darcy but as she learns of his true quality is not afraid of changing her mind. Mr. Darcy was sweet, opinionated, and equally prejudiced against Elizabeth's \\"poor connections\\".The plot was wonderful and well paced. It kept me on the edge of my seat (although it was not an action book); I couldn't wait to see what would happen on each page.I enjoyed the arguments between Elizabeth (and her fiesty personality) and Mr. Darcy (stiff and proud). The quips they came up with! The chemistry between the two was perfect!Lastly, I enjoyed how the author emphasized (via Mr. Bennett) to marry for love and not for money or connections or the like. This is something very much beyond her time (as many marriages in the late 18th century were arranged).Bad:Well, this is being exceedingly petty, but the language of this book makes it difficult for a modern reader to fully understand the nuances of what Jane Austen is trying to say (the notes at the appendix help with this, however).Dialogue/Sexual Situations/ViolenceNone. Talk is made of how Lydia and an officer run off to live with each other without marrying. None.Overall:Sweet. There is no better word for the free-spirited, witty romance between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth. I would have to say this is the best, purest romance story I have ever read (besides, maybeThe Princess Bride). The movie does a fabulous job with the book, but the book is even more enjoyable than the movie (if you can imagine). You will not be displeased with this one."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I'm a recent newlywed who decided to raid his wifes bookshelf and this was the first book of hers that I picked up. Wanting to be better read and enjoying the movie &quot;Sense and Sensibility.&quot;I recommend to anyone that is curious but apprehensive of Austen like I was to see a film based on one of her books. You will hear the use and cadence of victorian speech which will, in my humble opinion, make her books more accessible and easier to read. This is the first Jane Austen I've read and I am now bonafide fan.This is one of those stories where the destination is not important but the journey is. Within the first ten pages, the stage is set. The two headstrong protagonists, Miss Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy cannot stand one another at the beginning of the book. Sparks fly and meet with typical results. The characters are distinct and memorable. Mr. Bennet, Elizabeth's father, was one of my favorites. Anyone who is an admirer of dry &quot;british&quot; humor will find themselves in stitches. It is the first book in a very long time where I found myself laughing out loud and on more than one occasion.A moderately quick read for those used to victorian prose. I for one am glad that I got over the &quot;girly&quot; stigma that's usually associated with Jane Austen. It has made me consider other books in my wifes arsenal I normally would not have otherwise.I will, however, pass on her &quot;The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood&quot;Great book. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I never thought I'd have a favorite book or author until I read Pride and Prejudice. It is, by far, the most beautifully written love story in literature, in my opinion.Miss Eliza Bennet is the second eldest daughter of an English gentleman whose estate can only go to a male successor upon his death. Because he and Mrs. Bennet are unable to conceive a male child, it is the best course for the girls to marry and marry well. The great advantage the girls have is that they are beautiful, with the eldest girl, Jane, being the most beautiful of them all.The Bennets live in Longbourn, a small village just outside of Meryton, a quaint little town. The story begins when Mr. Bingley, a very amiable and wealthy young bachelor, decides to lease an estate in the area. At a ball, Mr. Bingley introduces his best friend, Mr. Darcy, another wealthy bachelor, and his sisters to the local society. It is here where Mr. Bingley meets the Bennet girls and starts to fall in love with Jane Bennet, and it is also here where Mr. Darcy meets Elizabeth. Elizabeth immediately dislikes Darcy for several reasons but mainly because he insults her by first refusing to dance with her and then by saying, with Elizabeth within hearing distance, that he isn't in the habit of asking girls, who have been rejected by other men, to dance.Elizabeth is a complex character, a young woman who is wise beyond her years, reserve, has a dry sense of humor, friendly but very cynical of her world and of love. In contrast, Jane is sensitive, likes to think well of people, very friendly, and somewhat fragile. Bingley's personality is a perfect complement to Jane's. He's friendly, generous, somewhat nave and looks up to Darcy. Darcy is brooding, quiet, reserved, prideful, and yet loyal and protective of his friends and family.The story progresses to where Darcy discovers his growing attraction to Elizabeth, despite his best efforts, and proposes to her. Because of his social status and wealth, Darcy expects Elizabeth to say \\"yes\\" to his marriage proposal. To his surprise, she not only turns him down, she also tears right into him: His haughty behavior, rudeness, and his part in driving Bingley and Jane apart. Yes, Darcy had been up to no good in breaking up Bingley and Jane. This sets the stage for heartbreak, courtship, scandal, intrigue, and reconciliation and finally a happy ending for both couples.Jane Austen paints her characters and their dialogue with such splendidly crafted sentences, such as \\"I wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!\\" She takes time to enrich the story with picturesque descriptions of each setting, and describes each character in such a way that you easily understand the layer of complexity in each. For example, Elizabeth dislikes those who she thinks are vain, but yet she prides herself in her ability to read people's personalities and they're like. Wickham, the protagonist in this story, is, on the surface, well-mannered, kind, and has a \\"good face,\\" but is really a liar, thief and a gambler.I highly recommend this book. I've read it numerous times and there's always something new to discover with each reading."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Excellent classic novel. I loved how there are a variety of story lines going at once. It takes a few chapters to get past some of the old English language, but once you get a few chapters into it you can't put it down. It's a good novel about relationships - from family to romantic - in a setting of the early 1800's in England."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"pride and prejudice seems boring if you merely scan it, but if you read every detail then you'll find that it is a very witty, interesting, funny book. many things happen in this novel and you'll learn.this book may be confusing if you don't understand these old english expressions. i luckily knew some of them and learned the rest.pride and prejudice takes you into the world of the aristocracy in Enlgland in the early nineteenth century. You'll learn about matchmaking schemes and what was most important for a woman (marriage, of course) and how people treated their own family. I'm not talking cruelty or anything, but about pride. For ex. Mr. Darcy likes Elizabeth, but doesn't want to, since she's below his class. When Elizabeth's siter Lydia runs off with a guy their father almost disowns her in his anger. It may seem like a cruel and heartless thing to do, but when you read it, it almost seems like a perfectly sensible thing to do. women married for money and position, rarely for love. daughters were expected to obey their parents' wishes. Pride and Prejudice shows you all of this.this story takes place in England in around the early nineteenth century. here, in the upper-middle/lower first class is Mr. Bennet, a sarcastic, quiet man, his rather foolish wife, and their five daughters. Jane, the eldest, is the most kindest and prettiest. She's a goody-goody but you like her anyway, since she's also sensible. Elizabeth is the second eldest; the main character and also the wittiest and cleverest of her sisters. Mary is the quietest and most accomplished; she spends her time studying and you hear least of her in this story except when she's making some clever observation on pride or virtues from her studies.. Catherine, also called Kitty, is next, and then Lydia. They're both foolish, flirtatious, empty-headed girls who spend most of their time going to town so they can flirt with officers in the militia.enter Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy. They're best friends, both rich young men, both really handsome, both bachelors. only difference is that people hate Mr. darcy, as he's a proud, indifferent man who hates to dance and critizizes things. Mr. Bingley on the other hand is charming and amiable, loves to dance and admires Jane a lot. of course Mrs. Bennet starts scheming. She hates Mr. Darcy though, since at the beginning of the book, Mr. Darcy is heard telling Mr. Bingley at a ball that Elizabeth is not handsome enough for him to go off and dance with. Elizabeth is actually very pretty, as Jane Austen puts it, but nevertheless Mr. Darcy is a picky person. Elizabeth doesn't like Mr. Darcy's personality too much herself. they seem to be destined to scorn and be critical of each other only unfortunately for Elizabeth Mr. Darcy starts to fall head over heels for her after being stunned by Elizabeth's playfully bold, unique personality.of course they don't get married at once, otherwise this would be a very short novel. neither do jane and mr. bingley. The happy endings are delayed as a result from pride and prejudice. After all, Mrs. bennet isn't the only one who schemes. everybody does, from Mr. Darcy to Elizabeth's best friend Charlotte to Mr. Bingley's sister.this was a fabulous book and i definitely reccomend it. it depends on the reader's reading level, though."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is the book that I chose for my amazon.com report. I liked the book a lot more then I expected myself to. I think that it is a book that should be required to be read in one point or another in the sixth grade. Pride and Prejudice, Jane Austen, New American Library, 1989. I gave the book a five star rating because it teaches you what love is and what it was like for the people back then. For them to fall in love with one another and have all the regulations and rules. It was probably hard for them. Everywhere in this book is love. Whether it is from mother to father or from daughter to mother or father.In this book a family of seven welcomes Mr. Darcy. He is a very rich and hasome man. Mr. Bennet and Mrs. Bennet try constantly to get one of his five daughters to marry Mr. Darcy, but Elizabeth has other plans. For she is in love with Mr. Wickham. It turns out that Mr.Wickham is in love with Elizabeth. They begin dating and cannot stand a single day without each other, so they decide that they should get married and soon they become engaged. But then Elizabeth realizes that she does not love him anymore. She soon comes to a conclusion of why. She loves Mr. Collins.I am not going to give away a good ending because it is so exciting, but they all live happily ever after. Meanwhile Mr. Darcy is having trouble choosing who to marry. I will not spill the beans on who he decides to marry because I would write too much and then it might give all of it away. The other three girls do find their true love and Mr. and Mrs. Bennet are happy because their daughters are happy.My opinion of this book is wonderful and outrageous. I think that this book is just like Jane Austen said, \\" it is like your own darling child.\\" Her version of this book has made me want to read more of her books because I think that they will be somewhat like Pride and Prejudice but I would never know till I read another one of her books. I also agree with the old saying, \\"don't judge a book by it's cover\\" because I picked up this book and said, \\"This does not look like something I would want to read.\\" I read it and said, \\"WOW! This was a really excellent book.\\"I think that the theme is a very important thing when you are trying to rate a book because basically it is what the book taught you about life. So the theme for Pride and Prejudice was that no matter how much you love someone you can't possibly be satisfied unless they love you back, and that love has no boundries. You can love someone and they can love you but you will still love that person no matter what happens. Even if that person leaves or passes away you will still love but you won't know it because it is just from the bottom of your heart."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"One can easily be mistaken by pride and prejudice, which can later lead to foolish misunderstanding. Throughout this novel the reader can observe how a marriage can secure social status and economic security. Mrs. Bennet would do anything to guarantee both for her daughters. Pride and Prejudice is a story of love, drama and life at England during the 19-century. The author of this classic of literature is Jane Austen. Jane Austen is the seventh daughter of eight children. Being daughter of Rev. George Austen and Cassandra, Austen was born in December 16th, 1775 at Steventon, Hampshire, England. Austen died on 18 of July 1817 at the age of 41 in Winchester, Hampshire, England. Jane died unmarried as well as her sister Cassandra Elizabeth who was 2 years older than Jane. Jane wrote several books before her death including Pride and Prejudice who's initial title would be First Impressions.The arrival of Mr. Charles Bingley to Nederfield Park, caused quite a scandal. Mr. Bingley was a young single man with a huge fortune, and the perfect candidate for husband for one of Mrs. Bennet's daughters. Mr. Bingley's sister and closest friend, Miss Bingley and Mr. Darcy had arrived with him. Mr. Bennet paid unwillingly a visit to Mr. Bingley under order of her wife with the purpose of causing a good impression. Mr. Bingley encountered the Bennet's at a ball and was allured by the oldest Miss Bennet, Jane. Not only once did Mr. Bingley ask her to a dance with him, but twice. Miss Bingley became an acquaintance of Jane and became very fond of her.Throughout the novel we are able to observe how society was back in the 19th century. A woman's priority was to get a wealthy and high ranking husband who would be able to provide a good social status to her and their children. The fact that Mr. Collins would inherit the Bennet's property after Mr. Bennet passed away allows us to see further into women's rights. Women were not oppressed as they used to be but they still didn't had the same amount of privileges we do in the present. Mr. Bennet could not leave their daughters any inheritance because they were all women and the property was entailed, meaning that only males could inherit it. The book is so well written with so much detail that it turns one from an outsider into an insider.One is able to observe what a typical day would be in the old days, especially for women, how would they travel and how long their visits would last. I found it quite peculiar how in the past people used to be guests for months and in the present it is less likely, one usually is more busy and just stops for a while and moves on. In the novel Elizabeth spends four weeks at Hunsford with Mrs. Collins and she is still begged by Lady Catherine to remain. Jane also spends around three months in London in her aunt's residence. We can see and advance in the way Mr. Darcy thinks. Many would have believed that Elizabeth's imprudence would be considered of bad taste and rude, but Mr. Darcy admired her for all the reasons someone else may dislike her. Elizabeth didn't accepted Mr. Collins proposal and she still declined Mr. Darcy's proposal not afraid of remaining unmarried. In contrast Miss Lydia Bennet was so desperate in getting a husband. On her way home Lidya commented to her sisters the following,\\"Let us hear what has happened to you all since went away. Have you seen any pleasant men? Have you had any flirting? I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back. Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare. She is almost three-and-twenty! Lord, how ashamed I should of not married before three-and-twenty! My aunt Philips wants you to get husbands, you can't think. She says Lizzy should had better have taken Mr. Collins;but I do not think there would have been any fun in it. Lord! How I should like to be married before any of you! And then I would chaperon you about to all the balls.\\"I found this book intriguing since it shows how us humans may be blinded by prejudices and pride. Sometimes we may judge too fast or too harshly and that no matter how bad something seems it may not be the absolutely true. Elizabeth judged Mr. Darcy too quickly, being blinded by prejudice, she believed completely what Mr. Wickham had said and didn't confirm it with Mr. Darcy. Mr. Darcy was sometimes too proud that he acted foolishly, he didn't show any signs of his feelings towards Elizabeth till the last minute, he didn't tell the absolute truth about Mr. Wickham in order to avoid judging and to conserve his pride. Even though Jane Austen is not here to see the impact her stories has had, this piece of art specifically will always be remembered as one of the classics of literature."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Gave this seller a poor review for slow shipping and a book in poor condition. Happy to report that they quickly responded to my complaint email and issued me a refund."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Austen is known to be one of the greatest classic female novelists. Her stories contain strong heroines, who rebel against societal norms in order to achieve their full potential as women. Pride and Prejudice, Austen's most well-known work, does not fail to contain this familiar element of Austen's writings.The novel follows the story of the Bennet sisters, primarily the two eldest, Jane and Elizabeth, and their misadventures in love. Jane is the sweet-tempered, docile, and beautiful daughter, making her Mrs. Bennet's favorite. On the other hand, Elizabeth is independent, hot-headed and sarcastic, making her Mr. Bennet's favorite. Mrs. Bennet's main focus in life is to have her five daughters married to wealthy men so Mrs. Bennet can live a life in comfort.When wealthy Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy move in to Netherfield, the estate next to that of Mr. Bennet, Mrs. Bennet is elated at the possibility of at least one of her daughters marrying one of the men. Mr. Bingley is almost instantly taken with the innocent Jane, while Mr. Darcy manages to insult Elizabeth within moments of meeting her. This starts the rocky relationship between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. Blinded by pride and prejudice, both parties must face hurt and heartbreak before finally receiving their happily ever after.Despite strong characterization, especially of Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, Pride and Prejudice does not make my list of favorite books. The story is flat, with no interesting plot elements outside of the occasional use of verbal irony for some humor. As it is a romantic comedy, it is predictable and lacks the depth of most great classic novelists such as Dumas, Dickens, and Leroux.Pride and Prejudice is a light-hearted easy-read. However, if looking for a book that is engaging, it might be best to look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Appropriate for children, this book has excitement, history, and christian thinking in the ways of social behavior.

But I've always wondered about the \\"songs\\" (Chapter 6) that Lizzy performs before giving way to her dull sister Mary. Was she really singing? I guess not, since the subsequent refs are to the instrument. During the time of P&P's writing and for a few years thereafter the English Scarlatti cult was in full swing, so the CD \\"Scarlatti as chosen by Clementi\\" is worth while listening for hardcore JA authenticity fans. Clementi was associated with the Broadwood piano manufacturers and the album contains pieces chosen from Clementi's influential English edition of 1791. Emilia Fadini plays these pieces on an English c. 1800 repro piano with some fire--I can easily imagine Elizabeth wowing Darcy and the crowd with K 381 (track #3). Anyway, the recording gives some perspective."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Haven't had a chance to read the book yet. But, it looks like it will be a great read.

This is my all time favorite, I have read it several times in just a few months."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"A mother's driving force is getting her five daughters married quickly; it hardly matters to whom. A suitor proposes, is summarily rejected and marries someone else within days. A woman doesn't like men but wants to get married anyway. A sixteen-year-old runs off with a man and doesn't marry him right away, much to the chagrin of both her parents and sisters. A mother has no use for her daughter's suitor but happily accepts him into the family because he is wealthy. The less money a family has, the more important it is that all their daughters marry and quickly. If the family lives in the country, they must work harder to get these daughters married. Sound like your favorite sitcom and/or your favorite cousin and her family? Well, it's Jane Austin's timeless PRIDE AND PREJUDICE. I recently reread this comedy of manners that I hadn't read since high school. Here we have much ado about getting the daughters married. Even though we in the U. S. have lived through the 60's and the &quot;Women's Movement,&quot; sixty percent of law students now are women, and many things have changed about the way young women are brought up and what they do with their lives, I still saw a lot of families I know here. Everything changes; yet everything remains the same.Everybody points out what is so unique about this novel as well as the rest of Austin's works. She does very little to place them in any given time. They are quite wonderful in what they don't tell us. Austin doesn't give us a lot of specificity about a lot of things. For example, The Bennetts are always entertaining yet we don't know much about what they eat other than &quot;venison&quot; or &quot;meat.&quot; While people often &quot;color&quot; when they blush, the only color named in the entire novel is blue; Wickham may wear a blue coat when he gets married. The young women often play music but we are never told the names of the pieces they play. We do know that Elizabeth plays rather badly. I kept thinking that these young girls have too much free time on their hands. They need more hobbies or part-time jobs. Of course young women of a certain station in Austin's day didn't work.The ironic first line of the novel is well-known: &quot;It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.&quot; With that great opener, we are off and running.Parts of this novel will make you smile; others will make your laugh. My favorite character is the father, Mr. Bennett, who is quick to see and point out his wife's and others' foibles but never sees his own."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I downloaded the illustrated Kindle version of Pride and Prejudice for free from Amazon. Thank you Amazon! This is one of my favorite books and one that I have re-read several times and will read again.OK. So you know this isn't a bitch and complain session and that I am appreciative of the freebies I have gotten from Amazon. So here it goes, the good, bad, and the suggestions.This illustrated version of Pride and Prejudice - offered by Amazon - is beautifully formatted for the Kindle. It is attractive and appealing and like most Kindle books is a pleasure to e-read.The only problem that I can see - or actually CAN'T see - is the muted e-ink illustrations or the text below each illustration. Even when I zoom in on the illustration, though I can see the illustration better, I still can't read the writing :( I have a Kindle DX (larger Kindle), so this must be a serious problem for people with regular 7 in. sized Kindles.If the e-ink problem with the nine illustrations were solved, I would gladly pay .99 cents for a copy of this partially illustrated book. If the problem were fixed AND each of the sixty-one chapters were presented with one of the Brock illustrations, I would gladly pay $9.99 for the e-book. And please don't tell me to buy the newer, smaller Kindle because the e-ink is sharper. I have tested it out at the store, and though somewhat sharper, it is not sharp enough to make up for 60 year old eyes when e-ink is muted.Any way, I will make due with this freebie from Amazon and keep searching the web site from time to time for the improved edition:)"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice was published in 1813 in three volumes, the customary presentation of a novel in the early 19th Century. Penguin Press has provided Kindle owners with a wonderful enhanced version of the novel preserving the three volume format without attempting to standardize or modernize the text.The Penguin book is presented by Juliette Wells, Enhanced E-book Features Editor. It is edited with an introduction and informative notes by Vivien Jones. The result is a very readable yet scholarly treatment of the novel, with a biography of Jane Austen, 19th Century reviews of the book, descriptions of how to make tea and Jane Austen's eating habits, and much more.The last time I read Pride and Prejudice was in 1966 in an English literature class in college. I challenged the professor's choice of reading material as completely irrelevant given the Vietnam War and the Civil Rights movement and protests on my college campus, San Francisco State. It was a pleasure to reread the book with the wisdom of age supplemented by the excellent notes throughout the three volumes. Kindle owners can, with a spin of the wheel and a click, read explanations of the semantics of the vocabulary used by Austen, consider content interpretations, view illustrations of fashion, learn historical dance steps, and see period architecture.The focus of the production, of course, is the novel with its themes of first impressions, pride, vanity, seduction, feminism, prejudice, sexism, fatal attraction, society, intellectual domination, morality, etiquette, marriage, heritability, class structure, the family as a purposeful unit, and personal happiness. I highlighted many passages and notes to read again and enjoy. One example is from Volume 1 when Darcy says to Elizabeth, \\"There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil, a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome.\\" Another example of my highlights is from Volume 2 when Elizabeth states, \\"The more I see of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense.\\" And here is an example of an explanatory note I highlighted from Volume 3, \\"e3. Elizabeth's determination here matches her effort throughout the novel to pursue what she considers to be her own happiness; compare her response to Mr. Collin's proposal of marriage in chapter 19.\\" The novel, notes, and other features allow the reader to experience the historical context of the first edition.Before reading Pride and Prejudice, I reread James Joyce's Ulysses on my Kindle with Don Gifford's Ulysses Annotated paperback book as a guide. It would have been a better reading experience to have this excellent source integrated with the novel. Penguin's enhanced e-books with built in reference features will be excellent for new publications of classic novels. I learned a great deal more about Austen's novel in the convenient Kindle format than I did 42 years ago in college. Hopefully, I'll be able to add many enhanced Penguin classics to my Kindle Library."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This edition has a nice binding and the illustrations are charming. However, the margins and type are both too large and the result is a 476 page book which is awkward to hold.

Students should consult a professionally published version (Penguin, Oxford University Press) before writing papers or using quotations."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I adore and revere Austen and this book is, for me, the pinnacle. It's such a masterwork of the English language, so richly layered and textured and such a sharp observation of the society in which Austen lived. Read only at surface level, it seems little more than a sweet romance but when the text is examined deeply the mastery of Austen becomes apparent.Was Austen a feminist? I'm not entirely convinced of this but what I do know is that she was keenly, keenly aware of the way her world worked. She knew that the only power a woman had was to charm and flirt until she captured herself a rich husband. A woman did not have the power to seek her own occupation and a sharp and educated mind was not exactly appreciated. This is why Austen and her most bewitching heroine Elizabeth are so very subversive. Austen's creation, like Austen herself, bucks the convention of the time and is determined to see her life played out on her own terms. She will not settle for anything less than love and though that may seem simple to today's reader, it was anything but in an age when money and status meant everything. Elizabeth is not perfect. She makes mistakes and she is judgmental at times but her greatest strength is her determination to be true to herself.And yet even though Austen makes such a strong case for independence of spirit, she is also kind to those who bow to convention. Though Elizabeth's dear friend Charlotte makes a choice that initially seems extremely repugnant, it is easy to see that, really, Charlotte is simply doing what she must to survive. It is not that Charlotte is any less true to herself than Elizabeth, it is simply that she is rather more practical and pragmatic. She sees her situation in a very clear light and, in the end, chooses what is for her the lesser of two evils. I think that Austen respected this as well. Being brave and forging a new path is not for all of us.As for Darcy, he is also a product of his time. He behaves in a way that society feels a man should. At a very young age he must deal with gross abuses of his father's trust and a rather horrific betrayal of his family's kindness. He is forced to shoulder responsibility at a time when his peers may have been busy gambling and chasing skirts. There are few in whom Darcy can confide and he holds his cards so close to his chest that he must shut out others who could perhaps be of assistance to him. Though his wealth and status seem to suggest that he is above the slings and arrows of society, it turns out that this assumption is a naive one. Darcy is no more free to do whatever he likes than Elizabeth is.What makes this book so satisfying is that the hero and heroine triumph over their adverse circumstances. At heart, Austen was a romantic. She clearly had hope that the narrow confines of her world could stretch enough to allow for happiness and self-fulfillment. She believed in the power of love to conquer some very daunting obstacles and she believed that love could help people grow into a better version of themselves. I think it is this optimism that makes Austen so appealing to her readers."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is Jane Austen's most popular novel and it is remarkable that it has sustained such a high popularity 200 years after it was originally published. The primary plot of the story follows Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy in a highly contentious courtship that begins with mutual contempt but evolves quite unexpectedly for both into very different feelings. Subplots involve her sister Jane and Mr. Bingley in a courtship of their own as well as the romantic entanglements of various other sisters and friends. The story is a bit of a roller coaster ride with soaring hopes and crushing disappointment in store as events unfold. I won't reveal the ending for the handful of people who haven't read it but suffice to say that the novel concludes in a way that leaves the vast majority of readers well satisfied.Darcy and Elizabeth are complex and multi-layered characters who both grow and change somewhat as the book progresses. They are the heart and soul of the book and about as well fleshed out as any characters you are likely to see. The supporting characters, however, are considerably less deep and are more caricatures than anything else. Some are good and kind like Jane and Mr. Bingley, and others are ridiculous and vain like Mrs. Bennet but none are remotely as substantial as Darcy and Elizabeth. So, does this ruin the book? Hardly. These secondary characters offer a wealth of material for the author as she plays them off of Darcy and Elizabeth.This novel is almost certainly the one where Austen best displays her sharp-edged wit both through Elizabeth's dialogue and in the narrative voice describing some of these characters and their actions. If some of them were less ridiculous, the potential for the satire would be weakened considerably. And make no mistake, Pride and Prejudice is as much a satire of the time it was written, as it is a romantic drama. Even today, the prose is quite funny and enjoyable. The Enriched Classics edition is also nice because it includes footnotes explaining some of the language and/or references that were well known at the time but confusing today's readers.In summary, this is a great novel. Admittedly, there were a few times where I thought a character's behavior was a bit over-the-top but the overall story is so riveting and the book so compelling that I just can't find any serious fault with it. Pride and Prejudice is deserving of its reputation and I highly recommend it to Austen fans and newcomers alike."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I originally read this for my sophmore English class, and didn't enjoy it too much because of all of the analysis we were required to do. I re-read it the following summer and discovered it makes much better leisure reading. I'd say the ideal audience is obviously female (considering the main character is the fiesty heroine Elizabeth Bennet), of any age.Even though it is a classic, it still manages to be quite a page-turner, with unexpected plot twists and witty dialogue. The most enjoyable aspect of this novel is watching the relationship between Elizabeth and Darcy develop. I've read the book several more times, and each time I find myself anticipating their eventual confession of each others' feelings for one another. Although the ending of the story is predictable, it is how this ending is reached which makes for an interesting read.The book is largely character and dialogue-based, so I'd shy away from it if that isn't your thing. However, to any classics-lover, this book is a must! I'd also highly recommend viewing the BBC mini-series (the one featuring Colin Firth as Darcy, and Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth) to fully experience the Georgian England setting. But, trust me, you won't want to simply ditch the book to watch the movie version. Nothing can quite compare to Jane Austen's original writing."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Like all the other jane austen books i loved this one just as much. jane austen is famous for her characterisation and this book proves it to you even more.elizabeth bennet and mr. darcy intertwined into their own fixed judgements and opinions make this book not just a must read for its witty satire and humour but for its indepth understanding of true love. eliza,prejudiced ....Darcy, too caught up with his high society unfold their true character gradually making you enthralled and wanting more.mr. collins the cousin, catheran de bourgh his patron bring out the best in subtle humour.mr. and mrs. bennet, both of them a class apart...their uniquely opposite personalities creating sparks. the four sisters: genuine, bingely:awesome...the story i leave for you to unravel. you'll love it to the best of your ability.trust me; you're caught. you won't be able to get your hands off it. its the work of a great woman and a great writer, a true genius who to me is just as equivalent to shakespeare. but then thats just me.a book that shows us how two minds can eventually meet and harbour friendship and love.

Five daughters later, his estate is still slated to pass to a distant cousin, an obnoxious clergyman, because it can pass only to a man. Had there been a son, something could have been done, but as it is, the daughters' only hope of avoiding eventual poverty is marrying well, for themselves and for their mother.Our focus is on the second daughter, Elizabeth. More thoughtful than her sisters, she is her father's favorite. We are not the only ones to like Elizabeth, the prideful and immensely wealthy Mr. Darcy also finds himself falling for her. She rejects him because of the prejudice she has formed from his foster brother, the untrustworthy Mr. Wickham. The rest of the novel allows us to watch as these characters manoever to finally get into a position where they can accept each other.Absolutely stuffed with memorable characters and scenes. I rate it as her best, slightly better than Emma, but reasonable minds can differ about this one."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Jane Austen certainly seems to have done a great job earning her name in the literary world. I can only imagine how difficult it was for her to have been able to earn such a status in the very much male dominated era that she belonged to. This book illustrates two major themes of that period - the somewhat male dominated society, and the class structure in the early 19th century England.At the beginning of the book Elizabeth Bennet the heroine of the novel seems doomed in every sense. She is both female, and does not have an inheritance that will earn her a respectable marriage. However, what she does possess are things that cannot be bought with money - she is by far the smartest woman in the book, and has an incredible sense of humor. It is in fact these two traits that the aristocratic Mr.Darcey finally finds irresistable, and leads to him proposing marriage not once, but twice. It is only at the very end of the book that Elizabeth gives in, and agrees to the marriage - much to the surprise of both her parents and her older sister. This marriage is significant in that it brakes steadfast barriers. It seems almost as though it is the beginning of the end for the English class structure.Jane Austen is a brilliant writer and you will find her work easy to follow. I can assure you that you won't regret reading it - I haven't, and I have read it many, many times. It is almost addictive."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"And that says a lot! Elizabeth Bennet is the second of five daughters in the Bennet household. She is a lively and good-humored young woman of high understanding and an open mind. However, she has one defect, she is too quick to judge. Especially so when Mr. Darcy comes to her neighborhood. Darcy appears to be of a reserved, haughty and proud disposition owing to his large fortune and noble birth. Lizzy adopts an immediate dislike of him. Mr. Wickham, whom Lizzy judges to be an amiable man, gives her further evidence of Darcy's unworthiness, and she is prepared to accept and believe it (She is prejudiced!). Darcy notices all the defects of her rather embarrassing family, low-connections and inferior wealth in comparison with his own (He is proud!). Just when you think it's a dead end, however, the barriers begin to crumble away as more and more of Darcy's real character is revealed. Through more dependable sources, she learns that he is in fact a good-hearted, charitable, just man, and the most surprising and unexpected revelation, that he has more than a strong regard for her.My favorite thing about this book is Austen's portrayal of society through her characters: the greedy and self-interested (Mr. Collins), the rich and snobbish (Lady Catherine de Bourgh), the small-minded and ridiculous (Mrs. Bennet and Lydia), the decietful and immoral (Mr. Wickham), and the kind-hearted and easily victimized (Bingley and Jane). The novel is one of the funniest I have ever read, and so entertaining. Mrs. Bennet seldom speaks of her 'nerves' or complains without making you laugh. It is not a slow read either, despite the popularity of the novel there are plenty of unexpected turns to keep you going. Beneath the entertaining quality of the novel there are lessons to be learned. Lizzy misjudges Darcy, Darcy misjudges Lizzy, she misjudges Wickam, Mr Bennet misjudges Mrs. Bennet when he married her, and Jane (Lizzy's older sister) misjudges Miss Bingley. It is perphaps eight months since the beginning of Lizzy's acquaintance with Darcy that she learns his true character, and every moment proves more and more how good a man he is. I liked Sense and Sensibility, but I love Pride and Prejudice. Lizzy and Darcy are positively the most adorable couple I have read."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I thought this book was magnificent.

Despite its difficult language and rather lengthy descriptions and dialog, which tended to confuse me and cause me to lose interest at several points throughout the novel, the plot and events of this book left me in uplifted spirits and with the positive feeling that love truely can overcome any obstacle put in its way. The romance between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, as well as the relationship between Jane and Mr. Bingley, left me guessing throughout the entire novel, and motivated me to trudge through the somewhat uneventful chapters inbetween exciting events.

Every lady who reads this book will dream of their Darcy...will wish that they were Elizabeth. No one can escape the enchantment of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"An amazing book! I thought this was one of those &quot;girly-girl&quot; books that was mushy and stupid. Yet this isn't some Harlequin romance. In fact, it pertains equally to both genders. Elizabeth Bennet, Mr. Darcy, the characters are amazingly created by Jane Austen. A wonderful book, definitely worth the time and effort spent trying to understand it."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"...I also strongly recommend that an interested reader try listening to the audio version of this novel. If you think the prose of Austen dry, I assure you that you will find a good reading of it a revelation indeed. Among the versions I recommend strongly are the version read by Irene Sutcliffe (Audio Partners/ Cover to Cover, or Chivers in the UK), and that by Kate Reading (Books on Tape, available from them).I found the Reading version very good overall, and outstanding for the portrayal of Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Mrs Bennet. The best scene, in my opinion, was that of Lady Catherine confronting Elizabeth in the garden at Longbourn. However, I found Elizabeth less easy to distinguish in certain other scenes from her sister Jane, and the men done not as well as I would have hoped. Mr Darcy was a disappointment, in that Kate Reading read his dialogue in a less stately manner than I had expected. However, the reading of the novel was overall very good as I have said. I noticed many little details and phrases that I had overlooked in many readings of this novel, and that I had also ignored in my stay at the Republic of Pemberley (a website dedicated to Austen).I have not yet had the pleasure of listening to the Irene Sutcliffe version, but I plan to buy it very soon. ...If you are rushed for time, or spend a lot of time in your car (or listening to tapes), or if you want to experience Austen in a different light, do try either reading."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This was my second Austen novel, my first being Sense and Sensibility.

I didn't want it to ever end! That's the mark of a good book. When you're done with it, you wish you had never read it just so you could read it for the fist time again.

Anyway, this was to replace an old crumbling version of the book so I contacted the publisher (haven't heard back) and won't read anymore- too disappointing. I love books and cherish this one - so maybe it won't bug you as much. But to me it is absolutely unacceptable to copy a book incorrectly. Who knows how many other errors there are. Since the publisher hasn't responded I'm writing this review here to warn others to pick another version.EDIT - January 6, 2010 - The publisher just got back to me and they were phenomenal - they took the time to show me the proofs used from the original version, etc and they will be revising this in June, coming out with a corrected edition. They clearly love and care for books as much as I would hope - so do not hesitate to buy from this publisher."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"From time to time I read a critical opinion on Pride and Prejudice that, while acknowledging its excellence, wonders why Jane Austen could not in her genius provide some more gravitas. It's rather more observant and intelligent than your run-of-the-mill romance, to be sure, but a romance it is at bottom. No political savvy, no real attempt to face the role of women in Regency England, just a cute love story with an enjoyably satirical bent. Miss Jane herself seemed to agree with that assessment - she once called it \\"a little bit, two inches wide, of ivory\\". Decorative, but hardly important.Would someone please tell me what these people were reading? It certainly isn't the same book that I read. Or the one that thousands of people have fallen in love with and has produced at least four separate movie and television versions (which is a detail that allows me to give away certain plot points below, confident that most people already know them).It is indeed a very romantic love story, if by romance we mean the attempt of people to open themselves up and accept each other with their good and bad qualities - not only accept each other, but admire each other and want to be together just as they are. That process is difficult enough in this day and age, with the whole lot of us positively encouraged to be as frank as possible. Back in Miss Jane's day it seems to have been a good deal harder, what with the restrictions placed on people in the way of acceptable behavior and the disastrous consequences for breaking the social rules.If, however, we understand \\"romance\\" to mean the story of a woman who doesn't know her own mind, who has been so hurt that she can't stand the thought of love, who is too headstrong to allow anyone to tame her, and/or who eventually finds her way into the arms of a muscular hero type and melts on the spot (which is, after all, exactly what happens in plenty of perfectly good romance novels), that's not precisely what we have here. To be sure, the heroine of Pride and Prejudice does indeed begin the story entirely too headstrong to submit to marriage for its own sake, and she certainly finds her way into the arms of a man she previously despised (offstage, of course), but she doesn't exactly melt. It would be more accurate to say that she learns to think for herself. Whereas before she rejected her society's more foolish standards by reflex, she gradually comes to accept or reject what she's told by thinking it over first. And people think that Jane Austen didn't consider the place of women in her world? That there's no understanding of the big picture in Pride and Prejudice? Baloney.Now, Pride and Prejudice doesn't mention the big picture very often, although it's always present. The Bennett sisters get into trouble largely because a company of militia moves into a nearby village, and you and I both know that they're there to drill and train because at some point they will probably have to go fight against Napoleon Bonaparte, even though no one ever mentions his name. The sisters also have problems because they have no brothers, and know that a distant male relative will therefore inherit their house when their father dies. Rather than complain about these various disasters, though, the author shows us what their effects are upon the family in its daily life - the temptation to a group of young woman of handsome men in uniform hanging around, the scramble for advantageous marriages, and of course the question of whether one ought to seek a man one loves or a man with money if one can't have both. Great authors know, especially when it comes to two-inch pieces of ivory, that it's much more powerful to show the impact of great historical events than to talk about them. Jane Austen was a very great author.If she simply showed the workings of her society, though, she would have been simply a very good essayist, not a great author. Fortunately for us, she was also an extraordinary stylist, and she had an enormous gift for irony, very much on display in Pride and Prejudice right from the famous first sentence. That same twinkle remains in Miss Jane's eye right through the first sentence of the last chapter - \\"Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs. Bennett got rid of her two most deserving daughters.\\" Few authors would dare spend hundreds of pages setting up two weddings and then dismiss them both like that. It's positively delicious. With that kind of language, that sly inclusion of social criticism and such intriguing characters as Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy, you can call Pride and Prejudice a cute little romance if you want, but I'm warning you - it has hidden depths.Don't let that scare you, though. I told you, it's delicious.

Many events happen and after some of Elizibeth's lovers have been taken by other rich people who have power, she settles over a person called Mr. Darcy who has known their family for many years and seems to notice everything going around and gives an aura of some sort to other people.

Jane Austen speaks out in mild but effective comical terms on the stupidity of tradition throughout the eighteenth century. Her main themes address the problems of true love, money and the importance of family life. She does this through the narrative of her highly regarded heroine Elizabeth Bennett.

Perhaps some British peope or people familiar with British society will be able to give me a satisfactory answer. While Mr Darcy abhored people who are ill-bred, unsophisticated and mediocre it is diffcult to see how he could put up with people like Lady Catherine, Caroline Bingley and Louisa Hurst who are just as bad as Mrs Bennet, Kitty Bennet and Lydia Bennet. The latter group had less money and social status. Is this the reason ?"},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Why is Jane Austen's work so popular even today? Because she was just the best! This is on my personal top ten list. I've read it at least ten times and probably will read it several times again.

All of Jane Austen's books are good, but this is her best - and a classic that should be part of every woman's education and every woman's personal library.

As someone else stated earlier, P&amp;P is not Austen's deepest work; however, it still contains many levels of meaning. Superficially, there is the charming and *credible* romance. As one digs deeper, one can find lessons on how to read properly (as Elizabeth learns) as well as the layout of a new meritocracy based not on rank, but taste and intelligence. This is not a bland love story, but a quiet, faintly smiling attack on pride, tastelessness, vanity, prejudice and obliviousness. The portrayals of Mrs. Bennet, Caroline Bingley and Lady Catherine de Bourgh are masterpieces of sweet viciousness.Overall, Austen's late 18th century (*not* Victorian) work is a lovely balance of comedy and commentary, romance and drama. Fun, witty, but not swoony or saccharine, Pride &amp; Prejudice should please all but the most proud &amp; prejudiced reader (or the utterly unintelligent), for it is a charming novel, near to perfection."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I HAVE READ THIS BOOK AT LEAST THREE TIMES BY NOW AND EVERY TIME I NOTICE SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND GET MORE OUT OF IT.

JANE AUSTEN WAS OBVIOUSLY NOW AND AGAIN PICKING FUN AT THE IDEAS OF FASHIONABLE SOCIETY OF THAT TIME, ESPECIALLY ON COURTSHIP AND MARRIDGE AND MANY TIMES AT THE CHARACTERS SHE INVENTS. SHE ALSO MAKES MANY OF HER CHARACTERS REALISTIC AND WRITES HER BOOK COMPASSIONATELY SHOWING AN UNDERSTANDING OF PEOPLES EMOTIONS AND THEIR OWN OPINIONS.

Even the minor characters are immortal -- Mr. Collins, Mr. Bennett, Lady Catherine in particular -- these are characters without which our imaginations would be the poorer, would they not?As to Elizabeth, one can only lament that she is fictional, and not a real woman one could fall madly in love with...New readers of Austen, please note: although she writes about a period when women were in certain ways subordinate, she makes it clear that at least some women considered themselves to be essentially free and equal, and succeeded in holding their own, or more than their own, in their relations with the other sex. If I may venture to say so, her best women are both quite feminine and quite strong &amp; spirited. Her best men respect those qualities.

After all, I am a guy and disposed to guy-ly things like action movies and bbq ribs. Pride and Prejudice, on the other hand, is a quaint British novel about a group of daughters and their various courtships and marriages. The main plot concerns whether one of these daughters-Lizzy-can or cannot overcome her initial dislike of a good man who subsequently falls in love with her. The device by which this plot operates, and extends into over three-hundred pages, is that everyone is either too scared, or too proper, to say what they really feel. The novel is conversation, conversation and more conversation, and almost all of it in an affected upper-class British speak where one talks around things, never about them. It does not entail much action-when it does it is usually characters traveling to a new locale to talk some more, and there is no bbq to be found at all, and so as I say, it is not, and by its nature cannot be, my favorite novel of all time. And yet, it is a testament to the skill of the author (and this is the first Austen I've read, and she has lived up to the hype surrounding her name) that, despite my lack of inherent interest in the subject matter, she managed to sustain my attention and, what's more, I can say that I completely enjoyed the reading. I would even be willing to read more of the same by the same. Her characters are interesting, distinct and likable, her dialogue true, and her descriptions sparse, witty and to-the-point.I give the novel 4 out of 5 stars because I enjoyed it, liked the characters and thought it well-written overall. It only loses its one star for being about things that do not compel me particularly; I'm sure that those who are predisposed to like conversation-driven British literature about social mores and marriage will rate it the full five."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"My first experience with Jane Austen was an unfotunate one since, like many people, I had her prose rammed down my throat by a dodo high school English teacher. To make matter worse, the instructor, Ms. Z was a retired hippie who wore burlap sacks to school and worshipped Freud. At one point she had me write a paper comparing the three principle characters to the id (Lydia) the ego (Elizabeth) and the superego (Jane). At the tender age when a youth's mind is ripe for absorption and exploration, mine was already acclimated to the professional academic practice of ideological regurgitation of canonical literature.But years later, I saw the mini series and really enjoyed it. I promptly reopened the novel after many years and discovered the intensely liberating sensation of rereading required highschool texts without pedagocical intrusion.Austen's portrait of Victorian society is a sociological gem. And this time instead of taking my teacher's word for it, I actually found the book enormously funny. Much of the language, environment, and social circumstances are completely out of date, but in order to appreciate them, one must read the book in context. Some argue that it is too verbose. But there were no malls, cars or televisions in Victorian England. People entertained themselves, among other ways, by reading and writing and corresponding with each other. Words played heavily in the day to day lives of the middle class and aristocracy.I recommend that anyone who detested this book in high school, reread it and enjoy it. And I recommend that educators present this book in context so that students can appreciate it's humor, language and historical perspective."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Even if one considers Pride and Prejudice to be a cautionary tale for men to avoid getting caught up in the affairs of women, or with recognition that Austen is truly showing that women have an amazing ability to manipulate men and essentially control their world, one cannot overlook the sheer boredom that reading Pride and Prejudice creates. Set this one aside and pick up The Scarlet Letter if you are looking for a classic worth reading."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Read this and many of Jane Austen's other novels as a teenagers. Downloaded this on to my new kindle and was as enchanted as the first time I read it. A classic romantic novel with exquisite characters and reflections on the way of life of that time. Timeless and a must read for the sad romantics amoungst us."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I have been reading classics, but this did not rate for me. I read half and stopped. I found it extremely boring, the descriptions went on and on, and the book was hard to read."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"What makes a book a \\"classic\\"? Is it the language? The fame of the author? The date of publication? Or, as my high school English teacher used to say, is a book a classic \\"because it still says what it needs to say\\"? In the case of Jane Austen's masterpiece, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", I'd venture that it is all of the above. Though it was one of her first published novels, it's probably her greatest, and features some of the greatest characters ever written in what is quite possibly one of the oldest stories ever told.The plot itself is timeless. The Bennet family of Hertfordshire has five daughters, and with no sons and an estate entailed along the male line, it is important that the girls find good husbands if they don't want to be turned out of their home upon the death of their father. As is common in most families, each child is very different. Jane, the eldest, is quiet and serene, and always sees the good in everyone. Elizabeth is intelligent, while Mary is preachy and a stuck-in-the-mud. Catherine (Kitty) is a follower, and the youngest, Lydia, is an out-of-control flirt. The story begins, rather famously, with the arrival of new neighbors at Netherfield, a home a few miles away. The house has been taken by a young man with a large fortune, and almost immediately, Mrs. Bennet begins scheming that the as-yet-unknown Mr. Bingley will marry one of her daughters - preferably the eldest.As luck would have it, Bingley and Jane hit it off right away. The same cannot be said for Bingley's socially-awkward friend, Mr. Darcy, and Jane's sister Elizabeth. Almost immediately, the two get on each others' nerves, begun with Darcy insulting Lizzie within the hearing range of the latter and continuing as the Bennet family (with the exception of the two eldest) make fools of themselves at every opportunity. When a regiment of soldiers comes to town, Elizabeth is quick to enjoy conversing with a Mr. Wickham, one of Mr. Darcy's least-favorite people, and eagerly believes everything Wickham says about his former childhood friend.Of course, not everything is as it seems. Darcy and Elizabeth continue to meet over the course of the next year, while she is visiting a friend near his aunt's home, and even on his estate at Pemberley. The more they get to know each other, the more they realize they may have been mistaken about one another. And when Lizzie's youngest sister does the unthinkable, the Bennet family's misfortune may end up being the shove Elizabeth and Darcy need.The greatest thing about this book is its characters. Jane Austen was a master of the absurd, and she has captured it beautifully in the obnoxious Mr. Collins, the haughty Lady Catherine deBourgh, the foolish Mrs. Bennet, and so many others. Everyone is drawn to life, and as you are reading it, you realize that, even though the book came out two centuries ago, these are personalities that still exist in all of our lives. The dialogue is witty and to the point, and though the novel is relatively short, the action never lags. There's a reason the 1995 BBC miniseries adaptation clocks in at close to five hours; a LOT happens in this book. With the 200th anniversary of the novel happening this year, it's definitely time to take an enjoyable look back at one of the most famous - and well-loved - books ever written."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I had seen the films, and knew what was going to happen.

That means that not only is it telling an entertaining tale, it is also calling to something deep in the readers' souls. Examination of available books shows that at least a dozen sequels to it have been written; I have reviewed one and will soon review another, but I am not going to buy and read all of them. Therefore I might be missing something I would enjoy.But what I am not missing is this: Jane Austen believed in sense and sobriety. She believed that the happiest marriage was one between a man and woman who were intellectually and spiritually in tune with one another.To the readers, I say: Go thou and do likewise. Read the book. Then do what Elizabeth and Jane wold approve, and you will find yourself happier in the long run than those who ignore the principles Pride and Prejudice is meant to exhibit."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I've been a fan of Austen for 20 years and this is one of my favorites.

Jane Austin gives details of the characters' thoughts that make the story, especially the development of the two main characters, convincing. The other characters are amusing and vivid. The dialogue is delicious with treats like, \\"Is not general incivility the very essence of love?\\"In my Kindle version random line breaks occur. For example, one often encounters \\"Mr. [line break] Darcy,\\" even when \\"Mr.\\" is almost the beginning of the line.

Mrs.Bennet has five daughters and is hoping that Mr.Bingley will fall in love and marry one of them.Mr.Bingley and her eldest daughter the beautiful sweet Jane seem to strike up an attachment.When Bingley's best friend Mr.Darcy,a proud gentlemen and Mrs.Bennet's second oldest daughter a playful witty girl named Eliazbeth(the main character)meet lets just say Elizabeth thinks Darcy is the most disagreeable man she has ever meet.Including some of Austen's most memorable characters:Mrs.Bennet and her husband Mr.Bennet(the father of dry wit)make one of the funniest,unhappily married couples in history,and Mr.Collins(one of the suitors)is the model of everything a girl doesn't want in a guy.I love Elizabeth and Mr.Darcy.They have some of the most bewitching conversations and never has Austen's ear for dialogue been better then in her second novel.I was charmed by Pride and Prejudice and hope you will be too."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"This is one of the excellent works that has to be studied for chosen words. I have studied it. I have checked all the definitions that I didn't know. She has used rich vocabulary that adds so much. If you don't check the meaning, you will lose on the context of it. You need to think constantly and be alert while reading. Words put weight on the meaning that when you're tired, you might not understand fully what the author has meant. Understanding its meaning gives you so much pleasure.The author states the situation the character is in by finding the perfect word to describe it. The words chosen were so perfectly used in given situations.Some dialogues may seem unnatural of the words spoken. Did people really talk this way? But after getting deeper into her work, you just get used to it like to the commodity in everyday life.I loved in Jane's work the development of the characters. It is extraordinary and so complex. The author has captured in most not an ordinary way of life back then making it in every sense very realistic.The feelings of being modest, shy, and lacking self-confidence when in love were perfectly presented. Readers who look for romance won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"I read this book quite a while ago, in fact when i was in year 9 and my older sister was studying it for GCSE, i saw the book and seeing as i was bored i decided to read it. to my surprise i actually liked it. it turned out to be very interesting and amusing at times too. the relationship between Darcy and Lizzy interested me very much as i found Lizzy's retorts and critical behaviour great as i am a great believer of speaking your views. For Lizzy to do that in that kind of society was very brave of her and i admired her for it. Since then i have read this book so many times it's unbelievable and it still interests me greatly. i never get bored with the storyline and i live along with the characters and feel for them as if i was reading the book for the first time. It's an absolute classic and i love it. i really recommend everyone to read it. don't be put off by the fact that it is set in old times. U will be pleasantly surprised to find that it's actually great."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Austin lays out all of her witt and charm within the first three pages of this novel and by the third and fourth chapters you won't be able to put the book down.

It seems that many other students do not particularly like the novel, especially the male crowd. If my class was ever assigned P&amp;P I am sure that there would be many complaints from my classmates... but they complain about every novel we are assigned, and therefore I can never really trust their opinion. If you are a student looking to read P&amp;P I highly recommend it. My own ideas on this novel are quite favorable. I am sorry that not everyone has a taste for Austen. I consider her one of the best authors who ever lived. I enjoyed reading Pride and Prejudice as well as other Austen novels. Her novels, especiall P&amp;P, are quite funny and I have often found myself laughing outloud on many occasions (which is not an easy feat). Pride and Prejudice is not a novel to be over looked."},{"Title":"Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is one of the finest of Jane Austen's work. The novel centres around the Bennet family, who are the principal inhabitants of the village of Longbourn. Mrs. Bennet is a marriage obsessed mother, whose dearest wish is to see her five daughters married and settled. As it is, the Longbourn estate is entailed on a distant male cousin, for Mr. and Mrs. Bennet lack a male heir. This makes the five sisters, Jane, Elizabeth, Mary, Kitty and Lydia, increasingly dependent on husbands to provide for them, if their father was to die. We see the different personalities of the five sisters, but the two that stand out are the two eldest, Jane and Elizabeth. Elizabeth Bennet, the heroine of the novel, challenges and changes the established rules of class barriers. Her marriage to Mr. Darcy, an aristocrat who has an income of \\"ten thousand a year,\\" allows Elizabeth to climb the social ladder and cross social boundaries, despite the strictly stratified class lines of Austen's time. Elizabeth's eldest sister Jane, also makes an advantageous match with Mr. Bingley, a member of the noveau riche. Times were changing even as Jane Austen was writing. Although Mr. Darcy's aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, lamented over her nephew's and Elizabeth's engagement, her angry objections were overruled. The ancient aristocratic voice became faint and was silenced as times changed."}]`),E={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:P},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:j,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},C=["disabled"],S={key:0},B={key:1};function W(n,o,s,u,r,i){const c=f("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",M,[(e(!0),t(y,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),g(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",B,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",S,"See more"))],8,C)):b("",!0)])}const x=d(E,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-97b26f85"]]),H=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/37.md","filePath":"quotes/37.md"}'),N={name:"quotes/37.md"},D=Object.assign(N,{setup(n){return(o,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[p(x)]))}});export{H as __pageData,D as default};
