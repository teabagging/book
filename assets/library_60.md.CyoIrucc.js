Unfortunately, _House of the Seven Mables_ is not up to par, lacking much of the warmth and humour, and, yes, direction of the books in the rest of the series.In the latest of a chain of good ideas that turn out badly, Jane and her sidekick Shelley Nowack get roped into acting as decorators for a friend who is remodeling a Victorian Monstrosity. An iffy proposition from the start, the project goes increasingly sour as Jane and Shelley discover that the contractor is incompetent and the work is being sabotaged by persons unknown. Soon enough someone turns up dead and to protect their own interests -- as well as their skins -- the two friends turn their talents towards solving the crime.The premise is not a bad one, but the work as a whole borders on the incoherent, lacking discernable pattern and full of random detail that adds nothing to the plot. The characters are lackluster and their motivations, where they appear, do not contribute to the mystery. Many of the situations and characters are stereotyped. I was particularly put off by the portrayal of feminism, which poked mean-natured fun at the concept and seemed to say that only whining incompetent women would embrace the title, while real women have no need for that kind of nonsense.I also felt that the job-site setting was poorly researched and inaccurately portrayed. With a husband in the building trades, I could not help but wonder how anyone in his or her right mind could have been roped into such a situation in the first place. That such a disaster as the remodeling project was allowed to continue as long as it did without the homeowner's taking action stretched my suspension of disbelief to the breaking point.Jane and Shelley spend lots of time doing random things that have nothing to do with the matter at hand, almost as if they don't find the actual crime very interesting. I'm sorry to say, it's not. To anyone paying attention, the solution is evident from about chapter five. This would have been okay if the book had put together successive pieces of the puzzle in a slow revelation of complex motive and complex relationships, but it didn't. Jane literally stumbles on the solution by accident in what can best be called an anticlimax.I was still amused by this book and I give it three stars rather than two because I like the series and care about the characters. But it's a disappointment."},{"Title":"The House of Seven Mabels (Jane Jeffry Mystery Series #13)","review":"Jane Jeffry and her neighbor Shelley are offered the opportunity to be the interior decorators for a large old home which their acqaintance Bitsy is redoing. Their children are growing older and more independent so these moms have more time to do some things they want to do. The problem is that they are not sure that this project is such a good idea. When they go to see the house, they are discouraged by the poor condition that it's in. Also some strange things are happening on the job site which convince them that someone is sabatoging Bitsy's efforts. Added to this, they are put off by the bossy and incompetant manner of the contractor, Sandy. When a murder occurs, things become even more grim. Jane and Shelley turn from decorators to investigators and finally, quite by accident, Jane solves the murder. This is not Jill Churchill's best effort, but Jane Jeffry fans will probably want to read it. The solution is presented very abruptly at the end, without much leading up to it. Also there is not quite as much humor in this book as in some of the previous ones in the series."},{"Title":"The House of Seven Mabels (Jane Jeffry Mystery Series #13)","review":"Sadly, what I felt when I finished this latest Jane Jeffry mystery novel was frustration and confusion. Whatever is going on with Jill Churchill? The Jane Jeffry mystery books used to be one of my favourites (as well as an automatic buy for me). But not anymore. I found it very hard to believe that the authour who wrote \\"Grime and Punishment,\\" \\"A Quiche Before Dying\\" and \\"The Class Menagerie\\" also wrote this very sad and unsatisfactory work.Feeling bored and restless (Jane is suddenly confronted with the fact that soon her house will be empty of children and that she has yet to accomplish anything noteworthy besides being a good mother), Jane Jeffry reluctantly agrees to help her best friend and neighbour Shelley tackle the redecorating of an old Victorian house in their neighbourhood. The house is an eyesore and should have been torn down long ago. But now, incredibly rich and recently divorced Bitsy Burnside (a woman who usually gives Jane heartburn) has decided to restore and renovate the house and use it for business purposes. And she wants Shelley and Jane to do the redecorating. Jane is leery but Shelley is excited at the prospect of shopping at someone else's expense. And so Jane soon finds herself a reluctant partner in this latest enterprise. But too many things about this project cause both Jane and Shelley to wonder if it would be wiser to pull out fast -- for example, gung-ho about certain \\"feminist\\" ideas that she has picked up, Bitsy has decided to hire an all female crew of workers (Jane and Shelley are not at all certain about the wisdom of that particular move); the contractor, Sandra Anderson, strikes them as being both incompetent and strange; and someone has been playing a series of dangerous pranks on the workers. And the pranks result in a death...The saddest thing about this book was that it mirrored Jane's feelings of restlessness and boredom -- that spark of lively humour that characterised previous Jane Jeffry novels was completely absent. Add to that the fact that Shelley's character has somehow gone beyond ordinary bossiness into the realm of almost unpleasant, and I began to wonder if Jill Churchill had actually written this book! The mystery went no where for much of the book: Jane and Shelley would take a stab at 'interviewing' the suspects, and then do other things (shop, eat, garden, etc) and then look at the mystery from different angles before giving up for a good night's sleep.And when they finally crack the case, it is because Jane stumbles onto the answer by accident -- no taxing of the 'little grey cells.' But my biggest criticism was that Jill Churchill stereotyped the so-called 'feminists' in this novel. They were the usual short-haired, strident, angry male haters who may be lesbians, that the main stream media usually portrays all feminists to be.Unfortunately \\"The House of Seven Mabels,\\" does not compare well, esp when you consider the previous Jane Jeffrey mystery novels (those were real gems). And that is a real shame."},{"Title":"The House of Seven Mabels (Jane Jeffry Mystery Series #13)","review":"The 13th book in the Jane Jeffrey shows Jane and her best friend Shelley Nowack at work again. These two suburban mothers are asked to help old friend, Bitsy, renovate/redecorate her Victorian home and the two, looking for something to ease their boredom, agree to help. It seems that Bitsy only wants female contractors working on the house, and when Jane and Shelley show up, they realize that the lead contractor is a bit too demanding. When she ends up dead, Jane and Shelley once again are determined to find a killer. Add to this the fact that all of the renovations are going wrong (with a prankster adding to the mess), and Jane again finds herself in a situation she feels she has to \\"fix\\".I have enjoyed each of the books in this series more for the relationships between the characters rather than the suspense of the mysteries. This was a good addition to the series, and I like the fact that Jane is becoming more independent (she keeps working on her book) and actually buys herself and her son computers. If Jane would only buy herself a new car, she would be all set! On the whole, I would recommend reading this book if you enjoy cozy mysteries even if you have not read any of the previous books in this series.The first book in this series is \\"Grime and Punishment\\".

I enjoyed the writing and story and the only weaknesses I saw was that I couldn't understand why Jane would continue to go along with Shelly's project when she had such strong reservations. Also, I figured out who the killer was soon after she was introduced (and I guess that's kind of a biggie in a mystery). There were some distracting editing flubs too. But I still liked it enough that I will read the other books in the series.I found a story featuring women in non-traditional businesses appealing. And I appreciated the length. Some seem to feel a book is better the longer it is, no matter how the story drags in some parts. I say get to the point and get it over with. Thank you Miss Churchill.C.M.

Most of us can do that when we get into something new and exciting, if only for a little while, then we generally come back to earth and evaluate whether or not this new &quot;thing&quot; is something in which we can truly believe and support.Off my soapbox and back to the book and Jane: I love Jane and Shelley and all the crazy situations they usually find themselves in. I did sort of like this book; but I have to say that I thought it was too short and, therefore, a bit of a cheat. I didn't like the way it ended either -- but up until the last couple of chapters or so, I was still having a good time. Maybe the next one will be better. We true fans can only hope..."},{"Title":"The House of Seven Mabels (Jane Jeffry Mystery Series #13)","review":"Jill Churchill's &quot;House of the Seven Mabels&quot; seems to be a little lacking in her usual ingredients of tongue-in-cheek humor and enjoyable fun.

If you're a fan, you'll read it, but be prepared to be disappointed. The story is weak and formulaic, the mystery is contrived, the characters don't seem as likable as before.

Hopefully, if this series continues, the next entry won't be such a paint-by-number effort."},{"Title":"The House of Seven Mabels (Jane Jeffry Mystery Series #13)","review":"I came across this book at a sale; after reading the first few chapters, I checked Amazon and was disappointed to find that it was still in print. Jane seems like a fifties' holdover, and the descriptions of the many meals and snacks are simply tedious. The worst aspect of this book isn't even the shoddy editing--it's the tone. The anti-feminist take here is appalling."},{"Title":"The House of Seven Mabels (Jane Jeffry Mystery Series #13)","review":"I have liked the character Jane Jeffrey and her pal and neighbor Shelley. And this is an easy read with the comfort of known characters growing older and progressing as individual women who still find a home and family to be a good center. The mystery here is not such a big suspenseful draw, just the involvement of the two friends in a possible money-making scheme, ring led by Shelley, with Jane along for the ride, and maybe the profit. The plot revolves around this would-be job and the unusual, almost all woman crew of renovators who are already on the payroll. But the vandalism of the site and the one murder take a gentle route to solution. This is no great puzzler, much less suspenseful horror. Rather domestic in its scope.Jane's interaction with her children and their maturation, her comfortable relationship with detective Mel, her entry into the real computer age and her developing novel, make for a fast and easy diversion.This is not the best of Churchill. In fact, mystery is just coincidental to the plot, it seems. But I do think it is good enough to divert the mind from the frustrations of the world for a while."},{"Title":"The House of Seven Mabels (Jane Jeffry Mystery Series #13)","review":"I have read all the books in this series and this was the weakest. I couldn't stay with it and skipped ahead to the end.

This entry is a clunker. I guess I keep reading the series for the prospect of a good book coming along; every once in a while one does. Churchill really needs to stop bragging about her parents in the diplomatic corps, and I can definitely do without her incessant snarky comments about her daughter (in contrast to her huge love for her apparently saintly sons). She also needs a better editor. Almost every dialog bit in this series begins with Shelley saying, &quot;Jane,--&quot; or Jane saying, &quot;Shelley, --&quot; This book was particularly grating in its gratuitous (and passe) attack on feminism, which Churchill apparently regards as a huge farce, as she does *every* social concern. Give the woman a t.v. set and a bag of chips and she's happy! Jane Jeffrey is more trailer park than she knows."},{"Title":"The House of Seven Mabels (Jane Jeffry Mystery Series #13)","review":"Homophobic. Xenophobic. Definitely not as good as the other Jane Jeffrey mysteries."},{"Title":"The House of Seven Mabels (Jane Jeffry Mystery Series #13)","review":"After her husband died, Jane Jeffrey was left to bring up their three children alone. Now her eldest son is in his second year of college while her only daughter is a senior in high school and the youngest child is in ninth grade. She along with her neighbor and best friend Shelley suffer from a form of empty nest syndrome and want to do something interesting with their free time.When Bitsy Burnside contacts them to decorate a dilapidated old Victorian house, Shelly is intrigued and Jane sees the possibilities. However from the first day they enter the house things go wrong. When the contractor is found dead at the bottom of the basement stairs, Jane knows that somebody killed her. However, whom is nearly impossible as the victim was such an obnoxious individual, there is a plenty of suspects. Soon a series of malicious pranks occur and nobody knows who is behind them or if it was the same person who killed the contractor.Anyone who likes a cerebral amateur sleuth novel with little violence will want to read THE HOUSE OF SEVEN MABELS. This is a lighthearted cozy, the perfect book for beach reading. The friends of Jane and Shelly come across as real and believable while the story line is filled with enough unexpected twists and turns to keep readers turning the pages. Jill Churchill imbues her plot with enough humor to have her audience chuckling out loud.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The House of Seven Mabels (Jane Jeffry Mystery Series #13)","review":"Character crankiness captures the reader as it carries through funny, foot-dragging dialogues, first featuring Jane Jeffry in soliloquy, then adding Shelley's two-cent counterpoint over coffee.Any awareness of a reality beyond reading melts like table butter, spreading into conversations at a gourmet luncheon business meeting. Jane and Shelley had skeptically agreed to join a couple hardcore feminists to discuss participation in a construction venture. As the women try to lure Jane & Shelley into their mad project of remodeling and decorating a dilapidated mansion, the reader's taste buds are bated by Jane's descriptions of luncheon plate contents towering toward culinary pinnacles.Churchill has an uncanny ability to write with such a flowing, lighthearted ease that her plots and characters (even when shrouded in the miasma of moodiness) skip along merrily, just two suburban housewives dining casually around danger, or shopping across a stage.Having read some of the Amazon reviews on this book, I was ready to chuckle at Jane's sour milk mood expressing itself entertainingly through satiric sneers against certain sub-cultural agendas which prodded the sore spots in Jane's contemplations of an \\"empty nest\\" coming soon.It doesn't take a brain-iac to catch the depth being deftly woven through themes rising crisply from the novel's title, as they surge subtly through the first few pages of Jane's cranky anticipations of adjustment to diminishing motherhood; tying into Shelley's car screeching into her driveway (seeming on two wheels); then pausing over the posh lunch with the feminists.Jane isn't spitefully bashing hardcore feminism in this novel. She's understandably reacting viscerally to the contrast between her life passages and the pedestals which some personalities seem to have the privilege to preen and prod upon.Churchill's style is sneaky, subtle and smooth. Love the continued slow-perk sharing of daily routines between Jane and Shelley, two friends whose personalities should clash, clamor, and clang. Instead this unlikely pair is entertained more than irritated by the other's foibles as they saunter through simple activities, or argue over committing to overwhelming projects which many women would die for but don't have the freedom, opportunities, or time to enjoy (be hired as decorators in a remodel of an old mansion? Yes!).Churchill continues to capture with her toe-tapping of terribly touchy issues, lightly exposing the barefoot essence of pros and cons, without kicking the door down with her personal bias, a bias which is entertainingly clarified with humor through the sarcastic snips and snide asides written gracefully enough to offer no offense to un-invested readers, whatever his/her political-social prejudice.Yet someone in the story was offended enough by something to find a cause to kill.The way Churchill deals with hard-core feminism reminds me of a passage in Ayn Rand's ATLAS SHRUGGED in which Dagney Taggert pauses in temporary terror over tangible concerns, as she suddenly realizes that women don't run railroads. Then she recalls that she has been, in reality, running her father's industrial empire; her brother, as President, has always been a figurehead fool. Her panic discounted in a heartbeat of deduction, Dagney spits, \\"To hell with that,\\" instantly emerging beyond all concerns about her gender, satisfied to C.E.O behind the scenes.At the point of dealing most directly with this issue in Mabels, Jane asks a couple of the women carpenters if they had trouble working in a male dominated industry, to which they replied that once a contractor saw their impressive portfolios, the gender question was simply released; respect and need for competence took precedence.The seven Mabels caricatures move through the plot in well drawn style, fleshed-out into a Norman Rockwell style of living types. The reading is easy, relaxing, and involving; the themes have depth without investing in irritating pushes toward political agendas; the mystery is suspenseful without going overboard, trying too hard to outdo the ultimate in convolutions in the genre.Refreshing, delightful, insightful, almost as good as a simple, satisfying life, Churchill's seven Mabels paint every day reality into letters on a page, without once slipping on a banana peel into a boring passage of prose.How does she do this; how does Jill Churchill make depth and complexity look so simple, fun, and easy!With Awe,Linda G. Shelnutt"},{"Title":"The House of Seven Mabels (Jane Jeffry Mystery Series #13)","review":"I just finished reading this book and I have to agree that it isn't up to the same standard as the previous Jane Jeffry books. I have noticed this in a lot of different series though. We, the readers, love a series so the author puts out a book a year--and we're thrilled! However, it might be wiser sometimes for the author to wait a little longer if her story isn't really &quot;gelling&quot; as well as it could. (I felt the same way about the last &quot;Mrs. Pollifax&quot; book by Dorothy Gilman.)I enjoyed this book mainly because I've enjoyed this series and like the characters. I have to admit I didn't like the &quot;snobbish&quot; comment about buffets having terrible food, but maybe where I live the buffets have better food. :-)The story line is always a little fantastical for Jane Jeffry and her friend, in my opinion, but this one didn't really make the mystery *interesting*. I know NOTHING about building and remodeling and things but even I wondered why they would rewrite their contract and not get a lawyer to look at it when they said Bitsy should have. ???? I would have enjoyed a little more with Jane's kids and Mel too.If you love Jane Jeffry, you'll want to read this book just because it's part of the series.

Never yet met one who insisted on calling women by men's names.) They don't use any of their own knowledge to solve the mystery--and in fact they never do. It's solved by sheer accident, as if the writer suddenly said to herself, &quot;Oops! Forgot to reveal the murderer!&quot;I have really enjoyed all the other books in this series (some more, some less, but I enjoyed them). &quot;Mulch Ado About Nothing&quot; was a bit weak.

I guess.See, I REALLY disliked the one prior to this, \\"Mulch Ado About Nothing\\" -- it was tedious, not very interesting, and I didn't even much like Jane in it, which was VERY disappointing. I didn't know what to expect with \\"Mabels,\\" but overall it was a good read.With one kid in college, another in high school, and the third growing up fast, Jane Jeffry is starting to realize she must fill her days with something else once her kids are grown and gone. Her neighbor/best friend Shelley suggests they take on the decorating of an ugly, crumbling old Victorian house nearby that's being renovated by an old friend they haven't heard from in years, Bitsy Burnside. Bitsy and her supremely-feminist contractor Sandra (call her \\"Sandy\\") have commandeered an all-female crew for the renovation, and upon visiting the house Jane and Shelley begin to see that maybe Bitsy has gotten herself into more than she bargained for.In the first place, the house is a total wreck, barely worthy of saving. Secondly, Bitsy's contractor Sandy has pretty much alienated -- or caused the ire of -- nearly the entire crew, through her over-the-top feminist ramblings and lack of any real knowledge in the construction business. Even Jane and Shelley have second thoughts when they see their contracts, which are badly and unprofessionally written.Third and most important, a series of \\"accidents\\" have been plaguing the worksite from the beginning, and it's become apparent that someone is trying to sabotage the project. When Sandy the Contractor is suddenly found dead at the bottom of the basement stairs, Jane and Shelley are convinced it was no accident, and set out with Jane's policeman-boyfriend Mel to figure out the mystery.I have always enjoyed Churchill's writing, and in that sense \\"Mabels\\" is no exception. But the plotting is very sparse, with (for the first time in a Churchill book, for me) the identity of the killer VERY easy to spot early on (just look for the person with the only REAL possible motive that you've been made aware of while reading). I wasn't too bothered by the fact that the murder took almost a hundred pages to happen - and I don't agree with the reviewers that have said the feminism angle was stereotyped with lesbians, etc. ---But, I DO feel that Jill Churchill's \\"Jane Jeffry\\" series is struggling, really suffering, maybe from her concentration also on her \\"Grace and Favor\\" mysteries. Ever since those began, the \\"Jany Jeffry\\" series (to me) has been sub-standard, and the books now seem sort of rushed. The same thing has happened with Lydia Adamson and the \\"Alice Nestleton\\" series; a major shame for it to happen here, too.Oh, and one note to those people who have complained about the typographical errors in this book -- VERY true, and VERY irritating; the typos and missing words and bad grammer in this edition are really distracting, and destroy the mood of the book at times. But anyone who writes (as I do) will tell you, it is THE AUTHOR who copy-edits and approves the final galleys of his/her book, so the responsibility for the many, MANY errors in \\"Mabels\\" probably rests with Ms. Churchill.Again, another instance - maybe? - of Ms. Churchill's divided attention costing her the quality of her books.

There is good propaganda in the account, but that does not really detract from the story, and I found that the book was pageturny. I see it was republshed in 1988 and I wonder if the republication included an account of what happened to the people who were caught up in the daring and courageous work the women were doing."},{"Title":"Paris Underground","review":"This is not a review, but a warning to potential purchasers: you should know that this book, listed as a hardcover for a cover price of over $30, is in fact a Scribner paperback. I learned that when I sent it to my mother."},{"Title":"Bowhunting's Whitetail Masters: The Techniques, Secrets and Successes of the Most Skilled Whitetail Bowhunters in America","review":"This is not the typical deer hunting how-to manual. Bertalan goes far beyond the world of 300 yard rifle shots and endorsement-ridden outdoor magazine articles as he explores how twelve master bowhunters operate inside that zone of extreme intensity the surrounds the trophy whitetail buck, where a hunter's single stray movement or the most subtle shift in breeze can end a season. Those of us who have bowhunted across North America and beyond know that the hunter who consistently, year in and year out, bags a trophy whitetail buck with bow and arrow, can stand up against any hunter, anywhere, from any species, past or present. Bertalan does a great job in this book as he tells the story of each master hunter. Through these stories, the reader comes to know the approaches, philosophies, and techniques that these hunters have used to take craft to the level of fine art. Bowhunting's Whitetail Masters is for hard-core, dedicated, veteran bowhunters. If you consider yourself to be one, you owe it to yourself to read it. Let Bertalan show you what it takes to be great."},{"Title":"Bowhunting's Whitetail Masters: The Techniques, Secrets and Successes of the Most Skilled Whitetail Bowhunters in America","review":"This is not your typical how-to deer hunting manual. You won't find step-by-step instructions, equipment lists, endless endorsements, etc. What you will find is a book of incredibly detailed non-fiction hunting stories. The stories chronicle how twelve master bowmen have transformed whitetail hunting from craft to art. Only by reading the stories do you come to understand each hunter's individual approach, technique, and philosophy. Only by reading the stories do you learn. This book is for hard-core, devoted, veteran bowhunters, because it endeavors to move far beyond the tired &quot;Here's where you should put your treestand&quot; formula so frequently rehashed in outdoor magazines and manuals. Those of us who have bowhunted across North America and beyond know that bowhunters who year in and year out kill trophy class whitetail bucks can hold their own with any hunter, anywhere, from any species, past or present. Such hunters are predators who have developed rare skill.Bowhunting's Whitetail Masters takes you far away from the 300 yard rifle shots and places you inside that zone where a hunter's smallest stray movement or the slightest shift in breeze can make all the difference. I myself find it intoxicating to read about how exceptionally skilled hunters navigate and operate within this zone to become what they are: whitetail masters. Bertalan has done a great job."},{"Title":"Vocabulary Booster","review":"I found this Vocabulary Booster CD to be helpful and convenient in mastering some of the words that commonly come up on the SAT and in English and History. It has 200 vocabulary words on it and they are a good assortment of short words like &quot;abash&quot;, &quot;coup&quot;, and &quot;ebb&quot;, and longer ones like &quot;deleterious&quot;, &quot;etymology&quot;, and &quot;magnanimous.&quot; It also has a good mix of adjectives, verbs, and nouns. Although I knew some of the words already, all of them are high-school or college-level words that are good to know not only for the test but for reading or writing essays.The CD is well-paced, neither too fast or too slow. The reader states each word carefully twice and gives its part of speech before defining it. This way you can hear the pronunciation and prepare for the meaning and sentence that follow. Most of the sentences use catchy phrases that help you lock the word into memory by repeating the word or its forms and rhyming them. The rhymes are colorful and logical but not silly. For some of the words, the CD also mentions the roots or prefixes, and special uses of the word.One reason the CD is convenient to use because the words are read in alphabetic order. So if you're interrupted by the telephone, you can stop it and come back to it and remember how far along you were. This also makes it easy to jump back or forward to a particular vocabulary word. It's good to listen to even when you have only 10 or 15 spare minutes, and you can easily listen to it when you're walking, jogging, or riding in a car, bus, or train. But whether you listen to it for a short time or for the entire 74 minutes, you can always adjust to skip words you've already mastered or review ones you've forgotten.The CD cover lists all of the vocabulary words. You might be able to fit this little pamphlet into your shirt pocket, but I Xeroxed it to keep in a notebook in case I lost it. It's very handy to glance at if you can't bring the CD with you.This CD is good not just for the SAT or vocabulary tests, but also as a refresher. Even after you already know the words, you can listen to the CD to help remind you to use the words. They help you express your meaning better in essays.All in all, this CD is easy to understand and easy to use. It definitely helps."},{"Title":"Vocabulary Booster","review":"As a high school student preparing for the SATs, I found the Vocabulary Booster CD to be a great way to improve my vocabulary. It really helped a lot, and I managed to raise my verbal score by 90 points! I would recommend this CD to anyone who wants to raise their SAT scores."},{"Title":"Vocabulary Booster","review":"The Vocabulary Booster CD is one educational resource that will surely be put to use because the student can listen to it while doing almost anything. The words are clearly enunciated by McKenna, the pace is deliberate enough to let the meanings sink in, and the usages are cleverly composed to make the definitions as memorable as possible. As someone with children approaching SAT age, I will certainly have my kids use this before taking the test."},{"Title":"Treasury of Religious Quotations","review":"This is one of three books of religious quotations I keep handy for preparing my sermons and other religious writings. The other two are The Quotable Spirit (Lorie &amp; Mascetti) and The Routledge Dictionary of Religious and Spiritual Quotations (Parrinder).Tomlinson is a writer and editor who has produced books of quotations on several other subjects. This book was especially attractive to me because Tomlinson is a Unitarian Universalist (also my denomination).The 2000+ quotes are grouped into 149 topics listed alphabetically. Within each topic, quotations are further separated by religious or philosophical tradition. So if I want a Buddhist or Moslem perspective about something, it is easy to find. Conversely, if you want only Christian quotes, you can easily ignore the other subjects. Tomlinson uses 30 different religious/philosophical classifications, and each topic has quotes from Christianity and 1 to 8 other traditions. Some of the classifications are quite rare; for example, only quotes from Albert Einstein are given the label &quot;Cosmic.&quot;Christian quotations make up a significant portion of the book. Also, the King James translations of the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) are used instead of Jewish translations. Tomlinson categorizes these as &quot;Christianity/Judaism&quot; and places them next to the Christian quotations instead of using &quot;Judaism/Christianity&quot; and placing them next to the Jewish quotations. Native American traditions are virtually ignored, with only one Leni-Lenapi and two Navajo quotes. Other major and minor traditions fall between these extremes.Several appendices provide additional information. There are &quot;thumbnail&quot; biographies (2-4 lines) of the 170 people who are cited more than twice and a paragraph on each of the 30 religious/philosophical classifications. Full bibliographic information is provided for the 250 sources used to compile the collection. An author/title index is also included.The sources most frequently cited (other than scriptures or founders of world religions) are: Henry Ward Beecher, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Martin Buber, George Buttrick, G. K. Chesterton, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Harry Emerson Fosdick, Abraham Johsua Heschel, William Ralph Inge, Rufus M. Jones, Hans Kung, Maimonides, Thomas Merton, Reinhold Niebuhr, Blaise Pascal, Franz Rosenzweig, Jean Jacques Rousseau, William Shakespeare, Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, Thomas a Kempis, and Paul Tillich."},{"Title":"Treasury of Religious Quotations","review":"I ordered the product/ Paid for the product/ received the product/ like what I received/ Makes me a happy camper/ nuff said"},{"Title":"The best of Patricia Kristoffersen","review":"I love this book, the title says it all.

L. Davis's later work reads like he was trying to make a living, churning out the pages and events which seem hollow. This epic follows the characters from Cherokee country of Georgia through much of the Southeast, experiencing Americana and various challenges. Much of it seems pointless. You can do better.Davis fans will find his traits demonstrated: long sentences, rich descriptions of nature--both the beautiful and the blighted, minor characters that are humorous caricatures, and descriptions of place and history.This is a little-known and under-appreciated author whose works are not of even quality. Following is my list of his works that I've read, in order of my esteem from highest to lowest.1. The Homestead Orchard--Humorous, sad, joyous, beautifully crafted short story about a father and son.2. Old Man Isbell's Wife--Humorous short story3. Bench Squatters--short story about a single dad and his kids4. Flying Switch--action-packed hilarious short story5. Open Winter--sweet & realistic short story about moving a herd of horses6. Harp of a Thousand Strings--sweeping novel of the French Revolution related to the American experience7. Winds Of Morning--novel8. Several other short stories9. The Distant Music--saga-like novel of an Oregon family's generations10. Beulah Land--saga-like novel of America's westward movement11. All of Davis's essays--not profound but they reveal Davis's thinking12. The Kettle of Fire--a fictional legend that doesn't really work13. Honey in the Horn--spare yourself! Saga-like, overlong, random, Pulitzer-prize winning, historically inaccurate, pointlessTo access the short stories, get a copy of his Collected Essays and Short Stories, published by the University of Idaho Press. Even better, if you can find it at a reasonable price, buy a copy of Davis's short story collection, Team Bells Woke Me (currently the best Amazon Marketplace price is $19.21, but this gets you Bench Squatters, Flying Switch, and some other lesser pieces not in the Collected Essays and Short Stories)."},{"Title":"Beulah land (Pocket book)","review":"it's about an indian girl named Ruhama.

Why is it a phenomenon? Essentially, fractional reserve banking is the ability to create money out of thin air. Or more accurately, the license to create money out of thin air. Black's Law Dictionary defines &quot;license&quot; as, &quot;The permission by competent authority to do an act which without such permission, would be illegal.&quot; But it isn't the people doing this. It is the bankers courtesy of the Federal Reserve Act. People like the Rockefellers, Nelson W. Aldrich, J.P. Morgan and Paul Warburg. This books goes into the details. Fantastic information explaining the history of money, where the national debt comes from, why statists depise gold and silver and suggestions on what you can do about the problem of fiat currency. I, above all things, stopped using Federal Reserve Notes and credit cards and started using the Liberty Dollar. I signed up as an associate two years ago. It has been a fun and informative journey. I also have met Bernard von NotHaus on several occassions."},{"Title":"The Liberty Dollar Solution To The Federal Reserve","review":"Great book I can now see that we need to get back to having our money backed by gold and silver I have used Liberty Dollars in many states and find that many like what it stands for.http://www.chooney.com/liberty/liberty1.htmlBuy this book you wont go wrong one you read it you will want touse Liberty Dollars also and we all will take back our money one Liberty Dollar at a time"},{"Title":"The Liberty Dollar Solution To The Federal Reserve","review":"A riveting book that will open your eyes to the ecomomic problems in our society and how we got here.

Edward Griffin, vonNothaus presents a compelling case that our current monetary system is destined to the predictable busts historically associated with fiat currencies which have been foisted upon societies long past.As the title states, this book provides a solution.And the solution simply stated is that our economy can only be salvaged with the re-introduction of a commodity based currency as called for in the U.S. Constitution.I have read this book three times so far. I am reading it for the fourth time, and I learn something new every time."},{"Title":"The Liberty Dollar Solution To The Federal Reserve","review":"Bernard von Nothaus had an ambitous plan to provide an alternative currency to the ever depreciating US dollar. In this book, he and others discuss some of the theory of money, and why our currency has depreciated dramatically since the Federal Reserve was created in 1913.He also dicusses his Liberty Dollar program, which began in 1998 and continued until 2009, putting millions of his new currency into use.Readers should know that the program described in the book no longer exists. After 11 years of success, Mr. Nothaus was arrested and convicted of counterfeiting and other charges, however unfairly, and his inventory of millions of dollars of silver coins was seized by the Secret Service. An interesting look at a very original thinker who tried to change our monetary system for the better."},{"Title":"The Liberty Dollar Solution To The Federal Reserve","review":"This book, by far, hits the nail on the proverbial head. What Alan Greenspan wrote in 1966 (included in this book) is prophetic and sobering. What is unique is for someone to propose a logical, peaceful solution. Until now there have been theories and conjecture on what must occur or which tools are needed for the population to take back their economic freedom. This book shows you the tool and how to use it; a proven system, accepted by the majority of business owners, and fun to use.

I have had no injuries, excessive soreness or fatigue or any other problems. His recommendations on duration, pacing, lifting techniques, frequency and intensity are very sensible.

Extra equipment is kept at the bare minimum- they use only dumbbells and a simple bench- you could adjust this around a chair if you don't want to go garage saling for a used exercise bench (this is what I am going to do- you can get them for $20-50 sometimes used!).

In \\"The Great Dumbbell Handbook\\" the exercises focus on the shoulders, rotator cuff, chest, back, biceps, triceps, forearms, legs and core (stomach). Most of the exercises can be done by using a chair but there are a few that require a \\"flat to incline bench.\\"I started out using 5 lb weights and did 8 reps. You can build up to two sets of 15 reps and use whatever weight feels comfortable to you. Some of the exercise you might recognize include:Upright RowShoulder PressBench PressFlyesStanding Bicep CurlLungeYou can't really do the reverse leg lift without a \\"flat to incline bench\\" but it looked like it wouldn't be good for the lower back anyway. Some of the exercises have an advanced section as well as the beginner exercise. For example the \\"standing bent-over flyes\\" shows the exercise done while you keep your back at a 30-degree angle. The alternative is to do the exercise with your back at a 45-90 degree angle. It is a small change to make if you want to try the advanced version.This full-color book has pictures of each exercise along with step-by-step instructions. As with the Medicine Ball Workout and the Stretch Tubing Workout, the easiest way to use this book (so it stays open) is to cut it in half. Then, simply punch holes in the corner of each page and put it on a metal ring.

But the pages are full of great information. In fact, I've read much larger books with far less valuable information.To begin with, the book uses vivid, well-chosen color and all of the photos are color photos. It starts with a large graphic in color of the human body --- showing all of the muscles and muscle groups. It takes up two pages, one for the front of the body and one for the back.Then it shows you what you'll need or might need in your dumbbell lifting. For many, this is basic. But it's great to have it nonetheless. Then it shows you how to set up a program. This is one of the hardest part of weightlifting. This book makes it easy and fun. What's more, it goes more in depth than many other books I've read.The author then takes you into stretching. Lots of wonderful stretches are described in detail and you see pictures of them being done. It tells you exactly how to do each stretch and gives you cautions when necessary.Finally you get into the dumbbell exercises. They're divided up by muscle groups. This makes it quick and easy when you're in the weight room. It shows you the correct way to do the lift and gives you any cautions that might be necessary.The one and only thing I didn't find that I would like to have found in the book was that there are no modifications to any exercises shown or discussed. You may not need them but some people do. So you may want to invest in a book that shows modifications.Warnings are in red. So when you see them, read them! There are not many. But when you see one, you need to use caution.Each exercise is shown in the beginning, middle and finish stage. It's fully described and instructed. Moreover, up in the upper right corner in a yellow box you'll find the muscles worked! There is a complete exercise on each page.This little book is just wonderful. I love it and I've been lifting most all of my life --- and that's a few years. If you buy no other book on lifting weights (specifically dumbbells), buy this one. Keep it handy at all times.It's easy to use and it's about the best written and best illustrated book you can get.The book I have is dated October 2007.I recommend it highly and without reservation.- Susanna K.

Her greatest accomplishments include:&#65533; The establishment of the Church of England (in 1559)&#65533; Re-establishment of the authority of the British crown at a time when other monarchies were deteriorating&#65533; Re-establishment of English coinage after the nation's near (and total) bankruptcy&#65533; Support of exploratory voyages (by Drake and Raleigh) in the New World to lay what eventually became the foundation of the British Empire&#65533; Support of the cultural arts during what is now regarded as England's &quot;Golden Age&quot; (ie the Elizabethan Age) of literature, theater, and music&#65533; Survival of all manner of foreign threats (eg invasion by the Spanish armada in 1588) as well as domestic conspiracies (e.g. numerous assassination attempts)These and other accomplishments are explained by her intelligence, commitment, tenacity, charisma, style,grace, and charm. Also by her almost ferocious determination. Also by what the authors characterize as her brilliant use of &quot;pragmatic delays.&quot; It is also worth noting that she led an all-male government with an androgynous style designed to transcend gende rissues. Moreover, throughout her reign, she sustained direct and frequent contact with her subjects at all social levels throughout the realm. Perhaps no other monarch in history was loved more.The authors organize their material within 12 chapters whose subjects are indeed relevant to the our own business world: Leadership, Managing Finances, the Art of Spin, Team Building, Vision-Mission-Commitment, Decision-Making, Vast Intellect, Style, Gender Politics, Competitive Intelligence, Her Greatest Triumph, and Succession and Legacy. The authors include within their narrative comments by women in our contemporary business world, comments which reveal and illuminate the relevance of Elizabeth I's leadership strategies and tactics to what all executives today (not only CEOs and dcertainly not only women) now need to be effective. If you have seen the recent films Shakespeare in Love and/or Elizabeth, you can already envision this remarkable woman. Higgins and Gilberd create for her a much broader and deeper context with which to understand her greatest strengths and most admirable virtues. If and when I am ever permitted to have a &quot;fantasy dinner&quot;, Elizabeth I would certainly be among those included, perhaps joined by Julius Caesar, Eleanor of Aquitaine, Abraham Lincoln, Winston Churchill, Katherine Graham, and Jack Welch."},{"Title":"Beginning Web Programming using VB.NET and Visual Studio .NET","review":"A word of caution here, this is not a beginners book. More like an advanced or an intermediate book. If this is a beginner's book, then I would hate to see an advanced book. The first 2 chapters were okay, but starting with Chapter 3 it is a real lu-lu! It goes on and on about web controls and custom controls and dynamic control and customized templates and cascading style sheets. I think it would have been best if some of that advanced material had been left out and kept more simple for chapter 3 and concentrated on developing an application that didn't have to rely on all kinds of custom controls and style sheets and all other kinds of stuff. Keep it simple stupid would have been more the order of the day when it came to writing this book."},{"Title":"Beginning Web Programming using VB.NET and Visual Studio .NET","review":"Truely this is not a beginner's book but rather a foundational book.I've been studying the .Net Framework for just over a year now. During my studies, I've learned many sophisticated techniques; however, I have not be able to show what I know because I did know how to put it all together. It was like having all the pieces to the puzzle and not having a picture to guide the construction. Consequently, I've been looking for the Picture and this book is it.... a step-by-step guidance on how to integrates all the technologies into one project. This is the &quot;Glue&quot;!If you're looking for guidance on how to implement the many .Net techniques in a Web Application than this is a Great book! If you are a real beginner please look else where and then come to this book. You will be glad that you did ---&gt; I am!Bottom Line - The book should be titled Foundational instead of Beginning. If it were, I am sure it reviews would be much higher."},{"Title":"Beginning Web Programming using VB.NET and Visual Studio .NET","review":"This book provides a good foundation but I took less and less out of it as it progressed. I like the chapters covering header controls and base classes and also the instruction on tables and datasets. The strength of the book is that one can follow along with the clearly written 'Try this out' sections, although these were not without the usual scattering of errors. Ultimately the authors seem to lose interest in the application we are supposed to be writing in this book.The longest chapter was on XML frankly left me baffled. I've read more comprehensible stuff elsewhere since. All I could do was follow along without really learning. It seemed a complex exercise for a beginners book!In summary, I learnt some good things from this book but ultimately I found it disappointing."},{"Title":"Beginning Web Programming using VB.NET and Visual Studio .NET","review":"I can understand that a complete beginner to web design and programming in the .NET Framework would be a little upset with the title as some of the reviews have stated, but there's a light at the end of the tunnel! Those that are complaining now will be thankful later when they need to integrate all of these new technologies to create a finely woven site that impresses its users. I can honestly say that I've read a dozen books on ASP.NET (in VB and C#) and none do the justice to the topic that this book does. Many are rehashes of the same old thing - here's a datalist, here's a datagrid, here's one way to use ADO.NET, etc. It's just so hard to find it all in one place and this book does have most of it between two covers!Consider having a look at a book like ASP.NET Website Programming (problem - design -solution) which I have read from cover to cover. Now that is an advanced book that covers excellent ground but really doesn't do a good job of explaining the code - if this book was at my fingertips it would have been much, much easier to understand and implement.So those of you that have some experience with custom server controls, CSS, ADO.NET, and XML will not find the road that hard and will greatly enjoy this read.Those that want to learn how to implement security correctly using a variety of different techniques throughout the lifecycle or your project will be very excited indeed.-All the best in your programming endeavors."},{"Title":"Beginning Web Programming using VB.NET and Visual Studio .NET","review":"I have bought at least a dozen Web Development Books and this book has provided more practical development techniques than all the other books combined.

No book on this complex subject can do it all, but this book comes the closest of any I have read."},{"Title":"Posh & Becks","review":"Now that Becks L.A. Galaxy career has come to an end for this season, and the team is in last place, the euphoria about POSH AND BECKS coming to Los Angeles has almost become \\"none newsworthy\\". However, I think that Andrew Morton did a brill job of research and writing about an ordinary couple who became mega stars, only to find their glamour fade to a trickle in Los Angeles."},{"Title":"Posh & Becks","review":"I just finished Victoria Beckham's autobiography \\"Learning to Fly\\". In it she discusses a horrible court case her and her husband had gone through with this author fighting for this book not to be made. The guy that Andrew Morton's information is based off of was Victoria's old bodygaurd. He was the man believed by the FBI to be the one sending the kidnap and death threats that held the family's lives in fear for years. I would never support a person that disrespected someone that i admire so much."},{"Title":"Posh & Becks","review":"So why did I pay good money for a book which has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING NEW other than rehashed tabloid articles?? I could have just read through a newspaper archive. This book is full of \\"reportedly,\\" \\"allegedly,\\" \\"it was claimed,\\" meanwhile, isn't Andrew Morton supposed to be a journalist?? Couldn't he have confirmed or investigated any of these allegations, reports and claims?? This was the worst biography I have read in my life."},{"Title":"Posh & Becks","review":"I never read a book by this author before, so I didn't have any preconceptions. I was looking for a biography of two celebrities I admire so I could learn more about them and their rise to fame. This book was not a good choice. I can't say I learned anything new of any real interest, and I was put off by the hostile tone of the author, especially toward Victoria Beckham. No one is perfect, but this book really seemed to unfairly accentuate the couples' flaws and downplay their strengths. Nobody deserves to be criticized like that. It was unkind and not a pleasant read. I still admire the Beckhams for their many good qualites, however I'm not so sure about the author."},{"Title":"Posh & Becks","review":"The simple introduction here would be, \\"Liked him but didn't like her.\\" Of course, he has that warm, winning smile that makes him both attractive and seemingly approachable--while she favors a frowny pout that is very off-putting. (The book contains 16 pages of photographs, most of them in color.) But more importantly, he has real talent that he has worked all his life to cultivate, while her skills might be charitably described as modest and haphazardly developed. Morton makes the point that Posh has always pursued success rather than proficiency: \\"Victoria's supreme ambition, the goal she had had since childhood, was to be famous and admired . . . [and her] success was achieved quickly and in spite of, rather than because of, any real talent she could demonstrate.\\" I am also not keen on promoting anorexic role models for today's youth, and there are many pages in this tome devoted to her slenderizing habits.For a change of pace (although not a sports buff), I took the time while reading this book to watch clips of David's action on the soccer field. I was amazed at what I saw, both in terms of skill but also, and unexpectedly, in terms of joy--this man loves to play! Yet he is described as \\"nice but dim,\\" and his wife is a high school dropout.Morton provides his own analysis of this couple: \\"He seems content to be who he is, secure in his skin, a talented footballer doing what he has always wanted. On the other hand, Victoria is driven by the demons within; a woman who is at once dauntless, intrepid, and dynamic, and yet insecure, vulnerable, and needy.\\" But they have found each other, they love their kids, and they have been successful at promoting \\"Brand Beckham.\\" Maybe it will all work out in the end . . ."},{"Title":"Posh & Becks","review":"Andrew Morton is presented as the something between the devil incarnate and the Brit version of Kitty Kelley but this book, Posh and Becks isn't that bad actually. In fact, it's pretty fair. He makes it clear that the whole Girl Power thing that the Spice Girls had going was actually crap. They were invented by two busnessmen and their careers were guided by their male manager. They were a business venture first and musicians second. But hey, they entertained a whole lot of people and they all got rich so who can complain?Morton says that the Adams/Beckham wedding was tacky. Well, that's a mater of opinion but the pictures of the wedding did provoke more derisive laughter than envy in most people who commented publicly.Morton presents Beckham as a nice guy who let's his wife make the decisions... that could said for most happily married men. Morton also brings up a few alleged affairs but he makes it clear that the women involved all told their stories to the media so their actions have to be suspect.As for Victoria Beckham herself, Morton spent less time talking about her relationships before Beckham than she did in her own book. She complains bitterly about Morton in her book but all in all, Posh and Becks isn't a hatchet job and seemed rather mild to me. Pity about Beckham's soccer career though."},{"Title":"Posh & Becks","review":"Morton must receive his praise for putting together all the dirt there was on Posh and Becks. Is it morally wrong? By no means. Instead of digging through old glossy magazines you can check one book with a glossy cover.One question which this book fails to answer is how a player who is apparently past his prime and a girl who never was a good singer could become and continue to be such celebrities world-wide. But this is not a question which has anything to do with this charming couple but with us."},{"Title":"Posh & Becks","review":"I have read many books this is the second time and last time I ever read a book from this author. I happen to like the Beckhams, and feel that every single public personality deserves a key word privacy. When you cannot trust your nannies, cleaning people that is really sad, especially since they are a normal couple with children that fight and have their difficulties like everyone else in the world, they are the upper 3% of the world with money, they worked hard for it and deserve every single penny if we buy into them and their branding..and strong family values.I am sad if David did have affairs on his wife because that is a lack of respect for her and his boys and if they even have an agreement to an open marriage it is still no ones business but their own. there is a saying men like blueberry pie, once in awhile they like a little apple but than they return to the bluebuerry pie men love history they never leave their wives!To Victoria if you want your fashion sense to soar like an eagle think globally not locally to size 0.,go larger bring your books sell it all and than use some of it for charity or a training school for homeless teenagers to get them off the streets.I would go QVC or Shopping channel with your fragrances and clothing and sunglasses the more units you sell the more you make it is simple math. Do Jewlery too and anything you can brand your name on because Beckham sells because everyone wants a piece of you it represents wealth and abundance.You go Beckhams and when the press hate you it is because you are doing well. No one wants your sucess it is a famous saying. Andrew Morton can you never write a book that is pleasant I challenge you to do it my gosh man you are a negative and jealous writter and no better than the thousands of papparazzi that chase these people daily for their fix!"},{"Title":"Posh & Becks","review":"this book didn't tell me anything i didn't already know. i guess i was hoping it would go more into friendships and events these two had been involved with but it seemed to just skim over their life with the bare minimum of details. i wasted my money."},{"Title":"Posh & Becks","review":"This is a great easy read.You won't believe the amount of Harassment That Victoria Beckham,endured, she is so young and talented.The book is about her rise to fame and marriage etc.Nothing would have stopped her career and her Millions.There are some shocking photos in this book but you get a good idea of who she really is."},{"Title":"Posh & Becks","review":"\\"A couple of kids stealing grocery money\\" was Larry King's comment on Posh & David Beckham: Casey Kassem was similarly dismissive. What we've seen in this book is a long way from the truth. Morton narrates a perceptive and well-told story about the pair of outlaws. You'll find that David ran the show: Victoria, for the last year of her life couldn't even walk, due to the crippling effects of a bad car accident: she had to be carried around. Beckham had been driving along a dirt road at night, doing 70mph and ran through a barricade and off the road where a bridge was down. Pure recklessness on David's part--a recklessness and carelessness that cost Victoria Beckham the ability to walk, and cost the lives of many people, including Posh & Beck themselves.David was a skilled footballer--he rarely drove anything except his favored Mercedes--and car thief, but he didn't know when to take his foot off the gas. He liked fast cars and flashy, more mature women--the trappings of glamor. But the careful thought and planning that helped Dillinger and others was lacking--Morton describes how the couple would drive into Manchester in their Mercedes, wearing flashy clothes, and walk about casing the different stores for possible robbery: again and again, this aroused suspicions--it was if they wanted to call attention to themselves. They robbed some banks--the maximum haul that I recall from the book was under $4000 (about half that ammount when you consider that these are English Pounds) but spent much more time robbing grocery stores for $40 or so, and often grabbing for loose change. The book describes how David Beckham stole a Ford Cortina, drove it for a distance, and abandoned it for another Ford Cortina, but switched the license plate to the newly-stolen vehicle: when suspicions were aroused, the license plate quickly was traced to the original stolen car. The couple also liked taking pictures of themselves, and the pictures sometimes showed the license plates of the car they were driving--not smart!Sir Alex Ferguson, the legendary Man U. manager, traded David to the U.S.A.'s Los Angeles Galaxy football team. His posse ambushed Victoria and David in London, with Ferguson repeatedly shooting his mouth out at Victoria calling her a \\"two-bit hussie.\\" The aftermath did nobody credit: the Beckham family wanted all the guns, which were all stolen or (rarely) bought with stolen money. Ferguson wanted to retire David's number but kept the old jerseys to auction off. Los Angeles county sheriff Jordan, part of Ferguson's ambush team, may have grabbed a suitcase full of money for himself: he wanted the bullet-pierced death car to auction off. The car's owner (it was, of course, stolen) wanted it, and in a court case a federal judge returned it to the owner, who rented it out to what might best be termed an \\"exhibitionist\\" who charged admission for people to see it.The title of the book comes from both of their nicknames. There are occasional errors--such as accepting the FBI's line that David Beckham was involved in the Kansas City Wizards Massacre (see, for example, Robert Unger's book)--but nothing major. So--a well-done and interesting look at Posh & Becks."},{"Title":"Oracle8i Tips & Techniques","review":"I am a senior DBA for a major international bank and Oracle OCP. The objective of this book is to show new feaures of Oracle8i, which is something you would normally only get in an Oracle classroom. The topics are very straightforward, practical and illustrative.

But, on the whole, a great book."},{"Title":"Oracle8i Tips & Techniques","review":"This book covers exclusively Oracle8i new features.

I liked the overview of the ORDBMS in Chapter 1, and the treatment of partitioning, but overall this collection of tips is just that-- a set of tips for the expert minus a well-written orientation to new features.

It sounds like it's a book to teach colors. However, it's kinda odd. For example, there is a page where the scenery is blue. It has blue sky, a lake, blue logs, and Lofty (which is blue) lifting up a log. It reads something lile Lofty lifts blue logs. So there's no 'finding' any particular item because the whole page is blue. I just found it a bit strange in the technique used to teach about colors."},{"Title":"Let's Find Colors","review":"I was very excited about getting this book for my son. However when i recieved it i was very dissapointed.The pictures are great,but the actual point of the book- to learn colors is hardly featured.I would not reccomend this book as a tool to learn colors."},{"Title":"Let's Find Colors","review":"Bob the Builder is big at my house and he can really do no wrong.

I get bogged down in trying to follow all the instructions and make them match up with the screen pictures. This book comes with a CD that plays video on your computer. Doug Sahlin, the author, tells you how to do things in Flash, and demonstrates them with moving screen shots. It's like watching over the shoulder of an expert.

So, I didn't (don't) have time nor patience reading through some loquacious-professor-speaking nor I'll-entertain-you w/ nonsensical stuffs.This is my favorite tutorial/quick reference book in that the contents are clear and concise to the point with pertinent illustrations. The CD-rom is as equally excellent. It is a stream video lessons that are practical and applicable to your sites. I wish I had owned this book as my first Flash book. It would have saved me so much time and money. I look forward to reading more of his books."},{"Title":"Flash(tm) 5 Virtual Classroom","review":"I just completed the virtual classroom CD accompanying Doug Sahlin's Flash 5 book. I must say that it was an enjoyable way to spend a few hours. I teach graphics glasses and am always interested in seeing other teaching methodologies for classroom, distance, and self-paced learning environments.This book could be used in any of those arenas. The author displays a thorough knowledge of the subject in a clear and concise fashion both in the video and the book chapters. The book is laid out in a clean and organized style and although I would recommend this book for beginner/beginners, I added a few new tips to my collection. I enjoyed the video presentations, although I had some sputtering of sound and sound/lip sync problems with the real player.Tonight I viewed the video again from another computer wondering if the voice over might accomplish the same thing without the video of the instructor as it's really the content in the main window that is important and well presented. However, you can see that the author is a clown and having a good time creating this project for us, and the element of a real teacher can ad that touch of humanity missing in our on-line virtual existance! I value the ability to have my program of flash running simultaneously with the video so I could pause the video and do the lessons.I have used flash to produce a few company demos and consinder myself an intermediate user. I get stuck on the actionscripting and this book touches on actionscripting enough so one could advance to a book like Foundation Actionscripting with a basic understanding of this robust flash feature.I recommend this book to flash beginners and anyone who hasn't launched their flash program in a while and wants a good clean organized review."},{"Title":"Flash(tm) 5 Virtual Classroom","review":"This book was excellent for me.

That would have saved me SO much time and money to quickly grasp a truly useful Flashabilities.The book's content is no-nonsense, to-the-point, and w/ the pertinent graphics tutorials and references.

For most people, it is dry and difficult to master a new program with only the manual in hand. This package eliminates that problem with a CD containing excellent video instruction to accompany the informative text in the book.

Learning things like the basics of flash, creating graphic objects, then modifying and creating complex objects.Also you begin to build symbols, animations in a frame by frame layout, create buttons, movies and then add sounds and finally publish what you create. Overall this book will help even those with little or no computer or web design experience"},{"Title":"Flash(tm) 5 Virtual Classroom","review":"Although I'd not used Flash before, I have used many graphics apps before, and have been using a computer for some time. Perhaps this has soemthing to do with why I came away from this bok feeling insulted.The book provides no concrete samples or projects, gives no real sense of accomplishment, and yet manages to take up 300 pages. How is this? By tediously overexplaining things and going into absurd detail over things that frankly, should already be second nature to anyone intending to create with Flash. An example - taking an entire page to explain and instruct on contextual menus. That's right, an entire page to explain that if you click your right mouse button, you will get a list of options particular to whatever you are clicking on.The videos on the CD are equally as tedious, with the author speaking at a snail's pace, never really accomplishing much of interest.If you are completely new to graphic applications and generally adverse to / afraid of poking around an interface without hand-holding, this book may be useful. At the same time, if that describes you, do you really want to be jumping into Flash in the first place?I found this book immensely frusterating and very dissapointing. Next time, I will buy a book that comes reccomended, rather than the one that was in the 30% off Bargain Bin."},{"Title":"Flash(tm) 5 Virtual Classroom","review":"Although I have had some experience using Flash, I must say this book has helped me tremendously.

Whats totally missing with this book is the companion CD has some lessons, but there more like very quick explanations of how to create certain elements in flash. The explanations are to quick to follow and at the same time the CD comes with know .fla files for you to follow along in flash while you view the movies. This would have been great to see as an addition is the actuall files so that you could try out what the heck this guy is talking about. Another thing I have problems with is this guy just does not impress me with his teaching act. He's just to goofy. For some reason I just could not wrap myself around his personality.. Get someone who has a presence. Someone you can say this guys for real... Hire an actor or something... Id have to say this is just another quick release book and the virtual classroom aspect is not up to par.... If you can get the book for ... its worth it I guess for a first time book, but if youve already bought a few flash books and your looking for something with some guts and very finely tuned tutorials to follow along and really get what there saying, this is not the book..... Bubba"},{"Title":"Flash(tm) 5 Virtual Classroom","review":"This book was a serious disappointment. You would think a book about Flash would USE Macromedia flash for the tutorial CD - just like the tutorials that come with flash do in the help files. NO, instead you get a RIDICULOUS Real-video presentation with the poor author babbling uncomfortably in the corner of the screen, completely out-of-sync with what is going on in the Real-Media movie of the flash interface (not an actual flash interface!). Also, the book is slow, tedious, and under-informative too. Every simple action lists a dozen steps describing the micro-actions that make up the step. It's almost like describing a mouse-click like this:1. Raise hand2. Extend hand toward mouse3. Rest hand on mouse4. Extend index finger forward5. Apply pressure with the same index finger upon the left button of the mouse, being careful not to affect the right button. Do not move the wheel on the mouse, should you have one. (Some mice have wheels on them to allow for vertical scrolling in a window from anywhere on the screen).6. Depress the button.7. Pay attention for an audible &quot;clicking&quot; sound.8. Release the button.&lt;/P&gt;I don't intend to be mean - the author seems like a nice person, but I expect to get what I paid for - and I didn't. Maybe the editors need to get their act together or something.Big thumb down."},{"Title":"Flash(tm) 5 Virtual Classroom","review":"I thought this book and accompanying CD were a bit simplistic. Mr. Sahlin should do away with the &quot;props&quot; he uses as examples on the video - I felt this was &quot;dumming down&quot; just a bit too much. And, Mr. Sahlin may know Flash, but in this day and age, he should consider hiring professional &quot;talent&quot; for the video. At times, I found his pronouncition of words a bit hard to understand. The content of the book and CD was ok and followed logical teaching patterns, however, given this method of teaching Flash, just the minimum basics could be presented. There is just so much more to Flash. Also, the CD ran fine on my PC but after installing to the letter on my Mac - had some big time problems."},{"Title":"Flash(tm) 5 Virtual Classroom","review":"This book is short, remedial, and useless. I found one intermediate level tutorial (scrolling text boxes). Even for a beginer book, there just isn't enough information. Visual Quickstart Flash 5 is much better, and better still is the entire Friends of Ed series, starting with Foundation Flash. The only thing worse then this book are the jokes told by the &quot;professor&quot; in the virtual classroom."},{"Title":"The Infinity Link","review":"Characters were decently developed and Carver developed a good basic theme for his book. However, he wasted page after page with a totally unnecessary side-story that had a reporter chasing after the story that was the plot of the book.Had it not been for this side story I would likely have given this book four stars. It was as if (and quite likely that) Carver wrote the book and then added the side story to give it some fat... you know, add a lot of pages so people will think it's a great book and not just a good book.As it is, the book is still a very good read and, if bored, you may skip over most of the side story without missing anything of the central plot. I'll read more of Carver."},{"Title":"The Infinity Link","review":"For a book written in the 1980s I must say that it had an imaginative view of the future in terms of technology--having (landline) phones in which one can view who s/he is talking to, manned spacecrafts that can travel as far as Pluto, and computer links that can bring our minds to places other than here and now--among others. It has shifting voices and view points, and it is particularly obvious when we get to chapters featuring Hoshi Aaronson's thoughts. The writing style has the kind of authority I look for in sci-fi novels. While I have no problem with the writing style, I think at times it tries to tell too much to the point of being dragging--the side stories sometimes making me forget where the main story had gone.What I liked the most about this book is Mozy's character development throughout the story. The book was able to portray her changes and realizations under realistic circumstances, eventually molding her character into something she would never have dreamed possible in herself. It all might have started small and petty (that's what I thought of the story's conflict at first), but I was glad that in the end, she was able to get something out of it--fully realizing and appreciating her own humanity. The other characters also had their own unique likeable and unlikeable personalities. In terms of character development, I can say this book did well--the characters came out alive and believable.A worthwhile journey... though anyone would have to be patient to get through it."},{"Title":"The Infinity Link","review":"\\"The Infinity Link\\" by Jeffrey A. Carver, 1984This is such an unusual story. You are given the basic outlines of a girl who has lost her beauty to some accident, trying to make a go of it in college and this job come along. The job is wonderful: she gets to play with another person, male, who sees her in the compute simulation as she would see herself if she was not injured. The job is to end soon, but no one tells her. She is doing good and it comes to light with another peon and her out after work. She is devastated. She had thought there was a future and not an end. Now what?Now come the aliens.

Its dialogue is extremely well-thought and intelligent. This is extremely evident in the conversations between Will Hunting, a genius janitor with a sad family history, and his psychologist, Sean. It's setting of Southern Boston is also a beautiful addition to the visual images the screenplay plays in our minds. The basic story about a young man trying to cope with family pain is somewhat similar to the film &quot;Ordinary People&quot;. This is a piece of riveting literature not only for Hollywood honchos and box office bullies, but also for people who enjoy a wonderful story."},{"Title":"Good Will Hunting: A Screenplay","review":"Good Will Hunting is my favorite movie.

Great for people to read and see how scenes were developed and changed and for people who are interested in writing their own screenplay. Matt and Ben Rock!!"},{"Title":"Good Will Hunting: A Screenplay","review":"Having read all the reviews and endless adulation for this film, it's easy to see why the screenplay for Good Will Hunting snatched up an Oscar last year for Best Original Screenplay. Damon and Affleck have crafted an intelligent story that speaks volumes of humanity in the dialogue and character relationships. Characters are three-dimensional, flawed and compelling, forcing the audience to actually CARE what happens to them.The major strength of the script is the finely-crafted monologues that Damon and Affleck give their characters: i.e. Shawn's speech to Will in Boston park is simply beautifal. Then there's Will's speech to the NSA agents which combines humour and observation in one neat little package.The actor's performances stem from the sheer amount of subtext handed to them by Damon and Affleck in their script. Primarily, Will's path goes from frightened loud-mouth to assured and confident young man through his counseling sessions with Sean. These scenes are a joy to read as Will and Sean draw closer together by burying to the root of Will's struggle and for Sean to overcome past tragedies. Robin Williams at first seems like an odd choice for the role of Sean, but, for anyone who's seen DEAD POET'S SOCIETY will understand, approaches his role with vigour, inflecting Sean with wisdom, quiet solidarity and subtly conveys Sean's pain and anguish from a life of struggle.Also, Affleck gets a great speech near the end of the story when Chuckie tells Will to accept his gift and to follow his heart and to stop denying himself in the eyes of others, because he has something that not many people have.The script is also laced with some wonderful photographs from the film, which chart the progress of the story in pictures, and also includes a superb introduction from the film's director Gus Van Sant. The story is warm, deeply emotional and human, containing brilliant flashes of wit, pathos, observation and self-doubt, and I have no doubt that from this, Damon and Affleck will continue to rise and rise. Good Will Hunting reminds us that movies don't have to be about exploding asteroids, sinking ships or gratuitous car chases, they can be about the explorarion of the human condition, where the guay gets the girl and has all the answers."},{"Title":"Good Will Hunting: A Screenplay","review":"It is not difficult to understand why this screenplay won the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay. There are only so many stories to be told; the difference is how those stories are told. In a land where movies about old television shows are considered original, Hollywood is desperate for anything that looks even remotely new. The tale that Damon &amp; Affleck (with some help from Goldman) tell is not a new one. However, it is the way they tell it that makes this story so fascinating. The characters are fleshed out, not cardboard cut-outs. The words you read actually make you care about the characters, thinking of them as real people.Ah, the words. That's what makes this script so original. If Will, Chuckie, Sean and the rest of the clan were not so eloquent, this would just be another run of the mill buddy/romance/coming-of-age flick that just happens to star Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, and Robin Williams. Most people remember at least one of the wonderfully written monologues from this film, such as Will's interview with NSA or Chuckie's speech to Will about using his gift. However, the normal every day-to-day speech between the characters is written just as poetically.Words are powerful, something we seem to forget in our modern American society. If nothing else, this screenplay is worth looking at just to refresh one's memory of how moving words can be.A great screenplay to companion a great movie."},{"Title":"Good Will Hunting: A Screenplay","review":"You know, I've seen a lot of movies and read alot of screenplays and I've got to say; The more a movie costs, the more big action is it, the fewer words...and on and on until all thats left is an explosion or two and a sex scene. This story is different, it's exceptional. It was put together brilliantly and I must say, you're doing yourself a disservice by not reading this screenplay and viewing this movie. There's reason it won."},{"Title":"Good Will Hunting: A Screenplay","review":"Good Will Hunting cultivates a blend of historic elements together with a present-day scenario. A screenplay which perhaps challenges you more than it entertains. Focused, precise and of the depth -Good Will Hunting is a world away from the garbage hollywood produces everyday."},{"Title":"Good Will Hunting: A Screenplay","review":"I don't know! I have become a fan of Matt and Ben after seeing the movie, good will hunting.Some people don't like the movie because they don't understand the movie and the intrisic (inside)meaning of the story, but think about yourself as a guy who are afraid of everything(esp. new people, because you are unsure about them and you are really afraid you will get hurt)but you want appreciation from other(there is why he writes equation on the blackboard of Harvard University), you may understand it better!Lots of contradiction in the story made it more interesting. But don't forget the story background, South Bostan, is also the part of the story.Matt and Ben made fame after the movie. It beat other experienced screenwriters to get the best screenpaly price. So, it is brilliant.the screenplay also have something that the movie doesn't have.If the movie break your heart, the book will also break your heart."},{"Title":"Good Will Hunting: A Screenplay","review":"&quot;A lot of Good Will was written on such cross-country road trips. We tell each other stories while in a particular character, usually to make each other laugh or to make sure that Ben doesn't fall asleep at the wheel,&quot; says Matt. And then Gus says, &quot;Matt Damon and Ben Affleck are describing things in their screenplay that mean so much to them that it will break your heart when you read it.&quot; Ironical as these statements may seem, they bring out the essence of the book. Written in a style that's like a country rivulet, the dialogues, laced with expletives on the surface, are a lesson in human behavior. Each character has a character that is unique, that is human, that is devoid of any celluloid syntheticity. I'm dying to see the film."},{"Title":"Good Will Hunting: A Screenplay","review":"This screenplay is unbelievable. The men who wrote this amaze me! There are only subtle differences that differ the movie from the book. Although I'd seen the movie before reading the screenplay, I still enjoyed reading it greatly. The emotional heartfelt words will bring you to tears many times. Will Hunting, the title character, progresses from a genious, slacker boy to a strong, independent man. As a thirteen year old, I can relate to the immaturaties of this character. I reccomend this screenplay to people of all ages."},{"Title":"Good Will Hunting: A Screenplay","review":"Good Will Hunting is not only the best screenplay of the year, it is one of the best in the last ten years. Most movies these days are not worth the price of admission. So I see them when they come to a discount theatre. Even cheap night at the video stores yields nothing but a bunch of meaningless stories which do nothing more than shock your retina with fast paced images. I stare vacantly at the screen, unmoved, uninvolved. Damon and Afleck have written a brilliant story which does what most working screenwriters only wish they could do. I cared about the characters and I was concerned about the outcome. I was rooting for them, hoping that goodness and happiness would come their way.It is entertaining throughout. And yes it made me shed tears. Twice! The scenes are peppered with short speeches that are so natural and realistic that you will be tempted to think that it must have been easy to write this stuff. No wisecracking James Bond here, folks. Meaningfull and realistic dialogue. The writers took a chance that there is an audience out there for a well crafted and moving story. This is a story. Did you get that? I said, &quot;a STORY!&quot;. I'm not talking about a plot that unfolds like three acts all tied up into a neat little package, like butter on your popcorn. This isn't just devices and tricks. It is a story! You will remember the dialogue because you have heard it before. In real life. People actually talk this way regardless of the Bostonian accents. And where did they get this mathematical information. I don't know, it's either made up or well researched.It doesn't get any better than this, folks. If you have a heart, it will be cracked when you listen to what these characters have to say to each other. Yeah, you will care. Check it out. You'll actually give a damn, Scarlett."},{"Title":"Good Will Hunting: A Screenplay","review":"This was a very well written screenplay to one of my favorite movies.

I've read this screenplay at least eight times, and every time it's gotten better. I'm writing my own screenplay right now, and I have major respect for Matt and Ben. They're wonderful writers, and I hope they can find the time to write another movie. If my screenplay could ever be half as good as theirs, I'd be extremely happy. I think everyone should read this book. It's simply wonderful."},{"Title":"Good Will Hunting: A Screenplay","review":"I loved the movie, and after seeing a blurb on the poster that said &quot;Read the book,&quot; I rushed to Amazon Books to find the book. Sure enough, I did, and enjoyed it. I'm so glad that Matt Damon and Ben Affleck have become so successful, as they deserve every bit of their success. I'm looking forward to another Oscar win, maybe in the acting category, and more wonderful films from the two."},{"Title":"Good Will Hunting: A Screenplay","review":"This screenplay shows the authors have writing talent, but that it is not very developed yet. William Goldman helped write this screenplay, and even HE didn't think it was that great a screenplay (as he says in &quot;Premiere&quot; magazine). I know it won Oscars for the writers, but then Sylvester Stallone was once nominated for a best-acting Oscar...what does that tell you about the award? I think this screenplay showed promise, and I hope the writers try to develop their skill further, so that one day they may write a good screenplay. But winning an Oscar, they may think they don't need to improve, and that would be bad for them and movie audiences, both."},{"Title":"Good Will Hunting: A Screenplay","review":"I picked up this book/screenplay, knowing very little about the story prior to reading it. Only that I had seen on TV awhile back Matt Damon accept an Academy Award for the movie. So it must be good, right? The script is so remarkable, and the story is very moving as it lets us in on a young man having been dealt a hand in life neither good nor bad really. It's about how you deal with it, and not letting it keep you from finding what you really want out of life. (Hope I am not giving it away.)"},{"Title":"Good Will Hunting: A Screenplay","review":"I have lived my life thinking that as a gifted person, I owed it to people to make intellectual use of my gift without thinking of my own emotions or how I wanted to live my life. This film showed me that people are fulfilled by living the way they want too, not by pleasing editors of Mensa. I hope it isn't too late to discover the self within myself ; savor my friendships, although those people may not be blessed {or cursed}with my &quot;gift&quot; ; and go for what I want, like Will.

I read this in one night and I was not impressed at all."},{"Title":"Good Will Hunting: A Screenplay","review":"Having seen the movie and read the screenplay, I can never fail to understand how something like this was ever taken seriously. There is absolutely nothing original here; the writing is shallow, tedious and unbelievably hackneyed and I marvel that such mediocre talent could be so hyped, so gushed over and can only wonder how such 'writing' could ever have been made into a movie let alone win an Academy Award! It baffles me completely.Incidentally, there is much whispering in industry circles that Affleck and Damon didn't really even write this screenplay. Instead it was the result of a collaboration between Gus Van Zant, Robin Williams, William Goldman and Rob Reiner. As a matter of fact much of William's comedic dialogue was actually improvised, yet authorship was, strangely, still credited to Affleck and Damon - probably for unknown publicity and marketing reasons.The fact that these two have not produced any screenplays worthwhile since tends to verify suspicions about their real and minimal contributions to Good Will Hunting."},{"Title":"Good Will Hunting: A Screenplay","review":"I like the packaging of this nice little book. With the popularity of the film, someone might have been tempted to make a handsome profit by padding up the screenplay with glossy photos and selling the thing for $25 a shot. But for less than $10, this is a nice read and a great treat for fans of the movie. Everything is tastefully done, starting with Van Sant's thoughtful introduction. For film students, reading the script and comparing it with the final product on screen is a great lesson in film-making that money can't buy. In many scenes, the difference between the screenplay and the dialogue in the film is just a few subtle words (&quot;That's a SUPER philosophy, Will&quot; as opposed to &quot;That's a WONDERFUL philosophy, Will&quot;)that make all the difference. I even like the black-and-white photos placed in just the right spots throughout the book. Classy all around."},{"Title":"Good Will Hunting: A Screenplay","review":"This is a beautifuuly written piece of artwork.

His character gave me chills, and when Robin Williams hit the screen, it was like, BOOM...there he is, and from that point on, I was prepared to laugh.

The cast of characters fit well together.Robin Williams always delivers a dynamic believable real performance, subtle humor in an beautiful written drama.I found a lot of personal connection to Will in this movie. His complacancy in life reveals his hestitation to step outisde the bounds of his comfort zone and really let his Gaurd down to become who he can.There are so many great moments in this movie from the animated dialogue between Will and numerous therapists & Sean ( Robin Willimas), to his running in with bloated Ego's of College preps.Good Will Hunting inspires us all to seek knowledge using what resources or devices we have available. An inspiring entertaining film.Favorite lines:Sean to Will: \\"Maybe *you're* perfect right now. Maybe you don't wanna ruin that.

One of them, Will, just happens to be a genius, with a photographic memory. He is also an abused orphan who doesn't trust anyone but his friends and seems content to do construction and janitorial work. When an M.I.T. professor of mathematics catches him solving a nearly impossible proof one evening after all of the students have left, he is intrigued.After Will gets into trouble with the law, which is a fairly common occurrence for him, the professor steps in and agrees to work with him and get him counseling if the judge will agree not to send him to jail. Will reluctantly agrees, not really willing to see a therapist. It proves to be difficult to find a therapist who can handle Will; he has read their books and mocks them during therapy sessions. Finally an old college friend of the professor's has a breakthrough and becomes someone that Will can trust.This is a story about a person learning to take risks in relationships and with his future.

I love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Lord Pierson Reforms (Zebra Regency Romance)","review":"Drunk and drenched, and at the mercy of two Cyprians, Lord Pierson has just reached an ultimate low. And then he finds his salvation: in the form of a beautiful woman. He spots an angelic woman in a passing carriage, and he vows to meet her and make her his wife. Through her, he WILL be reformed.The lady in question is Lady Rowena Revington, a spoiled, self-indulging brat. It is Amy Corbett's job, as Rowena's chaperone, to find a husband for the willful girl. But Lady Rowena has no desire to marry. She lives to make every man fall head-over-heels in love with her, Lord Pierson included. As it happens, sweet Amy is the one who truly has budding feelings for the reforming viscount.I enjoyed this book very much. Actually, it's better than most of the books I've recently read. The characters (especially the secondary characters, which includes the charming and crafty Lord Bainsbridge) are engaging, and you really want to know what happens to them. Romantically, each character ends up with the right person, and the ending is sure to leave a smile on any reader's face.On the flip side, there were certainly times when I wished the book would move a little bit faster. Also, I thought the characters were a bit superficial at times.Overall, though, it's a really good book. I enjoy Donna Simpson very much, and I hope she has a story for Lady Harriet (Bainsbridge's bluestocking sister) underway."},{"Title":"Lord Pierson Reforms (Zebra Regency Romance)","review":"When Dante Delacourt, Viscount Pierson, catches sight of the delectable Lady Rowena Revington as he is trying to make his way home after a night spent drinking heavily at the Bacchanal Club, he firmly believes that Fate has sent him a message of sorts. Then and there, Dante decides to change his ways, to eschew his hitherto rakish ways, and to become more responsible and respectable; for Dante believes that the Lady Rowena is the very embodiment of perfection and purity, and so has decided to do all he humanly can in order to be worthy of his &quot;angel.&quot; Little does Dante realize that Lady Rowena is actually a very spoilt and autocratic young lady, and a very canny flirt. Or that employed as Lady Rowena's chaperone is a sweet tempered and steadfast young lady (Miss Amy) who embodies all the qualities that Dante believes the Lady Rowena possesses; a young lady who has, furthermore, lost her heart to him! Will Dante realize that Amy is the real prize? Or will he continue to moon after Lady Rowena, thus breaking Amy's heart?While &quot;Lord Pierson Reforms&quot; revolves around a much used plot-line, what lifts this novel above the usual are the bits where Amy grows a backbone and tells Lady Rowena off, the developing bond between Dante and Amy, and the portrayal of the friendship that exists between Dante and his best friend, Lord Bainbridge. While sweet natured, Amy is not a doormat, and I really liked that Amy figured out early on in the book how to deal with Lady Rowena, and that she was not shy about wielding what little power she had. I also liked that the authour allowed us to see why Dante and Amy were a perfect match; and why although Dante and Bainbridge were such polar opposites in temperament, they were still best friends. But I was disappointed that Donna Simpson did not go into why Lady Rowena and her father seemed to have no relationship with each other, and that things with Bainbridge's sister, a character I really liked, were left hanging. Perhaps there is a book or two there? (Hint, hint). On the whole, though, if you're looking for a nice, non-taxing and enjoyable book to unwind with, &quot;Lord Pierson Reforms&quot; may be just the ticket."},{"Title":"Lord Pierson Reforms (Zebra Regency Romance)","review":"I have read many of this author's books and enjoyed most of them; indeed some are, in my view, in the 5 star/keeper category. Not this one. I admit I gave up after page 75. The stilted, silly dialogue, the ridiculous over-done cardboard characters and the wholly unbelievable plot was too much and, frankly, I was not prepared to waste my time plodding through something that had already bored me to tears. The author seemed to have found a plot she could not properly bring in line and then populated it with characters who could not catch my attention. It was, sadly, for me a huge, huge disappointment. Hopefully this is a one-off aberration!"},{"Title":"The Strawberry Patch","review":"The Strawberry Patch belies its pastoral title. It is a searing account of the lives of both middle class and poor rural women in India,who face socially sanctioned oppression and natural calamity with courage and resilience born of cultural values similar to those of the great Hindu epics of Ramayana and Mahabharata. It also affords a nuanced glimpse at lives of Indians during the Raj; the tricky negotiations ordinary people made to survive and maintain their dignity within a fundamentally unjust colonial rule, and sometimes a humorous look at the soft underbelly of Empire. The final impact of the book is amazingly uplifting, despite the sometimes grim options the characters are faced with. One senses a deeply compassionate, historically informed and profoundly truthful story-teller behind these tales."},{"Title":"An Engineer's Guide to Technical Communication","review":"This is a well written book (I guess), I cant help but think that this is one of those subjects that the writer needs to provide a lot of examples of the topics and they do but that makes for a really boring at times read. This book did a great job at getting across the topics, but the topics are generally quite simple or follow common sense guidelines and so reading it can often feel like busy workOverall:- Good book, but for those of us well versed in English and communications, this book will be quite boring."},{"Title":"An Engineer's Guide to Technical Communication","review":"An Engineer's Guide is a technical communications textbook written by two engineering professors. In the introduction, they state that \\"the text was written by engineers, for engineers\\" (xi). Its target audience is engineering students who are just starting their undergraduate programs; the authors explain the format, purpose, and use of many documents that are considered common in professional engineering situations. Because these documents are also used in other math and science fields and these students often share the analytical mindset that engineering students have, this book would be ideal for all Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) undergraduate students.Textbook authors have to choose between breadth and depth. In this case, the authors choose to briefly cover the primary forms of communication that STEM careers require. One of my favorite things about this book is its title, which is also the book's focus: technical communication, not technical writing. One weakness of the documents produced by the scientists and engineers I have worked with is that they have difficulty communicating the ideas that seem so clear to them and so confusing to the rest of us.Because of those experiences, this book's focus on communication rather than writing seems particularly apropos. I love that this is its focus, almost as if the authors are trying to coax reluctant cave-dwellers out to interact with the other natives. It is not a book about writing, but a book about how engineers can prepare themselves to use the various forms of communication that they will be required to use in their professional lives.The book is divided into ten sections: an introduction plus nine types of communication requirements. The first two chapters give an overview of how the writing process differs from the engineering design process. Chap-ter 2 also covers rudimentary audience analysis and gives basic information about grammar and style. Chapter 3 discusses ethical issues in technical communication, most of which are unique to STEM fields.Chapter 5 gives an overview of the basics of document design. It is interesting to note that this chapter is treated as a form of visual communication but is given its own chapter in the middle of the book; the other visual design content is presented in Chapter 9. This is the only large organizational oddity.Other than splitting the visual design segments, Chapters 4-10 are in a logical order; however, the authors state that these chapters can be presented in any order desired. I think it would be particularly interesting to structure an introductory course that presents these concepts in an order that would reinforce the curriculum of one of the early core classes in the undergraduate Engineering program.Each section is divided into documents and/or tools that are commonly used to fulfill the stated communication need. For each document, the information given includes function, form, and mechanics. These elements are followed by interesting, well-written exercises.WeaknessesFor any book, publishing costs constrain the author into making compromises. In this case, the authors chose to print without color, so that made the section on information architecture at once awkward and innovative. The authors obviously were concerned that the page count should be low enough to avoid intimidating learners, which had the added advantage of keeping the price down.Because of the page count constraint, the authors had to choose the content carefully; only the items that they considered vitally important were retained. This leads to some interesting glimpses into the minds of these engineers. For example, the section on proposals and reports is only 18 pages long - barely enough space to discuss the most general characteristics of each form. The section on RFPs doesn't even mention grant proposals. In contrast, there are 20 excellent pages devoted to a discussion of how to communicate calculations. I have never seen more than a few paragraphs at a time on this subject, yet it is something that would be crucial to the credibility of engineering design documents.In general, that is how I ended up viewing most of the things that I would consider flaws if I saw them in other kinds of technical writing textbooks. At first I thought they were weaknesses (and in fairness, maybe they were), but after looking closely at them I inevitably saw the logic in the treatment of these elements. Invariably, the choices the authors made were based on the viewpoint that engineers' primary responsibility is to design things and write about those designs. I think that's why grant proposals aren't included in the list of other kinds of proposals: grants aren't an intrinsic part of the design process. This is a very interesting way to look at the world and may explain why STEM students have such a difficult time communicating with other kinds of technical writers.StrengthsThis book is written from an engineer's viewpoint. As such, it addresses communications issues that are unique to engineers and others who have similar mindsets. I have always been surrounded by scientists, mathematicians, and engineers, so I have been intrigued by this kind of analytical mind for several decades. In my current classes, my STEM students are the ones who both fascinate and confuse me. This book has helped me understand, for example, the engineering student who recently wrote a paper on the merits of video game music. To him, this music is digital, repeats in easily discernible units, and aurally illustrates a highly analytical game. The illustration on p. 187 looks very much like the chart he drew to diagram the sequence of events in his favorite video game. Almost every page has something that makes me smile because my mind would not have phrased it that way because I am not an engineer.I have discussed most of the book's content in previous sections of this memo, but I think an examination of the exercises is appropriate here. Like most textbooks, each chapter ends with a set of exercises to help the student synthesize what they read. These exercises are not unusually analytical for an introductory text, but they discuss the kinds of problems engineers and scientists are required to solve. For example, the chapter on visual communication has a question that requires the student to graph data about aircraft speed against power required and power available. The next question is about the best way to represent data about fluid dynamics. These questions are representative of the kinds of exercises found throughout the book.Even though several subjects are given only lip service, An Engineer's Guide to Technical Communication is a superb resource for engineering students. They won't learn how to write any type of document perfectly, but they will be able to identify the key characteristics, tools, and audience for most of the documents they will encounter in their professional lives. This textbook is an ideal choice for an introductory course in writing for engineering undergraduate students, as well as for math and science students."},{"Title":"Screeching Halt: A novel","review":"This story was wonderfully written--humorous and very enjoyable. I loved the all of the Scandinavian characters--they had great feeling and emotion. I couldn't put it down!"},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"Bride McTierney is heartbroken and in tears. Her boyfriend of the last few years has just dumped her because she is not right for his image, being size 18 and all. While she is drowning in tears, the most handsome man she has ever seen walks into her shop. Vane Kattalakis is in fact not a man but a were-hunter (werewolf) who set his eyes in Bride in a previous Dark Hunter novel and believes that she is the most strikingly beautiful woman he has evern seen. Seeing her in tears, he buys her a $600 necklace from her shop and offers it to her and walks out of the shop. Bride chases him down the street with the intention of returning the $600 back to him stating that she cannot not accept such an expensive gift. They end up having one passionate interlude in the back of her shop.Vane walks out of the shop a second time believing that he will never see her again as she is way above his station. Later that evening a mark appears in the palm of his hand. The same mark mysteriously appears on Brides hand aswell. This mark signifies that Bride is Vane's mate and he has all but 3 weeks to convince her to become mated with him, otherwise Vane will have to live a solitary life without any female for the remainder of Bride's life.Vane decides to appear in his wolf form to protect Bride, for the rest of his pack will attack her if they know that he has a potential mate. To complicate matters, his father and his mother both want him dead, as a result of their unwanted relationship. Vane's mother and father come from opposing clans of were-hunters.This was my favourite dark hunter novel so far. Vane is such a gentleman and it's nice to read that Bride is not your usual stick thin twig but a real plus size woman with all her curves and all. Vane really does respect Bride and is real knight in shining armour and we all dream of one of those, don't we? The fact that he is drop dead gorgeous is a plus aswell. I love Sherrilyn Kenyon's modern and witty dialogue. She sure knows how to spin a fairytale yarn. A very highly recommended read. You will not be disappointed.Lea Ling Tsang"},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"I bought my first Sherrilyn Kenyon book ('Fantasy Lover')on a suggestion from Amazon not expecting much. How wrong I was! Needless to say, I've now read the entire Dark-Hunter series and can't wait for 'Seize the Night' in December. I bought 'Night Play' the day it came out and was not disappointed. Ms. Kenyon has created a wonderful world full of mystery and passion. The story of Vane and Bride is especially special to those of us who aren't a perfect size. Read it and you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"I read this book twice in a 48 hour period, which I have never done before.If you are looking for action and nail-biting suspense, you won't find it here. There isn't much external threat to this couple - the primary threat comes from whether or not Bride can accept Vane as her mate, and of course we all know she will. Some may find the lack of suspense annoying, but I found it incredibly tender, gentle, and refreshing.Bride is hardly a cipher - she is a woman with many of the same issues that most of us feel. And a size 18 is hardly obese. Vane is just breathtaking. I am in danger of falling in love with a person who doesn't exist!Sherrilyn Kenyon's DH novels may be cut from the same cloth, but they are not carbon copies of each other. The humor in this was delicious - I was laughing out loud even the second time around (especially at Vane's response to Julian's story, which was told in \\"Fantasy Lover\\" - priceless). Secondary characters were endearing and well-fleshed out - the Squires, Valerius, Bride's family, Fury - and many of them grew and developed over the course of the novel. No glaring plot holes that I was aware of.If you want to melt into a puddle, then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"I really liked Vane. He was a perfect, sensitive, gentlemanly hero. He was gorgeous, compassionate, and knew how to make a woman fell beautiful and wanted. Then we have Bride. She's not so bad, all in all. She has some spunk, and she seems like a nice person. But that's about it. There's nothing really special about her. And apart from her being mated with Vane, is there anything else that could make her so very extraordinary? Well, perhaps her opinion on weight. I don't mind the heroine being something different from a skinny size zero model. But I really don't like reading about a massive body, love handles, and so on. But I could stand it if the heroine wouldn't spend half the book ogling and drooling over Vane's perfect, no-fat, muscle-rippled body. Come on!!! If the heroine can be so imperfect, why does the hero have to be the epitome of male perfection? And for all those who think it's perfectly fine for the heroine to be a size xyz - what would you think about a size xyz hero with a big belly? I really didn't like the heroine to be so two faced - she lamented over other people telling her she should loose some weight, but she had no problem whatsoever with only caring about Vane's appearance. Blah.Well, another problem I had with this book was that there wasn't mush of a story. It just seemed to drag on and center on one question: will Bride accept Vane as her mate? (and afterward: will they have puppies or children? That was really icky). When they mated, which was obviously just a matter of time, it was such an anticlimactic moment. I was like: is that it? Oh well.The good spots were when we get to meet all the other people. I especially liked Valerius and can't wait to read his story. Hope it'll have more of a story and less of a heroine ;)"},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"I really loved this book. I was worried that as I got further along in this series, being that there are so many in this series, that it would get old and I would get super bored with the story line. I haven't found this happening at all. Each book is individual on it's own. I loved Vane and Bride's story. It was different from the others as Vane isn't a dark hunter so the dynamics of the story are completely different then the rest of the other novels.Vane is a were-hunter who has been shunned and abused by those who should have loved him his entire life. The only one's who have loved his are his brother Fang and his sister Anya, both of whom he has just lost...Anya to death and Fang to a comatose existence he can't seem to break. Vane spies Bride in her store immediately after she has been dumped by her jerk of a boyfriend by FedEx mail. Vane can't resist her, regardless of the fact that she is a size 18. Vane sees someone beautiful, luscious and kind. It is refreshing to read a book that includes a heroine who is not a size 2. It was nice to see someone attracted to a woman because of who she is and not how thin her waist is.Besides that fact the story was fantastic. I read a review where someone commented that they didn't find Vane romantic. I completely disagree...I thought he was honorable, romantic, protective and sweet. I highly recommend this book as I do the entire series. You really don't have to read these in absolute order but I highly suggest you do. Each book builds on the one before and there are things that you may not understand completely if you don't read them in order. Kenyon will explain things briefly to catch you up but it's nothing compared to reading the full story of each character. And the story of Acheron builds in each book which is something that shouldn't be missed. I really hope everyone enjoys this book and series as much as I do."},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"Although better than the previous novel, Night Play seemed to be lacking what the original few had. First introduced in Night Embrace, Bride and Vane's story is actually really sweet and touching. From a distance in NE, were-hunter Vane is instantly attracted to the otherwise larger woman. Still attracted to her some months past, he comes upon her store while out walking from just surviving against some particularly nasty daimons. Fang is still in critical condition. Not knowing the ways of humans, he tells Bride that he wishes to buy some jewelry for someone very special. He then, after purchasing it, gives it to her before walking out. She goes after him in shock and thus begins their relationship. Throughout the novel, Vane tells Bride that he loves her and thinks she's the sexiest woman he's ever seen, despite her size 18. I thought it was pretty refreshing for the hot hunk to go after the non-supermodel just like Fantasy Lover.Born to an Arcadian mother and a Katagaria father, Vane is the sole difference when compared to his brother and late sister. Having only known the wolf-ways, Vane suddenly turned human one day and was forced to fight alone which would, eventually, heighten his unknown powers. Bride, on the other hand, is completely human and oblivious to this world. Although friends with wives of Dark-Hunters, and a certain sister-in-law, she is suddenly forced from her oblivious, boring life to that of adventure and love. As she learns more about Vane and his world, she also comes to realize that she seems to have been left out, as most loved-ones have been involved with this strange world.After a rump in Bride's dressing room, Vane discovers that Bride is his mate and must protect her due to the prize on his head; his scent will be on her. However, because of the sudden burn mark on her hand, Bride is torn from being terrified for her life and her affection towards the man that seemed to be sorely attracted to her. She comes across a beautiful wolf who seems to understand everything she says. She instantly takes a liking to him and longing for the man who was starting to make his way into her heart, she names him \\"Vane.\\"Always the sucker for humor, I loved the way how Vane stood up for Bride against her recent ex, particularly with the moving and the dinner. He's definitely a classy guy even without the knowledge of 'human courtships.' :) Night Play opens to Fang and Vane's bickering, or, more particularly, Fang's constant whining and rambling which I thought was hilarious. I personally thought that Bride freaked out too easily and accepted things too oddly, but I suppose that's what makes her, her, especially when being compared to previous women who either know of the dark-hunter existence or has some sort of direct unknown connection. Bride is definitely nave of everything around her. Vane's loyalty to here was very touching, even when he was not always around. I also found myself immediately liking the rouge, lone wolf who is introduced. I hope to see his book out soon. Also with new books, Ami&eacute;e and Fang's story is in the beginning of NP and I can't wait until this one comes out sometime next year.A couple of characters are re-visited, which is always a major plus for me. I was disappointed when Zarek did not make an appearance as he did in the previous, but he'll probably show up sometime soon. Ash and Simi show up, seemingly always together now, and was actually in this novel quite a few times, another pleasant plus."},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"I've been trying to read the DH series in order, however that's not always possible since my local library doesn't carry all the titles. Having grown tired of the ardeur in the Anita Blake series and what she's doing to my poor Richard Zeeman, I needed a break.Out of all the couples in the DH series, I believe Vane and Bride are my favorite and yes, it IS because Bride isn't a size 2. Thank you, Ms. Kenyon, for giving us women a heroine who is more realistic looking. :) I loved how Vane didn't make one snide remark about her size and how he loved her for who she is.My guy read the book (?! He says he was curious to see why these books caught my fancy; yeah, sure) and he said that most men like women who have something to hold on to.

One reviewer made the point that the heroine has sex with the hero within the first few pages of the book. While this does happen it doesn't impart the book with a sense of completion. The romantic journey is far from over.While even though I am far from a perfect size 6, I have become accustomed to reading books with perfect heroines with perfect bodies. What is refreshing about this book is not that the heroine (Bride) is a size 18 but rather that she has realistic insecurities. it isn't so much the falling in love that helps her gain the confidence to overcome quite a few of her hang-ups but a genuine journey of self discovery.There are a few standard and over the top moments where the hero (Vane) saves the heroine from certain death and also embarrassment. These somewhat clich&eacute; moments do not detract from the wonderful flow of the story.What makes this book really stand out for me is the fascinating world of Dark Hunters- Were-Hunters, Gods, Goddesses, Demons, Daimons, and etc. Sherrilyn Kenyon has created an absolutely absorbing world!"},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"When Bride McTierney opens up the FedEx letter, she isn't sure what is more shocking - the fact that she's just been dumped, or that her boyfriend actually had the audacity to use her own FedEx account? Outraged, humiliated and feeling so rejected, she cries her heart out until the most amazing man walks into her shop.Having just lost his beloved sister and with his brother lying in comatose after the savage attack of Daimons, Vane has been alone for months, grieving over the tragedy that befell his kin. While out wandering in New Orleans, he passes by a shop and, much to his shock, he sees the woman whose memory has haunted him ever since he saw her eight months ago. Unable to stop himself, he walks into her shop to find her crying. Thinking that he will just comfort her before walking away from her for good, he never expected that the Fates have marked her as his mate. But as a Were-Hunter, he knows that a human female could never survive his life. But could he possibly be wrong? Could the gentle, beautiful woman whose decision could ultimately alter their lives for the worse or better be the answer to his lonely existence?If you have read NIGHT EMBRACE, you would have had a brief glimpse of the time when Vane \\"almost\\" met Bride. We knew then how mesmerized he was by her, and in this novel, we are told of the loss he felt after letting her go without introducing himself that day, and how he thought about her every single day since.NIGHT PLAY, just like the previous books, had me enthralled from the very start. I loved the fact that Bride isn't the beautiful, stick-thin heroine that we always see in romance books. Sure, she had some hang-ups about her weight, but so do most women regardless of their size. And this is what makes her real and what makes Vane so adorable. He saw the real beauty in her. And he loved her enough to willingly sacrifice his own happiness by not forcing her against her will, even though her refusal could mean decades of utter solitude for him. Now that's what I call a \\"great\\" hero.As with her other books, the author has blended humor, sizzling love scenes and a thoroughly enjoyable plot, helped more by the appearance of some of the characters in the previous books, and the addition of new and quite interesting characters that scream for their own story. And although you won't find the usual Matrix-style fighting that we have seen in its predecessors, NIGHT PLAY is a fast-paced and enjoyable ride that would make you reach for the next instalment, or the previous ones if you're new to Kenyon.And did I mention that the great Acheron and Simi, his beloved demon, provide much laughter too?Please keep them coming Ms Kenyon - and FAST!"},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"i have read most of her books just love them re bought this book lost the frist one i had i read them over and over"},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"Not a dark hunter, but he'll do.

Her newest installment, Night Play, was excellent!Night Play is the first book that centers around the world of the Were-Hunters. We have seen glimpses into their world through earlier books by the author but this is the first one devoted to a Were character. Vane and Bride are both characters that we met in Night Embrace, and you knew then that these two would end up together! And what a couple! Vane was just perfect-he accepted the heroine as she was, tried at all times to protect, love and understand her and was willing to bend for her (plus it does not hurt that he was HOT.) The heroine of Bride was one that most women could relate to. She is not perfect by society's standards and was hurt badly because of that mindset. However despite all that, she takes a chance with the hero to love again. For that reason, I thought she was great.The plot, dialogue, setting, and premise were all well written. The book was fast paced so I was never bored. The secondary characters really fleshed out the story and we see some characters from older books make a visit. Kenyon really does a good job explaining the world of the Were-Hunter.All in all, a great read! Thanks Mrs. Kenyon!"},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"Being an avid fan of Anne Rice and Laura K.Hamilton I bought Night Play because of the similar content, and also the review on the back cover said \\"move over Anne Rice\\". To say I was disappointed is an understatement.Night Play lacked the depth, details and intelligence of any of Anne Rice or Hamilton novel. I thought the plot was generic and immature. Reading this book, I felt like I was eavesdropping on some 20 year old's fantasy. Let me refer to the a scene where Taylor (the evil ex-boyfriend) comes to drop off Bride's things and intends to just leave them on the curb. But wait, here comes Vane to the rescue, roaring in on a motorcycle, clad in black leather. He jumps the curb, hauls Bride into his arms and pays the movers $10,000 to put her stuff \\"anywhere she wants.\\" When the movers express doubt over his offer, he whips out his cell phone and pushes button 1, his banker, who agrees to anything he wants. Button 2 is his attorney, who will handle the lawsuit Taylor threatens when Vane tries to pummel him. It was way over the top.In most other books similar to this series I can pick up anywhere in the series and pretty much follow along. But with Night Play I was left wondering, what is a were hunter, who are dark hunters, what are sentinals... and what exactly is Vane?? A were hunter? A sentinal? It was suggested that he was a lot more. Actually, there was a lot left unsaid, very poor descriptions and details. The humans turned to were-whatevers by \\"flashing\\"- \\"Poof!\\" In fact, there was a lot of flashing going on. Vane \\"flashed\\" here and there to different locations, back and forth in time, in and out of wolf form. Even the coffee was flashed!Basically, this is a good book if you are looking for a light romance about mystical beings. However, if you want a book that is a little more intense and meaningful stick with, or try Anne Rice or Laura K. Hamilton. I would not say you could fly through those books in a couple hours, like many reviewers said of this book, but the time spent is well worth the effort."},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"I've been reading the Dark-Hunter series from the beginning and while I loved both Fantasy Lover and Night Pleasures, the last three full length stories were not as good. This book redeemed the series IMO.First, we are back in New Orleans, which was missing from the last two stories, and we get to see some of the better reoccurring characters at length. Nick, Kyrian, Tabby, Julian, Amanda and Grace as well as Ash and the demon with ADHD, Simi, all had a roll in this book. We also get a snippet of Valirius not being a total stiff and his squire is a riot!But the relationship between Bride and Vane was what made the story sing. Bride is about as average and unassuming as possible, while Vane is dark and tormented (like so many of the other heroes.) He cherishes her for the softness she brings into his life, while she gains confidence in herself by having a man love her unconditionally. There was a great balance between the ordinary and extraordinary happenings in this book and the characters are smart, witty and highly entertaining. Overall, a great read!"},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"Like the rest of the Dark-Hunter novels, I literally devoured this book! I simply could not put it down until I had read it all, because it kept me hooked from the start and didn't let me go until the end.I think what I loved the most about this book was that Bride was a heroine I could relate to, being a size-18 woman myself. She was real. Vane finds her beautiful, not because of what she looks like, but because of who she is. It doesn't matter to him that she isn't a perfect size three annorexic, in fact, he loves her all the more because she isn't! If only we could all find a guy like that."},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"i wasn't really all that excited in reading Night Play since i did not quite like Seize The Night. but i thought, what the heck...and you know what, it was worth it...and more. though i was a bit miffed that i got the order of reading wrong, i still immensely enjoyed Night Play. at first i did not think much of the hero being part wolf or something like that since i thought that it might just be another one of those typical \\"werewolf\\" plots, but, surprisingly enough, Vane's story was intriguing from the start.next thing i knew, i was staying up all night, finishing the book in no time. i was hooked.i also liked that kenyon made an unconventional heroine in Bride. she's not the usual svelte female in most romance novels. the fact that she has an issue about her physical appearance made the story more realistic (and that's a lot considering the nature of the French Quarter...) and the fact that Vane fell hard...as in really hard...for Bride made the story so envy-worthy for any female reader.im sure some of those who read this has yearned to have someone like Vane (i.e. a charming, sexy, gorgeous hunk of a man) in their life.i really liked the story of this one as compared to Seize the Night since kenyon concentrated more in developing the relationship between Vane and Bride. her superb intertwining of the lovers' story with the many obstacles Vane has in connection with his \\"world\\" has redeemed kenyon in my eyes. i really loved this story: from the subtle and sometimes outrageous humor, sensual scenes, to the quirks of the supernatural and normal characters.bytheway, watch out for Fury. now that's another de-lish specimen of a...man. female readers beware, there's an overload of handsome males in this book..."},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"A guest review by Danielle HillHeroine: abundantBride McTierney thought she would never recover from her broken heart when her long-term boyfriend tossed her aside because her plus-sized physique didn't fit his upwardly mobile lifestyle. Not until two-legged wolf Vane Kattalakis seduced away her tears, anyway. She treasured the experience as a sweet memory to ease her pain, thinking he was just hers for one night. But her connection with Vane is destined to last a lifetime, at least for him.It turns out that the most beautiful woman that Vane Kattalakis has ever laid eyes on, a human woman at that, is his bride-to-be whether he likes it or not. And he has but six weeks to convince her to become his true mate, or he will spend the rest of his very long life neutered. For Vane is a Katagaria, a wolf who can take the form of a mortal--and a powerful one at that. But he has enemies that he must protect the sweet, vulnerable and sexy Bride from until she decides whether or not to take him as her mate for eternity.Vane only hopes that he can keep himself from falling in love with her as he struggles to keep her alive.What worked for me:\\"Night Play\\" has snappy dialogue, enough humor to induce boisterous laughter, and enough angst to drive you to tears. The dangerous situations that the characters find themselves in make you hold your breath, and the power of the love story causes your heart to beat faster. Vane is a sexy, tortured hero with enough taste to appreciate a real woman in Bride. He is tender and possessive and completely captivated with her. She is sweet and likeable, a woman you would want to be friends with in real life. The sex scenes are very sensual but also emotional, serving to strengthen the connection between Bride and Vane. I loved how there was no question that he found her to be very sexy.\\"Night Play\\" also has some really great secondary characters, some of which are old friends from the previous books in the Dark Hunter series. Kenyon also introduces new characters that definitely show their capability of carrying their own novels in the future.I also really enjoyed the deft way in which Kenyon played out dysfunctional family dynamics and agonies with a uniquely dangerous edge. Vane's family really doesn't get along, to the point that they want him dead. His mother actually nearly beat him to death when he was a helpless puppy because of her hatred for his father. You hurt for him that he truly feels alone except for his brother Fang, who languishes in a coma. His family troubles truly put my own into perspective. You want Vane to find happiness and tenderness with Bride, little of which he has had in his long life.Size-wise Bride is a bona fide size eighteen, and Vane sees her as the most beautiful woman in the world.What didn't work for me:There was nothing about this book that wasn't done right. I hated to see it end.Overall:I can't sing this novel's praises enough. If you want to read an excellent story full of unforgettable characters, sizzling sex, and humor, with a sexy hero and beautiful plus-sized heroine, you've got to go out and grab this one.If you liked \\"Night Play\\" you might also enjoy the Halloween reading list or one of the other wonderful Dark Hunter series installments that reveal the intriguing world of the Were-Hunter.Warning: Spicy (but tasteful) love scenes, and there are some descriptions of violence that might stir the mild-mannered reader."},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"this is the sort of book you go back to when nothing new has been published (that you find interesting). it is my favorite kenyon novel so far... really worth having"},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"I have enjoyed every one of Sherrilyn Kenyon's Dark-Hunter novels so far, but Night Play is undoubtedly among the best she has written up to this point. Vane is just a hero you want to drool over and Bride is an honest to goodness real woman. She is an actual size 18, not one of those heroines who is a size 10 and thinks she's so fat. The romance factor is touchingly sweet, the villains are bad, and, if you're like me, you will end up laughing out loud through half the book. It is definitely one you don't want to miss."},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"I just got a Kindle for Christmas.

This book may be the best of the series.. If not the best, at least top 5.."},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"The StoryVane lost his sister and his brother is now comatose. Vane is lost and lonely. He is walking down the street when he sees the woman he has been unable to forget-Bride. His wolf howls for her. He starts spending time with him, now the fates have spoken and marked them as mates. He has three weeks to decide to mate for life or Vane will be impotent as long as Bride lives. He is afraid his enemies will hurt her if he mates, but the thought of living without her is equally unacceptable.ThoughtsI absolutely love Vane, Fang and Fury. The wolf brothers are an excellent addition to the Dark-Hunter family. Vane is protective and unique, family is everything to him. He is the strongest magically in centuries. This is every girl who ever thought she was chubby's dream come true. Bride has self esteem, she just never thought someone with her body type would ever be with someone who looks like Vane. Its every girls dream to end up with someone like Vane. I loved how they are together, how he only sees her. Their love and connection is evident and comes off the pages exceptionally well. I wish there was more of the Kattagaria and Arcadian books, even if it was a different series that would be fantastic!"},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"Vane Kattalakis is a Were-Hunter and a Katagaria which means he was born a wolf. The only hang up is that his mother was Arcadian and this caused him to change into human form when he hit puberty. His father always hated him and his brothers for their Arcadian half. Then, when helped protect Talon's mate Sunshine from the Daimons that wanted her. This caused the Daimons to retaliate on his pack and kill his sister and her pups; It gave Markus (Vanes Father) the perfect opportunity to eliminate the two sons he never wanted in the first place. After having them tied and bound, he then sent word to the Daimons were they could find and destroy his sons. What he did not expect was the strength and willingness to do anything to protect his brother Vane had and he saved them both from certain death by the Daimons. But not before Fang was seriously injured.Fang reverted back to his wolf form and ever several months after healing he still would not take human form, would not hardly eat. This worried Vane he couldn't lose Fang, he just lost Anya his sister. Fang was all he had left in the world,till he found her.Bride McTierney was having the worst day possible. She just received a letter from her boyfriend sent to her, Via her FedEx account. It read like this:\\"Sorry Bride, But I need a woman more in keeping with my celebrity image. I'm going places and I need the kind of woman at my side who will help me, not hinder me. I'll have your things delivered to your building. Here's some money for a hotel tonight in case you don't have any vacant rooms. Best, Taylor\\"Bride felt she should have seen it coming he was never happy with her appearance always tried to not take her out places or made excuses why she could not attend parties with him. He was always putting her on a diet and never was satisfied with her as she was. But none the less this hurt all the same she thought she was in love with Taylor.Vane had just left the good Doc Grace Alexander's office after she told him there was nothing she could do for Fang, if he was not ready to heal. This couldn't be more upsetting, he needed his brother and not just because they were being hunted by his pack and he couldn't keep his brother safe like this. But because he desperately loved his brother and needed him to wake up, he needed him. He felt so alone. While walking down the street Vane stop to stare into a shop only to see Bride standing there he had only seen her once before when he was protecting Sunshine and she has been in his thoughts ever since. Before he knew it his feet took him into the shop. He couldn't help himself he had to interact with her. Bide seem to be drawn to him also on a impulse Bride asked him to make love to her right then and there. Well you didn't need to tell Vane twice he was scared he had never taken a human female before and didn't want to hurt her but at the same time he couldn't not have her now.After forcing himself to leave her knowing it was best for both of them he finds markings on his hand indicating he has just met his mate, which is impossible because Bide is human but he has not been with any other woman in months so it must be her.After finding Bride he confirms his fears. He knows he can't keep her but if he lets he go and does not complete the mating ritual he will never be able to be with any other woman, he would be essentially impotent. But as crazy as it sounds that was not his biggest concern, his biggest worry was fear of his pack finding her and exacting their revenge on her as a way to get to him. And this he could not tolerate. But Vane finds he is unable to stay away from Bride so determined to woo her he tries to be the normal man that he thinks she expects, then has his whole facade ruined when she is kidnapped as a way to punish Vane and his pack for the pain and suffering they have caused her and her pack. This will change everything for Vane.I think this is my favorite Dark Hunter book so far. I can't even tell you how much I loved Vane. He is strong and sexy in all the good ways. But he is so cute when he is unsure about how to be human. I loved it. Acheron is fabulous as always I do think I am in love with him. I love Simi also, my favorite part with them is in the doll shop when she is playing dolls with Acheron and baby Marissa and Acheron made Simi's doll look just like her. I also fell in love with Fury he was hilarious; I just cracked up at him especially when he first met Bride and didn't know what to tell her. I loved his bickering with Vane fabulous. I can see there is probably a lot of similarities between Fang and Fury, I was also very glad how the book ended. There is a very good scene at the end of the book. There are so many parts of this book that I liked I can't even list them all for you without giving the whole book away."},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"I have read this book before and I loved it then.

This one was a change--mostly because it contained werewolves. I liked the beginning. Kenyon grabs the readers attention by showing the were brothers hanging from trees, left for dead. She introduces the female character by receiving a fed-ex from her now ex, dumping her. Very witty, very attention getting.My only fault is that she is alway elborating on how over weight Bride is and how self-conscience she is about it, yet during the first love scene, she's watching her body in the mirror. Over weight women that have a problem with their bodies, would not be over eager to stare at them naked in a mirror.Vane is the man almost every woman dreams of. I love this sexy character. The parts where he puts Bride's ex in his place are priceless!"},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"Where to start. Okay, enter \\"Bride\\", the \\"heroine\\" (loose use of the term), atypical for the part. She is a boring pushover, idiotic, weak of character, whiney, self-deprecating, irritating at best and obsessed with the fact that she is nearly the size of two heriones (size 18) yet does nothing about it except express excuses, self pity, and low self expectations.In the opening chapters of the book she is dumped by her 'boyfriend' of five years via Fed Ex and she is 'devasted'. Apparently she is quick to recover, however, because inside of 30 minutes she's \\"having the longest climax of her life\\" with a complete stranger in her shop. There was no chemistry build up to this scene. I don't believe a stranger buying her a necklace constitutes conjugale rights. Not my idea of \\"romance\\". Where is this woman's self worth?The man, Vane, (much more appealing in his short stints in early novels)is the were-whatever. Throughout this book he conveniently gains new magical talents, chapter by chapter, to the point where he is nearly invincible, (yet inexplicably still concerned for his safety?)Okay . . . if you buy all that, Bride spends the rest of the book vascillating between obsessing on her old boyfriend, and wondering \\"Why\\" Vane wants to be with her. (This is a role model for large women? Sherrilyn you should be ashamed of yourself for slathering Bride with every cliche that is associated with the same.)The lack of free-will for Vane only adds to the insult here. Even he isn't sure if he is with her because he loves her, or because the \\"Fates\\" deemed it so. If he choses otherwise, he would be celebate until the day she dies . . . what choice do you think he will make here . . .Vane spends the rest of the novel in what appears to be \\"old home week\\" with characters flashing in and out of each chapter, people flashing here and there, food flashing in and out, clothes flashing on and off, etc.As with the last book, the real climax of the story takes place about 100 pages before the book ends. The rest of the story is meandering filler which includes . . . are you ready for this . . . all the were-whatevers dancing the MACARENA . . .Everytime I would try and get beyond the self-deprecating thoughts of Bride long enough to try and find some value in the story, the author would use lines such as \\"She couldn't stop blubbering.\\" Based on the cliches for large women that are rampant in the book, I really don't believe that Kenyon has done anyone any favors with her portrayal of Bride.My pet peeves with her writing in no particular order:* Maybe it's just me, but I find the constant references to her other works and websites in these books extremely cheesy.* Sophomoric sex talk* Two dimensional characters* NO Romance - only Gratuitous sex* Inconsistencies from story to story* Juvenile dialog* Riddled full with clichesI really didn't care for any of the characters in this book regardless of their size and shape, not even the bit players.

I can forgive what, to me, was very juvenile dialogue in something like Twilight, which made up for that in tension, but this is an adult book and Twilight is probably the only YA series I will ever trudge through. I guess a girl in her twenties might still be in that really awkward stage but I wouldn't be able to socialize with her which left me wondering why the hero would. OK, so she's a bigger girl...why can't she set an example and be proud of who she is? Just a thought."},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"I was disappointed in this book, even though I still love Darkhunter novels. I'll probably buy and read them as long as the author writes them, but there's just no way to honestly say this one (or the last one) are anywhere near as good as the first few in the series. If you've never read a Darkhunter novel, don't start with this one - it might turn you off to them and then you'd miss out on the earlier, much better books in the series.The problem is that the book just goes through the motions. It didn't have the passion of previous Darkhunter stories, and the characters didn't have as much depth. We don't really get to hear much about the hero at all, and there is a lot of indirect speech instead of dialogue. It's very repetitive, and you keep hearing the same things over and over again from the author, like how hurt Bride was by her ex, and how Vane can't believe she will accept him, but there isn't a lot of action and dialogue to really show you that these things are true.I never felt anything for Vane - in fact, he was more impressive in his brief appearance in a past novel than he was here - and never really liked Bride, whose only distinguishing feature is that she's fat. Really, really fat. She didn't do or say anything to make herself loveable, either, so I couldn't see any rhyme or reason to the fact that Vane fell for her. She seemed to spend most of her time whining about her ex-boyfriend (even after she'd met Vane, which made no sense), and worrying about her weight. In fact, it seemed there was more attention paid to Bride and her weight than to the hero. I would have preferred to read more about the hot wolfman, and much less about the insecure, obese shop owner.The book is a big zero on the sensuality scale, too, unlike previous books. The love scenes are as passionless as the characters, and there is no anticipation since they make rather dull love the first time they meet.All in all, the book goes through the motions and follows the formula, but it's uninspired."},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"This lady writer is daring and adorable.She possesses excellent skills at weaving magic with every book.

She has no dignity or self-respect and spends most of the novel in abject subservience to the power of the Were-Hunter wallet. But she does it all through free-will. So that makes her acceptable. Not.Even the parts of the story not focused on the romance continue the trailer theme with the hero at serious loggerheads with his father. In fact, fathers hating sons is a signature of the Dark-Hunter series.The whole novel is about dysfunctional relationships and experiences. \`No good deed goes unpunished' is a saying that appears in the story. What on earth is that about? How negative and miserable.However. I am determined to finish reading this book. Despite the fact it's extremely tough going. Why on earth did that stupid woman stay with a partner who treated her like dirt for 5 years? Why is so much of the novel devoted to Bride's petty squabbles with her former partner?About half-way through the adventure kicks in which makes for a much more interesting read. What I like about the Dark-Hunter world is that it's basically a very sociable world. The guys go to bars, drink, have fantastic tatts, live in each other's houses and all know Ash and Simi. But Bride doesn't get any better. And actually I'd like the DHs a lot more if they weren't all so very very handsome.It turns out that Bride is actually a daughter of the state's most successful veterinarian. (!!!) And she tries to justify her relationship with her former disrespectful partner like this; \\"...sometimes we let other people treat us wrongly because we want to be loved and accepted so badly we'd do anything for it.\\" Pardon me? That is the philosophy of criminals, doormats, women who like to victimise themselves and hookers. If you have self-esteem you don't 'do anything' for some idiot's 3 minute love. By the end of the novel Bride is still fat and ugly. Nothing wrong with that. But her self-esteem is still totally dependent on another person; Vane. Get therapy sister.This novel is not an enjoyable read at all. But I know many readers will disagree. Never mind."},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"I have read all of her books and have loved them. I found the constant discussion of Bride's weight and body image issues (she is a size 18) a bit distracting. I also found it hard to picture Vane with her (maybe it's the pessimist in me, sorry...).I would have been happier to have it said that she was overweight, not the perfect body type (who is??) and let it go with that.Regardless, I did enjoy it and look forward to her next."},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"Kenyon is a real \\"hit and miss\\" author. I have decided her books fall into 3 categories - \\"Buy,\\" \\"Borrow\\" and \\"Don't Bother.\\" This books is a don't bother, because it's just irritating with a big \\"ick factor.\\"The entire book is essentially \\"really hot studyl guy has the hots for an obese woman.\\" Yeack. It's very difficult to like a character who likes nothing about herself and just feels sorry for herself. Several of Kenyon's characters - (such as Grace in book 1 and Sunshine in book 3) are described in rather unflattering terms, but in this book Kenyon takes it to a whole new level, and NOT in a good way."},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"Looking for something light to read between the last Dexter novel and the upcoming Vince Flynn, I pulled this one off the shelf. My Wife likes Kenyon, so I thought I'd try one. Unfortunately, I realized about 100 pages in that I had already read this one before. What total trash! Oohh, he's so sexy. Oohh, I can't wait to get in her pants...\\" Blah, blah, blah. The unfortunate part is that it starts off almost interesting. But, it falls quickly after the prologue. Its a book about nothing, without Seinfeld's wit.Basically, all we have here is a writer detailing her leather-clad, bad-boy [...] for her readers, like all her other books. She came highly recommended, but I would never pick up one of her books again. Just creepy-bad!"},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"I had to force myself to finish this one as the story and characters it never really caught me enough.Also, while having a lush figure and carrying 10-20 pounds extra so the heroine isn't unrealistically skinny would indeed be refreshing, a size 18 is heading for, if not already, obese, sorry. An obese heroine contrasted with the hero being so physically perfect just doesn't gel for many readers ... myself in particular :-(And for those who blindly believe urban myths: \\"A woman of Marilyn's height, at the extreme of Marilyn's weight range (140 lbs), would probably wear a size 12 dress today (which is the same dress size listed for Marilyn in the book The Unabridged Marilyn).\\" See www.snopes.com/movies/actors/mmdress.htm"},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"She's a good enough writer with a great imagination, but too much time spent on her heroine's size 18 body and the hot guy inexpliciably going for it is not only unconvincing but icky."},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"The sex scenes are quite disturbing. Especially when the heroine is a size 18. Maybe the author is trying to reach out to the plus size women and I totally get the point, you don't have to be stick skinny to live in this world, but this a romance novel and I'd like the author to at least keep the heroines the dress size they usually wear.She also has to be more convincing on how a classic handsome looking heart throb managed to fall in love with a woman such as Bride. She just seems a little plain."},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"I just got this book and I have already reread it once. I could not believe that the heroine was a plus size woman, with all of the insecuritites that we sometimes have.As for Vane, WOW!This book is very well written and I would highly recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"Tired of the old, stuffy adages for vampires, werewolves and demons...then welcome yourself to SK's Dark-Hunters series. If you haven't been introduced to this intriguing and fascinating world, don't worry. The author provides plenty of background so you don't get lost.The book begins with Were-Hunter, Vane Kattalakis, distraught over the death of his sister, and the injury sustained to his brother who now lies comatose. All of Vane's life he has had to fight for what he wants and needs. Growing up in a wolf pack is definitely for the dogs, especially when both your mother and father hate you...and have tried to kill you at least once.Vane is steadily growing tired of the struggle. And, now without the companionship of his brother and sister...and with a death bounty on his head, he just wants to find a little peace. He doesn't expect a human woman to fulfill his desire, but in Bride McTierney, Vane finds all he ever needs.Bride is a sweet, compassionate woman who has just been dumped by her loser ex-boyfriend. She just wants someone to love her for her. When she meets Vane, Bride is a little scared of his intense and passionate nature. She has never met anyone like him...someone with magic powers, shapeshifting abilities...and stamina that can only be dreamed about. Yet, it isn't easy knowing your boyfriend is a dog, literally.This was such a wonderful book! I immediately rushed out to buy the rest of the series. The dialogue, wit, and humor is very funny. And, Vane makes this one a definite keeper. A true Alpha with a heart of gold, he makes you want to start looking for your own Were-Hunter.Check this out! You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"I've read four of her books and I'm fully addicted and can't wait to get the next one! I wind up staying up very late trying to get to the next page and once I get to that page I want to read more - I can't put it down. It's entertaining, funny and full of action and romance! Being a big fan of Buffy The Vampire Slayer and Charmed, this fits right in! Thank You! I can't get enough."},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"Get out your notebook and pen because you'll need it to keep track of all of the people and all of the various lineages. I finally gave up and just decided to enjoy the character Vane. He was so well written, a little clueless as to dating but he so clearly loves the heroine and his brother.Actually I enjoyed this more than any of the other Dark Hunter books except for the first one. So will you."},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"This is yet another excellent book by Sherrilyn Kenyon!!It is considered part of the &quot;Darkhunter&quot; series, although Vaneis a were-hunter not a DH. Still many of the chararacters fromprevious books make a cameo appearance. Also in this book welearn a bit more about the infamous &quot;Sanctuary&quot; and the Peltierfamily that runs it. You don't have to read this series in order,Sherrilyn does a great job of filling in any needed information.If you do read this one first you will scramble to find theprevious ones, that are that good. It all starts with FantasyLover.)One of my personal favorite quirks of SK's writing is that herheroine's are not &quot;cookie cutter&quot; perfect. Each are as unique,as their story. Her character's have to battle both inner demonsand outer daimons before finding their way. She also has the bestwebsite available when you do develop the &quot;DH Addiction&quot;.www.dark-hunter.com"},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"I waited eagerly for this latest Dark Hunter novel. Vane's appearance in Night Embrace was so memorable, along with his facination with Bride.Ms. Kenyon does a wonderful job of fleshing out his character. He is vulnerable and sensitive due to abuse. Under the tough (and undoubtably cute) exterior, readers will be happy to find out that there is more than meets the eye.Born of a \\"mixed\\" union, his father's people have often been hunted by his mother's line. Although both species are were creatures, one spends more time as beast while the other is more comfortable as man.Just trying to survive his father's abuse and his mother's scorn would be scarring to anyone. Vane does not want to hurt Bride, his destined human mate. This is a touching story. Of course, love will conquer all, but it's an intersting read getting there!This is definitely a keeper. It's supernatural romance at it's finest."},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"I have waited for Vanes' book since Kenyon introduced him in a previous book. I love the fact that Bride was full figured. (Fat Ladies need love too.) Of the entire series I think this book is my favorite. Kenyon has introduced so many different charactors that she should not have to jump around genres for at least 5 years. I hate it when authors get a reader all wrapped up in a series they have started, then stop and write about something else. To date Sherrilyn Kenyon is worth the bucks at the book store."},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"I love the fact that she's decided to head into new territory with her newest, and in my opinion, one of the very best novels Ms. Kenyon has written to date. I still love a good old fashioned vampire novel but I have to say it was so refreshing to read about a different character from your typical paranormal fare.I love her style, her prose and the beauty of her worlds. This story didn't disappoint me in the slightest. All the new and wonderful characters she's brought into this novel, along with a few of our old favorites made this tale thoroughly enjoyable.No this story didn't have as much action as her others and that she was able to keep me hanging on the edge of my seat without that shows her skill as a masterful writer. This story centers more on the budding love affair between the hero/heroine and his need to get Bride to bind herself to him before their three week time period is up. Otherwise, horror of all horrors, he'll be a neutered dog (or wolf in this case) for as long as she lives! And what self-respecting wolf would want that????More so than any of her other novels, this was filled with massive amounts of humor and all in all was just wonderful. If you want a fast, easy read than I totally urge you to run, not walk, to your nearest bookstore and pick it up.Far as Bride's size went, 18, didn't bother me in the slightest. I only wish you'd see men more often fall for the beauty that's inside a woman than the outer shell."},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"I love Sherrilyn Kenyon's four Dark-Hunter novels that have been released so far. I really think that she should just stick to writing those and abandon these spin-off series. I absolutely detested her short Dream-Hunter story from last year and I don't think this first full length Were-Hunter novel is much better. Many times I almost put the the thing down for I couldn't see the point. Sometimes I would even flip to the back, start reading the teaser from the next DH book, and wish Night Play would magically morph into that one.When Kenyon writes for her Dark-Hunter series I expect cool, action-packed plot lines and characters that leap off the pages. Unfortunately, Night Play's plot is as skimpy as Brittany Spears' thong and the heroine is so tedious and annoying I want to drown her in a bathtub.Meet Bride McTierney, the plus sized heroine that everybody's wetting their panties about. I sure wish I hadn't. If Bride is supposed to empower women who have meat on their bones, we live in sad, cruel world indeed. Bride is a insulting joke. I know many people have body image issues. Heck, I wish my thighs were slimmer and I could shave off ten pounds really quick, but I don't spend all day thinking about it. Bride is a character that is solely defined by her body image issues and her own insecurities. It almost seemed like for every page of action, there were two pages of Bride whining about what an unloveable lard-butt she is. Maybe I would be more sympathetic if Bride started dancing with Richard Simmons instead of doing her tedious pity party thing all the time. Even worse is Kenyon making Bride come across as a complete loser, from Bride's involvment with her jerk wad ex-boyfriend who she stayed with because there was no one else to her being stood up at the prom for being a 'fatty' to her OWN sister ridiculing her while Bride takes it like a doormat. The only thing I can figure is that Kenyon made Bride the world's toilet bowl so getting the studdly hero would make her victory over all the naysayers who treated her badly would be sweeter. Of course, the perfect chippendale hero that serendipity provides for her, Vane thinks her cellulite is the sexiest thing ever and through his sexual healing, Bride gains her self-esteem. I just think there is something really condensending to all that.There is a really skimpy subplot about Vane's wolf-pack wanting to kill him and an indepth delving into of Vane's non-stop tragedy of a past. The crux of the book is Bride wringing her hands and worrying in between bouts of lovemaking if Vane can love her and her blubber. I start wondering if it's really her personality and not her weight that's the cause of her problem with men, so don't look a gift horse in the mouth, sweets. There is also some ridiculous subplot about Vane worrying about how she will react to him being a werewolf. I mean, Bride hangs around with the Deverauxs, knows Kyrian and Acheron, and her dad even knows about the were-Hunters. How can she not have a clue about the supernatural stuff!? If the Dark-Hunters want to keep their war with the Daimons secret that need to do a much better job of hiding themselves cause it seems like all of New Orleans knows about them.Even the vibrant side-characters couldn't save this book. Normally I'd be thrilled to Acheron, Simi, and the rest but this time they only enforce what a tedious character Bride is."},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"\\"Night Play\\" is a Romance novel with fantasy elements and a fantastic hook. The leading man, V., is a handsome young werewolf. The leading lady, B., is an average woman -- average income, average education, average looking, slightly overweight, and self consious about her appearance -- just like most readers (hurrah, not another anemic chick). B. is working sales in a store, depressed because her scum boyfriend dumped her. V. walks into the store, is immediately smitten, and comforts her. Wow, what a great beginning! The first three chapters are 5 star material.Alas, the rest of the book stinks. Each chapter gives V. one more magical super-power; and introduces 2 to 5 more support characters, most of them powerful allies. Each new support character is well described & interesting -- and drops out of the story in a couple chapters, to be replaced by someone else. This story is so overwhelmed by support characters that the main couple fade into the background.By half way through the book, V. has so many magical powers & powerful allies, that the antagonists are no longer a threat. V. acts nervous, but it isn't convincing. By the end of the book, V. can travel through time, teleport anywhere, magically prevent people from getting killed (even if they receive fatal blows), and last long enough in the sack that any real person would get borred.Sherrilyn Kenyon's other Dark-Hunter Novels are enjoyable reads -- get one of the others, instead of this one."},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"Everything Kenyon writes is amazing.

I enjoyed Vane working through his wolf and human side.Was very glad to read Bride wasn't the usual size 8 heroin and although insecure about her body didn't go on and on about it.This was one of the few books that I laughed out loud and really enjoyed the change of pace.I happened on Dk.

It differs from the others a bit because there's very little action and all romance--the focus is entirely on the couple. Bride is an ordinary, average human woman who has recently had her heart broken. Vane is a Were-Hunter who is surprised to find that fate has chosen Bride as his mate.The best way to describe the bulk of this book is very cheesy romance. It's sweet and silly and laugh-out-loud funny. Vane is a very appealing hero, while Bride is easy to relate to. Not the best of Kenyon's books, but still worth reading."},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"This book was more about the romance than some of the other books in this series. I liked Bride (but I'm not crazy about her name) and Vane, though the book followed Kenyon's usual \\"supernatural man finds love with human woman but he thinks they shouldn't be together\\" formula. I also like how Kenyon's leading ladies are not the stereotypical drop dead gorgeous bombshells. Not a lot of substance here, but that's really not what I was looking for. You read these books for a fun supernatural romp complete with some hot between the sheets action."},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"This was a welcome relief after reading the last book. I liked the continuation of the story of the wolves. I especially liked how the ending wasn't wrapped in an over sized bow. We hope it turns out okay.

Obviously their self-hatred extends to the romance genre as well.Well, as a healthy and happy size 14 to 16 amazonian queen, I don't have such problems and I loved Bride McTierney as much as I loved Sunshine Ravenwolf - yet another full figured female in the Dark-Hunter universe. There were times I wanted to hit her for not having a little more faith in herself, but could understand her reluctance to get emotionally attached as well as her self-esteem issues considering her jerk-off ex-boyfriend dumped her for something that looked like a bone, but when it came down to defending her man, Bride was all business.Was it improbable for Vane Kattalakis, this drop-dead gorgeous stud of a man/wolf to find his mate in a size 18, red-haired venus of willendorf of a woman? No it wasn't, because Vane saw the beauty inside as well as savored the lush curves on the outside. Their lovemaking scenes were actually rather celebratory of the full-figured woman and made me cheer as well as get aroused.And what was there not to like about Vane? Tall, dark, furry, fiercely loyal to those he loves and...loaded.I may get flamed for this, but the Were-Hunters are just a bit more fascinating to me as a reader than the Dark-Hunters, save for Zarek (my psychotic baby). Just the world Vane and his brother Fang (gotta love those names) inhabit is both beautiful and harsh, full of magic and danger. Parts of Vane's story made me cringe - Kenyon definitely knows how to put the 'fun' in dysfunctional considering that both Vane's parents want to kill him for different reasons. I also loved Vane's other brother, the omega wolf Fury, and I can't wait to read something about him.What else did I love - Sanctuary the Bar (I have got to get down to New Orleans and find this place!) Mama Bear Peltier is like this den mother to all these different types of fantastic beings, and reading about her trouble-prone quintuplets (check out the Dark-Hunter website for pictures - they're all delicious!)brought a huge chuckle. Fury being introduced to mashed potatoes for the first time is side-splitting comedy, and when all three brothers discover what Bride's dad does for a living, I had to stick my hand in my mouth to keep from laughing out loud on the bus. Nick Gautier trying to give Vane lessons on dating (bad idea). Simi the demon deserves her own story some day - maybe she'll get Travis Fimmel, and not eat him. And I will never listen to 'Sweet Home Alabama' again without wondering where Ash is..."},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"This is the second Dark Hunter novel I've read, and I do like them, a lot! I intend to make my way through ALL of them.That said, I have to agree with everything that Ivy, the 'Avid Reader' had to say. There are things not to like in this story.I would have liked to see more of Vane's (vast) powers - he didn't come across as powerful and scary for 90% of the book - more like a loveable dog. I was confused by the fact that he and his brother, Fang, had collars on in the opening of the book that inhibited their powers. It was a story element that was not explained. In fact, Vane was down and out more than once in the story, and only hints were made of the extent of his powers. As if there is a future story waiting to be told, of which this novel only provides the backstory.I never got what it was that brought Fang around, and am a little irritated with the author about an apparent 'Deus es Machina'. I said to myself - WTF! I was also irritated that Fury appeared, 'feral, and dangerous', so-called, and yet had so little to do. It's possible I have to read other books to get more of him (great character), however a really good writer would have woven his arc into this story a little better. He and Fang, and Vane come a long way together in this book. There is a spot in the middle where a little more depth, tension, and mystery about Fury's character would have been appreciated. The author could have strung us out a little longer about Fury.But mostly I enjoyed the interpersonal interplay. I did feel a sense of romance between Vane and Bride (hated that name). I loved their date together. I felt the struggle with Vane to control his animalistic nature, and that was a compelling part of the story, for me. There were spots that were laugh-out-loud funny. I certainly enjoyed the humor. The familial relationships were very enjoyable. I loved the Thanksgiving Dinner scene. There was a charming sense of family that Vane and his brother's were missing. The sex was hot. While I bought Bride's size 18, and loved her for it - loved seeing her through Vane's eyes and that he saw beauty in her curves (I've been a size 18), towards the end I did feel like the author harped on that subject just a little too long. So that it became like nails on a chalkboard. This is not the first time I've noticed a Kinley/MacGregor story obsessing about beauty. In fact all the Were-characters are supposedly (beautiful), in an over-the-top way. So you wonder if the author has some issues with that. Are these 'Mary-Sue' characters?But none of these remarks detract from the story. It is entertaining. It's not going to win a pulitzer prize for literature. So my recommendation is ... read it, and ENJOY it for what it is. ;-)"},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"I will begin this review with a little demographics information. According to an American Demographics journal article in July 2003:\\"The average woman is 5'4\\" tall, weighs 145 lbs. with a dress size of 11 to 14, has a 36-37\\" bust, is about 29\\" around the waist and close to 40\\" around the hips\\".A size 18 is not too far from that. It sounds huge, but it's really not. Take a look at some of the plus size models in some of the fashion catalogs and you will see that while the size sounds humongous to people used to hearing about characters who are a perfect size 6, in real life beautiful people do come in all sizes, and size 18 is not as big as some people imagine it to be. Especially considering that Bride is tall.Now that we have that out of the way, let's talk about this book. I loved this story. It is an amazingly sweet love story, with two very likable characters who simply fit. Vane needed a family oriented girl who is able to surpass every day trials and tribulations. He needed a no-nonsense kind of girl. Bride, regardless of her poor body image, is a strong female lead. She is self sufficient, she does not take attitude from others, and even though in private her feelings may be hurt she does not go about whining about it to everyone or playing the victim. She is very real. She is also just what he needs. On the other hand, she needed a strong partner as well to make her see past her own insecurities. Vane is a dream come true, and is one of my favorite heroes in this genre. I have read a lot of paranormal romance novels (way too many according to my husband!) and I have to say that there are very few heroes out there who, as wonderful as they are, can compete with Vane. The novel has quite a bit of action in it as well. The action does not take over the love story, for which I am glad. That is actually one of my issues with some of her newer books which seem to be more urban fantasy than paranormal romance. These older novels in the series have the right mix of action and romance, and Night Play is no exception.I understand that some people prefer their romance characters to be perfectly fantastical vehicles of escapism. I am of the opinion that I would like to at least somewhat relate to the characters, particularly the female leads. I hate to admit it, but every time I read about a \\"perfect size 6 blonde with blue/green eyes, flawless alabaster skin, tiny hands and feet\\", it just turns me off a little. I cannot relate to that because that is not my reality. Now give me a dark haired, dark eyed, average hispanic girl who is strong despite what life throws at her and still finds her dreamy true love, and you have caught my attention. I understand that not everyone is like me, so I don't begrudge the blonde skinny girls their books. However, having other types of characters that the audience can identify with is smart, and makes Ms. Kenyon's books more interesting to a wider audience."},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"This is Vane and Bride's story.The beginning went right into the action. Not a disappointing moment throughout the book. Maybe except Fang didn't play much of a part. He should've been.I have to admit I was a little afraid of reading the were-hunter's book. But it surprised the heck outta me cuz this book has to be just as good or better than the dark-hunter books. It is a nice change of pace from the dark-hunters. I'm glad we get a look into the other side of their magical world. The side of the were-hunters.An issue though: The guy displayed on the cover? I just can't picture the Vane she talks about and describes in the book as looking like the one on the cover. That totally ruins the book when you have to imagine a not-so-great stud muffin when the description of Vane is so much better.I just got done with this one and I love it. This is one of my faves. The scene at Bride's house with the family is great. Vane is great. This book is great. Looking forward to Fang's book."},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"I found this novel to be one of the hottest Dark-Hunter novels to date. Vane is the sort of wolf you want to sink your teeth into, and i'm glad Ms. Kenyon decided to forgo the usual waif-like heroine for once. Bride is a testament to just how sexy a curvaceous woman can be. All in all, an excellent read. i highly reccommend it."},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"I always look forward to Sherrilyn Kenyon's books and it gets harder and harder to wait for each new one. They are my favorite. When I got my hands on this book it was hard to set it down for anything until I was finished (bought it at lunchtime and was finished by 10pm that night). Only put it down (sadly of course) to go back to work.The characters were exciting and interesting. Her herione was believable and relatable. By that I personally related to her as a person. There is humor, suspense, action, and romance. Besides you don't have to read the others to enjoy it. Although, reading the others will allow you to follow the story of the others that are mentioned in this book and gives you insight into Ash. That is the man I really want to know more about. You can read the back for general information but if you like romance novels that involve the supernatural or just romance in general I HIGHLY recommend reading this one."},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"I am a fan of Kenyon's DH series and have read almost all the others and so was quite surprised to find this one dull and lifeless throughout. While the male lead (Vane) is typically wonderful, the female lead (Bride) is consistently nervous, frightened, whiney and completely ineffectual in that all she does through the story is tag along quietly, never actually doing anything at all, let alone contributing anything important. The love scenes are totally lacking in pizazz, or indeed any emotion at all. Kenyon can do much better than this [see Seize the Night, Winterborn, Fantasy Lover, etc.] No matter how well Vane treats Bride, how sweet, generous, giving, accepting, and noble he is, she is unable to rise above her whiney fear to actually give him anything back or contribute to the relationship in any way. She lacks personality, having neither strength (like Amanda and Grace), humour (like Tabitha), or loyalty (like Astrid, Maggie and Danger).Indeed, when pressed to come up with her positive attributes, the author and the male lead can only list her \\"softness\\". Which, at dress size 18, is not really surprising. I don't have an issue with her weight one way or the other, and much has been made of how great it is to have a romantic lead who is not waif thin. That's fine. But she is hardly a role model for real women as she spends the entire book obsessing about her weight and never just relaxes about it and moves on to developing any actual personality.An interesting point for those who feel Kenyon has done a service to large sized women by casting one in the role of female romantic lead: the male lead stays with her not because he has fallen in love with who she is, but because the Fates have decreed that they are mated and if he doesn't stay with her he can't have sex again until she dies. Not exactly free will here, folks -- Bride does not win Vane fair and square, rather Kenyon has had to stack the deck to keep Vane focussed on Bride. Indeed, when Bride asks Vane if he is with her because of who she is or because of the Fates' decree, he has to honestly reply \\"I don't know\\". It would have been a much better service to women to give this character some personality over and above her weight and nervous fear, so that we'd see that a large sized woman can be sensual, funny, playful, strong, smart, loyal, helpful and good to be with. You won't find that in this book.That being said, the interaction between Vane and his brothers [Fang and Fury] was fun, as was the crowd at Sanctuary and all the cameos by other characters we've come to know and love.Still, overall, a big disappointment in the core love story which was lifeless, flat and dull throughout. Don't waste your time on this one. Any one of Kenyon's others would be a much better choice."},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"I read a few pages of SK's work in an anthology and had a lukewarm response so I made sure I looked at the best and worst reviews along with the excerpts featured here before I purchased. The book seemed to have the right elements in place:1. Bride: an emotionally bruised, \\"regular\\" heroine who's got a reason to be down on love.2. Vane: mysterious, handsome hero who's attracted to the heroine and goes after what he wants.3. Danger.Somehow these ingredients didn't come together to make a great whole.The attraction didn't have a foundation or I should say it had a weak one, in my opinion. Vane saw Bride when he was in wolf form at a street market and months later he sees her in her boutique. Okay. But I wanted to see/feel what drew him to her. Was there an emotional intrigue? An instinctual attraction that kicked in that couldn't be denied? Maybe the author did intend this, but it didn't come off that way and it didn't build enough to make me believe in the first physical encounter. (I'm no prude). Like if the author had shown that Bride's kindness and gentle way had made a deep impression the first time, I would've bought into Vane's perspective because he hasn't had that in his life.It seemed like all Vane had to do was give Bride a few compliments and that was enough for her to sleep with a stranger. I didn't buy it. There wasn't enough heat generated in the scene or emotional connection where I believed Bride would through caution to the wind or get caught up in the moment. The setup didn't seem to lead to something inevitable, which the author wanted us to believe. I'm sure she wrote it that way, but that's not how I experienced it.Bride's ex was made into a cartoon character. I know he's supposed to be an ex for a reason, but the way he was written you had to wonder if Bride had had a lobotomy or if her self-esteem was beneath Lake Pontchartrain.Vane's alpha status was told more than shown. He seemed to be reacting a lot to the various problems, several of which he knew were coming, than taking more control. But that wasn't my big gripe.A major obstacle for me was his complete ignorance of human social norms and dating customs. I could understand it being foreign to him and him needing to familiarize with the differences in dating a human, but he seemed to have just landed from a different planet!Would a *true* alpha male who's 400 years old and has cell phone, a banker on speed dial and a standing reservation at Brennan's not pick up on some human customs along the way? In 400 years? C'mon! Wouldn't a true alpha want to observe how humans interact so he could operate within the human dimension whenver he needed to? Just for survival's sake? If SK had given me a reason for his ignorance, I would have been willing to suspend my disbelief.It seemed like Bride needed a hot guy to validate her as being good enough instead of truly unraveling what her strenghts were along with her flaws. This is the same kind of snobbery where a less attractive person is cast aside, only it's in reverse.The romance didn't seem to have much foundation beyond the fated mate scenario that's prevalent in many paranormals. I don't mind it, but don't hang the romance on it. Show us what makes a hero or heroine endearing and loveable to their partner. How do the characters challenge and comfort each other? I think Kresley Cole does a better job of this with little moments building on each other.I struggled to get through this book and by the time I reached page 300, names like Fury and Fang and the zig zagging to other characters sucked what little pleasure left out of reading this book."},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"Bride McTierney is heartbroken and in tears. Her boyfriend of the last few years has just dumped her because she is not right for his image, being size 18 and all. While she is drowning in tears, the most handsome man she has ever seen walks into her shop. Vane Kattalakis is in fact not a man but a were-hunter (werewolf) who set his eyes in Bride in a previous Dark Hunter novel and believes that she is the most strikingly beautiful woman he has evern seen. Seeing her in tears, he buys her a $600 necklace from her shop and offers it to her and walks out of the shop. Bride chases him down the street with the intention of returning the $600 back to him stating that she cannot not accept such an expensive gift. They end up having one passionate interlude in the back of her shop.Vane walks out of the shop a second time believing that he will never see her again as she is way above his station. Later that evening a mark appears in the palm of his hand. The same mark mysteriously appears on Brides hand aswell. This mark signifies that Bride is Vane's mate and he has all but 3 weeks to convince her to become mated with him, otherwise Vane will have to live a solitary life without any female for the remainder of Bride's life.Vane decides to appear in his wolf form to protect Bride, for the rest of his pack will attack her if they know that he has a potential mate. To complicate matters, his father and his mother both want him dead, as a result of their unwanted relationship. Vane's mother and father come from opposing clans of were-hunters.This was my favourite dark hunter novel so far. Vane is such a gentleman and it's nice to read that Bride is not your usual stick thin twig but a real plus size woman with all her curves and all. Vane really does respect Bride and is real knight in shining armour and we all dream of one of those, don't we? The fact that he is drop dead gorgeous is a plus aswell. I love Sherrilyn Kenyon's modern and witty dialogue. She sure knows how to spin a fairytale yarn. A very highly recommended read. You will not be disappointed.Lea Ling Tsang"},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"Hmmm, not the usual size 2 heroine. Bride McTierney was curvaceous and didn't fit her boyfriend's idea of beauty so he dumped her. There she is crying (and vacuuming her store) when Vane Kattalakis (a were-hunter wolf) comes wandering by. Yes, we met him in Embrace the Night where he had briefly noticed Bride. I was hoping she would be in his book!!I really enjoyed the flow of the story. There was a lot of information to take in about were-hunters - the wolves at least. The description of the female wolves left me wondering how Kenyon will write stories about them since the females are alphas themselves. In this book, we find Vane seeking a little gentleness with a \\"human\\" woman. He wants to comfort Bride and this really heads quickly to intimacy. He, as an animal, I think is just ready all the time and Bride is just rebounding from a failed relationship. But this is fantasy and who needs all the \\"getting to know you\\" stuff. We, as readers, know that eventually they will wind up together -- the romance is very nice and I actually think they come to love each other in a more conventional manner than other dark-hunter novels.There wasn't as much violence in this book as in the rest of the series. I liked that. You bump into all your favorite characters and meet some new ones. I'm not sure these books stand alone since I am reading them in order.I'm surprised at the conflict other reviewers are having with Bride's size. Since this is MY fantasy, yes there is a double standard. I want the guys to be absolute HUNKS (unlike real life) and I want them to fall in love with a NORMAL size woman (more like me) and I am no size 2. (This is not to say guys in real life aren't great but let's face it -- they are NOT all like the ones in these books.)"},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"This is Vane's and Bride's story and it is the first full length novel about a Were-Hunter in Kenyon's Dark-Hunter series. Vane Kattalakis is reputed to be one of the most vicious and powerful Katagaria Slayers. So far this has helped him to keep his sister and brother safe, but now his sister has died in a Daimon attack and he and his brother were marked for death by their father, the head of their pack. Although Vane can save the two of them, his brother Fang was hurt so badly that he has fallen into a coma and is now hidden at Sanctuary.Bride McTierney has just been dumped by her boyfriend of five years and is having a really bad time, when Vane walks into her store. Never has she seen such a gorgeously scrumptious male and she is completely bedazzled when he seems equally attracted to her, though her ex-boyfriend always complained that she weighted too much. But Vane thinks she is perfect and they spend a hot night together after which Vane leaves because his father has sent a killing squad after him and he doesn't want to endanger her.But then something unexpected happens: although Bride is human a mating mark appears on both Vane's and her hand which means that if Vane cannot convince Bride within three weeks that they belong together he will spend the rest of her lifetime impotent while she isn't affected at all. And she doesn't even know yet, that he is a Were-Hunter wolf...With Vane Kattalakis Kenyon has created another complex hero with a tortured past, rejected by both his parents and always ready to kill anybody who threatens him or his family. He was only able to survive by hiding the full extent of his magical powers and by hiding his true nature. In Bride he finds a woman who is sweet and vulnerable but also sexy and loving; with her he can indulge the gentle side of his nature.The story is also populated with fascinating secondary characters; there are all the Peltier brothers and the only girl of the Bear clan, Aim&eacute;e Peltier who looks after Fang, as well as all the other residents of Sanctuary. The reader also gets to meet Vane's younger brother who was left for dead by their mother and finds out, why their parents hate each other so much. Then there are Nick, Cajun bad boy and Kyrian's squire and Simi, Asheron's childlike and always hungry demon.A really great paranormal romance which you won't be able to put down."},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"This book made me a true Were-Hunter fan, when I wasn't one before. I have loved all the Dark-Hunter books so much that I didn't think anything could be as awesome. I was SO wrong.Vane was really something, a unique character to be sure. I loved the special way he treated Bride, it was a true, 'knight in shinning armour' romance. I also loved that Bride wasn't the perfect looking character that you read a lot of these days. Yet Vane found her to be perfect.Once again Ms. Kenyon delivers a story that you just CAN'T put down..."},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"I LOVE the Dark-Hunter series and this one was no exception! I could not put this book down. I love the way Vane treated Bride, like she was the most precious thing in the world to him.The humor in it was great. I loved his reaction to Fury in wolf form jumping on Bride. I also loved Fury. He reminded me a lot of Zarek. That he turned out to be Vane's brother was even better.I wish that Bride had told her sister to stick it where the sun don't shine when she was making all those nasty comments to her about how Bride and Vane didn't belong together and she should have held on to Taylor(the loser ex) with both hands. Granted her sister's comments pushed Bride into having her epiphany regarding her feelings for Vane, but it would have been so much better if she'd told her sister off after she had the epiphany.The end of the book didn't seem to have the same oomph as her previous books though. But when Fang appeared I got a big lump in my throat and suddenly it didn't matter.I did have to laugh about the comments of another reviewer who was annoyed that SK's characters are always reading Kinley McGregor(SK's alter ego)romances in these stories. That was something I noticed too.I cannot wait to see Valerius and Tabitha. Now there's a pairing I'm chomping at the bit to read about. Hopefully brother Zarek will make a reappearance."},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"Only from the mind of Sherrilyn Kenyon would this be even remotely possible.I swallowed this book whole last night. Bought it and finished it within six hours. Fantastic read! I loved the attraction between Bride and Vane. I knew in Sunshine's book that we would have to see more of Bride and of Vane. They were obviously those type of characters that leap off the page at a writer and demand their own story.There was more humor in this book than some of the others. I had the feeling that the fairies were at play while Ms. Kenyon typed away. Fury's mashed potato experience had me laughing out loud. Hope I didn't wake the neighbors.And the tenderness. Oh the tenderness! I wept for joy at points in this book. And I identified with Bride in more than one way. She is a heroine you can definitely love! And the moment Vane put a bigger slice of cake on her plate, ... well, let's just say that was a deal sealer for me.If you haven't read anything by Sherrilyn, pick this one up. This book is a sheer joy to read. Definitely goes on the keeper shelf for me."},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"I've been anticipation this book for quite a while, so on the day it was released I rushed to the store to find a copy. I was not dissapointed! I finished that book in record time(6 hours) and it DID NOT drag!Bride is not your average heroine. She is no petite, beautiful goddess. She is just an average woman (with curves) who is treated like a queen by the extremely gorgeous and humorous Vane. It is also important to note that Vane does not want her to change for him. In fact, he encourages her to eat food, when she tries to go on a diet for him. (smile)DEFINITELY A KEEPER! WORTH YOUR MONEY!"},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"Although this is part of the Dark-Hunter collection, the hero is not a Dark-Hunter but a Were-Hunter.Falling in love was not part of the plan for Vane Kattalakis, falling in love with a human who knows nothing about his world even less so. But the heart's a fickle thing and Vane has to convince Bride McTierney to stay with him in less than 3 weeks or it's caput for his libido. Not only that but he's got his whole pack chasing after him for a crime he didn't commit. Bride knows nothing about this and is in total heaven with Vane- that is until Vane's mother kidnaps her and tries to brainwash her. But putting her heart on the line and realing it back in is something Bride is no stranger to. She's just got to toughen up to the realiation that her boyfriend's a dog-litteraly."},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"After reading the first book from Sherrilyn Kenyon, I purchased every book I could get my hands on.

They always seem relatable."},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"Wonderful story. One of my favorites of the dark hunter series, Sherrilyn Kenyon at her best. I was waiting for this one since the first book in which Vane and Bride briefly met ( Night embrace, if I correctly recall )Vane is my perfect hero, alpha male but in a good way, caring and protective. And Bride is the perfect mate for him; I loved how they work through their insecurities and problems to get together.As always, secondary characters are amazing too and keep you interested in the series. Loved specially fang and fury and look forward to reading their stories.Highly recommended!!"},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"Book 6 is very good. I love all of the books in the series some more than others and this one I like less than the others, but it is still a very good book. I would recommend it because I think that everyone should read them in order."},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"When I first started reading the Dark Hunter series, I was far from impressed. I thought the plots were shallow and the characters were forced, but inspite of myself, I kept reading, hoping to see what everyone else loves about Sherrilyn Kenyon. With each new book in the series I get more hooked than I was before. Of all the Dark Hunter books so far, this is the best! The plot is just okay, but the writing is great, the characters are endearing (I have immediatly fell in love with the hero)... you'll laugh and you'll cry. If I dare say so, this book was comparable to Christine Feehans Carpathian series (a must read). This is a keeper for sure. Good work Sherrilyn Kenyon!"},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"This is a very worthy addition to Miss Kenyon's excellent paranormal series. Engaging, sensual and peppered with humor, it explores the universe of Gods, Fates, Dark-Hunters, Were-Hunters, Daimons in rich, dark detail. Vane is any woman's dream hero come true - tall, dark, handsome, rich and deeply devoted to a believably insecure heroine. I had a little issue with Bride's continued insistence that she was having a nightmare after discovering the truth about Vane; granted, she's human but there comes a point where you just want her to pinch herself and get over it. Still, this is minor and does not detract from the book's merit on the whole. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"This has to be one of the best books I have read in years. It is the first one in this series that I have read and I am goin to buy the rest of the series starting at the first.

I won't go into the story line, don't want to ruin it for you,,, just buy it and you wont be dissappointed!!!"},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"This was my first time reading Sherrilyn Kenyon.

Of course I had to order all the other books in the series!"},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"Amongst Sci-Fi, Fantasy, and fiction I love WereWolf & Vampire Novels. A nice weaving af many characters from her previous novels and a great weaving in of many fantasy scenes, powers, and themes in a high adventure romance novel. I really like the banter , affection and humorous interactions and dialogue amongst Kenyons characters! Can make you give a second look at your friends, neighbors, and casual aquaintances less there be another hidden identitiy to them yet to be discovered?? A good, fun, quick read and fantasy escape. Leaves me wanting to learn more about her other characters and to read their stories in more depth from her other novels. I can hardly wait as i look forward to reading more of her Novels. :-) Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"NIGHT PLAY by Sherrilyn Kenyon reads like a high school wallflower's fantasy: the gorgeous bad boy falls for the slighted fat girl, and not only does he have money and beats up her meanie ex-boyfriend, but he's a good guy werewolf, too!So, it's a cheesy story. Formulaic, too, since almost all of Kenyon's heroes are carbon cutouts of one another: tough, tormented men with supernatural abilities and tortured pasts who somehow always manage to save the day from (seemingly) undefeatable enemies and hardships.But I guess that's why I keep reading these books. They're familiar and entertaining, no matter how cheesy. I mean, I knew the moment I started reading NIGHT PLAY, it was going to suck me in, and nothing was going to keep me from finishing it, not even the need to sleep or go to the bathroom.So, much like a drug, Kenyon's books are addictive - they're not necessarily good for you, but you can't stop from buying more and more!Anyway, enough with the rant. Back to NIGHT PLAY.This is the story of Were-Hunter Vane, who you may remember as the werewolf in NIGHT EMBRACE. If you have never read NIGHT EMBRACE, I suggest you back up and read that book first. In fact, start the DARK-HUNTER series in order, beginning with its prologue FANTASY LOVER (about Julian), and going to NIGHT PLEASURES (Kyrian), NIGHT EMBRACE (Talon), DANCE WITH THE DEVIL (Zarek), KISS OF THE NIGHT (Wulf), and then NIGHT PLAY. You're better off, as you will understand secondary characters, background, and inside jokes a lot better.Vane initially met his heroine, Bride, in NIGHT EMBRACE, and their attraction brings them together in NIGHT PLAY. I like Vane as a hero. Being a wolf most of the time, he is totally clueless as to how humans interact, and that gives him a nice vulnerability that many past DARK-HUNTER heroes lacked. Plus, he's genuinely a good guy. He's not a jerk off, he has nothing to prove, and he's kind to animals and his own family members. In fact, he's now one of my favorite characters, which includes Ash, Simi, and Zarek.Bride is an interesting lady. I've never read about a size-18 heroine before, especially one who is self-conscious about everything. I liked the fact that Vane loved her immediately for who she is (and Kenyon was very convincing in showing why and how he could love her). I'm not sure I liked her myself. The one thing she said that really bugged me was how impressed she was that Vane was \\"loaded.\\" To me, it's tacky to bring up finances right from the start of a relationship. It's also shallow.Anyway, Vane and Bride get involved, and then Vane's various family members begin hunting him down for the crime of being alive. There's a little bit of time travel involved, and of course, there is Ash and his many interesting predictions.Altogether, it was an entertaining story - though it did have some cheesy dialogue, etc. So it's not perfect. But it's enjoyable. And it makes you want to read more. Now I have to go buy SEIZE THE NIGHT (about Valerius). Arrgh!"},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"Sherrilyn has done it again. She mixes characters from other books in the series into this book plus gives us insight tocharacters and places that are to come. Can't wait for her next book.You will be glad you bought it. Definitely not a waste of money and soon you will be ordering them all!"},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"In the bayou swamps near New Orleans, the Katagaria werewolf pack are punishing siblings Fang and Vane Kattalakis for the latter's actions that led to the death of their sister. The soulless Daimons attacked their brood and killed the she-wolf in revenge for Vane's protecting the woman of their enemy a Dark Hunter. Their father, who detests the brothers, took advantage of the killing and arranged for the Daimons to murder his sons. Vane defeats them and takes his unconscious brother away.Eight months later Fang remains in a coma while he and Vane hide amongst the \\"Bears\\". Vane wanders the New Orleans French Quarter when he notices Bride McTierney inside a store. She is his soulmate though he knows humans and wolves do not mix. He buys a necklace from her, but leaves it with her because he wants her to have it. Vane realizes he has to persuade Bride that they belong together; not easy with her current anti-male philosophy following her ex-boyfriend Taylor's dumping of her via her Fed-Ex account and the difficulty of cross breeding. Worse he knows his father will come after him and anyone he cherishes once he realizes that he and Fang live.The latest \\"Dark\\" romantic urban fantasy is a fantastic blending of horror with romantic intrigue. The exhilarating story line moves forward on two fronts: romantic and survival (though Vane might say they are the same) with incredible twists that will surprise readers yet feel right. With a strong cast, the Kenyon mythos where the supernatural and the romance converge is at its fabulous best.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"It was so nice to read about a woman that was not stick-thin and to read about friends of the Dark Hunters.

But this one was great. Speaking for all us less-than-stick-figured women, all you skinny b**ch*s can just shut up. Finally, a gorgeous man that likes curves! It is very simple to identify with Bride, who although she doesn't think as much of herself as she should, is certainly not going to put up with anyone's guff. And then to have this virile, rich, fiercely protective man waltz into her life and personify every woman's secret fantasy? A delicious thought to say the least. Vane was not raised with human prejudices and sees Bride as a person-- a beautiful person no matter her size-- and not merely a means to an end, and God knows there is little enough of that going around. (If only the world were truly this way. Then no one would have to write about it.)Miss Kenyon's writing was wonderful in this book, and her secondary characters were charming, namely Fury. The less-than-adept wolf says what everyone would like to say to the millions of pompous jerks in this world-- \\"Someone needs to take that stick out of your ass and beat you with it.\\"The only thing I was sort of ambivalent about was the somewhat sappy proposal in the bar, but all in all a very enjoyable read with enough sarcastic dialogue to keep me laughing.Brava, Miss Kenyon!

It drove me nuts when I found out so I decided to read it right away and boy was I glad that I did. Vane is sex on a stick! It's really no wonder why Suzanne (and others) have already claimed him for their harems. He's a dream!Of course, the best thing about this book is the fact that he loves bigger women. Bride isn't comfortable about her appearance so she does all that she can to steer attention away from herself, but all of that does nothing to make Vane look the other way. In fact, the way he sees her is the thing that got me. Vane sees Bride's beauty and never lets her forget it. Cue sighs.SK really made this book enjoyable for her readers. I started another book but it simply didn't hold my interest by page 100. I decided to pick up this book and read a few pages. At page 10, SK completely won me over. I was floored by the way she was able to introduce the history of the Were-Hunters and its world in such a tight word count. Then she goes on to introduce Vane in the opening scene. There she is able to reveal so many different aspects to Vane's personality in one single scene. She displays his courage, his heartbreak, his determination and also his love for his brother, making him a well-rounded and likeable hero for readers to fall for.From there, she introduces Bride and the first line from her POV is so effective in making readers sympathize with her. Bride gets dump via FedEx by her boyfriend for five years. Everyone has either been dumped or lost someone that they've felt deeply for, so it's easy for people to relate to her situation. Bride is such a great heroine. Strong, sweet, big and beautiful - she really brought this book to life.The rest of the book follows the same route - exceptionally well-written, sexy and dark! I devoured it. NIGHT PLAY is definitely one of the bright spots of this series."},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"Have been a long time Sherrilyn Kenyon fan. This was the first of her books that I read in paper form and still love it today. Nice to have an electronic version available as well."},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"Night Play is a sweet fairy tale, and Vane is one of Kenyon's most appealing characters because of his vulnerability. Having lived most his life as a wolf, he's unsure about how to go about wooing the woman he adores. The first date scene is absolutely adorable.Kenyon is not the kind of romance writer who has the characters spend all of their time arguing before finally realizing that they love each other. In Kenyon's books, the hero and heroine click together like magnets, and then face other obstacles to their happiness. This is particularly true in Night Play--Vane saw Bride once before, was instantly taken with her, and it turns out she is fated to be his. Fine with me. I felt like the sex scene early in the novel was justified by the narrative, and besides, the love scenes in the Dark-Hunter series are always fabulous!I have to smile at other readers complaining about Bride being a size 18. Let's see, in this book we have werewolves, werebears, demons, immortal warriors who kill demons, Greek gods and goddesses, supernatural tattoos...and we're complaining that a plus size heroine is unrealistic? It's not supposed to be realistic...just heartwarming romance.I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 for some very clumsy moments and details, but really, this book is a lot of fun."},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"NIGHT PLAY, the sixth book of the Dark-Hunter novels, is a spin off from the stories about the Dark-Hunters. It is a look into the lives of mythical creatures called Were-Hunters. Were-Hunters are the results of an experiment by a sorcerer that was meant to help a dying race. The experiment produced two forms of humans that can live as animals also. The Arcadians held human hearts and walked as humans but at puberty they possessed the ability to change into an animal form. The Katagarians were born as animals and lived as animals until they also reached puberty and obtained a source of unlocked power that allowed them to change to human form while maintaining an animal's heart. Angry with the interference of the sorcerer, the gods cursed the two races to die at each other's hands.Vane and Fang Kattalakis give new meaning to the phrase, \\"It's the dog in me.\\" The two were part of Katagarian pack of wolves until a bad decision caused the death of their sister. Due to the basic law of their pack, they were beaten and left for dead in their human forms in a swamp in New Orleans. Vane manages to escape but with a severely battered Fang to look after. Realizing that their pack wants them dead, Vane flees to the only place he knows is safe-The Sanctuary. While friends at The Sanctuary are nursing Fang, Vane wanders upon Bride McTierney who has just been dumped by her boyfriend of five years. In a tearful state of depression and heartache, Bride shares with Vane a couple of hours of passion. That passion marks the start of events that will either bring the two together or leave Vane neutered, that is, if he can survive his enemies. Have the gods been tinkering with life again? Can Bride accept the dog in Vane? Can Vane accept Bride for who she really is? Will the two survive to even consider a life together?NIGHT PLAY is another action-packed fantasy thriller by Sherrilyn Kenyon. She continues to conjure up some of the steamiest erotic scenes and incorporates some pulse racing drama that locks readers in and doesn't let them go until the end. I admit the story surrounding the hero being able to transform into a mythical wolf is a bit farfetched, but I had to remember that this is fantasy where anything is possible. But what really grounds this book is the heroine, who happens to be a plus-sized, down-to-earth woman with real issues. I could really identify with her character. This was an enlightening as well as provocative read.Reviewed by Brenda M. Lisbonof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"After reading the last book about Wulf (which I didn't like as much as I loved the rest of the series) I was hesistate about running out and getting Night Play the moment it came out. But I threw caution into the wind and ran to buy a copy. I'm glad I did. Although Zerek's story is still my favorite, I feel that Ms. Kenyon is back on track and I absored every word, every line regarding Bride and Vane's love story. I especailly loved the fact that Bride was not the typical romance herione. I've gotten tired of reading about perfect women (needless to say I don't have a problem reading about perfect men!!!!!). I also love the new direction the story has gone, delving more into the Were-Hunter story. Yet, I still have one little problems with the story. It's getting a little annoying and very distracting the way Ms. Kenyon keeps having her charecters reading her romance novels.Other than that it's a hit."},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"~Dark Hunter Series~~Night Play~~Book 6~~Can a gorgeous werewolf with magical powers and an overweight boutique owner with a broken heart have a future together? They can in Kenyon's fantastical world, which imagines a contemporary New Orleans teeming with vampiric Daimons, immortal Dark-Hunters and various were-bears, leopards and wolves. Vane Kattalakis is a lone wolf in every sense. His brother, Fang, is in a coma; his werewolf father wants to kill him; and his mostly human mother, who was taken by force by Vane's father, would happily see them all dead. But after Vane shares a sizzling sexual encounter with Bride McTierney, he realizes his life is about to change. Bride is Vane's \\"predestined mate,\\" which means that he has three weeks to convince her to be his partner or he'll spend the next several decades impotent and alone. Vane's gentle, protective manner and \\"ripped\\" body appeal to Bride, but she can't help wondering: if they were to get together, would they have puppies or babies? Kenyon's tale, while amusing at times, borders on the ridiculous. The rules of her world change constantly, and her male characters are all formed from the same tall, dark and dangerous mold. Bride, meanwhile, is a mere cipher, and though the sex scenes between her and Vane are titillating, their romance is nearly nonexistent.~Vane, a were-hunter, had just lost his sister. His brother retreated into a coma in wolf form after he and Vane escaped death at their father's command. Vane's mother hated him and also tried to kill him. Having never known parental love nor acceptance from anybody but his sister and brother, Vane was feeling pretty low and hopeless when he saw Bride. He was attracted to her and found himself in her store. Bride was flabbergasted at the attention he was giving her because he was the best looking man she had ever seen. Of course she was going to worry about her size, but she did NOT moan and groan about it any more than was normal. Of course she wanted to be smaller and felt inferior. The reviewer who would like to lose ten pounds has no idea how a size 18 feels. Bride knew there were a lot of people out there like a couple of the reviewers and she couldn't believe he would love her for herself. Gasp! Perish the thought..~ I enjoyed Vane & Bride's Story, I Thought they are good together! Everyone Deserves to be happy & Love Someone No matter of their Size (either one of them)!!!!!I Agree with THIS>>>>Like many that have been waiting most impatiently for Vane's book I didn't put it down until I had read it from cover to cover. A fantastic book!!!!I see a lot of Reviewers complaining about the sex or to much sex in a lot of the Romance Novels Here I Don't get it....if they don't want to read (sex scenes) then they shouldn't read Romance Novels then. Becuz Every Romance novel I've Read has sex scenes in it.If I could Give this More than 5 stars I as H*LL would have!! I Think Sherrilyn Kenyon Did An EXCELLENT Job!!!"},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"This is the first Were-Hunter novel to Kenyon's Dark-Hunter series, and I truly enjoyed it. First, hats off to Kenyon for having a plus-sized heroine. I've never encountered one before in romance (paranormal or otherwise), and it was nice to see a heroine who isn't built like a supermodel. Everyone deserves true love, even the overweight, and in the real world some men like meat on their women. Bride is very real. She has her insecurities, but also owns her own shop, bickers with a family she loves and is waiting for love. Vane is a werewolf. And, as in many paranormal romances, he has a destined mate. But, in Kenyon's world there are also some new rules. He has magic, for one. Second, there are two kinds of weres. Those born animals and those born human - and they do not get along. Yes, Vane is a too good to be true hero (pretty much faultless). However, though I want my characters to have some realism, I read for escapism. He swept me off my feet right along with Bride. The romance was sweet, and the sex was hot!This entry expanded even more on the mythological universe Kenyon created. It provides a good counter-point to the Dark-Hunters, since the weres are not governed by Artemis or Acheron, and have their own agendas and power struggles. An engrossing read - highly recommended."},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"I thought this book was great. Love Vane! I love the fact that in all the Dark Hunter books theres a different type of woman. Some lean and muscular, some curvy, some nerdy, some heavier set (like Bride in this book). I think it makes you connect more to the stories when it seems more realistic. We're not all 5'9 super models so for there to be female leads who are described as people you could know in reality was inspirational and had me sucked right in! :o)"},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"Judging from the state of the book, I probably got this at a secondhand store or a library discards sale. I didn't get it for free.Night Play confused me for about the first 80% of it, but most particularly the first chapter. I'd read the first chapter before, and it was in the middle of a book, not the beginning. I kept reading, knowing that it was a different book, and hoping to get unconfused. Eventually, like in the last couple of chapters, I did finally figure it out.Eureka! I was reading the series of events from the other brother's point of view. Boy, did I feel dumb when I realized why I was confused.This book had its fair share of romance and action, but it just wasn't as compelling as I usually find Sherrilyn Kenyon's books to be. The sex was OK, but not the make-ya-squirm good I've come to expect from Ms. Kenyon (In one book, the two main characters don't even have sex until near the end of the book, but the interactions they do have are fine examples of make-ya-squirm writing.). The characters were mere shadows of themselves, even the ones I already know from reading other books in the Dark-Hunter universe.The heroine, Bride, was a solid size 18, with self-esteem issues galore, just as many of us with size dramas are. Vane, the brother in question, was naturally a magnetic, powerful, sexy, hot, etc. magical wolfman, with a tight end and washboard abs and cruise ships full of money. Bride's self-esteem issues were magically borne away on the wind when she realized that Vane wanted her, all of her, as she was, and not some skinny chick who was \\"more sexy.\\" I know that in the first glows of newfound love, self-esteem issues sometimes seem to disappear, but really, they don't. They just take a back seat. Knowing that your man finds you sexy doesn't mean that you still don't wonder what other people think of you. In Bride's case, she found out exactly what her sister thought of her, for instance.To be honest, though, I think the book could have been better if size was not an issue in the first place. I know that I despair of ever reading good books written with heroines who are more than a size 14. There are some out there, but they are few and far between. The best ones are written by women who have actually been there and come back from the trip. Queen Latifah, who is a very sexy large woman, probably hasn't always been as comfortable in her skin as she is now, and I bet it wasn't easy to find her true self among the garbage. But I digress. In this case, such an issue was made of Bride's size and her emotional baggage that the \\"easy fix\\" was a letdown.Vane is just too perfect, perhaps more so than other heroes in Ms. Kenyon's book, and maybe because his perfection was described at so much length by Bride herself, in her thoughts and conversations, as comparisons to her own \\"shortcomings.\\" As the hero of the book, Vane should have been easier to peg, but his characterization is pretty shallow in this book. I actually prefer the Vane I got to know in the book where his brother, Fang, finds his own mate. In this one, so much of his time is spent agonizing over whether or not Bride can understand his world or not, hiding his magic from her, calling in favors to protect her when she doesn't even know she needs protecting, pretending to be someone else (his wolf persona) so that he can be close to her without scaring her, etc., that I never really got to know HIM at all, just what he can do. He's too perfect for words (ok, weak and unintended pun), and as such, not really appealing to me.So, though I did enjoy reading how Vane and Bride met, I didn't enjoy it as much as I \\"should\\" have enjoyed it, considering Sherrilyn Kenyon wrote it and considering that she's one of my favorite paranormal authors. This could easily have been written into the other book, as an alternating viewpoint kind of thing, though the characterization flaws would have stuck out like a pimple on your nose."},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"Of the Dark-Hunter books I've read, this is the only one with out an A+. I can't exactly put my finger on why I liked this one less than the others, but there was just something missing. It was still a great book though.Vane and Bride's attraction to each other seemed as if it was a bit more superficial than the rest of the pairings I've read. Even though I love the idea of Vane loving someone like Bride and vice versa, it didn't seem as real. Also, there was a phrase that Bride must have said six times during the book, that kept detracting from the story, as I was finding it rather annoying.Other than those two things, this book really was just as good as the others. The secondary characters, those who are recurring and the new, as always make the book even deeper, the plot's twists and turns keep it exciting!I loved that Bride's self consciousness seemed real, but not over done. And the feeling she gets from being loved by Vane was healthy, but not dependent. Kenyon was treading on thin ice keeping it from toppling into the unhealthy and dependent waters, but her ability to write strong, in depth characters prevails over all.I couldn't wait to start the next book, and even brought it to work with me and picked it up within minutes of finishing this one.I still highly recommend this series and have been lending my copies of the books to everyone I can get to read them!"},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"I have been a fan of Ms. Kenyon's ever since I picked up a copy of Fantasy Lover soon after it's release. When I finished reading the book all I wanted was... more! I joined her official role playing group and never looked back. Through the Dark Hunter group, and then the Ladies of Sanctuary (also known as DHAD or Dark Hunter After Dark) I met many new friends. A few of those friendships still continue to this day. As the series developed, Night Play was the book I anticipated the most as Vane had grabbed my heart from the get go. The fact that his heroine was a full figured woman endeared the book to me even more. I purchased the book as soon as humanly possible, and I was not disappointed. The lush and sensual story is still one of my absolute favorite books and always will be. Ms. Kenyon will always have this reader's love and loyalty as Night Play will also remain on my \\"keeper\\" shelf forevermore."},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"I wasn't sure if I would like this book because it's not necessary about a Dark-Hunter. Instead we learn more about the Were-Hunters and I really enjoyed it. It was a nice break from the DH hero. All though I don't care for Artemis, she can't really loose all her DH's consecutively.We first met Vane (hero) and his brother Fang in Talon's book (Night Embrace). The heroine, Bride also made a brief apperance in Talon's book. Now Vane and Bride get their stroy told. Vane is large white timber wolf who was born Katagaria and changed to Arcadian Were-Hunter after puberty. Bride is your normal human.We get the usually SK writing style which includes hot and steamy romance/sex, lots of humor and lots of action. We also see more of Valerius who appeared in Zarek's book (Dance with the Devil). By the end of the book I was feeling all warm and fuzzy. I really appreciated the family bond forming between Vane & Bride and with his brothers and Bride's cool family. We see more of the Peltier's who is the family of bear Katagaria Were-Hunters who run Sanctuary. This book will not disappoint. This may be my favorite book yet.Here's a list in reading order from Ms. Kenyon's website. I have pretty much read everything in this order and found it's helped with distinguishing who's who and what's what and so forth. Maybe it'll help you.1. Fantasy Lover (Julian and Grace)2. The Beginning: in the back of Sins of the Nght3. Dragonswan (Sebastian & Channon)4. Night Pleasures (Kyrian & Amanda)5. Night Embrace (Talon & Sunshine)6.

I happened to read the reviews and was livid over some of the remarks. These reviewers didn't like Bride being a size 18 because that's . . .uh . . .obese. I bought the book and expected to read about a huge woman waddling across the room crying over her weight all through the book. Nothing could be further from the truth.Vane, a were-hunter, had just lost his sister. His brother retreated into a coma in wolf form after he and Vane escaped death at their father's command.

Maybe there wouldn't be so many people with body image hang-ups."},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"Ms. Kenyon is an amazing talent in the genre of paranormal romance! I wish she could turn these dark-hunter stories out faster! Night Play is a Were-Hunter story and is amazing as any of the previous stories in this series! Normally I tend to get bored with a series if it drags on to much...this is SO not the case with Ms. Kenyon's Dark-Hunter series.This book has it all! Yummy dark hero, Vane who we met in Talon's story (who just so happens to be a wolf, Vane not Talon) yummy dark secondary characters (Fang, Fury...), a great heroine named Bride (who is not a perfect size 2 but instead a woman that is more average then we really want to admit too), and a storyline that is action-packed as well as the added historical detail to the myth of the Were-Hunter! Vane and Bride have incredible chemistry, and their romance not only made me laugh out loud a few times, it also made me sigh! *AH, ROMANCE*If you have been a die hard loyal reader of Ms. Kenyon's Dark-Hunter series this is a must read that you need to pick up. If you are new to the very talented author, and her great series, then get ready to order her older stories. Old friends, and favorite characters are included in this story, and we are even introduced to new characters. Plenty of potential for new stories for this series! I'm so excited!!!This was a very fast read, and one that I was loathed to put down until the last page. This is one author, and one series that I highly recommend without any reservations to the romance reading fan!Official reviewer for www.romancedesigns.com"},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"Like many that have been waiting most impatitently for Vane's book I didn't put it down until I had read it from cover to cover. A fantastic book!!!!Night Play continues on the legend that is the Dark-Hunters, Were-Hunters, Dream-Hunters and the gods and fates that still love to meddle in the lifes of us mere mortals. The main story between that of Vane and his heroine Bride is one many can relate to. Bride isn't a &quot;perfect&quot; model thin heroine with superficial woes and complaints, she is a real woman, with real issues, a realistic weight and a heart of gold. You find yourself understanding and empathising with her from the first moment you meet her.Adding to the great story of Vane and Bride is the reaccurance of some familiar characters that add to the story and also to the whole series. Kyrian, Amanada and Tabitha return to help Bride with some tough decisions, Val and Otto make an appearance to not only progress the story but prepare us for Val's up and coming book, Acheron is back with more great fortune cookie pearls of wisedom and a bit more of his background comes out and Nick, the wise cracking, hawaiian shirt wearing, charming cajun squire (can you tell he's my fav character??) is back with dating advice that would make you cringe if you weren't doubled over in hysterical laughter.All in all an amazing read! Good on it's own but if you want to fully appreciate it and get a full understanding of the Dark-Hunters and Were-Hunters so far I would suggest locking yourself away for the weekend and enjoying all the books in the series so far.6 stars, 2 thumbs up...A great book from the Paranormal Romance master of them all! Way to go Sherrilyn."},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"I read the other reviews of this book before reading it and I was somewhat worried that I might not enjoy it. I was wrong. All the people whining about how unrealistic Bride is, that she is obsessed with her weight, that she should have just been pleased that Vane wanted her so badly, etc clearly don't understand the woman. Some jerk had just used her viciously, harping on her weight. Of course she will be self conscious. Of course she'll wonder why Vane wanted her after 5 years of being told she wasn't worthy of love. And to those who say the concept of a hot stud like Vane wanting a size 18 woman...not all guys are attracted to size 4 women...thank god.I'll agree this isn't the author's best effort. Personally so far I'd say Night Pleasures or Dance with the Devil are the best. But it was a good book that appealed to me as woman who sees herself as far from perfect. And it made me laugh. The first scene with Fury when he meets Bride and tries to explain where Vane is had me laughing so hard I cried."},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"I really enjoyed this one. It's easily one of my favorites in this series (the other being Dark Side of the Moon). A heroine who isn't a perfect size 4 is nice. I can identify with her and her insecurities. And Vane is just hot. I knew this when he appeared in Night Embrace. But the character in this book isn't what I expected. He's far more sensitive and gentle than I would have thought. Normally I like the really alpha types but I was just really enchanted with the care with which he treated Bride. And his interaction with Fury is hysterical."},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"Vane Kattalakis is a Were Hunter with no pack. Bride McTierney is a normal human being.

I thought the plot was well crafted and the action paced well. The supporting characters have a depth themselves, especially if you've read the other books in the series.Bride is a a sensible heroine and I appreciated her size. Vane is a lovable sort of hero and despite him being described as feral and dangerous on numerous occasions I had trouble seeing him as anything else than a big, loving puppy.I enjoyed their story and look forward to reading Fury's, which I hope Kenyon will write soon."},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"What a great addition to the Dark Hunter series.

Amidst all sorts of conflict he meets a woman he can't seem to stop thinking about, Bride McTierney (also seen in &quot;Night Embrace&quot;).One of the many reasons this book shines is that Bride is a REAL herone with body-image issues. I felt Bride was very realistically portrayed in our world that puts SO much emphasis on being a stick-figure. The jealousy and self-doubt she feels when comparing herself to others was written very well. The jealousy others express towards her when they see her with a hottie like Vane is also portrayed well.I liked how SK described Vane's physical attraction to Bride (and the several ways he's attracted to her physically & the reasons).This book also shows more of favorites like Acheron, Simi, Kyrian, Amanda, Tabitha -- and we get a better look into the lives of the Peltiers of Sanctuary, Valerius & the Squire, Otto, who was first seen in &quot;Dance with the Devil.&quot;"},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"honestly this is one of my favorite romance novels ever.... because it gets inside the head of every REAL woman who isnt some skinny little thing.... i like the fact that neither bride nor vane are completely perfect (though vane comes closest) ... lol... bride is just the average woman with the same kinds of thoughts as most women over a size 12... she is NOT whiny and her \\"weight issues\\" and \\"self esteem problems\\" only come up occasionally in the book... though i'm sure the occasional skinny woman who reads these books because she cant get a date cause she acts like she has constant PMS might think that bride complains too much...... really in the book its more of an \\" oh wow, look at my body and look at his , i cant believe i snared THAT hunk\\" kind of thing"},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"The best so far!! I love the fact that the Bride was not a size 4. Vane was the best! Great story!"},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"I happened to pick this up at the library not realizing it was part of a series. I really enjoyed the alternate world Kenyon creates. I enjoyed it so much I read the whole series. SInce then I tried to read the christine feehan series but have not enjoyed it at all like I did this series. If you like romance and any supernatural you will love this series."},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"Welcome to the world of Sherrilyn Kenyon, where gods are spoiled brats, demons run loose, and testosterone-fueled, leather-clad bad boys keep the monsters at bay. While most of Kenyon's Hunter Legends stories so far have involved the ass-kicking Dark-Hunters, NIGHT PLAY shifts the focus to the equally yummy Were-Hunters.The Were-Hunters are actually two separate and distinct species created by an ancient sorcerer king determined to save his two sons from dying of the Apollite curse on their twenty-seventh birthdays. Splicing the essence of powerful animals such as bears, wolves, and even dragons with that of the Apollites, the Arcadians and Katagaria were born. While the Katagaria had the hearts of the animal and the Arcadians that of humans, they were two halves of a whole and should have lived together in harmony, far stronger and with a life expectancy much longer than any race before. However, the gods were displeased and wanted them destroyed. When the king refused, the gods decreed the two species would never know peace and planted mistrust between them. Soon, suspicion between Arcadians and Katagaria turned into hate, and hatred into open war. A war that continues to this day...as Vane Kattalakis knows only too well.Born from the forced mating by his Katagari father on his Arcadian mother, hybrid Were-Hunter Vane Kattalakis has spent a lifetime being rejected and feared by everyone except his brother, Fang, and sister, Anya. But when Daemons attack his wolf pack and kill Anya in retaliation for Vane helping the Dark-Hunters, the two brothers are sentenced to death by their own father. Barely escaping with a grievously wounded Fang, Vane lays low at Sanctuary in New Orleans, waiting for his brother to recover and knowing it's just a matter of time before assassins come for them. The last thing Vane expects is to find his destined mate, a human female at that.Was it because she'd just been dumped by her boyfriend via FedEx? Perhaps it was a case of temporary insanity? Whatever the cause, when the most gorgeous man she's ever seen walks into her store, buys her favorite necklace, and presents it to her as a present, shopkeeper Bride McTierney throws caution to the wind and has an unforgettable afternoon tryst with the mysterious Vane Kattalakis. Convinced it was just a fling, Bride's life takes a detour into the Twilight Zone when she suddenly acquires a new pet wolf, and Vane returns determined to woo her. Is he for real?With a three-week deadline to make Bride his mate or else live the rest of her lifetime in celibacy -- so NOT an option -- Vane must win the girl, confess he's her new pet wolf, and, oh by the way, there's a death warrant out for his hide. That's nothing this wolf can't handle, expect for one tiny problem. Practical Bride doesn't believe in the supernatural. Yep, love bites.Once again, Sherrilyn Kenyon adds another intriguing layer to her popular series. Brimming with ancient cultural nuances and spiked with classic Shakespearean pathos, NIGHT PLAY is nevertheless a very modern tale packed with Kenyon's highly irreverent humor. Vane and Bride are a fun pair. He's a little bit hairy; she's a little bit paranoid. Actually, you'd worry too if you weren't sure what kind of offspring you'd produce. Vane's family squabbles redefine the word \\"dysfunctional,\\" while the Dark-Hunters provide some of the best comic moments with their \\"dating tips\\" for the clueless Were-Hunter.Hot, sexy, and fun, NIGHT PLAY is just the perfect summer read to sink your teeth (or fangs) into. Don't miss it!TheSchemer"},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"I am amazed. I love this book, and I went and bought the rest of the series a week later! I am a big fan of Laurell K Hamilton, though I admit her latest books have to much sex in them. Though the Dark Hunter series is in the romance section at the book store, it has less sex and the same amount of action as LKH's books that are in the scifi/ficiton section. I love the witty humor, and the guys of the DH series. I am a dedicated fan and can not wait until her new book comes out. Definately a worth while read!"},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"Sherrilyn Kenyon just keeps getting better with her Dark Hunter Series. This book grabbed my attention with Bride, the heroine who is the typical woman that we all know. Who isn't or doesn't have a friend who is more than a size 10 with a love life gone south? Bride's troubles are just the kind that many of us can sympathize with. The fact that drop dead Vane, gorgeous and dangerous, sees her as the ultimate mate is just the kind of thing that makes it a wonderful read. With the animal part of his nature, Vane sees Bride not as too much woman but rather THE woman. The human part of his nature is drawn to the sensitivity that Bride projects, her love of animals and the vulnerability she portrays. I cheered when he showed up just in time to bolster her in dealing with the nasty ex 'who done her wrong'. My heart turned to mush when he insisted she eat a real meal AND have dessert. Obviously, there are men who see and appreciate a woman for the inner person and not just the outer appearance. Not to say that Bride has a rotten appearance, she just isn't the babe fest that most men hanker after, skinny bod, pouty lips and enhanced everything. No, Bride is a real woman, nice hair, a real body with soft skin and an attractive face. Bride is one of us.I look forward to any books that Ms. Kenyon writes. She has a handle on how men and women think. Her plots are interesting and the background information on the gods is accurate. So bring it on Sherrilyn, I'm waiting."},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"I liked this story about Vane and Bride except for the ending which I thought fell a little flat. But if you are a fan of this series, you will love what you learn about the Were-Hunters and other shapeshifters, more about Ash and you get a chance to see some past characters and some new characters that are being primed for future stories. I have one question. What if Vane's parents decide to work things out? Hasn't anyone considered what Vane's mother has done to his father to make sure any future relationship is impossible? Talk about a living hell for the two of them no matter what the outcome."},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"What a wonderful story. Forget the series, forget the author. I know nothing more about Sherrylin Kenyon or the Dark Hunter novels other than this book. And it's a darn good good stroke of luck too, considering some of the heavy criticisms and outlandish comments being being made about this book.I went ahead and purchased it half expecting it to be the silly waste of time that some people have pegged this to be. Even I can admit that the premise of a wolf having three weeks to convince a human woman to be his mate or be 'neutered' for the rest of his life is a little ridiculous, albeit curiously interesting. Plus the fact that many reviewers seem to be placing so much unwarranted emphasis on the fact that the main heroine/ love interest happens to be a bonafide plus sized woman has detracted from what this story really is. This is a love story. And a very sweet, cleverly written one at that.Vane Kattalakis is quite literally a rare breed. Aside from being an absolutely gorgeous looking, rich and kind hearted man there is much more to him than just that. The details are a bit lengthy if I get into them all but essentially there are two types of 'were'beings. The Arcadians are born human and stay human until they reach puberty, at which time they become and have the option of becoming an anaimal. Some are Bears, Wolves, Hawks, etc. Basicly your normal werewolf scenario. Katagarians on the other hand are the exact opposite. They are born as animals and become human once they reach puberty. The two species hate eachother because they both believe that their kind is superior to the other.In Vane's case, he is a Katagarian Wolf who finds himself inexplicably drawn to a human woman for the first time in his life. Bride is a kindhearted shop owner who is greiving over the fact that her boyfriend of five years has been using her all along and has just left her. Vane on the other hand is grieving over the recent death of his beloved sister and the comatose state of his brother. The two are heavily attracted to eachother and have a one night stand right in the backroom of her own store! Afterwards they reluctantly part ways and probably would have never met again if not for the strange greek markings that appear on both their hands. Vane recognizes the mark as the mating mark. In his species, once you have slept with the woman that fate has intended to be your mate, you must either consumate the mating and be bound as mates forever or be rejected by your mate and spend the rest of your life as a eunich. There are many more details involved that rationalize this whole idea that are impeccably explained almost to the point of normalcy.Although both Bride and Vane share an emotional connection that neither of them can deny, there are many complications.Bride isn't sure if she can trust a man after what her ex-boyfriend did to her and she has self esteem issues because she isn't model-thin and doesn't understand what Vane sees in her.Vane doesn't know how to even tell Bride what he really is, let alone get her to accept him and love him for who he is. Plus he doesn't want to burden her normla life with all the magic and unconventional aspects of his. It also doesn't help that several other wolves, including his parents, have set out to kill him( even wolves have dysfunctional families ).Will Vane and Bride be able to love and accept eachother for who and what they are?This is more of a romance fantasy with a bit of action mixed in rather than something worthy of having \\"A Dark Hunter Novel\\" come right after the title. Although that is reflective of the series and not the plot itself, that happened to be an assumption of mine, being the first time reader that I am.The story is sweet, witty, and lighthearted at times. The book has it's share of comical moments but there is nothing that I would consider to be immature or in bad taste or silly. As for the reviewer that found the scene where Vane shows up on a motorcycle and puts Brides jerk of an ex boyfriend in his place to be very over the top... what exactly were you expecting from a novel where one of the main charactors is a wolf and about 90% of all the charactors are either some type of animal, Dark hunter, demon, or other nonhuman species? I thought that scene was one of the best of the whole novel and was very humorously done and in perfect relevance with the rest of the plot. If you were expecting something different then I guess this book just wasn't for you. And as for those reviewers lamenting about Brides full figure being a distraction or of some big relevance to the story, you are only deluding yourselves to believe that because you must not be able to accept the idea of a plus sized woman being sexy and appealing enough to be the main charactor and love interest in a romance novel, which is sad. Brides weight is only a very minor issue that is brought up to reflect the part of Brides personality that WOULD feel insecure about herself. Even a thin woman would feel this way when with someone as physically immaculate as Vane. If anything, her weight issues and body image are a benefit to her charactor and the story because they show Bride as being all the more human, thus in contrast to the perfect, shapeshifting, immortal Vane.This was a wonderfully entertaining read and I recommend it to anyone looking for a nice love story that meets all criteria for a great romance without all the normal settings and cliched charactors. Even after reading all the negative reviews I still gave this book a try, and you should too."},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"I read all Sherrilyn Kenyon's books except the novella in \\"Tapestry\\". I loved every one of them, but I love Night Play the most.I can not imagine what it must feel like to be rejected because you are different. Vane, Fang and Fury made me want to cry. From the beginning to the end of the book, I could not put it down. I bought it on Sunday and finished it by 10:30pm.Vane was being pulled every which way but loose. He lost his sister Anya and was determined to make sure he got his brother back and out of the coma he was in after their father tried to have them killed,then to find out he had another brother, Fury. Whew!!!!His life just seemed so out of control!!!! He is also the most powerful one, stronger than his mother and father. I wonder if he can hold his own against Ash or if Ash is one of the handful of people who can negate his powers. That is definitely a question.To also find that \\"Bride\\" is his mate and the woman he wanted so long ago and to take the time to make her understand and believe she was beautiful just the way she is. I am a size 22, a size 18 is really not that big, but I can definitely understand how she feels when everyone around you is a 6 or 8. It seemed the premise of the book was for Bride to understand who Vane is and to love him for himself and the way he is, just like he loves her just the way she is.I am a fan of another great paranormal author Christine Feehan and her books about the Carpathians and vampires and I am definitely a Sherrilyn Kenyon fan and she is definitely on my list as best paranormal romance author.I thought this book was well thought out and possible the best she has written. Keep it up Ms. Kenyon, I am waiting for the next one anxiously."},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"This was the first \\"Dark Hunter\\" book I tried and the writing style immediately grabbed me. Enough so that I'm going to track down the others.Vane and Bride, were both likable characters. I found Vane a very romantic, sexy and brooding guy (but not so much it became annoying) but the nasty ex-boyfriend, who conveniently kept popping up to make Bride feel like crap, got old very quickly. He's immature and obnoxious and has left Bride with a very bad self image. I get it. My only regret is that the author took far too long to get past it and move on with things!Overall the book is fast paced and the main characters likable but somewhere past the midway point when Vane and Bride meet up with others in the Katagaria & Arcadia tribes my head began to spin. Utter confusion overcame me it was here that I wished I'd read the previous books. Lots of names and issues and past wars/hurts/deaths talked about and I had a very difficult time making sense of it all. When the story switched back to the romance between Vane & Bride the pages flew but when the pack politics kicked back in I was mighty confused. I'm going to collect these and read them in order because the story is quite interesting despite my confusion at past events!"},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"It's a great read you wouldn't want to put this book down its funny as well as sexy as I don't know what."},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"Again, Sherrilyn Kenyon drew me in to her Dark Hunter tale. This one revolves around Vane the Kattagari wolf who is attracted to the curvy broken-hearted, scared to love, Bride McTierney. As always, there are appearances from the other beloved Dark Hunters as well Ash and Simi. I never get bored of this series! The best thing about it, each book feels like a whole new series but it inevitably ties in the ones before it and will highlight events that will be broadened later. Sherrilyn Kenyon is amazing!"},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"This is Book 6 of the \\"Dark-Hunter\\" series and tells the story of Vane, a magickal Werewolf, and how he found his mate, Bride, a human and a friend of Sunshine and the Deveraux sisters. I think I belly-laughed more through this novel than any other in the series. The Thanksgiving scenes (both of them) are priceless, as well as the brief appearance of Valerius. Another sweet love story and an excellent read."},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"Night Play is the one of the first Were-Hunter books in Sherrilyn Kenyon's Dark-Hunter series. It's also one of my all time favorite books.I recently reread it and I forgot just how much I love it. I don't normally reread books. Being ADHD, once I know what's going to happen, I'm usually through. One of the few exceptions are the Harry Potter books and, now, the Dark-Hunters.I think it really says something about an author who can get me to pick up her book again and, as the story unfolds, I still get just as excited by each scene as it comes up. \\"Oh, I forgot about this!\\" \\"You go, Vane, you rock!\\"I really do love this book. In it, you have Vane, a Werewolf - though that is not a term they like, who is on the run from his father and pack who want him dead. His brother, Fang, is comatose and he just can't leave New Orleans without him.Then you have Bride. I love Bride and can really relate to her. She's a size 18 and her weight really bothers her. I've struggled with my weight my entire life and the thoughts she had when she's looking at clothes, etc, I can really relate to.What's more, we meet Bride after her long term boyfriend breaks up with her via Fed-x. What's worst, he charged it to her clothing shop.Vane is in no position to find a mate, especially a human one. But when the mating marks show up on Bride and Vane's palm, he has a choice: Mate with her or be impotent for the rest of her life while she goes on her marry way without a clue.This book had me laughing hysterically throughout. Its the stuff you wish happened when some dushbag ditched you. Sherrilyn had me falling in love with werewolves all over again."},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"I loved this book, it is one my fav's in the DH series.

Vane Kattalakis, a Were-Hunter wolf, sees her through her storefront window and is stunned. He saw her a few weeks ago when he was protecting Sunshine (Talon's mate) and never forgot her. When he enters her store, their lives are changed forever.Vane isn't looking for a mate but it turns out Bride is the one that the Fates have marked for him. But, she's a human and he's wanted dead by his enemies. Vne has three weeks to convince Bride, who is unaware he's a wolf, to be his mate or spend the rest of his life neutered. He also has to convince himself that this is an acceptable life for Bride given the danger he faces everyday from his enemies.I looked forward to reading Vane's story and it lived up to my expectations. Aside from being deliciously sexy, his love and admiration for Bride was just touching. She was so bruised emotionally and, for a wolf with no experience with humans, he was amazingly sensitive. I loved how he reached out to his network for coaching and his natural instincts made him really special. Vane is fearless and wildly protective of those he cares about but has a sense of fairness that should have been uncommon in someone with his sad background. The confrontations with his enemies were exciting and dangerous and the ending was cleverly crafted.This is my favorite of the series so far, full of heartwarming (and sexy) moments and excitement. The series just keeps getting better and better."},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"Bride has just been dumped and has had it with men. When a handsome, ripped \\"man\\" visits her shop and buys her a beautiful necklace she knows he must be too good to be true. He finds her, in all her overweight glory, to be gorgeous and wants her in a way no one ever has. Little does Bride know that he is a Were-hunter wolf with magical powers. He's on the run from his father's pack and his mother who both want him dead. With his brother, Fang, in a coma after a recent Daimon attack, Vane soon finds out that Bride is his destined mate. He has 3 weeks to convince her to accept him as his mate. When Bride finds out his true nature, will she be able to accept him wolf and all?This book takes place in New Orleans where several of the Dark Hunter books have, filled with Daimons, Dark-hunters, Were-hunters, were-bears, were-panthers, gods. goddess and of course Acheron. There was a little less action than usual in this story. While the beginning and end had some battles with his family the middle was more just about Vane trying to win over Bride. Since he grew up in a wolf pack and has had little contact with the human world, even after 420 years (which was a little hard to believe) he now finds himself trying to figure out how to date Bride by human standards. It was cute to watch him be confused by little things Bride did and not quite know how to handle it and it made for a very sweet story. He seemed to do just fine on instinct alone. I loved that Bride is not the perfect skinny, model type that we see in a lot of romance books but was a rather flawed character. Vane certainly sees past that and loves everything about her. He comes to her rescue with the ex boyfriend a couple of times too which was great and very funny! With his magic he could change her but chooses not to and that was very sweet to me. Even though he's an alpha male he seems to be one of the sweeter of the Hunters we've seen so far. Maybe it was just because they had a chance to have some \\"dating time\\" in the middle where they weren't wrapped up in some giant battle the entire time. He has one mixed up family to deal with though. His father has been sending warriors out to kill Vane while at the same time his mother has been trying to do the same thing. His mother lives in a different time period and while Vane can time travel, his mother can not. She must send demons after him and Bride instead. Turns out Vane has even more family than he thought too. This is the first Dark Hunter book that has focused on a Were-Hunter so they also gave us a little more info on the two types of Werewolves. It was nice to get a little more clarity on the two types. The thing that bothered me the most in this story was Bride's name, so if that was my biggest complaint that's not too bad. We also got to see a lot of old characters in this one like Kyrian, Acheron, the bear clan, Grace, Valerius, Nick, Otto and Simi. We got to know Valerious a little more since we haven't really seen to much of him it was good to see the other side of him before his upcoming book. As usual, Acheron's parts just make it that much harder for me to wait until his book. That is one mysterious man! Overall, this was a pretty good book. It definitely had a different feel than the previous Dark Hunter books but I really enjoyed Vane and Bride's story.[...]"},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"Every time I read her books I can't believe how gifted she is.

You will LOVE this book!!!!"},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"Many will disagree, but I think 3 stars is generous. Pleasant enough, but not my style. Absurd. The romance is fine, the passion steamy, and I even sympathized with some of the characters. But the plot is ridiculously silly. At the same time, it's needlessly complex, due to the widely varied species of characters and the overlapping series.Kenyon breaks the KISS rule (keep it simple, sweetie). She's got one series layered upon another series, and eventually, even a third overlapping series. She's got organizations piled upon societies and species. Yikes! Dark-Hunters, Were-Hunters, Dream-Hunters, daemons, demons, Arcadians, Kategorians (sp?), Apollites, Romans, Greeks, vampires, werewolves, all kinds of shape-shifters, the Fates and other Greek gods, and...humans.Not to mention the character names: Fury, Vane, Fang...Bride. LOL!!Lots of improbabilities:We have Vane, a shapeshifter wolf who only left the wild 8 months ago, having spent his entire life (almost 5 centuries) in a wolf den, apart from humans, but who dresses in leathers, can handle a motorcycle, manages an investment portfolio and is on good terms with the Wichovia bank president, knows his salad fork from his steak knife, is a wine connoisseur, drives several hot sports cars..... Imagine shapeshifter bears celebrating Thanksgiving. Silly.What are the chances that Bride's ex-boyfriend would be SUCH an overt jerk with a capital B. I mean he was over the top. What motivated him, after 5 years of dating, to be so unwarrantedly cruel? Who knows. Who cares. Plot device.Our hero Vane can magically makes clothes, cell phones, and roses instantly appear, and he knows that his human mate and his comatose brother are on a high priority hit list from his vile pack, but he LEAVES THEM UNPROTECTED TO GO GET A DRINK?? Even though his enemies appeared in that very same room only a few days ago??? (obviously, Kenyon needed to steer the plot. Who cares if we sacrifice all respect for Vane's intelligence, if not his SHORT TERM MEMORY!!)Gads.Vane tells Bride that he is 460 years old. That would mean he was born around 1550. Shakespearian days. But when they go back in time to England to see his mother, to a time AFTER he was born, and AFTER his brothers were grown up, they go to -- wait for it -- the 5th Century, referencing King Arthur. (I really must have missed something, because no way does that add up.)I'm in the minority. Many readers lap it up. Read this book for the romance, not for a coherent, compelling story.======================"},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"Vane Kattalakis is a were-hunter who's been banished from his pack by a father who's been trying to kill him and his brother Fang. After a deadly attack by daimon's, Fang is left in a strange coma and Vane takes him into hiding to take care of him. Shortly after he finds himself in Bride McTierney's shop. He'd already met Bride once and has been intrigued by her ever since. After a brief encounter with her, Vane realizes Bride is his mate, however he decides not to reveal his true form to Bride. Nor does he tell her, at least right away, they are fated to be together. Instead, he leaves her to believe he is human and secretly protects her from his former pack members who wish his mate harm.Bride can't understand why a man like Vane would be interested in her. But she indulges herself anyway, and allows herself to be swept away by the larger than life man on a motorcycle. But things go terribly awry and Vane is forced to clue Bride in on his true form and the sort of world he comes from. Needless to say, Bride is horrified at first and has a hard time accepting what she's been told. She eventually comes to terms with it and decides she wants to be with Vane anyway. On the side of all this, Vane still has to look after his brother, who refuses to come out of his coma.Night Play is the fifth in the dark-hunter series, although this book introduces us to the world of the were-hunters. Their were two problems I had with this book. The first is the lack of action, especially on Vane's part. He was very docile and spent most of the book \\"flashing\\" back and forth between his brother Fang and Bride in order to make sure both were okay. The other problem I has was with Bride's character in general. Although she was likable, her constant obsession over her weight and how Vane could possibly be attracted to someone like her got rather annoying after a while. In fact, I had hard time understand why Ms. Kenyon created Bride's character they way she did. I realize not every heroine should be a perfect size zero supermodel beauty. But a size eighteen just seems like overkill to me and unnecessary. It leaves the reader to believe the only reason Vane is with Bride is because the fates deemed it so, which is hardly romantic.Having that said, Night Play is a good one in the dark-hunter series. But it doesn't really hold up against some of the previous ones like, Kiss of the Night, Dance with the Devil or Night Pleasures.Erin Kernauthor of Looking for Trouble"},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"I enjoy the Dark Hunter Series.

Unfortunately he did not make my list as one of my favorite werewolves. I was turned off by Bride. She was too much the damsel in distress for me. Night Play is book six in the Dark-Hunter series. It can be read separately from the rest of the novels. I have been wanting to check out a book by Sherrilyn Kenyon for a while. Though I though this was an ok book, I was just a little disappointed that it didn't grab me more. I do plan on giving Sherrilyn Kenyon's books another try in the near future."},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"I have thoroughly enjoyed all of Kenyon's Dark Hunter series. I'm looking forward to the Dream Hunter's next."},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"Night Play is another foray into the mythological world of Dark Hunters and Were-Hunters in New Orleans. This is a pretty decent read; although not my favorite of the series. I liked Vane a lot. He is sweet, caring, and isn't the stereotypical romance hero. I loved getting a few more glimpses into Ash's mysterious character and I am always amused when Simi appears. On the negative side, I didn't like how the hero and heroine had sex as soon as chapter one - it takes away from the allure of the romance."},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"Loved this book!!

I like when the main characters are not perfect but are more realistic, or as realistic as you can be in a Fantasy novel. The love scenes were hot and the story was heartwarming and at times quite funny but then Kenyon's books always have humor that's why I love them. I recommend this book and all the others in the series they are a great read."},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"Enjoyed this book by far compared to others. Hope the dark hunter series continue to excite me as this one did."},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"While this book was enjoyable, it didn't have me on the edge of my seat for most of the book and it had a few flaws. Bride was a heroine that had major self image issues, which bordered on annoying. The ending seemed a little rushed and Bride has a complete character change in the last few pages. So that's my deal with giving this book a 4. I liked Vane very much, and could see the set up of the next book in the series, Valerius and Tabitha's, which I am really looking forward. All in all, not the best in the Dark Hunter Series, but I'm one book closer to Acheron!"},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"I love Bride and Vane. He is so completely clueless about how to get on in human society and she is completley unaware that there is anything but humans around, kind of funny because she hangs around with Tabitha and her family but oh well.I think the roamnce is great and that Bride really grows as a person throughout the book.

As always this series Rocks, but start at the beginning so you'll know what is going on! See my Listmania to find out what order to read!!!"},{"Title":"Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)","review":"I've got all the dark-hunter series books and while I love all 11 (though SK did have a lull around books 9 & 10), this is by far my favourite. My sister, best friend and I were talking about this book during a girls night the other saturday.... If you're larger than average, plainer than average, have an illness/disability/are less than physically \\"acceptable\\" don't you have the fantasy of some wonderful man who sees past that to the woman inside? Even in fiction it doesn't happen too often, which one would think would be the easiest place to find it - after all fiction, especially romance fiction is really all about fantasy. Well Sherrilyn Kenyon is one who does it. In Talon & Sunshine's story we get a rather curvy girl and here in Vane & Bride story she takes it one step further, specifying an actual size 18 heroine.Bride is lovely - tall, pretty and rubinesque with a good heart. She's also got a few foibles about a drop dead gorgeous man falling so quickly for her. But, fall Vane does - he's been slightly obsessed with her since seeing her some 8 months before this book begins (see afore mentioned Talon's story). Vane is just about perfect: he's gorgeous, madly in love with woman Bride is, gentle with a woman while delightfully randy at the same time, and protective of her to the point that he's prepared to walk away and live the years of the rest of her life celibate rather than dragging her into his rather dangerous dysfunctional world. I just love his explanation of the difference between love vs lust.I adore the characters in this story, who wouldn't want to be part of Bride's circle of friends (the knee-capping offer particularly amused me). Bride's lovely mum, dad and brother, even her slightly nasty sister ring true in the way of family dynamics (my relationship with my sister was a bit like that for quite a few years). The \\"wolf boys\\" (Vane, Fang & Fury) are fantastic, comical and heartwarming. (An aside... Can't wait for more of these yummy guys stories).I do not agree with the reviewers claiming Bride's too whiney etc about her size - anyone with the slightest concerns of self image would have a few worries with the start of a new relationship and I love the way Bride gains confidence through the progression of the story - to the point of a knock-down-drag-out confrontation with Vane's rather psychotic mother. Go girl!Read this book. It might just make you giggle, get teary-eyed and believe that we all deserve a happy ever after."},{"Title":"A German Ace Tells Why: From Kaiserdom to Hitlerism","review":"I don't usually go to superlative praise, but this personal little journal is mesmerizing. Begun in 1914 by a fifteen year-old German schoolboy, it records his observations from the outbreak of the First World War through each major historical moment to the invasion of Poland in 1939. In his own innocent words he marks the major stages of German struggles from the start of war, the end of war, the Versailles Treaty to the advent of Hitler as Chancellor, the empowering of the Nazi Party, and to the Second World War. He shows his gradual maturing from an enthusiastic patriot to a jaded young flyer conscripted into a war he cannot personally support, yet cannot avoid.A genuine and amazing chronicle."},{"Title":"Advising and Supporting Teachers (Cambridge Teacher Training and Development)","review":"Advising and supporting teachers by Mick Randall and Barbara Thornton (CUP) is a fine addition to the literature on teacher support. It guides teacher educators on how they can give support to teachers in training especially during their teaching practice. This book challenges teacher supervisors to examine their own philosophy of teaching and supervision by having them reflect on various tasks (part 2 of the book) that consist of case studies, observation tasks, role plays, feedback techniques and various other activities. The book begins by setting the scene for teacher supervision and offers a humanistic approach to helping trainee teachers through their teaching practice.This book is really a must read for any teacher trainer/educator that is involved with teachers on the practicum. It offers many provocative tasks and approaches to teacher supervision and can be utilized pretty much in any context (although it is very much British influenced). Regardless of how much a teacher educator can implement from this book, just one reading of it will remind teacher supervisors just how much they may take for granted when supervising trainee teachers on teaching practice. However, given the workload that many supervisors are burdened with, I wonder how, and when they will get enough time to reflect on the tasks! So the book would be most suitable for trainee supervisors that have more time to discuss these tasks. That said, I recommend this book to all supervisors of teachers as well, so that they can reflect on the complexities of supporting new teachers. This book offers support for these teacher supervisor"},{"Title":"Advising and Supporting Teachers (Cambridge Teacher Training and Development)","review":"This worthy handbook explores ways in which language teachers can best be advised and supported in their teaching situations. The authors provide a comprehensive review of literature to support their contention that the goal of training should be to develop independent, autonomous and professionally-minded teachers. Additionally, they demonstrate the central role feedback plays in helping teachers to become self-critical reflectors on their teaching experiences. Throughout, advisors are prompted to think about how they can move teachers on to higher level concerns and there are many good points to emerge especially in the area of talking to teachers (Chapters 6-9). Based on this excellent discussion, I also see a need for advisors themselves to reflect on their own practices especially in contexts where collaborative relationships with teachers and colleagues are not high on 'personal' agendas."},{"Title":"The Oxford Bookworms Library: Level 4: 1,400 Word Vocabulary Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde","review":"The Great Illustrated classics are great (no pun intended) The Strange Case Of Dr. Jekyll And Mr. Hyde is so cool.

Gibbs--the Rainman of Time Travel","review":"If i had to rate anything by, or having to do with Steven Gibbs, I would give it one star. I give it that rating for the fact that someone actually spent time to write about Steven Gibbs. I don't doubt that he's an intelligent man(he supposedly has a B.S. degree). One, of many, things that confuses me is that he invented a \\"working\\" HDR(hyper dimensional resonator) and a Time Transponder. You can actually travel through time with these devices! Oh wait, no you can't. To my surprise no one has ever had any proof that these devices work. These \\"amazing\\" devices look like they were built by twelve year old twins. Is say that because the devices are almost the exact same(with varying prices of course). There are so many people that are basically followers of this man, buying all of his products and getting no results. I'm not necessarily bashing Steven Gibbs, but more of bashing humanity for being dumb. I typed in Steven Gibbs in a search engine and read the articles that appeared on the page. I was disgusted at how many people are into the wonderous time travel devices. It seems like the need for time travel is turning into a religion. People need to understand the difference between real science and pseudo science. Anyone can sit in their basement and wrap up wires, diodes and switches in masking tape, glue it in a box and claim they're from 3084. But It takes a genius to sell it and make money. Now, I would like to appologize for the pungent stentch of sarcasm that was necessary to write about Steven L. Gibbs. I would also like to point out that if anyone has proof of this time travelling, quit your job... you just turned into God. Overall, this book is a waste of time and money. You should spend your money on something great, like a Flux Capacitor."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This trilogy is the best piece of literature ever concieved.

The story continues with the epic adventures of the fellowship, only this time it splits into seperate but related subplots. Sam and Frodo in one and the rest of the fellowship in the other.

Boy was I wrong.This book has so much description, it is unbelievable. It makes you want to start talking and writing with more description. \\"In such an hour of labour Sam beheld Mt. Doom, and the light of it, cut off by the high screen of Ephel Duath from those who climbed up the path from the west, now glared against the stark rock faces, so that they seemed to be drenched in blood.\\"This is a great story about good vs. evil, Where an unlikely hero is asked to do the unthinkable.....

I think that this is my favorite book of the three so far, but I'll have to hold back final judgment until I read The Return of the King, the final book in what has turned out to be my favorite trilogy. The story as interpreted, is broken up into two stories that combine in the end to make sense of this dramatic thriller. The first part of the book has a wide range of activity; it's about the beginning of the War of the Ring in the time of Middle Earth and it concentrates mainly on Merry and Pippins adventure through mysterious lands. As they meet some of the cruelest and unique creatures, they press on to find Frodo and Sam who are on their way to destroy the ring. The second part of the book follows Frodo, Sam, and Gollum as they try to make their way to Mordor, to the top of Mount Doom where the ring can be destroyed to preserve the world. The story turns out to be the most interesting of the two books so far and I highly recommended this book to the educated class who desire a in-depth, breath-taking adventure through a character filled new world.A+"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"&quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; book series are considered Tolkien's masterworks and for good reason. The third book begins as Frodo Baggins, Bilbo Baggins's nephew and the Ring-Bearer, is captured by orcs and taken to a tower in the dark land of Mordor. Sam, Frodo's servant and a member in the Fellowship, tries to get Frodo out of the tower. The story then turns to Aragorn, heir to the throne of Gondor and the only thing that stands in Sauron's way, and his army. They came to the Black Gate (the entrance of Mordor) to buy Frodo and Sam time, for their only hope was the destruction of the Ring. Tolkien describes each scene with so much care and detail that you'd think you were actually there. He takes you to a world of fantasy and adventure that grips you from the start and does not willingly let you go. Tolkien puts the &quot;good triumphs over evil&quot; genre and adds unexpected twists and turns that are thoroughly entertaining. I would recommend this book to everyone. The plot is thoroughly enjoyable and exciting. The story line and flowing and beautifully written. J.R.R.

Picking up just before the climactic battle of Gondor, it keeps up the suspense through to Frodo's internal battle with darkness. I won't give away anything that happens (in case someone has not read it yet) but let it suffice that Tolkien is one of the best writers I've ever read, and his world of Middle Earth is imaginative and the inspiration for almost the entire genre of sci-fi and fantasy. I've re-read the last few chapters of The Return of the King uncountable times, it is so moving. All the characters are realistic and have depth; the settings are gorgeously detailed; Tolkien was a master storyteller beyond compare. If you've never read this trilogy (and The Hobbit as well) then what are you waiting for? Even if it takes a while, it is worth it a hundred times over."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I had to read The Fellowship of the Ring for my sophomore English class, and once I finished it, I was so hyped up on LOTR that I decided to read The Two Towers just for fun.

And don't forget to see the movie--it provides a nice visual image to all the action."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Anyone who has read the first two in this classic trilogy, or who wants to get a jump on the movie release will want to read this. While Frodo and Sam move closer to destroying the ring, fierce battles wage between forces of good and evil with Aragon leading the victors. After finishing the book, the thing that struck me was the amount of current authors whose own work resembles Tolkein's. The most prevalent in my mind is Robert Jordan, but also admittedly Stephen King's \\"Dark Tower\\" series."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This Book Rules, it is a must buy."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"After watching the first film from the trilogy I start reading THE TWO TOWERS. It has a sad beginning with Boromir getting killed and Merry and Pippin being captured by the Uruk - Hai and Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli run in pursuit of them. When the three hunters find a trail leading to Fanghorn forrest they meet Gandalf again. After learning that Merry and Pippin are with Treebeard (an ancient being of Middle Earth), the four men decide to stop the corruptive undoings of Grima Wormtoungue in Rohan and make King Theoden and his Rohirrim army fight against Isengard. The Rohirrim army go to Helm's Deep to fight off Saruman's Orcs. After Rohan has won the battle, King Theoden,Aragorn,Legolas,Gimli,and Gandalf goes to Isengard to comfront Saruman. The five reach ruined like Isengard where they meet Merry and Pippin. After the Voice Of Saruman episode, Gandalf breaks Saruman's staff and Wormtoungue throws the palantir at them and there Pippin looks into it and is terrified and is taken by gandalf into Gondor.Book 4 is my favorite with Frodo and Sam meeting with Gollum and making him their guide to Mordor. His shortcuts he takes them are long and perilious like the Dead Marshes. On their way they meet Faramir, Boromir's brother and is taken to a forbidden pool area where Gondor rangers hide out. After the hobbits tell Faramir about the ring he lets them go. At the end, Gollum betrays the hobbits and take them to Shelob the spider where Sam wounds her and Frodo is poisoned by her. The Orcs take Frodo away and Sam is left alone in the darkness of Mordor. THE TWO TOWERS is fast paced and is much better to understand than THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING.

I think I could read them for the rest of my life! I highly recommend this book or anyone who loves trial and error and good vs. evil stories. READ IT!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Fellowship of the Ring was an audacious, sweeping fairy tale with fascinating (and sometimes silly) characters, a narrative surge that survived tedious pages of description, and a mythic quality that overrode some of the pretension. The Two Towers was a fan's book, filled with boring Nordic warriors and a lot of pseudo-legendary claptrap, but redeemed by the hobbits and some stunning scenes.Return of the King, the third volume of Lord of the Rings, is downright weird. Tolkien seems to have lost it. For much of the first two hundred pages, he is trying to write Beowulf (possibly forgetting that it's been written already and that this is not the year 1050). He even writes passages in perfect Anglo-Saxon poetic style, replete with proper rhythm and alliteration. Much of this is brutal to get through, with its fawning adoration of warriors and its recitations of family histories. Tolkien is so enamored of these Vikings that he downplays the fascinating and scary episode wherein Aragorn leads the armies of the dead against the forces of Mordor. This imaginative incident is offhandedly retold by Aragorn in the midst of all the stupefying knightly courtesies. Even the hobbits, Merry and Pippin, take on the bombastic cadences of the warriors, becoming sycophantic boobies as they bow and scrape to two different (and nearly indistinguishable) kings. The best sections of this Anglo-babble involve King Denethor of Gondor going bonkers and trying to burn his son alive.When Tolkien finally gets to the Big Battle, the writing energizes, especially when Merry and Eowen-the beautiful princess disguised as a warrior--take on the Head Nazgul. But weirdness returns as Aragorn, who apparently is the Chosen One, begins healing the mortally wounded! This is a bit much, especially when Tolkien's prose turns Biblical (lots of &quot;ands&quot;).We finally get back to Frodo and Sam, who walk to Mount Doom over many, many, many pages (the slightly homoerotic relationship between these two becomes uncomfortably overt in this volume). Meanwhile Aragorn and all the warriors confront the REAL Head Nazgul in Mordor to distract Sauron, and plotting sense takes a holiday. Sauron--this omnipotent creature of darkness, who can see all--turns out to be as easily duped as a freshman buying a phony elevator pass from a senior. He totally misses Frodo and Sam traipsing up Mount Doom. And the only reason the two hobbits get there is because the orcs conveniently quarrel and slaughter each other.And then comes the Huge Climax, the moment the whole epic has been building toward--and it's over in one paragraph! Frodo wants to keep the Ring, Gollum bites Frodo's finger off and falls into Mount Doom. End of Sauron. Eighty gazillion warriors, two kings, elves, dwarves, and a mighty wizard couldn't touch this Prince of Evil, but he's done in by a bit of slapstick! You look back on a thousand pages and say &quot;What was THAT about?&quot;Then, after pages of pageantry, there's a whole new story! Saruman, the once mighty and evil wizard, has set up shop in the Shire as a kind of Tony Soprano, and the four hobbit warriors rout him and his thugs. Where did this extra tale come from? If you know that Tolkien was a Luddite, you can understand the stuff about cutting down trees and building smoke-belching mills. But after defeating Nazguls, Balrogs, and Sauron, routing a pack of comical toughs isn't exactly a challenge for Frodo and company. Amazingly, Tolkien's prose transforms here, becoming plain and spare. I suppose you could admire Tolkien for the tour de force of transforming his prose to fit his characters, but I find it disconcerting. There is a bittersweet loveliness to the ending, where Frodo, mortally wounded in his soul, sails off to the Gray Havens with Gandalf and Bilbo.So this book is kind of a mess. And yet--with all this, somehow the three-volume epic keeps you engaged, and you care about the hobbits. I'm reminded of Moby Dick--not a similar story, but also a book that is a stylistic and structural disaster and yet somehow works. I read all the way through Lord of the Rings and will probably read it again, infuriating and labored as much of it remains. I suppose Tolkien's fierce belief in his own world lends this flawed saga a touching enchantment."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"report by Joe AntonucciThe book I read was Lord Of The Rings The Return Of The King. The author was J.R.R Tolkien. What this book was about is that as Frodo and Sam are getting closer to Mordor, there are a lot of troubles with the rest of the world. The world seems to be getting ever more overwhelm by orcs and goblins. Sauron's forces seem to have almost taken over the world. One of the major surviving cities, Gondor, is under attack and Gandolf tries to save it. When it seems like the city would be lost, Aragon brought the help of undead warriors to help them in battle. As all this was going on, Frodo and Sam were getting very close to the mountain. When they got at the top, they meet and very unpredictable guest. I cannot tell you who, because it would ruin the book. What will happen to Frodo and Sam? What is going to become of the rest of the world? What happened to Rohan's king? These are some questions that by only reading the book, you will find the answers too.I think that this book was pretty exiting to read. I also think that this book could get really boring at parts too. I think when there is a lot of action going on, it makes the book seem a lot more interesting. I was able to feel like I was in the book because the author described the characters and there emotions very easily. I think that the main conflict interested me a lot because it was about major battles and a lot of fighting. I liked this because it makes the book a lot more interesting to read. I think the characters were very realistic because of how the author showed their emotions and their personality's. I thought they were very realistic, except that there were elves and dwarfs.The author's voice during the book was more of a serious one. During the really important parts it was but in some of the other parts, he did have a funnier voice. Also at some parts he had a real mellow voice. I thought the author used a very large verity of vocabulary. He used words that I have not ever heard before, but the words still made sense to me. Also the author even made up his own language, which he used in the book. I think J.R.R. Tolkien had a very unique writing style. He wrote in like a olden times style of writing. The writing, at some parts, was very similar to how Shakespeare would write. This writing style is not my favorite because it makes it very confusing to understand. I think the author did a pretty good job with the amount of dialogue though out the book. I think he could have added more to it, because at some of the parts he would ramble on and on about the setting, and it made it very hard to understand what was going on. I thought the author's tone could have been funnier, but I thought his over all tone was good. I think J.R.R. Tolkien could have added more dialogue and a lot more humorous stuff to his book, but over all I would say this is a good book, not the best book I have ever read but it was okay.I believe that Lord Of The Rings Return Of The King was an okay book. I believe that J.R.R. Tolkien could have added more stuff to his book. I beleive he could have made the big battle scenes a little bit more exiting and that I believe he could have added more stuff with what happened to saromon. I think kids of the ages 12 and up should only read this book because it is a hard book to understand. I think this book deserves a 8 out of 10 because it seemed to have lacked parts from the book. It felt like some of the pages were missing but there was not any missing. The author left of at some parts, witch made everything really confusing. I think both boys and girl would enjoy this, if they have the IQ to understand it. I believe this was not the greatest book I have every read but it was not horrible.I believe this book was an okay book. It had an amazing detail in its settings. It made you really feel like you were in the book, but the down sides were that the book was to long and boring. Also it seemed like parts were missing right out of the book. I believe that this book deserves an 8 out of 10. I think this book could have added more to the ending because it sort of left you off. I think this was the worst book out of the 3 Lord Of The Rings books."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Return Of The King being the last part of The Lord Of The Rings sees the final battle between the forces of Mordor and those of the West.We observe the phenomenal growth in character of Merry and Pippin who come into their own as Knights of Rohan and Gondor respectively . In this capacity they perform great deeds of heroism .We also learn more of the characters Faramir of Gondor and the shieldmaiden and young noblewoman of Rohan , Eowyn .There are particularly strange and interesting scenes such as Aragorn's deal with the Dead Men of Dunaharrow to help him defeat the forces of Mordor and thus gain their freedom from the curse of being undead.The epic Battle of Pelennor Fields sees the heroism and sacrifice of many of the key players in the saga...This book sees the final resolution to the conflict between good and evil.The lesson of The Lord Of The Rings is that the forces of justice and good can win provided we always realise our cause is just and make a clear distinction between good and evil.This holds a lesson in the world-wide fight against terrorism and all those who want to destroy our Western , Judeo-Christian civilisation.This at a time when young people seem no longer influenced by real heroes and when political correctness and narcissism obscures moral clarity.LOTR is therefore more relevant today than ever."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This third and final entry in the Lord of the Rings series sees the crashing together of massive forces as the hordes of Mordor come together against the forces of good on the battlefield.

An unexpected gift, it became pure magic for me. There were moments when I became so affected -- scared, and then triumphant. I was living the adventure of Frodo and the whole fellowship. It made the summer of '86 a coming-of-age moment for me, something unforgettable. The knowledge of the book was something i could hug to myself, a deep dark secret, a source of pleasure when the summer finally ended and I had to start junior high school.When I was older and read it again, I was more critical. I didn't know why. I didn't want to be. But suddenly, Tolkien's words seemed too heavy to me, too ponderous. The metaphors were clearer, though. Still, it made me wish I never grew up."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Marvelous ending to the lord of the rings trilogy. Truly wraps things with vigior and intensity.

Some were bracing for war against the evil of Sauron. Others were dealing with the treachery of the evil wizard Saruman.Tolkien masterfully conveys his message to the reader. The general theme of this book is that good always triumphs over evil, and the author displays this in the text very well. When the reader thinks that the fight is hopeless, a miracle happens and good triumphs in the end.When I read this book, I found it to be exhilerating and fulfilling to me. I would recommend that anyone who needs a good book should read this."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers is the second part to the lord of the rings trilogy. The first book was translated to a movie which i saw. I liked the movie so much that couldn't wait for the next movie to come out, and many people told me that the movie was exactly like the book; So i decided to buy the book.the author tries to give his message to the reader by expressing it through the plot and the theme. Plot and theme is very important in a story and this book is full of it, it is very suspensful has relations to the rennaissance times in europe. In this story is about a series of rings that were given to all of the powerful leaders of the dwarfs, elves, man and one given to the dark lord of mordor. This single ring has the power to control the world but the ring was lost from the lord when he was killed. It rested for thousands of years until it as found again and given to Frodo, the hobbit. He and some key friends were sent to mordor to destroy the ring. The second book starts in the middle of their misson were all has gone wrong. frodo has taken leave with trusty friend Sam, gandalf was believed to be killed, one member of the fellowship has been killed, and two hobbits were taken prisoner. The three remaining members of the fellowship went out to rescue the hobbits where Frodo felt that he had to go alone(with the exception of his friend Sam) because the ring had a seductive power to people of the weak mind and were trying to steal it from him. The hobbits were found and Gandalf ended up not to be dead. They join with allies and build up an army against the traitot wizzard, Saruman. frodo continues his duty as the ring bearer to destroy the ring while he ecounters many obstacles along is way. The ending is too good to be given away, so too bad."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Who ever said that sequels are never as good as the originals? In Tolkien's second novel, The Two Towers, Tolkien disproves this theory about sequels. The Two Towers is the second book in a three book series.Before reading this book, one should read The Fellowship of the Ring, because in this novel, Tolkien develops the main characters that are all trying to help Frodo destroy his ring. The danger and peril faced in this novel is met and possibly surpassed in the sequel. In The Fellowship of the Ring, the dangers they had to overcome were not as extreme because they were facing them as a group instead of the characters facing them separately as they did in The Two Towers. The Perils are also not as severe as those faced in The Two Towers... BR> If one is wondering how Frodo came to bear this powerful ring, one should read The Hobbit. The novel tells the story of Bilbo, Frodo's uncle, and his adventures with a fellowship of elves also in this novel Gandalf is introduced. Tolkien describes his world that he created for his characters in this novel also.Overall this reader was very interested with the novel, The Two Towers, and found the novel very entertaining. The way Tolkien wrote these fantasies was very unique. Through out the novel, Tolkien was very descriptive. This was a good and at times a bad thing. Take for example an action scene, descriptions are the key to a well-written battle and Tolkien does this very well. Also Tolkien uses good description on his characters. The only bad thing about Tolkien's descriptions is that he may get carried away and starts describing things that are not pertinent to the novel. When this happens it tends to make other things unclear and hard to understand thus makes that section boring and not important to the novel. Out of all the books in the trilogy this reader read, The Two Towers did not take that long to read mainly because it has the most action. Taking into account this reader has not"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"WARNING!This review contains spoilers of the first book,so if you haven\`t read that,I recommend you not to read this.Well,the first book introduced us to the world of fantasy.Then it is time to read the sequel.As you have probably read the first book before reading this,you need no further introduction to the characters.The fellowship of the ring broke up in the end of the first book. Aragorn (the human),Gimli (the dwarf),and Legolas (the elve)has now left Emyn Muil to save the hobbits Merry and Pippin from the evil orchs.Frodo and his best friend Sam now decides to enter the shadowland of Mordor alone,because it is too dangerous to enter it for the others.This book is divided in two halfs. The first half is about Legolas,Aragorn and Gimli\`s adventures. First,they meet up with Gandalf (that might come as a surprise to many)and then leaves to help King Theoden of Rohan to fight the orchs.Merry and Pippin escapes the orchs and meet up with Treebeard,who is some kind of living tree - an ent.The second half is about Frodo and Sam\`s adventures on their way to Mordor and Mount Doom,their encounter with the creature named Gollum and a really terrifying monster named Shelob.Over all,this sequel is very exciting. It is fun to read two adventures which takes place at the same time,but on different locations. The first book introduced us to the Middle Earth with detailed descriptions etc,but this one is more like just a great adventure. If you like action,this book will not disappoint you.There is a lot more action in this one.Over all,all of the books are like one great adventure. Like the first book,this book has a little unclear ending too (but I won\`t reveal what)to overgo directly in \\"Return of the King\\",the last part of the series.As for what I remember,this was the most exciting book to read as there happend so much. It doesn\`t feel slow at any time. There is always something. And Tolkien has chosen to put out the dramatic sequences here and there. There is no time when it\`s just \\"action,action,action\\" and \\"talk,talk,talk\\". He varies it deeply in all of the books. And I really appreciate that.Now,the first film has already been released and I am now awaiting to see the big screen version of this book. But don\`t forget to read the book too.

I found the book very entertaining and would highly recommend this book to anyone who likes to read fantasy. The book is told in the third person showing all the events of Frodo and Sam, Merry and Pippin, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli, which made the book fun and captivating. However, I did become bored with many of Tolkien's unnecessary descriptions that I found too lengthy and often too detailed. Still, the book kept me interested to the very end. If you enjoy books that have both humor and sorrow, then you will love this book and for that matter the whole series.(The Fellowship, The Two Towers and Return of the King)."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers, by J.R.R. Tolkien, tells what happens to everyone in the company after the breaking of the Fellowship of the Ring. The first half of the book tells what happens to Boromir, Merry, Pippen, Aragorn, Legolas, Gandlaf, and Gimli. The second half tells of Frodo and Sam who are lost in Emyrn Muil. The book tells of how they meet a \\"friend\\" who leads them for a while they face many other dangers.Sam Gamgee is a likeable character because he comes from a different social class than the other hobbits and he still protects his master and fights with honor. Pippen seems like a likable character. He does a lot of wrong things at the wrong time, but his personality seems cute. Merry's character is very unique compared to many other hobbits. He has to face things that many hobbits would not have to face. The way the author keeps you in suspense throughout the book and does not just blurt out what he is thinking is good. The ending is both satisfactory and unsatisfactory. The author makes you think one bad thing had happened until the very end. The theme of the book is good always triumphs over evil.The author's style is overall satisfying. At some points in the book the author keeps you very interested and in other parts, he loses the reader. The author goes into very detailed descriptions but it is not too much. The vocabulary is pretty difficult. I disliked the way the book is cut in half and you don't really know what is going on with the other characters until you finish half of the book. The book would probably appeal to people from the ages of 10 all the way to adults because of the violence. It is also, appealing because of the many friendships in the book. I would recommend this book because the book has a well-written story line. I would give this book ***** stars.C. L.

Many will find the latter part of \\"The Return of the King\\" to be superfluous and lacking the fire of the earlier action. But thoughtful readers will appreciate what Tolkien has to say.*** The Lord of the Rings adventure is immense and life-changing to its players -- particularly for the hobbits who never imagined themselves so far away from home and so instrumental to the forces of the world.

Aragorn and the others are not at a loss for adventure, however. The first major battles are fought against the dark forces of Saruman and new allies are forged in the process.*** While essential to the epic and not-to-be-missed, \\"The Two Towers\\" is noticeably weakened by the absence of Frodo in the storytelling until two-thirds of the way into the book.

In The Two Towers, the second installment of the Trilogy of the Lord of the Rings, the tale of the One Ring's journey from the Shire to Mordor is continued. While not the fastest paced story at times, the book is still exciting and worth the time to read. The books starts out with the continued tale of Aragon the ranger, Gimli the dwarf, and Legolas the elf as they rush to save Merry and Pippen, two hobbits, from suffering in the hands of the evil wizard Saruman and his Orc servants. Along the way they are helped by the riders of Rohan, Gandalf the wizard returned from the grave, and the Ents of Fanghorn. At the same time, the story follows Frodo and Sam, the last hobbits to remain in the fellowship, as they bear the ring on. They are lead by Gollum and face the many perils of the lands around Mordor.

And the characters seemed to take forever to move from one spot to the next.

This happend after thay had walked through caves for days and were betrayed by what they thought was there loyal and faithfull guide. Then beliving his master was dead Sam left him ther and went on only to find out later that his master, Frodo was only stunned.The charaecters were very vivd to me because of there ability to use what they had in the wild.

The first book, The Fellowship of the Ring, told of the forming of the Company of the Ring, nine companions, who embarked on a perilous quest to the land of the Dark Lord, the land of Mordor. In the Company Frodo the Hobbit was the bearer of the accursed Ring of Power, which Sauron forged in secret eons ago, and which must be destroyed in the fires of the Cracks of Doom, the one place where the Ring can be destroyed, in order to save Middle-earth from annihilation.The Two Towers begins exactly where the first book left off. The Company of the Ring is scattered by a sudden attack oforc-soldiers, some in the service of the Dark Lord of Mordor, some of the traitor Saruman the Wizard. The orcs, mistaking the Hobbits Pippin and Merry to be the Ring-bearer and his servant, capture them, and Aragorn the Human, Legolas the Elf, and Gimli the Dwarf embark on a pursuit of the orcs, determined to rescue the Hobbits. Boromir has been slain by the orcs in an attempt to defend the Hobbits.Meanwhile, only Frodo and his loyal hobbit companion Samwise Gamgee are left to carry the deadly Ring of Power to the Mount of Orodruin, the Cracks of Dooom, in Mordor.

Two Towers is the second book of the Lord of the Ring series. The plot of the novel revolves around destroying the ring of evil power.The novel beginning with an interesting \\"cat and mouse\\" game. The characters are from all over middle earth. Some of the characters are Froto, Gimly, Arawhen, elf and dwarf. The character are trying to destroy the ring. They had to destroy the so the evil would not come back.In the book Gimmle comes later. Gimmle helps them get to somewhere they need to go. He is helping them because he was tortured because he had the for along time. When they found out he had it they found him and tortured him. On the way back they blindfolded him so he would not know the way back.In the book they had a lot of imagery. When I read some parts of the book it felt like I was in the book. He used a lot of description. The symbol of the book was the ring itself. The ring symbols the book because the book is based on destroying the ring. The theme of the book is about the Hobbits. Hobbits even though small have as much to offer as humans, elfs and dwarfs.I would recommend Two Towers to anyone who likes to read to fantasy and adventure books.

Only two things can save us: a lost king returns to his throne, and a little hobbit makes it to Mount Doom.Yes, there's a lot of tension in \\"The Return of the King,\\" the brilliant, rich conclusion to J.R.R. Tolkien's epic fantasy saga. And rather than cheaping out with a \\"and they all lived happily ever after,\\" Tolkien gives his saga's finale a bittersweet edge, along with plenty of wild battles and good vs. evi..Gandalf has ridden to the city of Gondor with Pippin (partly to keep him out of trouble), where the forces of Mordor are attacking. There is upheaval in the city itself, as the steward of Gondor is going nuts. Merry pledges his service to King Theoden of Rohan, not knowing what is ahead for the king and his relatives. And Aragorn is seeking out allies to fight Sauron on a military scale, even if they can't defeat him unless the Ring is destroyed. His search will take him to tribes of forest-dwellers, to Gondor -- and even to summon an army of the dead.In Mordor, the unconscious Frodo has been captured by Sauron's orcs, and taken to the fortress of Cirith Ungol. Sam is desperate to free his friend, but knows that he can't take on an army, and that Frodo would want him to finish the quest. Sam manages to free Frodo from captivity, but they must still brave more dangers before they can come to Mount Doom, the only place where the Ring can be destroyed. As they travel Sam sees Frodo slipping further and further into the Ring's grasp. Will Frodo be able to destroy the Ring?Usually, the climax of an epic adventure is a disappointment. \\"Return of the King\\" succeeds in almost every way, wrapping up each individual storyline, one by one. The ending has a feeling of finality; this is one story that could never have a sequel; Tolkien shows that in a war like this, there is no true \\"happy ending.\\" Even if the good guys win, there will still be scarring, and death, and haunting memories of what once happened. And even if a person survives, he will never be the same.This is the grimmest of the three books in this trilogy. Frodo and Sam are stuck in the vividly horrific Mordor, while the city of Minas Tirith is on the verge of completely crumbling. Tolkien does a phenomenal job of exploring the madness, despair, rage and sorrow that accompany a war, and the way it can affect even the idyllic Shire. And he doesn't forget the slow period of healing that follows -- for people, for civilizations, and even for nature.Though a section of the book near the end descends into near-biblical prose, which changes post-Gondor, Tolkien does not waver in his ability to evoke emotion. One of the most touching scenes in the book is when Sam finds Frodo naked, unconscious and being beaten by an orc. Others include Merry's farewell to Theoden, Eowyn's slaying of the Witch-King, and of course the bittersweet final scene.Speaking of Frodo, this trilogy's hero is almost unrecognizable in parts of this book. The bright, naive young hobbit of the first book has been worn down to a pale shadow of himself. As he grows increasingly attached to the Ring, we even see him doing what seems unimaginable: threatening Sam with a dagger. Sam has come a long way from the shy young hobbit who couldn't say a word around the High Elves -- now he's attacking orcs and carrying Frodo to Mount Doom.And the supporting characters are not neglected either, with the younger hobbits being exposed to the horrors of war, Aragorn breaking fully into his role as the future king of Gondor, and passionate war-maiden Eowyn affecting the war as nobody else could. Some much-loved characters are lost, and others will be permanently changed.The story doesn't really end on the last page; for more background, especially on Aragorn and Arwen, readers should also read the appendices at the end of the book. Another good addition is \\"The End of the Third Age,\\" in which the unpublished epilogue of this book can be found. Though this is probably not canonical, it nicely concludes the story and is a heartwarming look at what happens in the years following \\"Return of the King.\\"It's difficult, once the story has finished, to accept that one has to say goodbye to Middle-Earth and its enchanting inhabitants. But as Gandalf says, \\"I will not say: do not weep; for not all tears are an evil.\\""},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"A timeless book. Lots of great lessons of life illistrated throughout.

While I thought that Tolkien had a fantastic and original idea for his time, his writing left much to be desired for me. I did however, enjoy The Two Towers more than the previously mentioned books despite it having a few flaws for me as well. The Fellowship of the Ring needs to be read before this book, and because of that, I am not going to recap what happens in that book for this review. So be forewarned, the following can contain spoilers for those who haven't read the first book.Frodo and Sam had taken off for Mordor by themselves, leaving the rest of the Fellowship to its fate. They encounter the mysterious creature Gollum on the way and through capture, convince him to promise to be nice and lead them along the best path to Mordor. Gollum is a tricky character though and not the most trustworthy and leads Sam and Frodo closer to their peril. Meanwhile, Legolas, Aragorn, and Gimli have set off in pursuit of Merry and Pipin, who were captured by Orcs. Along the way they come across the Riders of the Kingdom of Rohan, known for their horses, and in the midst of a terrible war. The war is with the white wizard turned evil, Saruman, and his army of orcs that his is unleashing on the Southern kingdom. They decide to help and turn the odds against this horrible force that is descending upon the land.The characters in this book aren't quite as developed as in the first one. While we have plenty of background on the Fellowship characters from the previous book, we don't get much in the way of description for the Riders of Rohan or some of the other newer characters. I do have to say that Gollum is still my favorite. The interesting way he has of speaking and his interactions with the Hobbits are very interesting and a pleasure to read.The writing is very descriptive in other ways and unfortunately this can make the book slow reading at parts. It would have been nice to have more character description as opposed to the multiple instances of describing scenery and legends that aren't even really pertinent to the story. I did find that this book had less song and rhyme than the other and I appreciated that as I tend to skip over them since they distract from the flow of the book. The book isn't very offensive either and despite having battles, not really violent.I look forward to the last book and seeing if it will be my favorite out of all. My opinion has grown more positive with each book and I hope that it does improve.The HobbitBook 1: The Fellowship of the RingThe Two TowersCopyright 1954398 pagesReview by M.

I have gotten more into fantasy over the last few years, so I was bound to read them eventually. I think, I was afraid of not liking them. My Daddy loves them and raves about them any chance he gets. What if I did not enjoy his most beloved stories? But, no worries, I loved them. They have changed my perception of every book I read in the genre. I can pick out the Tolkien in Harry Potter and Eragon and, well, pretty much every bit of fantasy out there. The reason Return of the King is my favorite, however, is Jesus. No, really. This story is about a King returning to his people and his kingdom, freeing them from fear and hopelessness. It is a story about God's plan for us. And I love that. Actually, I even heard Beth Moore reference a scene from this book in a Bible Study, recently. And, you know if Beth said it, it's got to be the gospel truth. *wink*"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Fellowship is broken. Frodo and Sam travel alone to Mordor to destroy the One Ring. The Three Runners; Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli track the kidnapped hobbits, Merry and Pippin. Saruman the White sends his Uruk-hai army to destroy the kingdom of Rohan. Gandalf the Grey returns as Gandalf the White, and informs The Three Runners that the hobbits are safe, and then set out to assist in the defense of Rohan. There are many great battle scenes in this novel, which makes this book a fast and action packed novel. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a journey where there is a good fight around every corner."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The second part of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, The Two Towers, takes up where The Fellowship of the Ring left off. When the trust that was so necessary to the fellowship comes undone so does the fellowship itself. The quest splits off and the first half of the book is instead focused on the fellowship that was left behind and their hunt for those members that were taken by the orcs. Even though you don't pick up with Frodo and the ring until half way through the book it was still very exciting to hear about the adventures of Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli, not to mention the remaining hobbits.Many things changed in this novel and it was great to see how many of the characters are growing and maturing, changing and finding new inner strength and wit and hope. And, even though they are no longer on the main quest Legolas and Gimli still find plenty of excuses to knock some orc heads about as they journey into Rohan and discover the treachery of Sauroman. I also loved the Ents and the magic and history they brought to the story. It was also wonderful to read about the geography of the world so you could always follow along with where everyone was easily using one of the maps included in the book.The detailed layers in the story telling in this volume helped the first half come to life as all sorts of new countries and politics, beings and histories, magic and more were brought to light. I loved the poems and the languages and the names that all flowed together to just make the story come that much more to life.The second half of the book was much more quieter. Not as many characters and not quite as much going on. Frodo and Sam continue on alone until they discover Gollum, or Smeagol if you like, has been following them and decide it is better to follow than be followed and rope him (literally) into being their guide. This part of the story ended up being much more personal and seemed to go even faster as you followed the hobbits in their quest to Mordor and see over and over again just how dangerous, perilous and foolhardy the whole thing appears to be. Not to mention every time it seems like they have reached a milestone you realize they have so very much farther still yet to go. There's a whole third book yet!Fans of the movie should really read the books as well. You can immerse yourself more in the world and really take in all of the details, the songs, the legends and the world itself on a far more intricate level that only a book can achieve."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I have read some of the other reviews here and I'm surprised how much people's reactions are spread across the board. But I suppose that is what truly great art does -- hits people in different places and gets them talking. In my opinion, I agree that at some points the story did seem to drag a little, but the adventure more than makes up for it. For me, the first half of the book was not all that interesting, being mostly battle -- however, there were some significant plot twists (such as the return of Gandalf and Pippin looking in the stone) and new characters (such as Treebeard and the ents) that made it worth reading. (For what it's worth, I absolutely LOVED the ents!!) The second half of the book is what really held my interest, being the journey of Frodo and Sam led by Gollum through the mountains. The dialogue between Smeagol and his alter-ego Gollum is most fascinating, and the character development (especially of Sam) is profound. The characters really grow and change throughout their journey, but at the core is their extremely strong friendship."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Greed, betrayal, infighting, and indecision have led the Fellowship ofthe Ring to break up. Gandalf has fallen, and Boromir is dead. The restof the party is split in two, as Frodo sneaks off with Sam, to go toMordor, and Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli pursue the Orcs that haveabducted the other two hobbits.A lot of breaking stuff, fighting and sneaking to be found here.It ends in a cliffhanger."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I have bought the lord of the rings in all it's form since becoming interested in all things tolkien 25 years ago and the trilogy in this form is absolutely superb.

Excellent stuff."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"All three of the shorter novels published as \\"the Lord of the Rings trilogy\\" are fantastic novels, but the action taking place in The Two Towers is fantastic! This \\"trilogy\\" (originally meant to be published as one book) contains lush imagery, rich and detailed description, heart-pounding action and you can really immerse yourself in the world of Middle Earth.In The Two Towers, Frodo and Sam continue their solitary journey to Mordor, and are eventually overtaken by Gollum (Sm&eacute;agol). Gollum agrees to guide them to the Black Gate of Mordor, but their journey is fraught with danger (not the least of which is Gollum's dual-personality dilemma). Tolkien cleverly wrote his master epic in six books - two books for each volume which was eventually published. In The Two Towers, the books show the division between the Frodo/Sam storyline and the remainder of the Fellowship. Pippin and Merry become separated from the rest of the Fellowship and flee into an ancient forest full of strange and wondrous creatures. A fantastic journey filled with Orcs, Ents, a confrontation with Saruman and a reunion, not only with the remainder of the broken Fellowship, but with the reborn Gandalf, this chapter of the adventure is definitely a page-turner. Even if words on a page don't tend to excite you, this will keep you enthralled. The world that Tolkien has created in Middle Earth is so easy to lose yourself in, you might not want to come back!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"im sorry but there is nothing i can say about this that hasent been said in the 100000 reviews for this book on amazon!

I'll always love the first several chapters of The Return of the King for its focus on that city-on-the-brink, and for the apocalyptic battle against the witch king of Angmar and his minions. And the great news is, that's just the beginning of the book!Book V, the first part of Return of the King, picks up with the fate of all Middle Earth teetering on the very doorstep of destruction at the hands of Lord Sauron's most powerful ringwraith servant. Aragorn and company forge a last alliance between the human kingdoms of Rohan and Gondor that serve to stem the Dark Lord's tide while Frodo and Sam inch ever closer to their final destiny ... and the ring's (chronicled in the first three chapters of Book VI).Just as The Fellowship of the Ring lovingly spent several chapters establishing a world that needs to be saved, this final installment of Tolkien's master trilogy spends several chapters wrapping it up when the major danger has passed. It seems old J.R.R. was reluctant to leave, but don't be fooled (or over-spoiled by Peter Jackson's abridged movie ending). The uprising in the Shire, which serves as falling action and conclusion, does what so few stories of this scope ever do: wraps up every loose end and shuts the door on the story in a way that made it virtually impossible to sequelize. And Tolkien is to be credited for that.(This review has been posted by Marcus Damanda, author of the vampire fantasy, \\"Teeth.\\")"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Anyone who read all of The Fellowship of the Ring and bemoaned its supposed slow start or lack of action (misguided souls ... surely God will correct them im the afterlife) will finally find a home in the second part of The Lord of the Rings.

Thus, Tolkien splits his narrative. Book III is devoted to the adventures of Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli as they learn the fate of the fallen wizard, Gandalf, and seek to rescue the hobbits Merry and Pippin from the clutches of the orcs. Book IV returns us to Frodo and Sam on the hopeless trek to Mordor. Along the way, they enlist the help of a most unlikely guide ...Epic battles, walking tree-gods, monstrous spiders, and reintroduction of literature's most tragic villain, Gollum, highlight this most worthy second part of the greatest fantasy epic ever written.(This review has been posted by Marcus Damanda, author of the vampire fantasy, \\"Teeth.\\")"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"first time listening to books on cd very good but sometimes difficult to keep myself focused."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"the second book of the series it is also qiute good even for the ten thousanda of twists and turns tolkien provides. the fellowship is split in 3 now 1) Araghorn , Legolas and Gimli 2) merrin and pippin 3) Sam and Frodo .

The book is adult literature so it may take you awhile to read. The characters in this book learn to work together, no matter what they are. No matter if the are Elf, Man, Dwarf, or Hobbit, they learn to cooperate with each other and even become friends. This book is sad and romantic. The also is gory because there is a lot of battle scenes, so if you do not like fighting then do not read this book or any of the other Lord of the Rings books. Even though, in my opinion, Return of the King is the best book of the Lord of the Rings series, I strongly recommend that you read the first two books, The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers.

While the strange creature gollum is leading Frodo and Samwise to Mordor Legolas, Gimli, and Aragorn are battling the Oruci at helms deep. With all this in mind there is still more to tell, Merry and Pippin are also in this book escaping from the Oruci and convincing the Treefolk to wage war with Saruman himself.I'd say the climax of the story is at the very end when the Treefolk are crushing Isengod with their Giant stone hammers and boulders at the feet of Saruman's castle itself."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The two towers is an awesome book.

Tolkien takes us once again back to Middle-Earth, his fairy world populated with unique forms of life and filled with ancient myths. And amidst this enchanting setting, we accompany our merry band of Hobbits on their exciting adventures that carry them to places far beyond their and the readers imagination.After the fellowship broke apart at the waterfalls of Rauros, Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas set out to rescue the two young Hobbits, Merry and Pippin, who had been captured by orcs to be brought to the traitor wizard Saruman. The chase itself is as fast paced as the second part of Tolkien's first book had been since the departure from Elrond's home. The events that unfold around the three hunters culminate in a furious battle at Helm's Deep where the riders of Rohan clash with Saruman's mighty forces. These chapters possibly form the most intense string of chapters of the whole LotR trilogy.In contrast to the classical epic fantasy style of the first part, the second part of TTT focuses on the journey of Frodo and his faithful companion Sam to Mount Doom, the mighty fortress of evil Sauron. While the first part of TTT is filled with strife and warfare, the second part is also a journey to the true meaning of friendship, trust, betrayal and courage. Frodo and Sam find assistance when they least expect it by the hands of Faramir, brother to late Boromir, who succeeds in uncovering Frodo's secret task, but rather gives the weary Hobbits hope than despair as he resists the temptation to take the one ring from Frodo when he has the chance to do that. And they experience betrayal at the hands of Gollum, who first brings them closer to their final destination, but eventually leads them into a fatal trap. But it's the courage of dear Sam, who prevails when things appear to have been lost and evil is just one final step from victory...And that's probably the key to 'The Two Towers'. Where TFotR focussed on the adventures of a group of heroes set out to defend good from evil, TTT teaches us about friendship and faith, all spiced up by exciting battles and mysterious riddles. That's what makes Tolkien's epic so unique, as it is more than just a string of adventures in a world of fantasy and magic."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This book was very good. J.R.R.

The first time I read the Lord of the Rings, I thought the Two Towers was the weakest of the three novels. Since then I have read it again and believe it to be much better than The Hobbit or The Fellowship of the Rings. After I finished reading The Fellowship of the Rings for the second time, I remember thinking, &quot;Hopefully the Two Towers won't be too dull.&quot; I got my wish. In fact, each page of the Two Towers built my enthusiasm and anticipation. I could not put it down. The Fellowship of the Ring creates a masterful plot, and the Two Towers magnifies it.The Two Towers recieves it names from the towers of Orthanc and Minus Morgul. At Orthanc the deeds of Aragorn, Merry, Pippen, Gandalf, Gimli, and Legolas are performed. In Rohan they bring about the destruction of Isengard. The latter part of the novel returns to Frodo and Sam and their journey across Mordor and Ithilien to Minas Morgul. The book closes with disaster approaching the quest of the ring and war coming to Minas Tirith.Tolkien is an awesome author whose imagination and skill has inspired my own imagination on many journeys."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This is my favorite book in the Lord of the Rings series. From the first pages when Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas being running, running in search of Merry and Pippen, I am hooked every time I open the book. The battle at Helm's Deep is intense. During the battle, Gimli is separated from Aragorn and Legolas. When Legolas hears of this, he betrays his concern for Gimli saying, &quot;But I wish that he had come this way. I desired to tell Master Gimli that my tale is thirty-nine.&quot; A wonderful friendship is born.We meet the King of Rohan, Eomer, and of course Eowyn, the White Lady of Rohan. Women everywhere cheer when she appears! Later we meet Faramir, brother of Boromir, who appears to have the inner strength that Boromir lacks, however he remains in the shadow of his older brother. We travel with Frodo and dear, dear Sam while their guide, Gollum (oh, yes) takes them past the ghosts and battlefields of the Last Alliance.But it is the Ents that absolutely enchant me. Fangorn and his brother Ents (you'll have to read it to find out what an Ent is) are slow, steady, and peaceful creatures. Until they are riled enough to fight. And when they fight...let's say you just want them on your side.Enjoy this book. The middle of a trilogy is often seen as just a tie-in between the beginning and the end of a story where 'nothing really happens'. EVERYthing happens in this book. Don't skip it. It's fabulous."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I hadn't read this since high school and I picked it up again about a month ago. Just an incredible series, it's the best escape I could imagine. If you haven't read it yet, do so immediately, you'll find yourself longing for the simpler life of Middle-Earth."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I read the Tolkien Trilogy every year ever since I was in 6th grade. The Return of the King is an outstanding book, and it concludes Tolkien's Trilogy, The Lord Of The Rings, and it does it well. It concludes the adventures of a ranger fromthe north who's true identity is the heir of kings, and a hobbit's courage and trials. But the only way to understand this wonderful book is you need to read the first two books, which I'm sure everyone would. Although this is a great novel, you need patients to read it. And Tolkien has an outstanding use of words, for he uses old English text. This book is great for teens, but I warn parents that the book might have your kids reading all day long, that has happened to me before. Also, it's a great book for adults, i think. It shows the meaning of freindship, love, and obsession in some sense. And it also shows the meaning of ucatastrophe, which is a sudden turn of events from bad to good, the oppisite from the word catastophe. Tolkien came up with the word ucatastrophe, to explaine the end of the book. He also uses it as in the story of Christ. This is a great novel and I incourage anyone and everyone to read this great book."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The book starts out from where the first book, The Fellowship, ends and makes way for the sequel, The Return of the King. Frodo and Samwise have left the Fellowship, while Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli go chasing after the orc company that has captured Merry and Pippin. Frodo and Sam meet up with a familiar face. Also, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli find someone believed to dead. If you are expecting me to elaberate, you need to go read it yourself . \\"Do not be hasty.\\" as Treebeard (A character in the book) says (J. R. R. Tolkien, 452).There are only two main characters in the book, Frodo and Aragorn. Frodo is a courageous Hobbit (halfling) from the Shire. He has never been out of his homeland before, and is not the typical hero. Aragorn is a human ranger form the north. He is the heir to the throne of Gondor, yet he does not want to become king. The story is set in Middle Earth, a typical fantasy setting. There are four main areas each with its own geography. The Shire, in the far west is mostly forest and small hills while its neighbor to the east, Rohan, is made up of grasslands with mountains to the north. Next to the east is Gondor, which is made up of a mountain range and more grassland. Finally, in the far east is Mordor, the land of the Dark Lord, Sauron. Mordor is surrounded by a mountain range and its other land is cracked and infertile. The story is set with medieval weapons like swords and bows, but gunpowder makes an appearance in the middle of the story.This book is in the fantasy genre. The story contains elves , dwarves, halflings and humans along with various mythological creatures. Tolkien did several things well in the story. The description of the natural formations is extremely detailed and all of them seem like he was really there to describe them. The characters are also taken to great detail. All of them have intricate character and all of their aspects seem believable.The problem in the story that the characters must solve is that the ring must be destroy in Mordor. Sauron tries anything to regain control of it and if he succeeds, Middle Earth is doomed to be controlled by his might given to him by the ring.This book will be enjoyed by fans of other fantasy novel such as Eragon and the Shannara series. The stories share genres along with similar mythology. They all have the same main races along with having some sort of dark lord as the antagonist. It is better than these other novel though because it has more attracted plot and character development. The sentences and thoughts are much more complex and will be hard to grasp to younger readers.In my opinion, it is the second best in the Lord of the Rings series, following The Return of the King, but ahead of The Fellowship. It is ahead of the Fellowship because its more active start but starts slower than The Return of the King. Tolkien's description is full of complex descriptions and the sentences never get old. The British style does distract from the content for the American readers, but does not put it beyond the reach of most readers. My reactions to the book were wanting to read more and I thought that it was well done. I appreciated the detail, but the confusing names prevented me from completely understanding the plot on the first read through. On the second read though, it was much easier to grasp and I was able to grasp it perfectly. Due to the dryness of the book, it was hard to read for hours at a time, but I could easily go for twenty minutes to half an hour. This allowed me to take a break and think about the events, not just rush on to the next chapter. I rate this book five out of five."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Sure, we have all seen the movie, and have been impacted deeply by it (I sure was). The book is also this way, only more broad and fleshed out. The part I hated the most was the end, for I knew I had to leave Middle-Earth. Though I was leaving it, I knew one thing: I would never forget it or what the characters symbolized. Well done, Tolkien. Well done. And thank you."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This is my favorite book out of TLOTR! In my opinion, it's much more intriguing that the The Fellowship and The Return. OK, I haven't finished The Return yet. But believe me, this one is the best. The beginning didn't thrill me that much, but I couldn't stop after I got past it. The new characters and settings made me so excited.I think the last half of The Two Towers is my favorite, because it has Gollum in it, and I was excited to hear about him again after The Hobbit. Eventually I started thinking in third person without realizing it. o_O It was scary..."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"As you open the book The Two Towers from the series The Lord of the Rings you will be fill with excitment, wonder, and suspence. As you read the book page to page you are going to be drawn to their adventures and you are going to fell their happiness and sadness.

As you reach the midle of the book the most enteresting events are going to happen in this story. When you reach the end you are probaly be left wondering what is going to happen next so you might want to read the last book fo the series, The Return of the King. The Two Towers is a really good book to read when you can. It is exciting so it will catch your attention. You are going to have a really good time reading the book."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I have all three films on the extended DVD edition, loved them, so I HAD to read the books!INTRODUCTION: The Lord of the Rings was released in the 1950's, and it took everyone by surprise. With many loveable characters, a great story, a great new fantasy world with many place to explore, and the rich, moving storytelling were nothing people have ever seen before. Now with the books, video games, fan clubs, and three great movies, LOTR is easily one of the best stories of all time.THE BASIC PLOT: (Contains spoilers, so beware.) The Fellowship has separated. Boromir has been slain by Orcs, Gandalf the Grey fell with the Balrog into the pits of Moria, and Merry and Pippin were kidnapped by the Uruk-Hai. Frodo and Sam, meanwhile, are heading to Mordor to cast the One Ring into the fires of Mount Doom.Like the first one, this story is divided into two parts (called Books.) Book III tells about Aaragorn, Legolas, and Gimli's encounter with the newly reincarnated Gandalf the White, their encounter with Theoden, king of Rohan, the fight at Helm's Deep, and their encounter with Saruman, the treacherous wizard. It also tells about how Merry and Pippin's escape, and encounter with Treebeard and the Ents of Fangorn.Book IV tells about Frodo and Sam's encounter with Gollum, the twisted creature with two egos, one being Gollum, the other being Smeagol, his original self, their encounter with Faramir, Boromir's brother, and their encounter with the evil spider Shelob.OPINONS: The Two Towers was an exciting read! Filled with great narrating and storytelling, interesting new characters, plenty of action, and most of all, detail. This is much more longer and better than the movie! J.R.R. Tolkien is one of the best authors ever!OVERALL: A must read. Make sure you read The Hobbit and the Fellowship of the Ring first, though!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"\\"The Return of the King\\" is a wonderful culmination to J.R.R. Tolkien's masterful \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy. Like the second installment, \\"The Two Towers,\\" it is split into two stories. The reader must wait until nearly halfway through the novel to pick up again with Frodo and Sam in Mordor. This manner of storytelling is not quite as successful as in the second book, particularly when Tolkien tries to line up events between the two story lines. The chapter about Faramir and Eowyn, although beautifully written, seems almost an afterthought, being totally out of the chronology. The battle between Aragorn and the Corsairs is weakened because it is told only as a recollection. And in one chapter, Tolkien drastically overuses the phrases \\"and lo!\\" and \\"for behold!\\".But these are minor quibbles. \\"Return of the King\\" is a worthy successor to the first two novels, and every bit as richly detailed. Tolkien's ear for language and eloquent handling of emotional situations combine to produce some of the most heartbreakingly beautiful sentences I have ever read.The Appendices comprise nearly a third of this book. One can peruse these for hours, revelling in the incredible detail of Tolkien's world.\\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is one of the greatest literary works of all time. It is worth reading over and over and over."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"In the last installment of the Lord of the Rings, the pivotal moments in the battle for Middle Earth occur. Pippin becomes a guard of the Citadel in the service of Denethor. Denethor, the steward of Gondor, becomes insane and commits suicide by fire. Merry is in the service of King Th&eacute;oden, the king of Rohan. Th&eacute;oden dies in the battle of Pelennor fields. Sam goes into the tower of Minas Morgul to save Frodo from his evil orc captors. Frodo and Sam venture into Mordor where they destroy the One ring. Aragorn is crowned king. Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin return home to find that Saruman has defiled their homeland, the Shire. Grima Wormtounge murders Saruman. Sam Gamgee marries his true love, Rosie Cotton. Bilbo, Frodo, and Gandalf go to the Grey Havens where they will go on a ship to the West, or Undying Lands.Out of the trilogy of the Lord of the Rings, the Return of the King is the most intense. It is usually the favorite book of those who read it. I find that this book has the most emotion for me because when I read it, I am there on the journey with them. I have grown to love each character and I cared what happened to them. When Frodo and Sam went into Mordor, I was there too. I have spoken with a girl who thought that Frodo was acting like a baby. I then realized that those who only have watched the movies do not have a compete understanding of the power of the One ring. In the movie, the essence of the One ring is lost. I believe that if a person really wants to understand the Lord of the Rings, they should read this book. The Return of the King is my favorite book. It is definitely a great book to read and I want everybody to read it. This book is a tragedy because Frodo is sacrificed in a way. My favorite quote is in the end of the Return of the King, where Frodo says, \\"But I have been too deeply hurt, Sam. I tried to save the Shire, and it has been saved, but not for me. It must often be so, Sam, when things are in danger: some one has to give them up, lose them, so that others may keep them\\" (382). This shows the sacrifice that Frodo gave to save the Shire. A sacrifice that was not properly acknowledged for it's worth. Sam is the only person in all of Middle Earth who truly knows of Frodo's suffering to save the Shire."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This adventure filled action-packed thriller is only #2 in this awesome trilogy.When the hobbit Frodo Baggins and his friends go out on a quest to destroy the ring of power they find that it isnt an easy road to travel.They find other companions to help him on his journey like gollum the power obsessed fiend that wants the ring for himself,but when he leads Frodo and his friend,Sam,he betrays them while going to destroy the ring in the fires of Mt.Doom.This quest is a difficult one for the hobbit and his friend.I give this book 5 stars because it kept me on the edge of my seat."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Rob Inglis does a wonderful job reading the whole series. All of the voices, singing the songs, nothing is left out."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Completely unabridged...so much so in fact that the audiobook itself is finished by the 10th cd and the rest are the appendices included in the print version.

The only downside is not knowing the correct pronunciation of some of the names or places in the story....and there are a lot of names.I've recommended this book to my friends and coworkers"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Like the first book, this one is just riveting. Tolken does a fabulous job drawing you in to the story."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This is the final book of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Although a little shorter than the previous two books, it does a wonderful job of bringing all the plot lines back together in an altogether satisfying conclusion. What I love about The Lord of the Rings is how Tolkien brings the unlikely Fellowship together and then has the members spin out into their own adventures- all in service to their original goal, but with each character fully realized and making their contributions in keeping with their own strengths and personalities. It is not the heroism of just one or two characters that make success possible- they are all absolutely essential in their own inestimable ways. Much subsequent fantasy that has followed in his wake falls woefully short of this wonderful mix of plot and personality. It all moves forward with a sense of inevitability that never feels forced. This is a true classic in every sense of the word, and while we all have favorite scenes in this or that particular book, they all work together as a whole. Everything is necessary, very little is gratuitous or drags the story out longer than is absolutely necessary- a trait of restraint that a number of subsequent popular fantasy writers should perhaps have taken more note of. This is even more astounding when you realize the depth with which Tolkien has realized the world of Middle Earth. You sense a real and rich background world, which is evident without being constantly spelled out. For those of you interested in this background material, I would strongly suggest reading the Silmarillian. Only then do you really understand how deep the linguistic and fictional history of Middle Earth actually is- the origin of Sauron's master, the master's fall and Sauron's apparent rehabilitation, the creation of the rings of power and the past history of man, elves, dwarfs and halflings that eventually leads to the story of the ring. Then go back and read The Lord of the Rings again with a whole new level of understanding and appreciation."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The book was a good read. The descriptions can get long and parts.But otherwise it was a good read."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Tolkien is one of the best fantasy writters and in this book you will discover why. The book is faster than its prequel and it makes you want to drop every thing else until you finish it"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"JRR Tolkien's second addition to the Lord of the Rings trilogy is full of interesting plot elements and archetypes that create a very riveting and interesting story. The story itself will have you wondering what is going to happen next. At times, the book may seem slow, but in the end, it's all worth it. That being said, you may have to be a fan of The Lord of the Rings to appreciate some of the elements of the story. Simply put, it's not for everybody, but anyone can learn to appreciate the various plot elements and archetypes the author utilizes.The story has some interesting plot elements. All of the characters, such as orcs, hobbits, ents, and dwarves, help to create a very fantasy-filled setting. The dark setting adds to an already interesting story. The dark setting highlights the struggles of two principle characters, Frodo and Sam, and how difficult it is for them to guard the Ring. The Ring itself is rather interesting because of its influence over others. In the bigger picture, Tolkien probably used it to show how desperate people can get to achieve what they want and desire. But simply put, all the elements of the plot somehow create a world filled with fantasy.Tolkien's use of archetypes is very effective in establishing the meaning to the story as well as a means of communicating with the reader. The author could be using the Ring as a symbol of addiction, because it seems that whenever someone comes across it, they become infatuated by it. The character Frodo can be seen as someone with free-will because for whatever reason, he never lets himself be overcome by the Ring's power. Tolkien also uses Mother Nature as a means of communicating to the audience. By using the ents and their leader, Fangorn, and the impending conflict with the Orcs of Isengard he adds meaning to the story by possibly suggesting that people respect Mother Nature or people will get what is coming to them.Overall, The Two Towers is very effective at creating a world of fantasy while putting some worthwhile plot elements into it."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The story itself is self explanatory, although the 3 volume story is wordy and less fun than the Hobbit.

Otherwise, it is one of the best books that I have ever read. I'll admit, the first 50 pages were kind of slow, but when Merry and Pippin meet Treebeard, everything is swept along from there. I liked how Frodo almost tamed Gollum, bringing him away from the lure of the Ring. Unfortunately, he doesn't quite succeed.

I am eternally in love with all of the characters, from the loyal and dependable hobbits, to the stern and proud dwarves and all in-between. In this land, Middle Earth, are enchanted forests, grueling mountains, vast wastelands and glorious fields, all of which are setting to a great tale. A tale of hope, darkness, joy, pain, love, hate, triumph and sorrow all interwoven with masterful skill by a masterful storyteller.

I highly, highly recommend all three books."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This wasn't a book that I chose to read, it was a book that I had to read.

Almost equal to C.S. Lewis (The Chronicles Of Narnia), and inferior only to Lewis Carroll, he has created a true masterpiece in The Lord Of The Rings trilogy. In fact, each book flows into the other so well that you don't really feel as if you've read a trilogy; you feel as if you've read a very long book with three excellent chapters.

The first half of the book was a little emotional, but it was worth it. When I finished the book, I was almost torn apart. The ending totally surprised me, not only because it wasn't something that could have been predicted, but because these wonderful characters: Frodo, Sam, Merry, Pippin, Aragorn, Legolas, Gandalf, and Gimli, were ripped away from me. They were my family for 5 months, and now they were gone with not another word. Though saying goodbye to the Trilogy was hard, I would never ever go back on those 5 wonderful months and not read the books. Especially since it's summertime, this is a great time to read these books. A little part of me still believes these wonderful characters are with me, and will never go away."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"What is there not to like of J.R.R. Tokien books? It is lots of fun, plenty of adventure, action, battles, humor, hobbits, men, elves, dwarves, et., etc., etc.Book two of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy, &quot;The Two Towers&quot;, ends with Gandalf the Wizard and Pippin the hobbit traveling to Minas Tirith. Also Frodo the Ring-bearing hobbit and his faithful friend, Sam, are separated in the land of Mordor, Frodo in the hands of the dreadful orcs.Now we go into book three, &quot;The Return of the King&quot;. It's up to Sam now to save his master Frodo. It's a good thing he has the Ring of Doom with him. When Sam finally is able to free Frodo, they must continue their quest to destroy the Ring, before the evil Sauron uses it to his own purposes, to cover all the lands with his Darkness. But Frodo is starting to weaken with the weight and power of the Ring. Will he be able to complete his quest? Meanwhile, King Theoden and his Rohan forces, along with Merry the hobbit, travel to Minas Tirith to help King Denethor fight off Sauron's forces of Men and Orcs. And Aragorn the Ranger (or is he...?), Legolas the Elf, Gimli the Dwarf, and the Rangers decide to go to Minas Tirith... by the Paths of Dead!A truly great conclustion to such a terrific series. J.R.R. Tolkien certainly made these books so interesting and realistic. You must read the Appendixes at the end of the book, it tells about all of the histories of Men, Dwarves, Elves, Hobbits, and more. Also gives timelines of the 2nd Age, 3rd Age, and more.One of my most favorite characters is Legolas the Elf, one important reason is because he is an Elf. Somehow Elves have always fascinated and interested me, with their mysterious, quiet but strong ways. I love how he and Gimli the Dwarf are the best of friends and how they're always together and inseparable. I also love Pippin the Hobbit, he's so cheerful, kind, but always seems to always get into trouble! Also I think that Faramir the Prince is also a good character. Son of the King Denethor, in the eyes of his father is unworthy because he is compared with his brother, Boromir, who had been killed.I can't honestly say which of the three books in the trilogy is the best. I strongly recommend you read all of the books, including the prelude, &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. I think that the J.R.R. Tolkiens are mostly for teenager and adults, since younger kids probably would find it a little too complicated and boring for them. Have fun reading &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy!

Tolkien, The Return of the King seizes you by the hand and guides you on a mystical journey filled with laughter, sadness, courage and some of the best descriptions ever in a book.As the hobbits Frodo and Sam continue their treacherous journey deep into the foul land of Mordor, their fellow members of the fellowship (of the ring) hasten to aid Minas Tirith, Gondor's chief city and defense against Mordor, from the bound to be invasion by Sauron, the evil Dark Lord of Mordor.Fate seems inevitable for Middle-earth, with Frodo and Sam being the last hope; to destroy the \\"one\\" ring of Sauron's power. To do this they must reach the heart of Morder, Mount Doom, and destroy the ring in the awesome \\"furnace\\" that once had created it, though the closer they get, the more powerful the ring becomes and Frodo's will starts to break down. Frodo and Sam must be wary of their furtive guide Gollum, who is the only one available through which they can find their way.Back in Gondor, things are looking very bleak until Aragorn, the newfound king, returns with an undead army to re-conquer Minas Tirith from Mordor's wicked army. In a last ditch effort to reach Mount Doom, Frodo and Sam stagger to the imposing mountain past orcs, Gollum who betrayed them, and numerous other hurdles in their quest. Gollum plays a vital role in the destruction of the ring in the end, and Sauron falls.In his third book of the series, Tolkien wonderfully concludes this magnificent story of fantasy and wonder. This is a very well written book, and I strongly recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I guess most of the people reading a review for this book must be LOTR fans; otherwise, why would they have bothered reading the first two? Keeping that in mind, I would say that &quot;Return of the King&quot; might be my favorite of the three. We are introduced to the land of Gondor, the last stronghold against the dark lord Sauron. There is naturally a great battle sequence in this book as the free peoples of the West defend the city of Minas Tirith from the winged Nazgul and Sauron's minions. We are introduced to some new characters, such as Denethor, the aging steward of Gondor, and the King of the Nazgul, who challenges Gandalf to a final dual. I don't want to give too much of the plot away, but I do think it's interesting that the fate of the ring is decided with nearly one hundred pages left in the story. The remaining chapters are devoted to following up on the various characters, and Tolkien does this nicely. He does not leave any loose ends; Aragorn, Gandalf, Frodo, Sam, Merry, Pippin, Legolas, Gimli, Eomer, Faramir, Eowyn, Arwen, Galadriel, Elrond, Bilbo, all of these characters are firmly situated at the end of the story. I also like how Tolkien follows the four hobbits back to the Shire, where they find out that things are not the same. He could have taken them on an amazing adventure and left it at that, but instead he lets them learn from their adventures to the benefit of the Shire. Although the outcome of the story is good, we are left feeling somewhat despondent, since the elves are departing and the &quot;third age&quot; is coming to an end. All in all, this trilogy is simply one of a kind; I don't think I'll ever again enjoy sci-fi or fantasy that doesn't bear the Tolkien label."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"What happens when destiny breaks up the fellowship?You will find out when you read the Two Towers.In this second part, the deeds of all the members of the company after the Fellowship was broken, are told.Frodo and his inseperable Sam sneak away towards Mordor, while Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas have to change their plans when they discover that Pippin and Merry have been kidnapped by orcs. These decisions that they make, take each character on its own path and the events that take place in this book really help in developing the complete tale.The whole story really takes shape in it. Loads of things start happening, and many different characters take center stage. There is a lot more action, and the plot takes a few unexpected twists.Unlike the first part (The Fellowship of the Ring), this second book actually does have a season finale ending! so make sure you have the Return of the King (3rd part) close by, because you will want to start reading it straight away!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Someone who has read and been enthralled by the first two volumes of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" might fear that J.R.R. Tolkien could not possibly have written an ending for his great fantasy epic that measures up to what has preceded it. Such a fear would be groundless. \\"The Return of the King\\" is a nearly perfect, fully satisfying conclusion to one of the best-loved stories of the twentieth century.Tolkien has been accused by some of not being good at character development, and yet by the time the reader reaches the opening chapters of \\"The Return of the King\\" he or she loves all the main characters of Tolkien's story and knows them as well as old friends. In my opinion, the explanation of this paradox is that Tolkien, in his presentation of his characters, is the antithesis of a writer like Charles Dickens (whose works I also love). The hobbits, Legolas, Gimli, Aragorn, and the rest of Tolkien's cast of characters do not burst with exaggerated personality the instant we meet them, as do Pecksniff, Scrooge and Micawber. Their personalities are revealed to us slowly and steadily as they experience their adventures, so that we come to know them gradually, as we would come to know real people. A reader glancing at almost any individual page in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" might think Tolkien's characters are not very distinctive or strongly characterized, yet the cumulative effect of the whole long story is to fix an indelible impression of each character in our minds. This process is completed in \\"The Return of the King,\\" in which the characters -- especially the hobbits -- reveal new levels of heroism and wisdom previously unguessed-at.All the themes that Tolkien has raised in the first two installments of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" -- the horror of war balanced against the necessity of just war, the dilemma of capital punishment, the senselessness of environmental destruction, the reality of both evil and good, cruelty and heroism -- are resolved and clarified in \\"The Return of the King\\" in a profound, often heartbreaking, and entirely satisfying way. The marvelous, complicated plot of this epic story is resolved in a powerful, surprising and yet logical climax. This climax is followed by several concluding chapters containing some more surprises -- both pleasant and unpleasant -- and some of the most beautiful writing you'll ever read. Indeed, the final chapter of all, which brings the story to an unforgettably bittersweet conclusion, is so perfectly written that one would not wish to change a single sentence or word.\\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is undoubtedly one of the best novels in any genre ever written by anyone, and Peter Jackson's adaptation of it into a movie trilogy is to be commended for attracting many new readers to Tolkien's book."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"One Ring to find themOne Ring to bring them allAnd in the darkness bind themEach generation of storytellers creates a new myth that grabs hold of the imagination of future generations for decades to come. In 1937, J.R.R Tolkien started such a myth with the publication of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. Despite the flaws of their creator and the displays of racial, class, and gender prejudices that is obvious to a modern audience, the books of the trilogy brilliantly recount the tale of Hobbits, Elves, Dwarves and Men and their battle with evil. It is in the portrayal of his heroes struggle against the baser forces that the author transcends his own shortcomings to pen what has become one of the best sagas of courage, nobility of spirit, and raw adventure.Although often referred to as a trilogy Tolkien first wrote &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; as a single novel consisting of six books plus appendices. Tolkien's publisher divided this massive book into three novels. The first novel, &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, was first published 1954. This book continues the story begun in &quot;The Hobbit&quot; when Bilbo Baggins, a Hobbit, found a shiny ring lost by a creature called Gollum.&quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; reintroduces the audience to Middle Earth and her occupants. Each of the nine characters that compose the fellowship of the ring represents a different race that lives in Middle Earth. There is Gandalf the gray, a mighty wizard; Legolas the noble elf; the men Aragon a ranger and future king of men and Boromir eldest son of the Stewart of Gondor; Gimli, a dwarf lord; and finally the Hobbits Frodo, the ring bearer; his gardener and friend Sam and his two younger cousins Meriadoc or Merry and Peregrin or Pip.This first book also tells the story of the creation of the Rings of Power by the Elven-smiths and how Sauron the Dark lord of Mordor forged the One Ring filling it with his own power so that he could bind all the other ring wearers to his will. Although defeated centuries ago and his ring lost, Sauron now awakes and seeks it. Bilbo's ring is soon discovered by Gandalf to be the One Ring. Soon it is decided that Frodo and his companions must enter Mordor and cast the ring into the very fires from which it was forged. This is the only way to destroy it.The fellowship ends with the fall of Gandalf to the fiery creature the Balrog, the death of Boromir at the hands of the evil Orcs who kidnap Merry and Pip and the decision of Frodo to continue on with only Sam to Mordor. Aragon, Legolas, and Gimli set of to rescue Merry and Pip from the Orcs.Book two, &quot;The Two Towers,&quot; chronicles the separate adventures of Aragon traveling with Legolas and Gimli, Pip and Merry fleeing from the Orcs meeting up with the Ents and reuniting with Gandalf and of Frodo and Sam moving toward Mordor. This book also introduces us to new characters: Faramir, younger brother of Boromir; the Ents, the treelike guardians of the woods; King Theoden of the Rohan, his nephew Eomer and his niece Eowyn. We are also reintroduced to the evil wizard Saruman and his city of Isengard and to the creature Gollum.Book three, &quot;The Return of the King,&quot; is the final novel in the trilogy and by far the best. This is an example of the author surpassing his own limitations as the characters thrive and grow. This novel opens as the shadow of Mordor grows. The companions of the Ring continue to follow separate paths all leading toward the same goal, the overthrow of Sauron. Aragon is now revealed as the heir of the ancient kings of the West. Along with Legolas, Gimli, and Merry, he has joined forces with king Theoden and the riders of Rohan to go to the aid of the mighty city of Gondor. If Gondor falls so will the rest of Middle Earth.Pip is now in the service of Denethor the steward of Gondor and father of Boromir and Faramir. He serves this harsh lord while awaiting the coming conflict. Gandalf gathers news and makes his own preparations for battle. Frodo and Sam after escaping the clutches of the giant spider Shelob continue their journey toward the Cracks of Doom and the destruction of the One Ring. All the while, Sauron's forces gather for the great battle for Middle Earth.When I first read these books as a child, they captured my imagination and have not completely let it go yet. Rereading them in my late teens and early twenties I became disappointed by the author's prejudices that marred some of the passages for me. However, as I grew older and reread them again I realized that those things that offended my sensibilities were mere reflections of the age and climate in which the author was raised. They were not essential parts of this tale of the continuing battle between good and evil.Tolkien set out to tell a story about the struggle between the world of nature represented by the Elves and the Hobbits and the age of the machine represented by Sauron and especially Saruman who destroyed entire forests to build his city and war machines. However, these stories transcend mere allegories about the struggle between man and machine or good and evil and become cosmic in their application when speaking of basic concepts such as good, evil, courage, friendship, loyalty and hope.I had first set out only to review the third book &quot;The Return of the King&quot;, because the movie will be out in December. However, I realized that for those of you who have not read the other books that it was essential to give back-story and this resulted in a review of all the books. I hope you find this review helpful and derive as much pleasure from reading these books as I did. The only thing I found confusing in the entire trilogy was the fact that the name of the evil overlord Sauron was so similar to that of Saruman the evil wizard. Fantasy and adventure lovers who have not yet read the books should do so."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"\\"Return of the King\\" is the worthy climax to J.R.R. Tolkien's epic saga, the fantasy that created the genre as we know it today. Now, as the blockbuster movie adaptation is over, many readers are checking out the dramatic story that ends Tolkien's masterpiece and life's work.The story opens where \\"Two Towers\\" left off. Gandalf has ridden to the city of Gondor with Pippin (partly to keep him out of trouble), where the forces of Mordor are attacking. There is upheaval in the city itself, as the steward of Gondor is going nuts. Merry pledges his service to King Theoden of Rohan, not knowing what is ahead for the king and his relatives. And Aragorn is seeking out allies to fight Sauron on a military scale, even if they can't defeat him unless the Ring is destroyed. His search will take him to tribes of forest-dwellers, to Gondor -- and even to summon an army of the dead.In Mordor, the unconscious Frodo has been captured by Sauron's orcs, and taken to the fortress of Cirith Ungol. Sam is desperate to free his friend, but knows that he can't take on an army, and that Frodo would want him to finish the quest. Sam manages to free Frodo from captivity, but they must still brave more dangers before they can come to Mount Doom, the only place where the Ring can be destroyed. As they travel Sam sees Frodo slipping further and further into the Ring's grasp. Will Frodo be able to destroy the Ring?Usually, the climax of an epic adventure is a disappointment. \\"Return of the King\\" succeeds in almost every way, wrapping up each individual storyline, one by one. The ending has a feeling of finality; this is one story that could never have a sequel; Tolkien shows that in a struggle against evil, there is no true \\"happy ending.\\" Even if the good guys win, there will still be scarring, and death, and haunting memories of what once happened. And even if a person survives, he will never be the same.This is the grimmest of the three books in this trilogy. Aside from Frodo's emotional deterioration, we also have Merry becoming almost catatonic after the battle with the Witch King, and Denethor's descent into suicidal madness. There is a lot less humor, though it is still there: Pippin and Merry both thinking about food, Gandalf's reaction when Pippin pledges his sword to Denethor, some choice witty comments of Frodo's in the last chapters, and Gimli's half-joking threats to axe Eomer if Eomer doesn't consider Galadriel the most beautiful woman in the world.Though a section of the book near the end descends into near-biblical prose, which changes post-Gondor, Tolkien does not waver in his ability to evoke emotion. One of the most touching scenes in the book is when Sam finds Frodo naked, unconscious and being beaten by an orc. Others include Merry's farewell to Theoden, Eowyn's slaying of the Witch-King, and of course the bittersweet final scene.Frodo is almost unrecognizable in parts of this book. The bright, naive young hobbit of the first book has been worn down by the pressure of the Ring, to the point where he seems to be only a pale shadow of himself. As he grows increasingly attached to the Ring, we even see him doing what seems unimaginable: threatening Sam with a dagger. Yet these actions make chilling sense, even when Frodo recovers his self-control only a moment later. It's a devastating demonstration of the hold the Ring has on him; he tries to resist it while knowing that he's falling too far into its grasp. When he lapses into depression and nihilism, readers will wonder if he can actually give it up.Sam has come a long way from the shy young hobbit who couldn't say a word around the High Elves. This book has him chasing orcs with Sting, carrying Frodo physically through Mordor, fending off Gollum, and acting as the ultimate pillar of strength for his crumbling friend right to Mount Doom. Merry is exposed firsthand to the horrifying consequences of war, and Pippin moves past his initial flakiness in an effort to be a serious warrior. Aragorn breaks completely from the mold of rugged ranger and into the new status as a king, leading armies (both living and dead) without flinching.As far as the supporting cast goes, Legolas and Gimli assist as well; their friendship grows deeper, even as Legolas falls completely in love with the sea. Gollum's degenerate journey remains intertwined with Frodo's, even though he betrayed the hobbits in the previous book; and the icily passionate war-maiden Eowyn affects the War of the Ring in a stunning way that nobody could have predicted.The story doesn't really end on the last page; for more background, especially on Aragorn and Arwen, readers should also read the appendices at the end of the book. Another good addition is \\"The End of the Third Age,\\" in which the unpublished epilogue of LOTR can be found. Though this is probably not canonical, it nicely concludes the story and is a heartwarming look at what happens in the years following LOTR.It's difficult, once the story has finished, to accept that one has to say goodbye to Middle-Earth and its enchanting inhabitants. But as Gandalf says, \\"I will not say: do not weep; for not all tears are an evil.\\""},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Journey continues... 5 starsThis book starts off exactly where, &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring,&quot; (see my review) ends. The Nine Walkers of Boromir, Aragorn, Gandalf, Gimli, Legolas, Pippin, Merry and the Ring-bear Frodo set out from Rivendell. After their leader and guide fell into the abyss in Moria (an ancient palace of the Dwarves in the mountains), Aragorn became their leader.After emerging from the mountains, and passing through the land of Lorien, the Company faced a choice. Should they go to Mordor, where Frodo must go to destroy the Ring, the all-powerful instrument of evil and corruption or travel to Minis Tirith (Tower of the Guard) capital of the Gondor, a nation of Men who are at war with Mordor and its evil ruler Sauron.The Hobbits Sam and Frodo disappear and depart for Mordor. The other two Hobbits (Merry and Pippin) are taken captive by Orcs, despite being defended by Boromir, who is killed in their defence.In the first half of, &quot;The Two Towers,&quot; the tale of what happened to Pippin, Merry, Legolas, Gimli and Aragorn is related. In the second half of, \\"The Two Towers,\\" the tale of what happened to Frodo and Sam is related. Within the book, I much prefer the first section of it. The reunion of the Hobbits with Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas is one of my favorite moments in the book.In some ways, whenever I undertake to read, \\"The Lord of the Rings,\\" I dread the second section of, \\"The Two Towers.\\" Personally, I do no appreciate the pain-staking description of every mountain, rock and flower; I keep waiting for some actual dialogue or action to happen. Tolkien obviously had a vivid, EXTREMELY detailed imagination for he invented every single part of his fictional world of Middle-Earth to be believable. There is a history of behind all the races and some of the races have their very own languages.The problem that Tolkien may have run into in his epic work is that he lost something in attempting to achieve the grand scale he sought to produce. His heavy use of allusions to persons and events that the reader knows nothing of start off as evocative and then begins to get annoying. However, in terms of good epic length fantasy literature, \\"The Lord of the Rings,\\" started it and it is probably one of the best novels of the 20th century. One last note, remember, Tolkien originally wrote the story for his own enjoyment, he did not envision millions of people in dozens of languages reading his work."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"&quot;The Two Towers,&quot; the second part of Tolkien's &quot;The Lord of the Rings,&quot; delivers on the promise and potential of epic-scale action and adventure carried over from the cliffhanger ending of &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring.&quot; With the dispersal of the Fellowship, Tolkien takes a different narrative tact in the second part of the Ring saga. The Fellowship now in three units - Frodo and Sam; Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas; Merry and Pippin - Tolkien deals with each unit separately, preferring for the sake of unity to relate the fortunes of each unit for long stretches. Herein is the great triumph of Part 2 - the development of character and involvement with each that the segmenting of the Fellowship allows. Here we get depth and feeling, along with high action and truly epic scope.&quot;The Two Towers&quot; begins with the aftermath of Boromir's attack on Frodo in an attempt to wrest the One Ring from him. The Fellowship disbands - Frodo and Sam leave to try to destroy the Ring on their own, Merry and Pippin try to find them, only to be captured by Orcs, and Gimli, Legolas, and Aragorn attempt to track down Merry and Pippin. The apparently dead Gandalf reappears to the third party, stronger and more committed to the goal than ever. The split action of the novel, with regard to the title, concerns the ways that the members of the Fellowship deal with the major sources of crisis facing Middle-earth: the ambitious wizard Saruman at the Tower of Orthanc in Isengard and the Dark Lord, Sauron at the Tower of Barad-dur in Mordor.One cannot get too excited about the virtues of &quot;The Two Towers.&quot; The relationships between the characters are so finely rendered - for my part, the job that Tolkien does in developing Merry, Pippin, Gimli, and Legolas is magical in itself. Merry and Pippin are underestimated and undervalued by everyone, including themselves. The illumination and discussions of their doubts, fears, and modest desires against the spectacular backdrop of millennial conflict is so understated, that the two hobbits actually bring a sense of prosaic normalcy to Tolkien's epic fantasy. Gimli the dwarf and Legolas the elf, members of long-antagonized peoples, thrust together by the common goal of the Fellowship, is another fascinating pairing. The contrast in their characters and the process by which they become bosom friends is lovely to behold and offers one of the great homosocial relationships I've encountered in English literature. In both cases, throughout &quot;The Two Towers,&quot; Tolkien continually privileges the individual over the national, an approach which forces war and conflict to appear as it should, as an unnatural and horrific evil in the world.The minor characters add colour and vibrant life to &quot;The Two Towers.&quot; Good characters, like the melancholy Ents; evil characters, like the eternally-infighting Orcs; and ambivalent characters, like Wormtongue and Smeagol - all contribute to the development of the primary characters, while Tolkien carefully allows these minor figures the dignity of their own histories, actions, conversations, and fleshing out. All of this adds to the complexity of the Ring saga and shows more of the intricate social and even ecological effects that the anticipated War of the Ring will have on Middle-earth.&quot;The Two Towers&quot; is literally and figuratively the heart of the Ring saga. Rich in content, detail, and action, here, Tolkien's epic vision is most fully realized. Choice is a major theme of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; as a whole, and, again, in the many individual, minute choices made by the characters throughout Part 2, Tolkien allows us to see how the fate of people and nations can hang on the most seemingly insignificant choices. In the scope of an epic, Tolkien stresses the importance of the individual and of tolerance and patient judgment in decision making. Overall, my favourite of the three parts of &quot;The Lord of the Rings.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The second volume of Tolkien's epic trilogy never even wavers. If anything, it seems steadier and more controlled than \\"Fellowship of the Ring,\\" as several characters become more central and the plot focus widens to envelop all of Middle Earth. It suffers from a bit of sequelitis in places, but the overall book is just as enthralling as the first.Aragorn finds that Merry and Pippin have been abducted rather than killed -- for what reason, no one knows. Frodo and Sam have left on their own. So Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli race to find the orcs and retrieve the hobbits, but are stopped by the fierce Riders of Rohan, and then by an old and dear friend: Gandalf, who has been resurrected in the new form of a White wizard. Elsewhere, Merry and Pippin must use all of their wits to escape the orcs, and then find a strange band of allies that no one could have hoped for.Meanwhile, Frodo and Sam head into Mordor -- with an eerily familiar figure, Gollum, following them. Frodo subjugates Gollum, forcing him to swear on \\"the precious\\" that he won't harm him. In return, Gollum promises to guide the two hobbits through Mordor, straight to Mount Doom. But the Ring is weighing more heavily than ever on Frodo, and is starting to reassert its old sway on Gollum...One of the most noticeable changes in this book is the shift of focus. \\"Fellowship\\" was Frodo-centric, since the narration revolved around him, as did all the events and thoughts. But with the breaking of the Fellowship, the narration falls into three categories: Frodo and Sam; Merry and Pippin; Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli. This triple style allows individuals to shine more brightly, when they are called on to do more than hike with Frodo.Tolkien also presented a wider view of Middle-Earth in general. While the slow slog through Mordor doesn't really tell or show readers much -- aside from what a hellhole Sauron is the middle of -- it's shocking to see the the effects of the orcs, Saruman and Sauron on places such as Gondor and Rohan.Changes can be seen in Frodo even in this book, and which become more pronounced in the third book of the trilogy, \\"Return of the King.\\" He becomes sadder and more introspective, and the Ring's growing hold on him can be glimpsed at times. Aragorn is also changing. He is no longer merely the rugged outcast Ranger, but displays the hints of a future great king, if he can only get to his throne.Merry and Pippin also change: these two innocent young hobbits have to suddenly Sam is more promiment in this book, as Frodo's friend and personal pillar of strength.But where Tolkien really outdid himself is Gollum. Gollum returns, in a substantially different state. Oh, he's still addled and addicted to the Ring, but he displays a dual love/loathing for the Ring, a weird affection for Frodo (who, from his point of view, is probably the only person who has been kind to him), and displays a Ring-induced multiple-personality syndrome. Very rarely can bad guys elicit the sort of loathing and pity from the reader that Gollum does.One noticeable aspect of this book is friendship. When the Fellowship sets out from Rivendell, virtually everyone is a stranger, with the exception of the hobbits. However, in this book we get our view of how much Sam loves Frodo and wants to help him. Sam is fully aware of how much Frodo needs emotional support, and he's quite willing to be a pillar of strength for his friend. We see Gimli and Legolas's affection for Merry and Pippin; and Legolas's willingness to kill Eomer if Eomer hurts Gimli shows how far this Elf and Dwarf have come.This book is substantially darker than \\"Fellowship.\\" Frodo is starting to stumble under the weight of the Ring, and other characters die or are seriously hurt. The scene where Pippin's mind is trapped by Sauron is a very disturbing one, as is a violent and saddening scene late in the book. But there is also some wry humor: Gandalf's joke as he hears Saruman throttling Grima Wormtongue, Legolas's snippy comments about pipeweed as Gimli and the hobbits smoke up a storm, and Sam's debate with Gollum about whether they should cook the rabbits.Tolkien's second \\"Lord of the Rings\\" novel is a thrilling fantasy adventure, exploring more of his invented world than \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\" did. \\"The Two Towers\\" starts heading into darker territory, and will leave readers panting for more."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"In an epic conclusion to the Lord of the Rings series by J.R.R. Tolkien, The Return of the King seizes you by the hand and guides you on a mystical journey filled with laughter, sadness, courage and some of the best descriptions ever in a book.As the hobbits Frodo and Sam continue their treacherous journey deep into the foul land of Mordor, their fellow members of the fellowship (of the ring) hasten to aid Minas Tirith, Gondor's chief city and defense against Mordor, from the bound to be invasion by Sauron, the evil Dark Lord of Mordor.Fate seems inevitable for Middle-earth, with Frodo and Sam being the last hope; to destroy the \\"one\\" ring of Sauron's power. To do this they must reach the heart of Morder, Mount Doom, and destroy the ring in the awesome \\"furnace\\" that once had created it, though the closer they get, the more powerful the ring becomes and Frodo's will starts to break down. Frodo and Sam must be wary of their furtive guide Gollum, who is the only one available through which they can find their way.Back in Gondor, things are looking very bleak until Aragorn, the newfound king, returns with an undead army to re-conquer Minas Tirith from Mordor's wicked army. In a last ditch effort to reach Mount Doom, Frodo and Sam stagger to the imposing mountain past orcs, Gollum who betrayed them, and numerous other hurdles in their quest. Gollum plays a vital role in the destruction of the ring in the end, and Sauron falls.In his third book of the series, Tolkien wonderfully concludes this magnificent story of fantasy and wonder. This is a very well written book, and I strongly recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"What can I say? After over 65 years, the Lord of the Rings trilogy is still the ultimate fantasy epic. I won't go on and on gushing in praise. I will just note one of the brilliant literary devices that Tolkien uses that sets this book apart from so much other fantasy work. Tolkien weaves a complex narrative with many characters and plot twists, but also manages to set up brilliant parallels between them. For example we see two leaders (Theoden and Denethor) who face strikingly similar challenges, but Tolkien shows them responding differently. The former leads his men against evil, while the latter is cold and despairs. This use of paralleling gives the book so many layers and adds lasting value. Indeed, it's no wonder people can read this book many times over and not get bored. While the Peter Jackson movies are great, it doesn't - and can't - capture all of the nuance in the book. If you haven't read it yet, you're in for a treat."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I listen to a lot of books on tape. Every once in a while I come across a narrator who is perfectly suited to the work. I don't mean a narrarator who has a good voice, I mean a narrator whose voice brings the story alive. Rob Inglis is such a narrator in all three books in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Each character is clearly identifiable by his uncanny ability produce dozens of distinct voices. I've listened to other audio versions of Tolkien's works. Those narrarated by Rob Inglis are the only ones that I've found worth the purchase."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"'The Return of The King', by JRR Tolkien is the continuing adventures of the remaining members of the Fellowship as they draw together to meet the coming of the War of the Ring.

Yet even as those in Minas Tirith struggle to surviv, and Rohan musters for war, Frodo and Sam draw closer and closer to the end of the journey. Yet in the darkness of Mordor the ring grows stronger, and in the gathering darkness Frodo has begun to fall to its influence.RD Williams, author of 'The Lost Gate'"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This is the second book of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. It really kept me reading. I learned more about Frodo and Same and their quest to destroy the ring. While reading this book I could easily imagine the events. If you enjoyed the first book, The Fellowship of the Ring, you should read this book. There wasn't any part of the book I didn't like."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This book is an amazing credit to all literature everywhere. The style that Tolkien uses is astounding in detail thus making you feel almost part of this epic adventure. With the twists and turns that heroes take to proceed onward through their journeys. It is astounding how he makes it able to fallow the path of multiple characters at the same time yet keep it from becoming to confusing. The way words are placed in each sentence with extreme care as not to make the plot line any more confusing is very well done, this makes the story well written and an amazing novel. The lord of the rings: the two towers sucks the reader into it's plot and keeps them there until the book is done. This is one of the few books that has actually kept my attention all the way through the book not letting me put it down by any means. The flow of the book makes you want to become one of the races of middle earth and take on the roll as one of the adventurers to fight the evil forces of Mordor and cast away the ring of power. This book is the second one in the trilogy of The Lord of the rings and is the best written of the three. The two towers helps define the meaning of and epic adventure through the hardships and challenges that the characters must face the complete their task at hand and the internal conflicts within them selves."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This second installment in teh LOTR trilogy is without a doubt my favorite. Particularly the first part of the book in which Aragon, Gimli, and Legolas track down Merry and Pippin, and the Ents awake to defeat Saruman's orcish forces. This is just top notch fantasy that doesn't slow down much at all from cover to cover, keeping the reader turning pages.While I liked the first movie maybe a little more than the first book, I thought the second book was better than the movie. There are lots of good parts in the book that are left out (Faramir and the elaphaunt) or just changed completely (Sam's use of the ring of power) that change the overall feel of the story in a way that takes away from some of its attactivness. I was actually surprised to find just how much liberty the makers of the movie took in altering the story."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"In this trilogy focusing on medieval ages and sorcery,the fellowship has one final battle against Saruman and his massive orc army.Can Aragon,Gimli,and Legolas fend off Saruman's army,while Frodo and Sam,led by Golem,have one final chance to get the ring in Mount Doom,and find out if Golem really has a good side or not?If you like action as much as I do than this is the book for you.It is adventurous as it gets. You wouldn't be able to take your eyes off of this marvelous book once you start reading it."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"A! Elbereth Gilthoniel!So we stood on the quay with Sam and Merry and Pippen and watched Frodo and Bilbo sail away with Gandalf, Elrond and Galadriel, at the end of The Return of the King. For my son's second time and my thirteenth or fourteenth. And when I reached the last sentence and the trilogy we'd been using for bedtime stories for most of his seventh year was over, he said he wanted to start all over again with The Hobbit. Much as I love Tolkien's melodic prose, particularly his descriptions of the landscape in the turn of the seasons, reading him aloud takes some work. But there's a definite payoff. I think I finally got the names down to where I could pronounce them as J. R. R. intended. And it's undeniable that my son got a far-away dreamy look listening to these adventures that he didn't even with Narnia and Treasure Island. Then there is the reward of his admission, the other day, several years later, that despite enjoying the movies, which he had watched over and over again, he'd decided that he really preferred the books."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I got the whole \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy for my husband woh loved the movies. He has truly enjoyed listening to the audiobooks and so have I. The reader is excellent and provide different voices for each character. I would compare the reader to Stephen Fry of the UK version for the Harry Potter audiobooks. These books were definatly worth the money."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I didn't enjoy this as much as the first part of the trilogy, but it was still pretty good. Strangely divided, though. The events of this book take place simultaneously in two locations, and rather than skipping back and forth, Tolkien for some reason tells all of what happens in one place, then jumps to the other parallel story, occasionally giving chronological markers -- while such and such was happening in the great battle to the north, yada yada. Still, a good, and obviously crucial part of a great overall story."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The third book in the Lord of the Rings trilogy (which was never meant by Tolkien to be a trilogy, but three separate books seem a lot more manageable than one 1008-page volume). I liked this one better than the second book, but not as much as the first. I thought that, like in the second book, the way Tolkien divided the narrative was weird. Rather than switching back and forth between two simultaneous stories, he tells all of one, then all of the other. Still, that's a little nit-pick for an epic of this magnitude. I'm not sure if The Lord of the Rings as a whole would make my personal top 10 list, but it definitely deserves a spot among the greatest novels ever written, if not for the writing then for the sheer imagination and ambition of the project. I've never read a book that so convincingly creates an entire world. It's no wonder this is considered to be the definitive fantasy. There were times when I wanted to live in Middle Earth and other times when I set the book down and felt like I had been in Middle Earth for a while. An incredible escape, and well worth the time it takes to read it."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"im sorry but there is nothing i can say about this that hasent been said in the 100000 reviews for this book on amazon! BEST BOOK EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!I LOVE YOU TOLKIEN !!!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"As all things end, so does Tolkien's revered Ring trilogy. In this concluding volume, the surviving Company, minus Sam and Frodo, reunite to make a last stand against the inhuman darkness which has ushered forth from Mordor to swallow the world. Gandalf, resurrected now as the White Wizard, rallies the combined armies of Rohan and Gondor, Aragorn reveals his true nature and is proclaimed the returned king, and beneath the searching eye of the Evil One, a pair of lowly hobbits, exhausted and nearly out of hope, continue on toward a fateful rendezvous in the infernal core of Mt. Doom. Heroism, loyalty, courage, and determined resistance to the powers of oppression are all themes triumphantly proclaimed in this novel, and there are scenes inside The Return of the King which stand so memorable they endure in the brain throughout a reader's lifetime. Many writers would be unable to end such a monumental series on a note of triumph, but somehow J.R.R. Tolkien achieves the nearly impossible and herein delivers his best work of all."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"\\"The Return of the King\\" completes \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" history as two books with the first reporting the assault by Sauron's evil forces against his enemies and the final book following the covert mission of Frodo and Samwise the Hobbits. The author successfully combines individual emotion and vast warfare in a dark yet delightful fantasy.Various fascinating events transpire, Gandalf finally displays awesome powers, King Theoden of the Rohirrim becomes a stronger secondary character, and even Merry and Pippin the Hobbits become independently formidable. The storyline shows every character having an important part and making heart-wrenching sacrifices to ensure a victory in the fight against evil.\\"The Return of the King\\" resumes the divided separate group plotlines from the original Fellowship instead of intermixing them down a chronological perspective. The method might be confusing but minor references and a moderately short time span helps organize the proceedings. Not only does the reader comprehend the lasting effects of the epic battle years later, presenting a thorough account of actions and the consequences, but also discovers the enormous depth into the genealogy and language inside the different cultures in the appendices.The collection I own has \\"The Hobbit\\" along with all books of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" and contains inside the final novel a comprehensive appendices and index, the ultimate standard for any author wishing to compile a comprehensive series. As with about every film-based novel, I would suggest at least not watching the movie prior to reading the book if not forgoing the movie (although it is one of the greatest movies of all time) thereby leaving the story entirely to the imagination.I highly recommend the book collection to any fan of the fantasy genre.Thank you."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Merry and Pippin have been captured by orcs and Aragorn, Gimili, and Legalos are out to save them.

It's a fun and exciting book that will entertain anyone who reads it. But it lacks something that the movies really did a good job in. the movies went into more depth and details of the characters. Which isn't something you expect a movie to do. But the book left me hangin' on some of the charcters. The only character that truly gets your attention every time he appears is Gandalf. My reccomdations: don't read this book if you have high expectations from the movie. I'm not discouraging you from reading it but I'm just warning you. It's an intruiging book that will captivate you until the very end. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I read a very good book and that book was The Lord of The Rings The Two Towers.There were two things I liked in the book and that was they how Leglas shot two arrows at his enemies. Then the last thing I liked was when Gandalf was coming over the hill for Aragon with an army. I think this would be good book for everyone to read."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This review is in reference to what Jacobs (see review below) and others have written. I have not listened to this audio narration, but I have read the books. It's true that the story goes a little overboard when it comes to details. But it's important for everyone to realize that Tolkien was a linguist. He was most interested in languages, not fantasy. He had invented a completely new language (Elvish) and wanted to share that language with the world. Plus, he was very interested in what kinds of songs &amp; stories different races would have. The Lord of the Rings was the best way he saw to present his new language and songs to the world, to wrap it up within a story. He researched ancient myths and runes from countries around the world and put them all together to create a world called Middle Earth. So if the story seems to go too slowly for you, just remember that it was NOT Tolkien's aim to tell a great fantasy story. His primary aim was to share with the world the songs/stories of the different races, the Elvish language, and his invented Hobbit race. Naturally, that means that he'll go a little overboard describing every little detail about Hobbits and Elvish. Tolkien was surprised by the big response his trilogy recieved, and even more surprised by how many people tried to make his story into something it wasn't intended to be.Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the world he created and I enjoy how he brought so many old, mythological creatures to life. If it wasn't for Tolkien, the modern fantasy genre wouldn't have taken off the way it did. If it wasn't for Tolkien, the Dungeons and Dragons world (Forgotten Realms, Dragonlance, etc. books) wouldn't have existed. In fact, if it wasn't for Tolkien, many of our modern fantasy novels wouldn't be full of the dwarves, elves, and other creatures in the form they are in now. All those things took off because of the hype over his trilogy during the 1960's. I'm very grateful for the impact his story had. It's just important when you go back and read his trilogy to realize that his aim wasn't to cause any of that. His main aim was not to tell a good story. His main aim was to teach everyone what he had invented (namely, the languages and folklore of the races). I know this because Tolkien himself said so many times. Don't go into the story expecting something different."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Return of the King is an exciting, fast paced, novel. The novel is about the a man named Aragorn and how he is the riteful heir to the throne of a mighty kingdom, and a hobbit, or halfling, who is on a quest to destroy the One Ring of Power. A dark lord named Sauron aimes to destroy all of human kind and rule Middle-earth. He forged the One Ring of Power, and with it his disires can be filled. The race of mankind fights to destroy it, while Sauron's army of orcs, evil creatures born out of the ground; Nazgul, kings of old who were decived; and evil men; fight to recover the One Ring of Power.The Return of the King is a real page turner. J.R.R. Tolkien, the author, has created an entire world, and history in order to write this book. Not only did Tolkien write all three of the books in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, but also a 100+ page appendix. I think this is a wonderful book."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Ok to start off im am well aware that we all have our own opinions as far as well everything, but bashing this book is only the passtime of those addicted to something not legal in the united states. hmm... where to begin, how about with the first review 1 star &quot;i didnt like this book i thought it was scary&quot; what the hell is wrong with you tell you what pull the covers over your head and turn the nighlight up so you can read you pop up books. ok next victim stated this book was boring had cheesy characters and is boring read wheel of time. Man i dont know what your on but it must be good you see all those cheesy character are the basis for all the other characters in pretty much every single fantasy ever written are based on what tolkien wrote. a dwarf is always the the way tolkien described it in this trilogy, same goes for elves wizards and halflings. Oh yea the story is mundane and cheesy as well. man oh man gotta love the simple minded. you see god knows the whole fantasy setting does seem to blend from book to book, but when tolkien wrote this masterpiece it wasn't and do you know why, because tolkien created the entire fantasy genre with this cheesy storyline. every other fantasy nad i mean every other fantasy you read you can thank tolkien for because if not for him modern fantasy writers would have to go through all the trouble he did of creating an imaginary world with divers races and settings, also a few languages, oh and like i said tha basis that modern fantasy writers use for there characters, also creating a few thousand years worth of history. So in short read the wheel of time excellent fantasy, as are many others but try to remember who put all the work into it because all of them are just this book regurgitated, sad but true"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Return of the King is a great climax to the greatest novel ever written! Although I must say sometimes it is a tedious read, but it is still a great book. Just the fact that the history is just like it was all real, is amazing enough! The battle scenes don't go into great detail, because Tolkien writes it in such a way that you imagine what happens, he just gives it a base. The ending is truly moving, the book is definately a MUST read."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The hardest part of being in the middle of a trilogy is its has no beginning and no ending. But was that a problem when you have the first and the third at hand?Really its not a matter for me as a reader even the writer JRR Tolkein at one time in his life writing this book feel tired and hopeless.The complexity of this novel is very clear in this second installment. The characters are not confused anymore and the journey is somehow sickening in somepart ( Frodo and Sam with ashes and irritatingly routine meals, lembas) and interesting in the others (Helm's Deep and Sam as a hero)."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Tolkien out does the first book of his series The Fellowship of the Ring with his second book The Two Towers. This book could stand on its own without a prequel or a sequel. The level the writing takes on is phenomenal. This book concentrates more on the travels of the other companions in the fellowship than on Frodo. Several mishaps and adventures come about as the Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas track their kidnapped comrades Merry and Pippin. More than a &quot;cult classic&quot;, this book serves a deeper purpose; it sheds light on the exploits of humanity. It shows the darkness and the unity man posses within himself. The story picks up with the escape of Frodo and the capture of Merry and Pippin. It includes the return of Gandolf and the battle of the Ents at Isengard. Man begins to unite in the land of Rohan. This portion of the epic ends with the Frodo and Sam nearing Mordor after a near deadly encounter with Shelob and the rest of the Fellowship trying to unite all the lands of men together for battle with Sauron."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Hello fellow readers! You have ventured into this page to read my view on the lord of the rings: the Two Towers. Let me start off with saying that the movie by New Line CInema is out December 18 in theaters. ok.The Two Towers is a continuation of the first book, the Fellowship of the ring.It starts off where The FOTR ended, Boromir is dead in Aragorns Arms(sorry if ya haven't read that yet!),Legolas and Gimli are running around fighting the last of the orcs, Merry and Pippin are captured, Frodo is in the Lothlorien boat, and Samwise in running through the forest, trying to find Frodo. Sam does find Frodo and convinces him that Frodo needs Sam there with him, and Frodo, being very fond of Sam, decides thats the best thing to do right now. They both get in the boat and paddle over to The east shore and start there treck to Mordor. Meanwhile, Aragorn is in a very tight spot. He could either follow Frodo and Sam, leaving Merry and Pippin to torment, or follow the Uruk-Hai and leave Frodo and Sam very much unprotected. In the end he decides for the better, that he, Legolas, and Gimli should go and track down Merry and Pippin. So renued with vigar and spirit, they set off at a fast pace. Day after day they run until they reach the plains of Rohan. They see then that even though they are running as fast as possible, with no rests, the Uruk-Hai are very far away and are running through the nights. Even though, they keep running. The hobbits are alive they find, but before they can catch up to them, they are barred by the Riders of Rohan. The Hunt continues until they find themselves in the fangorn forest, where they meet a very special friend, Gandalf! There is alway a big battle in all of the Lord of the Rings books, and in the Two Towers, it is the battle of Helm's Deep. In the second part of the book, it goes back to Frodo and Sam, and Smeagol, or Gollum as we know him. Gollum has offered to lead Frodo and Sam through Mordor safely, or will he? Frodo doesn't know it, but Gollum has more planned out than he thinks...Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I would recommend the book Lord of the Rings: Return of the King for people who would read it for fun. I would not recommend this book for some one who is reading it for school because it is hard to journal about or to summarize. This book is for people who like fantasy and books with a large vocab. This book is about a group of people who are trying to get to Mordor to destroy an evil ring."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers is the second book in the J.R.R Tolkein Classic Trilogy, Lord of The Rings.The Book starts at the ending of the first book in the Lord Of The Rings, Fellowship of the Ring, when The Fellowship splits and goes different paths. The hobbits Frodo and Sam go to Mordor to finish the quest of destroying the Ring Of Power. As they pass towards Mordor, Frodo and Sam capture Gollum, who has been stalking after them for the ring.They force him to be their guide to Mordor. As they pass into the edge of Mordor, They go to Cirith Ungol to take a hidden route though the mountains. Gollum tricks Frodo and Sam by taking them to the Shelob, a giant spider. They sneak through its cave and Sam kills the Shelob. But Frodo was poisoned and taken by Orcs to a guardhouse.As Sam and Frodo are on their quest in Mordor, Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas are tracking The Orcs who stole Merry and Pippin. The Orcs are killed by Riders of The Mark. Merry and Pippin escape and meet Faragorn,part of large living tree race known as the Ents. Faragorn and the other ents attack Sauraman and defeat him with the help of the Riders of The Mark and Gandalf after their battle at Helm's Deep. Aragorn , Gimili, and Legolas rejoin Merry and Pippin and head to Tithral Minias to aid Gondor from Mordor's Attacks.I thought that this was a very enjoyable book and I would read it again. The book added many interest creatures and charaters that made J.R.R Tolkein's series famous such as the Ents.I liked how it showed the charaters progression as they passed on their separate quest and conflicts and how they fit into the bigger picture. Each charater developed a distinct personality and showed how they changed from the beginning of the book to the end. The problem with the book was if you had not seen the movie or read the first book , you would be completly lost. At times the book was confusing but eventully it made sense.I think this was a very enjoyable book and should be read with the rest of the Lord of the Rings trilogy."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Consider, if you will, an imposing book so flawed that it is filled with uber-heroes, beatific heroines, irredeemable villains, archaic diction, puffed up prose, overwrought melodrama, entire races consigned to evil, and motivations that are told rather than shown. I am thinking, of course, of... \\"War and Peace\\", or perhaps it is \\"Les Miserables\\". Then again, it may be \\"The Odyssey\\", or \\"The Merchant of Venice\\". Come to think of it, this is a pretty accurate description of the Bible.As its detractors so tediously note, \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" has flaws. However, these critics get so absorbed in picking their nits they fail to notice that, like its fellow classics, this work's pre-eminence renders its flaws inconsequential. If one is intent on fault-finding, faults one will find. But one is thereby blinded to the greater glory.\\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is indeed one of the most glorious of literary classics. It attains a majestic tone matched only by a handful of its peers: \\"Le Morte d'Arthur\\" perhaps, or \\"Paradise Lost\\", where the dimension is epic, and the settings, characters and themes pass into the collective consciousness as archetypes. Such archetypes are not formed by chance; they occur only when a creation taps into universal truths and the most essential elements of human nature.Middle Earth, the One Ring, Hobbits and Wraiths, the quest not imposed but willingly undertaken, strength not of body but of will, courage not of battle but of endurance, the smallest in stature carrying the heaviest of burdens and doing the greatest of deeds: these images and themes have passed into the common culture. How we respond to these archetypes depends on the person we are.\\"The Lord of the Rings\\" offends by turns: effete intellectuals because it is unashamedly mainstream, the attention challenged because it is lengthy, and jaded cynics because it wears its heart on its sleeve. If you hold membership in any of these clubs, then this book is not for you. Like the best classical literature, this work demands qualities in the reader that are sadly now out of fashion: things like tolerance for detail, a sense of history, a linguistic ear, a love of epic grandeur and an appreciation for literary convention. Most of all, it requires an innocence and an exuberance that runs counter to the existential nihilism of the day. There are no angst-ridden antiheroes in Tolkien, no moral malaise, no self-absorbed ghouls paralysed by the futility of existence. If you must have these things, then look to Michael Moorcock and his Elric sagas. What you find in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is Tolkien's rejection of such thinking.Ultimately, Tolkien's creation is for the life affirming. It comes from a perspective where life has meaning--where even suffering and death have meaning--and the act of living is not an end in itself but is dedicated to a higher purpose. For those willing to embrace such virtues, \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" makes a sublime connection to our hearts through its grace, its compassion and its incomparable genius."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This story begins with a young hobbit named Frodo whose uncle found a ring that turned the person wearing it invisible.

But in the beginning they got split apart, and Sam and Frodo are left with the ring to go to Mt.Mortar where the only the place the ring can be destroyed. Throughout the way Sam and Frodo meet a strange creature who has been acquainted with the ring before. Later on in the book they both figure out what he really is after. In the book there is kindness, love, bravery, friendship, and a life-lesson.The themes of the book are bravery, love, friendship, kindness, and a life-lesson. Bravery is when Frodo faces his fears in the journey, like when he faces orcs, and love is when Aragorn thinks about his girlfriend. Friendship in the book happens when Sam saves Frodo from almost getting killed and kindness is when Sam helps Frodo destroy the ring. Life-lesson is learned by Frodo who understands to keep your friends close. This is what the theme is in the book.The characters are Aragorn, Gimli, Legolas, Gandalf, Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin. In the beginning of the book Frodo and Sam run away to leave Aragorn sword-wielder, Legolas bow-master, and Gimli axe-holder behind. But later into the book they find an old and lost friend. Also Merry and Pippin are caught by the urau-kia to be taken to Sauroman, the wizard who turned evil. So the ring is left with Frodo and Sam to be destroyed, and they meet something special on the way.The setting in the story is in Middle Earth. It has lakes, streams, rivers, hills, volcanoes, mountains, cities, towns, and fortresses. Or as I would say, it is just like our planet. It also has cows, fish, wolves, dogs, cats, etc. There is also evil as black riders, trolls, goblins, orcs, cave trolls, and sarouman throughout the land.I would recommend this book because if you like a book with friends, action, and bravery, this would be the book for you. There is also kindness, love, and life-lesson to be learned in this book. Characters in the book are so courageous, brave, and loyal to one another it ads up to be one important fight throughout their travels. Another thing I like about this book is the setting because it is just like our own earth.

With many loveable characters, a great story, a great new fantasy world with many place to explore, and the rich, moving storytelling were nothing people have ever seen before. Now with the books, video games, fan clubs, and three great movies, LOTR is easily one of the best stories of all time.BASIC PLOT:BOOK V: Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Merry, and Pippin, go to the capital city of Gondor, Minas Tirith. There they meet the Steward of the city, Denathor, who is Boromir and Faramir's father. They must fight a huge army of Orcs and protect the city.BOOK VI: The climax and resolution of the book. Sam goes to rescue Frodo, and they march toward Mount Doom to destroy the Ring. I won't tell you what happens at the end, but it's a great ending.OPINION: Over 450 pages, but beyond pg. 311 are just optional appendixes that give great info to the plot. This is one great and exciting book, and I noticed in the movie they forget to tell about the battle in the Shire at the end. A must read!

Saruman is reduced to a truly pitiful creature that is still full of spite. Aragorn is revealed as the rightful king and takes his place at the head of the realm.There are also a lot of real world lessons delivered in this book. Evil must be stood up to and fought against even with everything to loose. Freedom is the ultimate reward and valor deserves much respect.

Tolkien's masterful \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy. This book contains some of the most powerful (Gandalf's confrontation with Saruman, Frodo's meeting with Famamir), most humorous (the reunion of the travellers in Isengard), most vividly descriptive (the landscape of Ithilien), and most deeply moving (Gollum finding Frodo and Sam asleep, the story of the Entwives, the choices of Samwise) writing in the entire trilogy. Tolkien also introduces the reader to two completely new and richly detailed societies: the Ents and the Rohirrim. The storyline has been neatly divided in two, and one of these sections further divides in two. Tolkien handles his diverging plots skillfully and with great suspense.I firmly believe that \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is the greatest work of literature ever written, and a case can be made for \\"The Two Towers\\" being the best book of the trilogy."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This book truly enchanted me right through the begining.

If anybody tries to copy this book you will notice it right away because it is so unique."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"J. R. R. Tolkien's \\"The Two Towers\\" is the second part of the classic \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy, widely regarded by many as the greatest fantasy epic ever written. The novel is far more sweeping in scope than Peter Jackson's acclaimed film adaptation, especially when the latter comprises only one half of \\"The Two Towers\\" (\\"The Two Towers\\" has scenes which appear in the first and final installments of Jackson's film trilogy.). The title refers to the twin towers held by Middle-earth's dark lords; Orthanc, at Isengard, the home of the traitorous wizard Saruman and Bard-dur, the Dark Tower of Sauron in Mordor. This splendid novel continues the chronicles of Frodo Baggins, the Ring Bearer, and his companions and friends as they seek to destroy the accursed ring, and free Middle-earth once and for all from the threat posed by the Dark Lord Sauron.Book Five recounts the exploits of Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Merry and Pippin. It opens with Boromir's deathbed confession to Aragorn, admitting that he tried to seize The Ring from Frodo Baggins. Before he dies, Aragorn assures Boromir that he has regained his honor by fighting bravely in defense of Merry and Pippin, now captives of orcs - some from Isengard, and the others from Mordor - returning to Isengard with their prisoners. Soon Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli follow in pursuit of these orcs into the land of Rohan. Merry and Pippin escape and flee into the old forest of Fangorn, meeting Treebeard, the eldest of the Ents. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli venture into Fangorn too, and are reunited with Gandalf, newly risen from the dead, after his fierce struggle with the Balrog from Moria. Eventually their paths will cross in Rohan, at the capital city of Edoras, soon after a successful defense of the kingdom from Saruman's forces at Helm's Deep led by King Theoden, his nephew Eomer and Aragorn. And Merry and Pippin will see Saruman's power destroyed and his fortress of Isengard wrecked by vengeful Ents led by Treebeard.Book Six chronicles Frodo's and Sam's eastward trek towards Mordor. They meet Gollum, who is tamed - at least for a while - by Frodo, acting as their guide into Mordor. They also encounter Faramir, Captain of Gondor, Boromir's younger brother, who offers them friendship and advice regarding their journey. It is a journey that becomes more perilous due to Gollum's renewed treachery, as the trio head towards the dark pass of Cirith Ungol and the ancient evil lurking within."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This book is one that will stay with me forever. The series itself is one of the most powerful fantasy stories ever written. The Return of the King is devided into two parts the first is of Merry, Pippin, Gimli the Dwarf, Legolas the Elf, Gandalf the Wizard, Aragorn the Ranger, Th&eacute;oden the King of Rohan, Eomer, Eowyn, and Faramir. The second is of Frodo Sam and Gollum. While Frodo and Sam are getting closer to mount doom to destroy the one ring of power, every one else is fighting off the armies of mordor. This story tells of the trials of friendship and the evils of war. An enchanting novel for the fantasy reader."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"THE RETURN OF THE KINGBY; J.R.R. TOLKIEN*****This book jumps into two sections. In the first section the main characters are Merry, and Pippin two Hobbits, Gimli the Dwarf, Legolas the Elf, Gandalf the Wizard, Aragorn the Ranger, Th&eacute;oden the King of Rohan, Eomer, Eowyn, and Faramir. In the second section it is Frodo, and Sam also Hobbits. The first part of the story with the first characters they are fighting to save the city of Gondor. They fight against man, orcs, and other horrible creatures of the Dark Lord Sauron. In the second half it is about Sam finding his master Frodo deep inside the land of Mordor. Frodo and Sam must make there way past Sauron's army and make it to the fires of Mt. Doom. With each step the burden of the Ring of power on Frodo grows. It feels much heavier. It's taking control of him. Will Frodo make it to Mt. Doom? Will he be able to cast the ring into the fires or will its hold on him be his downfall? There is a third part and the Hobbits that are living return home and find out they have to save that as well.This story has good strengths. It all played out. I would suggest reading the other books first. There weren't many weaknesses in the story. I couldn't find any. But if you don't like the jumping around then I wouldn't suggest it to you.I would recommend this book to you if you like the myths of the world along with humans mixed together in the fight to survive."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I read Lord Of The Rings Part Two The Two Towers. Written by J.R.R Tolkien, it is the second book in the series.The forces of Mordor were growing. Frodo, Sam, and Gollum were on their way to MT. DOOM. Along the way, they crossed paths with Forimier, Borimier&#65533;s brother. Forimier and his bowmen found Frodo in the woods. Forimier and his men attacked an army going into Mordor. Meanwhile, Merry and Pippin were still in the clutches of the Orcs. Arogorn, Gimli, and Legolas were still on the trail of the Orcs. Merry and Pippin escaped one night, but they went into Fanghorn Forest by mistake. Arogorn, Gimli, and Legolas went into the forest and met Gandalf the White. The four rode off to see King Theadon. When Gandalf convinced him to fight, they fled for Helms Deep. Gandalf knew they were heading into a trap. When the war had started Legolas and Gimli competition to see who killed the most Orcs. After the war Arogorn, Gimli, Legolas, Gandalf and the King left for Isengaurd. When they got there, they met two unexpected hobbits.To like this trilogy you must like fighting and medieval times. I can&#65533;t say if I like the movie or the book more they both have their ups and downs."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Jacob A With, your a dumbass. You must have no imagination because thats all it takes to enjoy a Tolkien novel. JRR's world of fantacy world is brilliant. Anyone interested in the LOTR read a summary of one of the books and you'll want to read the whole thing. I recommend this book to anyone with an imagination."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers is another amazing book in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. Be sure you have read the Hobbit and the Fellowship of the Ring before reading this book. The only difference in this and the first is that the action heats up at the begining, right where the first left off. There are parts with Marry and Pippen and the tree people (the Ents) that can we boring, but you won't be able to put it down. The novel is filled with many battles, surprises, wit, and wisdom. If you liked the Fellowship of the Ring, you'll love the Two Towers."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I guess the release of the movie will stimulate interest in the book. So I'm writing this for those who know the film but not the book. There are some minor differences in plot, inevitably, but both Tolkien's Trilogy and the Peter Jackson movie trilogy are great. I REALLY great. After vast battles and perils the forces of good previal, and Middle-Earth is saved, but at a cost. Tolkien unfortunately, I think, cut the final chapter from this, which provides a satisfactorily epilogue. It can, however, be found in his collected work elsewhere. The book also contains valuable appendices, chronologies, notes on the languages of middle-earth, etc. It's hard to say more about something so well-known, but if you loved the film you ought to love the book, too. Incidentally, Hal GP Colebatch's book 'Return of the Heroes&quot;, which I have reviewed on its own page, gives an interesting and insightful socio-political analysis all Tolkienties should enjoy."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Return of the King is the final book of the trilogy. The Return of the King is the most suspenseful of the trilogy for a couple of reasons. The first, it is the climax. The second is the order of events. The Two Towers ends with Frodo captured and Sam trying to rescue him. But the story line is not continued until the battle at Minas Tirith is resolved. And the battle at Minas Tirith is exciting as well. When Tolkien finally returns to Sam and Frodo, he leaves of with the Captains of the West making battle before Mordor. Just the order of events makes this one of the most exiting books I have read.The story begins with Pippin and Gandalf arriving in Minas Tirith. Denethor is a proud ruler who has fallen into folly. Pippin enters Gondor's service and Merry enters Rohan's service. Merry rides to battle with Dernhelm. After the battle, the captains ride to Mordor to draw attention from Frodo and Sam. Frodo and Sam make their way to Oroduin, where Gollum becomes an unlikely hero. After the wedding of Aragorn and Arwen, the hobbits return to the Shire, where a terrible shock awaits them. The movie does a nice job, but it was not long enough to include everything.If you're looking at this book, you have probably read the first two, and are ready to get this one. If you have liked Tolkien's other work, I encourage you to purchase the Silmarillion, which shows the beginning of middle earth through the tragedy of the Nolder."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Lord of The Rings: Two Towers is far better than the first although the fist one was needed for ground work so that the second to make any sense at all. Part 2 is very well written with vivid battle scenes and intricate plot twists that were completely unexpected by me or anyone who i know who read it. The way the timeline of when the movie is set is congruent with the introduction of explosives and tactical warfare. The two towers in otherwords is a well written book that sticks to some kind of historical guidelines. I would encourage anyone who thinks they can read it and stick with the existing plot should try it."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Lord of the Rings: The Two TowersBy: J.r.r TolkienReviewed By: J. SoonPeriod: 6This book has section 3 and 4 of the Lord of the Rings series, and tells about the companies' deeds. It all starts when Bromir, a fiends who has tried taken the ring from Frodo, dies. Meanwhile, Merry and Pippin were caught by orc-guards and are taken to the city of IsenGard. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli are in pursuit, though. Then the riders of Rohan apper, and they destroy the orcs. The hobbits now escaped and now they meet Treebeard, the ent. Later on, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli meet Gandalf again, who has returned from the dead. When they met with Gandalf, he takes Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli to King Theoden's castle. Gandalf heals the king of a curse, and they are now both allied. All of them now continue their journey towards Isengard. Meanwhile, Saruman and Wormtoung are stuck in the tower of Orthanc. Saruman was no longer a wizard after this because he would not repent towards Gandalf. Wormtongue threw a stone out the window, but it failed to Gandalf, because the stone was a palantir, one of the seeing stones of Numenor. Peregrin picks the stone up and gives it to Gandalf, but later steals it at night. Peregrin looked at it, and he is revealed at Sauron. But Gandalf forgives Pippin, and gives the stone to Aragorn, who rides away to Minas Tirith. Meanwhile, in a distant land, Frodo and Samwise are lost in Emyn Muil. Gollum has been on their trail. But later on, Frodo tames Gollum and Gollum becomes Frodo's servant. Gollum leads Sam and Frodo through the Dead Marshes and then they reach Morranon, the Black Gate of the Land of Mordor in the north. They can't pass through the gate, so Gollum tells Frodo to go to a secret entrance in the Mordor Mountains. While on their journey, they met Faromir, the brother of Boromir, who was leading an army of Men of Gordon. Faramir learned about the Ring, then tried to overcome his brother, Baromir. faramir then helps the hobbits by replenishing their supplies. After that, Frodo, Sam, and Gollum make their way through Cirith Ungol, the spider's pass. Faramir warned that that place was dangerous, unliked Gollum had told. Then they reach the Cross-roads, and take the path towards Minas Morgul. Meanwhile, they see Sauron's first army, led by the Black King of Ringwraiths. Gollum then guides the hobbits to Cirith Ungol. At that same time, Gollum betrays them, and leads them to a monster called Shelob. But Gollum was frustrated after that because of Sam's bravery. Samwise chases Gollum away and hurts Shelob. After that, Frodo is stung by Shelob and dies. Samwise then realizes that he must complete the journey alone, but as he goes into Mordor, he overhears the Orcs. He now learned that Frodo is not dead, but drugged. The orcs then carry Frodo's body down a tunnel where Sam cannot catch up...I liked the book because they gave italicized poems or songs. I like the songs in this book because they are both cheerful and emotional. They also might give clues what happens next in the story. For example,\\"Trough Rohan over fen and field where the long grass grows. The west wind comes walking, and about the walls it goes. What news from the west O wandering wind, do you bring to me tonight. Have you seen Boromir the Tall by moon or by starlight? \\"I saw him ride over seven streams, over waters wide and grey; I saw him in the empty lands, until he passed away in the shadows of the North. I saw him then no more. The North Wind may have heard the horn of the son of Denethor. O Boromir! From the highwalls westward I looked afar, but you came not from the empty lands where no men are.\\"This song gave me clues what would happen next, so that's what I like about the Story.What I don't like about the story is that there were too many words I couldn't pronounce. Sometimes I read pretty fast, them a hard word that I can't pronounce comes up, and then I'm going to have to read the word slowly. For example,\\"The skirts of the storm were lifting, ragged and wet, and the main battle had passed to spread its great wings over Emyn Muil, upon which the dark thought of Sauron brooded for a while. Thence it turned, smiting the vale of Anduin with hail and lightning, and casting its shadows upon Minas Tirith with threat of war.\\" In those sentences, I had to stop and pronounce the hard words I couldn't pronounce. That's what I don't like about the story.My favorite part in the story was near the end of the book. Actually, it is the end of the book. It is the part when Frodo get drugged by Shelob and then taken down to the tunnel where Samwise couldn't catch up. It reminds me of a brother and he is being taken away, and the little brother cries in tears trying to catch up to him. Also I like it because in movie format, there was so much suspense. in the movies, the orcs take away Frodo, carryng him down the tunnel, when Sam tries to get him back. Then after that, it just says \\"The End.\\""},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This book will keep you on he edge of your seat.

It told of how even the great can fall, and how the ones with 'least pourpose' could change the world.In the book i found that Middle-Earth is similer to the world that we live in today.

And also that everyone, great or small, has a worth."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"If such comparisons can be drawn, THE TWO TOWERS is the best of these three marvellous books--and, alas, far more maligned in the recent movie version than was THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING. Be sure to check out the psychological truth of Lord Faramir, whose strength of character in the book is hideously destroyed in the film; likewise that of the Ents. Otherwise my praise of such a magnificent book is unequal to the task--a rare story that manages to be charming, powerful, humorous, and deeply moving."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I, unfortunately, saw the movie before I finished the book, so it sort of killed my imaginatic picture.

I find this a thrilling and heart-warming book, has something for people of all ages."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Lord Of The Rings, The Two TowersBy: J.R.R. TolkienReviewed by: S. TeranPeriod: 5This book is the best book I have ever read in my life. Action, adventure, and fantasy creatures come to life throughout the book. In the begining, Sam and Frodo, two hobbits on their way to Mordor, capture an small and helpless creature who is trying to steal the ring of power away from Frodo. The creature's name was Gollum. He had been the previous owner of the ring of power until Bilbo Baggins, Frodo's uncle, found it in Gollum's cave. Gollum says that he can lead Sam and Frodo to Mordor safely if they spared his life. So they did. In another story line, Merry and Pippen , two other hobbits, found themselves captured by orcs; but one night, the Riders of Rhohan, men who are skilled archers and horsemen, had come and saved them. After their freedom, Merry and Pippen, foolishly ran into the Enchanted Forest. They were unaware of the mythical creatures that lived in the forest. They met an Ent, a tree that can walk and talk. His name was Treebeard. Treebeard took Merry and Pippen to see the white wizard to determine if they were Orc spies or not. Upon arriving, they met Gandalf. They didn't realize that he was reborn and turned into the White Wizard, who had special powers. Meanwhile, Aragon, who was the leader of the fellowship, Legolas, an elf, and Gimli, a dwarf, were in trouble at Helm's Gate. The Orcs, mutated elves, outnumbered the fellowship 10:1. Just when they thought that all hope was lost, Gandalf came out of nowhere along with the banned Riders of Rohan to kick some Orc butt. At the same time, Treebeard, Merry, Pippen and other Ents came to Isengard, the city where the evil wizard Saruman lived. So when they found out that all the trees in the city were cut down, they got mad and summoned all the Ents together and destroyed Isengard.I liked this book for many reasons. First of all, it has a lot of adventure and action. It had lots of battles between good and evil. It had me on the edge of my seat as the Orcs ran day and night trying to get to Mordor, while the fellowship was hot on their trail. Also, it has a great story line. The plot was well written because the author didn't reveal the whole story all at once. He kept building the story line chapter by chapter. In addition, I also liked it because of the mythical creatures in the story. You could visualize how the monsters looked like since the author wrote it in such great detail. For example, \\"They found that they were looking at a most extraordinary face. It belonged to a large Man-like, almost Troll-like, figure, at least fourteen foot high, very sturdy, with a tall head, and hardly any neck. Whether it was clad in stuff like green and grey bark, or whether that was its hide, was difficult to say\\". Those was just one quote of many which are in this book.The reason why I like this book so much is because it is a fantasy. I love fantasies. I also like science fiction movies and The Lord of the Rings has all of these features. Fantasies catch my eye because it most of the things that occur in story, don't happen in real life. For example, In Lord of the Rings, there are cave trolls and talking trees. Fantasy stories are great because it puts me in a different world and I forgot where I am.My favorite part of the movie is when Aragon, Gimli, and Legolas are going into battle with the ferocious Orcs. With the sound of the battle cries the Orcs are making, thousands of these Orcs fight against just hundreds of very brave men. Before this great battle commences, an army of 4,000 Elves come to aid the brave men. Thousands of arrows are shot at the same time striking the Orcs and dropping them like flies. Then the great hand to hand combat begins. Swords and spears start flying everywhere. It looked like a swarm of bees fighting since there were so many Orcs and men fighting. The battle rages on until the gate was breached. It looked as if the Orcs were going to win this war."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Another great Tolkien novel. Characters are excellent. Story is better."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers was an excellent adventure. Of the whole book the only thing I disliked was how the beginning started out a little slow, but it defiantly picked up. I did enjoy how the book opens shortly after the destruction of the group. You have Merry and Pipen who have been captured and taken hostage by a group of Orcs. While Frodo and Sam are trying to get to Mordor to destroy the ring. Then their is Aragorn, Legolas, andGimli who are trying to locate the where about of Merry and Pipen. On their journey they come across the Riders of Rohan. The Riders tell Aragorn that they ran into the Orcs lastnight, and slaughtered them, and they didn't see any hobbits. They must have died in the battle, but actually they escaped into the Forest of Fangorn unnoticed. There the hobbitsencounter a very old ent named Treebeard. Their description of Saraman and the evil wizard's plans move Treebeard to call together all the ents of the Forest. Then they set offto wage war on Isengard.In the meantime, the three companions enter the Fangorn in pursuit of the hobbits. In the forest they are amazed to realized that Gandalf is still alive. Gandalf tells them thatMerry and Pipen will be safe, but that the city of Rohan is in great danger. The four travel to the capital or Rohan, where Gandalf tries to convince King Theoden to ride into battleagainst Isengard. Gandalf does and Theoden leads his Rides of Rohan to Helm's Deep, where they will prepare to defend against a huge army of Orcs.While all of this is going on, Frodo and Sam are traveling to Mordor, seeking Mount Doom. On there journey their is a Gollum that pursues them silently, but aftersome time the hobbits manage to ambush and capture him. The Gollum promises to lead them to Mordor, but Sam doesn't fully trust the Gollum, unlike Frodo. The Gollum leads them, and they travel for many days through the Dead Marshes and later the ruined Plain of Dagorlad. Finally they reach the Black Gate but its impenetrable, but Gollum informs the hobbits that he knows of a secret route, but further south. Frodo again agrees tofollow the Gollum. After a few days of traveling they run into the Men of Gondor, led by Faramir. After hearing the natures of Frodo's quest, Faramir agrees to let the hobbits go,and warns them that the route the plan to take is very dangerous.Once again following Gollum, Sam and Frodo eventually find themselves in the mountains outside Minas Morgul. They enter a dark tunnel and the Gollum disappears. Suddenly, a horrifying spider appears from the darkness. Will they be able to fight off the spider, and why did the Gollum disappear?Plus you must read on to find how the battle turns out with the ents destroying Isengard. Then can the three companions and the Riders of Rohan hold off the outrageousnumber of Orcs?"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two towers is a masterpeice of tolkien. It continues the story of the Fellowship of the Ring as a sequel by bringing all the things that the fellowship had and more. It met the high bar left by the fellowship and was able to carry that mark throughout the whole book.This book so much to offer, from blood pumping battles, to the mythical Ents. It starts by telling the story of Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas chasing the band of orcs that holds onto Merry and Pippin. The first few chapters switch between Pippin's party and Aragorn's party. It builds up suspense with the meeting of treebeard and the White Rider. The Helm's Deep is the climax of the first part of this book.The second book continues the journey of Master Samwise and Frodo Baggins, the ring bearer. These two meet a new friend right in the beginning. His name is smeagol. Sam feels that he is untrustworthy yet Frodo trusts his new companion and heeds his advise and uses him as a guide. Smeagol of course is trustworthy to Frodo and proves his worth through the marshes of the dead. He even show him the way into Mordor. The make in a good distance into Mordor when they are captured by their allies, Faramir. He seeks the ring for Gondor, but eventually sees his downfall with the ring and allows Frodo, Gollum (smeagol), and Sam to journey to Mount Doom.This book is simply a work of art by Tolkien. It shows the perfect form of a science fiction novel. It is a must read especially if you liked the movie."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"After finishing the second book in The Lord of the Rings trilogy, The Two Towers, I rushed out and got this one immediately. I couldn't wait to see what would happen next.Although, I enjoyed the second book a little more than this one, this is still an exciting conclusion to the series and is a must read. I especially liked the part with Gollum and the two hobbits traveling together. While they are tempted several times to kill Gollum for his wickedness, something prevents them and in the end it saves everything.I thought this was an interesting message. While I am firm believer in free-will... sometimes you just don't know what fate has in store for you. This book is a great story about believing in your mission in life and having faith that if you press on fate will come to your aid, even if it's in an unexpected way.I wish there were more writers out there who would take on such stories and handle them as masterfully as Tolkien has done."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Return of the King is the final book in The Lord of the Rings series. One part of the book follows Frodo, the bearer of a dark and mysterious ring, and his loyal companion Sam, through the final stage of their journey to Mount Doom. They have been sent to destroy the evil ring by throwing it back into the place of its origin, The Cracks of Doom. Along the way, the two wanderers encounter many difficulties and hazardous obstacles in their path, including the small and shrew Gollum who is intent on getting \\"his\\" ring back or die trying.The other part of the book follows Aragorn, the noble warrior, and his companions as they battle the massive forces of the dark Lord Sauron. The battle between the two armies is the classic war of good versus evil, but with intriguing characters and extensive detail. You have the remaining group of the fellowship of the ring in this intense battle, including Gimli the Dwarf, Legolas the Elf, Aragorn the Ranger, and the small but bold hobbits Merry and Pippin.Overall, this is an amazing book. The only thing I didn't like about the book is that I had trouble getting started with it, due to the slow beginning. J.R.R. Tolkien makes up for it however, with suspenseful battles and beautiful descriptions. The thing I liked most about the book was the ending. It is hard to describe, but it is extraordinary and keeps you thinking even once you've finished. I highly recommend this book and would've given it four and three-quarters stars out of five, only because of the ending."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Well this book was cool. i am very glad i read it. i owe this to all my firends who encouragedm e to read this. it was well worht it and glad i got the chance. please do read it. it was the best."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"In an outstanding second book in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, JRR Tolkien continues the saga of Frodo and the Fellowship.

This is Pippin and Merry's part of the story. With some help from Ents (walking &amp; talking trees), Aragorn, Gimli, Legolas, Eomer, Theoden and the newly resurrected Gandalf, the power of the traitor wizard Saruman is broken. In the second half of the novel, Frodo and Sam are lead to Mordor by Gollum. But Gollum, try as he might, cannot overcome the corruption of the ring; and his obsession to repossess it leads to betrayal. Wonderfully poetic, fun at some places, sad and dark in others, this is a novel not to be missed. If you don't have a copy, get one and read it. If you have read it, read it again. It never gets old.

That might go without saying, but don't even think about it. You will be lost.Again, the book is rich with Tolkien's gorgeous prose. You'll probably never read prose so beautifully wrought by any modern writer out there. I think I will tackle the series a second time when I am older so I can read it aloud to my children.I would say also that there are some nice spiritual undercurrents to this book that makes it fabulous from a moral perspective. You are not just reading a fairy tale, you are learning a bit about courage, duty, honesty and virtue.

There is nothing else that has ever come close to comparing to it - although many have tried. &quot;The Two Towers&quot; is a wonderful second volume for Middle Earth - it concentrates on Merry and Pippin's adventures. Unless you have been completely spoiled by modern interpretations of fantasy, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; should be in your permanent library. Be sure to read the first volume =before= the new movie comes out, as I have heard that they changed many events, and left out others in the interest of brevity. Every fan of fantasy should read &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; at least once in their lives. My very highest recommendation for any fantasy book."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I give this book a 5 for its rating. Three reasons why I liked this book are it has great details because it always describs and tells you where the characters are in the book. The second reason why i liked this book is it tells you who the person is and sometimes it tells who there father is. Another reason is it has alot of action in it. It tells you whats happening in a battle. I would recommend this book to teenagers and above because it has alot of violence in it. The book is mostly about a war with good vs evil. Another reason why i would recommend this book to teenagers and above because it has alot of hard words to read and little kids won't know what they mean.I really liked this book and if you read it I hope you like it alot."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers is one of the best books i have ever read. it starts out with boromir defending pippin and merry from orcs sent by the evil one, and from that point inward this book never disappoints. if you enjoyed the fellowship, hold on. this book will take you through many twists and turns as far as the plot. however, try to have the return of the king handy when you finish. the end will leave you hanging so much all that you can think about is wat happens to frodo and sam. nevertheless, this book is a classic and should be read by almost anyone."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"To the first part of this amazing trilogy I give 4 stars, because of some boring parts, but to the second part, The Two Towers, I give 5 stars without thinking too much. The story starts with the fall of Boromir that was killed by the Orcs. From there it is told how the rest of the Company straggled on in their journey, and how Sam and Frodo tamed Gollum and went to Mordor, the Land of Shadow. I started reading this story and I couldn't stop. I liked every single chapter of this book - there was no boring parts. If you like fantasies and adventures I highly recommend this trilogy, you don't know what you're missing. And about the author, JRR Tolkien - it's true what they say: a storyteller of genius! In two words - ama zing!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"i've read the book THE LORD OF THE RINGS (I, II AND III) AND I FIND IT VERY AMUSING AND IT MAKES MY MIND MORE IMAGINATIVE. I HAVE ALSO READ THE SILMARILLION AND STILL LOOKING FOR THE MAP OF MIDDLE EARTH. IT'S FANTASTIC AND GREAT."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"In The Two Towers, writer J.R.R Tolkien mixes the ideas of a traditional fantasy with the complex features of secret languages and complex descriptions. These ideal characteristics are what contribute to an ideal fantasy novel that was once the best seller for ages and ages. The book itself is a fantasy-adventure novel and its point of view is normally the simple third person, although there are a few parts where it changes to the first person point of view. The actual theme of the book is to fight to win an adventure, and to success by winning freedom. The Two Towers is actually part two of a three book series called The Lord of the Rings. Therefore this book is actually like the meat of the series, in which all the details and difficult transitions are stored. A young hobbit (creatures who are small, plump and live in holes), Frodo Baggins, is heir to a secret ring, a ring of powers beyond the skeptical minds of all humans. His primary mission is to get rid of this ring, for it corrupts people through greed and wants. He chooses to take the way of destroying the ring through going to the dangerous lands of Mordor, where the dark lord Sauron, lies on his throne. In The Fellowship of the Ring (part one of the series) Frodo begins his adventure with a small wizard called Gandalf, who is to be his chief guide throughout the journey. Frodo then sets his backpack to finally start on his dangerous adventure to the dark lands of Mordor. With him he takes Sam Gamgee, a trusted servant of his and a few friends including Gimli, the dwarf, Merry the hobbit and Pippin the hobbit. He passes throughout many adventures including the mysterious Black Riders and being stabbed by one of them. Yet still, at the end of The Fellowship of the Ring, Frodo ends up reaching his goal for the time, the Elven House. There a counsel gathers to discuss matters about the ring and such other things. They decide who to bring with Frodo and who not to, yet meanwhile war tensions were going greater as the dark forces started to pile up and head for Minas Tirith (the war fortress of the good) to start that legendary battle of good and evil. Meanwhile in The Two Towers, Frodo finally decides to go to Mordor by himself because he found himself to be a bother towards his other comrades in this adventure. Tensions in Minas Tirith start to grow more and more and the land is filled with terror, terror of war. While Frodo is on his way to Mordor alone, Pippin and Merry get lost together and are caught by the terrible orcs. Then due to a little quarrel, they were able to escape and reunite with Gandalf and everyone else. Also, as time goes by, Pippin and crew reunite with Frodo and travel a long and harsh way to Mordor with many mischievous happenings. Then they all stop at the border of Mordor, looking at the dark land with a sign of trouble. The Two Towers is an extremely intriguing and breath-taking story. Tolkien uses complex descriptions and imaginary locations to combine with the traditional elements of a fantasy novel, creating an extremely successful series and novel. So far, I view this book as the best in the series and I highly recommend this book with my rating of 10/10. It always keeps you intensified and is always a pleasure to read. The reading level of this book is for junior adults for the book itself does not use complex vocabulary but rather has small print and has a reasonable amount of pages. Also, it is practically impossible to compare this to any other book because it is to good for comparison. Even the Redwall series from Brian Jaque&iexcl;s is definitely no match for Tolkien&iexcl;s The Lord of the Rings. Therefore it is highly recommended that you read this book for it was a big pleasure for me to be able to read it and it was also a very fun book."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The greatness of Tolkien's work is that he seems to be describing a world that has always existed.

I am happy with this purchase! It was a gift for a grandson, who is most happy with it!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"\\"Return of the King\\" is the worthy climax to J.R.R. Tolkien's epic saga, the fantasy that created the genre as we know it today. Now, as the blockbuster movie adaptation is over, many readers are checking out the dramatic story that ends Tolkien's masterpiece and life's work.The story opens where \\"Two Towers\\" left off. Gandalf has ridden to the city of Gondor with Pippin (partly to keep him out of trouble), where the forces of Mordor are attacking. There is upheaval in the city itself, as the steward of Gondor is going nuts. Merry pledges his service to King Theoden of Rohan, not knowing what is ahead for the king and his relatives. And Aragorn is seeking out allies to fight Sauron on a military scale, even if they can't defeat him unless the Ring is destroyed. His search will take him to tribes of forest-dwellers, to Gondor -- and even to summon an army of the dead.In Mordor, the unconscious Frodo has been captured by Sauron's orcs, and taken to the fortress of Cirith Ungol. Sam is desperate to free his friend, but knows that he can't take on an army, and that Frodo would want him to finish the quest. Sam manages to free Frodo from captivity, but they must still brave more dangers before they can come to Mount Doom, the only place where the Ring can be destroyed. As they travel Sam sees Frodo slipping further and further into the Ring's grasp. Will Frodo be able to destroy the Ring?Usually, the climax of an epic adventure is a disappointment. \\"Return of the King\\" succeeds in almost every way, wrapping up each individual storyline, one by one. The ending has a feeling of finality; this is one story that could never have a sequel; Tolkien shows that in a struggle against evil, there is no true \\"happy ending.\\" Even if the good guys win, there will still be scarring, and death, and haunting memories of what once happened. And even if a person survives, he will never be the same.This is the grimmest of the three books in this trilogy. Aside from Frodo's emotional deterioration, we also have Merry becoming almost catatonic after the battle with the Witch King, and Denethor's descent into suicidal madness. There is a lot less humor, though it is still there: Pippin and Merry both thinking about food, Gandalf's reaction when Pippin pledges his sword to Denethor, some choice witty comments of Frodo's in the last chapters, and Gimli's half-joking threats to axe Eomer if Eomer doesn't consider Galadriel the most beautiful woman in the world.Though a section of the book near the end descends into near-biblical prose, which changes post-Gondor, Tolkien does not waver in his ability to evoke emotion. One of the most touching scenes in the book is when Sam finds Frodo naked, unconscious and being beaten by an orc. Others include Merry's farewell to Theoden, Eowyn's slaying of the Witch-King, and of course the bittersweet final scene.Frodo is almost unrecognizable in parts of this book. The bright, naive young hobbit of the first book has been worn down by the pressure of the Ring, to the point where he seems to be only a pale shadow of himself. As he grows increasingly attached to the Ring, we even see him doing what seems unimaginable: threatening Sam with a dagger. Yet these actions make chilling sense, even when Frodo recovers his self-control only a moment later. It's a devastating demonstration of the hold the Ring has on him; he tries to resist it while knowing that he's falling too far into its grasp. When he lapses into depression and nihilism, readers will wonder if he can actually give it up.Sam has come a long way from the shy young hobbit who couldn't say a word around the High Elves. This book has him chasing orcs with Sting, carrying Frodo physically through Mordor, fending off Gollum, and acting as the ultimate pillar of strength for his crumbling friend right to Mount Doom. Merry is exposed firsthand to the horrifying consequences of war, and Pippin moves past his initial flakiness in an effort to be a serious warrior. Aragorn breaks completely from the mold of rugged ranger and into the new status as a king, leading armies (both living and dead) without flinching.As far as the supporting cast goes, Legolas and Gimli assist as well; their friendship grows deeper, even as Legolas falls completely in love with the sea. Gollum's degenerate journey remains intertwined with Frodo's, even though he betrayed the hobbits in the previous book; and the icily passionate war-maiden Eowyn affects the War of the Ring in a stunning way that nobody could have predicted.The story doesn't really end on the last page; for more background, especially on Aragorn and Arwen, readers should also read the appendices at the end of the book. Another good addition is \\"The End of the Third Age,\\" in which the unpublished epilogue of LOTR can be found. Though this is probably not canonical, it nicely concludes the story and is a heartwarming look at what happens in the years following LOTR.It's difficult, once the story has finished, to accept that one has to say goodbye to Middle-Earth and its enchanting inhabitants. But as Gandalf says, \\"I will not say: do not weep; for not all tears are an evil.\\""},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"&quot;The Two Towers&quot; opens with the dispersal of the Fellowship Of The Ring. Boromir, eldest son of the Steward of Gondor, is killed by marauding Orcs intent on capturing Merry and Pippin. In a sense, his heroic death is an act of redemption on his part, after trying to seize the Ring from Frodo. Merry and Pippin are carried off by these Orcs, servants of the corrupt wizard Saruman. Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas begin their trek towards Minas Tirith, the capital of Gondor, hoping to overtake Saruman's Orcs. And Frodo and Samwise proceed towards Mordor and Mount Doom.This second installment of &quot;The Lord Of The Rings&quot; is in two parts; the first deals with the exploits of Merry, Pippin, Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas. The second recounts Frodo's and Samwise's perilous journey to Mordor. Without a doubt, this is the most character driven installment of the entire &quot;Lord Of The Rings&quot; saga. Without giving away the plot, the book is an insightful survey of the main characters and their motivations. Suffice it to say that their interactions amongst themselves as well as with important minor characters such as Fangorn, the chief of the Ents, play an important part in determining the outcome of the war of the Ring.Much of Tolkien's best writing can be found in this book. I found &quot;The Two Towers&quot; as engrossing as either &quot;Fellowship Of The Ring&quot; or &quot;The Return Of The King&quot;, the third book in the trilogy. Incidentally, &quot;The Two Towers&quot; refers to Saruman's tower, Orthanc, at Isengard, and the Dark Lord Sauron's tower in Mordor."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"...that the Kindle store has The Fellowship Of The Ring and The Return Of The King but not The Twin Towers?

I had read LOTR several times before, but I enjoyed this reading almost more than the original books.The only thing I missed was a list of the tracks.

I highly recommend it for audio book lovers and lovers of the series.This makes for a great cd set to keep at your work desk or in the car..or even, like me, in your collection for listening to while exercising or doing chores around the house!A little pricey but you definitely get your money's worth!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"'The Return of the King' marks the conclusion of the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy. Actually, the story really begins in J.R.R. Tolkien's 'The Hobbit,' but that book is not necessarily needed in order to understand 'The Lord of the Rings.' The story began in 'The Fellowship of the Ring,' in which the wizard Gandalf learns of the return of Sauron, a being of great evil, and discovers that Bilbo Baggins possesses the one thing that will make Sauron's return complete: the 'one' ring.The 'one' ring was discovered by Bilbo in 'The Hobbit.' He relieved its original owner, Gollum (a cave dwelling creature with multiple personalities), while on an adventure with Gandalf and a platoon of dwarves out to destroy a dragon, recover the dwarven king's treasure, and the dwarves' home. The ring will make it's wearer invisible, and in the right hands, will give it's bearer incredible power. However, the ring is evil and seeks to bend the will of those who wear it to conquest.In 'The Fellowship of the Ring,' Gandalf decided that Bilbo was no longer fit to wear the ring and sent him off to see the elves. Frodo, Bilbo's nephew, was Gandalf's hand picked successor to carry the ring, and was sent off with a few friends on an adventure to ultimately destroy the ring in the one place it can actually be destroyed: the home of Sauron and actual forging place of the ring known as Mount Doom.Bilbo, accompanied by Samwise, Merry, and Pippin (three other hobbits), and eventually Gimli (a grumbling axe carrying dwarf), Legolas (the bow weilding elf), the Ranger Strider (also known as Aragon), and other along the way set off to carry the ring to Mount Doom. Along the way, they encounter Ring Wraiths and other perils.The story continued in 'The Two Towers,' in which the Fellowship was split. Aragon, Legolas, and Gimli set off to help fight the coming war while Merry and Pippin are carried off to other battlefields. Fearing for his friend's safety, Frodo set off on his own with the ring, and was followed by Sam and the creature Gollum.The story finally concludes in 'The Return of the King.' The Orcish armies of Sauron have massed to attack Gondor. Strider must rally the armies of Middle Earth to fight against Sauron's dark forces. He must also make a decision as to whether he should reveal his true identity as the true King of Gondor. In the meantime, Frodo and Sam seek to complete the final stage of their journey to Mount Doom to destroy the Ring.Anyone who has read a great deal of fantasy literature will see Tolkien's influence. The power of the ring is mimiced in other fantasy novels, such as R.A. Salvatore's 'The Crystal Shard,' the races of elves, dwarves, and orcs are oft repeated my dozens upon dozens of fantasy authors, and the other magical items and treasures are now commonplace in fantasy literature. His description of the ring wraiths is the model by which all other undead creatures are compared against. Tolkien's work was obviously influenced by ancient mythology from the Norse to the Romans and perhaps by such novels as Bram Stoker's 'Dracula' with his portrayal of the undead.Tolkien accomplished his goal of writing a long sustained narrative. Depending on which version of the trilogy the reader gets, he is likely facing 1,000 pages of fine print text. At times, the reader will likely think Tolkien was either being paid by the word, or that he just wanted to write as long a story as possible. While the rich detail Tolkien provides is artful, it can be a bit tedious.For instance, the opening chapters of 'The Return of the King' detail the march of the armies to Gondor in minute detail. This goes on for dozens of pages. Bye the end of it, the reader feels like they have marched to Gondor across mountains and miles of fields. Perhaps that was Tolkien's goal, but it does make the book discouraging to read at times. A similar effect happens as Tolkien details Frodo and Sam's weariness as the approach Mount Doom. Also, nobody in the trilogy appears to be able to say 'goodbye' in under the space of three to five pages.The novel does have a satisfactory conclusion to the trilogy that is entirely appropriate. The final chapters only relate to the larger story in a remote fashion, but they are a fun read. Sam, in my opinion the true hero of the final volume of the trilogy, steals the spotlight from Frodo, the protagonist of much of the trilogy. His actions, will, and resolve allow Frodo to see his quest to an end (whether that be good or bad, you'll have to read the novel to find out). Yet, Sam is one of the least celebrated characters in the trilogy compared to Frodo, Aragon, Legolas, Gimli, and Gandalf.I enjoyed reading the trilogy. Anyone who has seen Peter Jackson's recent movie treatments of the trilogy will probably enjoy these books as well. If you haven't seen the movies yet, I recommend reading each novel first before viewing the movie. This was the plan I used, and it made the movies immensely enjoyable. It is a rare incident when the movie turns out to be better than the book, but Jackson's movies so far have been better than Tolkien's novel, at least in my opinion. General fans of fantasy literature will enjoy this trilogy, if for nothing more than they will recognize Tolkien's influence in the works they are already familiar with."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Lord of the Ring:The Return of the KingBy: J.R.R.

To begin with, the ending of The Two Towers leaves you hanging so much that you need to go to a bookstore immediatly to find out what happens. Of course, instead of telling what happens to Frodo and Sam first, you hear about Legolas, Aragorn, Pippin, Merry and company. This part of the book is one that you cant skip, otherwise you wont understand the plot. I would give details of what happens, but that is for you to find out!If you haven't read The Two Towers, but have seen the movie, you need to read The Two Towers first. At the end of the movie they leave out about 100 pages of the book. If you haven't read the Fellowship of the Ring, i suggest that you read that also, as it includes many characters that you don't hear about in the movie, and is more fulfilling than the movie is.In all, I suggest that you read this book, and stop questioning whether you should or not. If you haven't read the series, read that first. The Hobbit is a very good book to start off with, so that would be good to read first. Go on, click on the buy it now button!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I am not a big book person so when I say this book was awesome it really is awesome. I actually doubted that the ring would be destroyed. I thought Sam and Frodo were going to die before they reached Mt. Doom if not from lack of water, than certainly from the Orcs camped all around it.The book was also outstanding in the way it was written. I liked how Tolkien put the climax of the whole series right in the middle of the third book, as opposed to the end like people would normally do. It made you think that life would go on happily ever after but, as you find out, there was still a challenge waiting for the hobbits at the end of the book.It was also great the part Gollum played in this whole series. He went from ultimate savior, to ultimate traitor, back to the savior all in two books. I knew that he would have something to do with destroying the ring, because that's what Gandalf said, but I didn't think that he would actually be the one the destroy it.I also thought it was great how Tolkien portrayed the effects of the ring on Frodo. How just hanging the ring around his neck and only putting it on a couple times made him slave to it. I thought that would happen though because you get the feeling from the book that nothing is as easy as it seems. I knew that it would take more than just dropping the ring into the fire for Frodo to relinquish it.In conclusion this book is the best book in the best series of books that I have ever read. I highly recommend that you check it out. It will be well worth your time. I am sorry if I gave away to much of the story for you but I had to."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"\\"...In the land of Mordor where the shadows lie.\\" In this second book of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, Frodo, the unwilling heir of the one ring, decides to journey off alone with his servant Samwise Gamgee. He makes his way eastward to Mordor and the fire mountain, Mount Doom. Meanwhile, his friends and companions from the Fellowship are caught in a bloody quarrel with the trader Saroman in his well-guarded fortress, Isengard. Saroman sends his army to destroy the main city of Rohan, but the great army of King Theoden soon beats his bloodthirsty orcs. Saroman is soon attacked by the ents of Fangorn forest, and his putrid fortress is destroyed. The book ends with the coming of the great darkness and a terrible War of the Rings. What happens to Frodo, the ring, and his friends remains to be seen in the next book.When I first picked up this book, Tolkien's marvelous writing compelled me, and made me see the emotions and terrible hardships Frodo and Sam have to endure on their journey, and also let me experience the terrible battles first hand. I recommend this book to people who have wild imaginations and who can stay on topic with the story's crazy names and titles. This book was great and I can't wait to read the final installment!Vince S.Des Plaines, IL"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This book is the conclusion to Tolkien's epic The Lord of the Rings. We pick up the story from 'The Two Towers'. Frodo and Sam are making their way to Mordor with the help of Gollum/Smeagol. The rest of the fellowship have survived Helm's Deep and Isengard. They again split up as Gandalf and Pippin race to Minas Tirith. Aragorn is charging with gathering an army meet Sauron in battle.This book is divided into two parts. One focuses on Frodo and Sam's journey, the other on the rest of the fellowship. This makes keeping track of the chronology of the story a little difficult, but it avoids jumping back and forth between the various story lines.We follow the story, as the forces for good gather to face the evil Sauron. Aragorn steps out of his role as the ranger from the North and into the true king of Gondor. We watch the Steward of Gondor, Lord Denethor, slip into madness. We see Eowyn rise in battle. This part of the book rises to a fevered pitch culminating in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields.The other half of the book follows the journey of Frodo and Sam. This section is harder to read. Frodo changes from the happy hobbit to a darker creature becoming more and more obsessed with the ring. However, as we see Frodo slipping away, Sam steps out of his humble past to carry Frodo towards Mount Doom.After the culmination of the War of the Ring, the book continues the story of the aftermath. We see that the scars of the journey have not gone away.Enjoy this final installment of the LOTR. It will leave you wanting more.

This novel is satisfying on many levels and has a complexity and vision that is missing from many of it's imitators.Please be aware though that there is a difference in the pacing of the novel from the films. I read the novel before I saw the film, and it is possible that seeing the film first may distract some readers. This novel is written at a leisurley place, it is not a quick read, but it is a doorway into the authors imagination and philosophy. Definitely worth the trip."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The story of the Lord of the Rings begins with the Hobbit, then the Fellowship of the Ring, next the Two Towers, and is concluded with the Return of the King. I would recommend reading the first three books before reading this one. Frodo and Sam are on the final leg of their journey to Mount Doom, but their resolve is failing. With the Armies of Gondor vastly outnumbered by the Orcs, will it even be in time?This classic book written by JRR Tolkien is sure to be a book you'll remember for a very long time. Each of the books, especially the Return of the King are packed with details. It is easy to visualize everything in your mind. I would encourage everyone to read it!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"the Return of the King concludes the exciting story of the fellowship of the ring. It offers more excitement and suspense as well as several surprises. Tolkien consistently stretches the reaches of imagination, and he always provides logic and reason so that his story makes sense and follows a consistent stream of creativity.As I read the rings trilogy, I found that it was helpful to have seen to the movies to help picture the events, characters, and surroundings. Of course, the movies made much more sense after reading the books, but I found reading the books more enjoyable than the movies. I am really glad that I decided to read them at a friend's suggestion. The Return of the King offers much more than the movie version. There is much more to the story here that the movie did not reveal, so readers will be very pleased to find additional events. Additionally, the book takes different turns than the movie. Tolkien offers characters that inspire, teach, warn, and revulse the reader due to their goodness or evil. This book involves romance as well. One of my favorite characters is Faramir. He is revealed as a warrior and leader possessing great integrity and courage.In this book, Tolkien reveals the true character of the King as a healer as well as a fighter and leader. This book has all of the insight into human behavior and personality as do Shakespeare's plays. I was sorry to reach the end of it. It was as entertaining a book as I have read.Tolkien is an excellent writer. This book along with the others is intelligently written. It is not just kid's stuff. It is stimulating reading.He tells a great story filled with complex characters and plots. The story follows a logical and understandable path that sparks the readers full imagination and range of emotions.There is no let up in the action at all in the concluding book and like the others there are surpises around every turn.If you liked the movie at all, you will indeed enjoy the book, especially if your one criticism of the movie is that it didn't make sense. The book will fill in the gaps and will cause you to appreciate the movie much more."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I just finished reading Return of the King, and I thought it was a great book. I'll admit that it took me awhile to get going, but then it started to pick up and I couldn't put it down. I thought the second half of the book, where it follows Frodo and Sam, was more interesting then the battles between the dark forces and the forces of man.I thought all the symbols and foreshawdowing that Tolkien used made the book very interesting. I also really enjoyed the parallels between christianity and the Lord of the Rings Series. I think that this is definantly a good book, and I think that everyone should read the series!This book has gotten me incredibly hyped up for the release of the new movie! I am looking forward to see if Peter can pull off all the things that he needs too!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This book is the third and final installment of J.R.R. Tolkein's Lord of the Rings Trilogy. Even though the forces of good have one great victories at Helm's Deep and Isengard they are not out of the woods yet. The evil armies of Mordor are coming to attack Gondor, so Gandalf, Aragon and company must hurry to its defense. At the same time Frodo and Sam draw closer to Morder and Mount Doom, but even as they do the Ring becomes more and more of burden on both of them. Will Gandalf, Merry, Pippin and Aragon have enough strength to defend Gondor and drive away the Dark Lord's Armies? Will Frodo and Sam fulfull their quest to destroy the ring? You are just going to have to read the book to find out.Tolkein's trilogy is the father of all modern fantasy series. Before Jordan, before Martin, before Eddings, before Brooks there was Tolkein. Every single fantasy author that comes along owes a debt to the work of Tolkein - because not only did Tolkein do it first, he did it better. His characters and settings seem to leap off the page and you find yourself reading with bated breath to find out what happens next. His world is in depth, colorful and unforgettable. Most important Tolkein understands the need to have a beginning, a middle and an end to his series (this is directed at you Robert Jordan). His series tells the story it set out to tell and reaches the end of its tale. So many more recent writers have their series stretching on and on for no apparent reason.(Side note: Has anyone ever noticed how the first few chapters of Robert Jordan's &quot;Eye of the World&quot; are almost a direct lift from Fellowship of the Ring? Boys (hobbits) living in a remote village (the shire) are visited by a mysterious Aes Sedai (Gandolf) who alerts them to a growing danger (The ring). They are then forced to flee from the Myradraal (the Ringwraiths) with the help of the Aes Sedai and her warder (Strider). I actually read Jordan first and have since read Tolkein and trust me Jordan just re-wrote the first part of Fellowship)If you want to read how great epic fantasy can be the only place to start is with Tolkein. Tolkein's work puts all of the others to shame in its story, its characters..everything. The movies that go along with the books are good too, but I always read the book before I see the movie; otherwise the movie kills what ever ideas I had in my head beforehand. Before you read Jordan, Brooks, or Martin - read Tolkein. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"In The Return of the King by J.R.R. Tolkien, Frodo continues his quest to destroy the one ring. This book grabs the reader's attention and doesn't let go.In the novel, Frodo continues his quest to destroy the one ring, with the ring always weighing heavily upon him. He must destroy it in the fires of Mount Doom, a mountain deep within Mordor, the realm of the dark lord Sauron. In the meantime, Pippen and Gandalf make their way to Gondor, where they face perils of their own. While Merry, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli and the Riders of Rohan travel back towards Rohan to gather their strength and ride also to Gondor, to aid in fighting against the siege that was inevitably about to hit. Later Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli and some of the others split from the group and take another route to get there even faster. Throughout the book all of the characters go through many perils, even those not going straight into Mordor.This book grabs your attention and doesn't let go. It doesn't have a dull moment in it. Even in the few moments of quiet, it still has something interesting going on. It is extremely creative and inventive. It has many unexpected events and twists. I recommend that you read this book, but it is very important to read the first two books of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers, before you read this one to avoid a great deal of confusion. I also recommend that if you enjoy these books you should read the prequel, The Hobbit.The Return of the King was a captivating, creative and thrilling book. It keeps the reader guessing until the very end and even then it has an unexpected twist. The novel has a range of emotions from joy to fear to sadness, often all at once. Though each character has a different job, each has their own significance."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This third installment in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy is a worthy successor to the previous two books. Tolkien wraps up all the loose ends with a wonderful, almost poetic, style.Saruman has been defeated, and now the armies of good must race to the city of Minas Tirith to stave off the assault of Sauron's forces. Meanwhile, Frodo and Sam must continue their quest through Mordor to destroy the Ring. Battles rage and wills are tested as the forces of evil bring seemingly overwhelming force to bear on the defenders of Middle-Earth. It is in this fury that Tolkien allows his characters to become their true selves: majestic personalities of great strength and courage. Even the small hobbits rise to great things. Frodo's struggle with the Ring continues, while Sam first fights to save him, and then fights to keep him moving on his quest. As the quest comes to an end, the reader gets to see most of the characters from the previous books one more time, and watch as the hobbits return to the Shire, discovering the effect the conflict has had on their home.Tolkien truly wrote a great story in this book. He not only has a great skill for description of situations, but also for human personality and emotion. This is evident first at the battle for Minas Tirith, where varying personalities shape the conflict, and then with Frodo and Sam in Mordor, which makes for the most compelling reading in the book. Sam's concern for his master and Frodo's struggle with his burden are detailed masterfully.This book is a great ending to this wonderful trilogy. It really is a quick read, and lacks some of the slower parts of the previous two books. The whole trilogy is great, and this final installment makes the time spent reading the trilogy more than worth the effort. This is just a fantastic ending to a great story of strength, courage, love and loyalty."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"In The Return of the King, Frodo and Sam continue their perilous journey to destroy the Ring of Power in the fires of Mt. Doom. Throughout the book there are many exciting battles and scenes, and the end of the book is worth reading all of the books just to see how it ends. I have seen and loved the first two movies, and this book is far better than both of those. I strongly recommend reading The Return of the King."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers starts right where the Fellowship of the Ring left off. Boromir is dead, the fellowship is broken and two hobbits are missing. Book three is the journey of Aragorn, Master Pergerin, Merry, Gilimi and Legolas search for the two missing hobbits Frodo and Master Samwise. Aragorn and the others venture through many lands and many perils. They meet with the Riders of Rohan who have light-footed horses and deadly bow accuracy, the mysterious tree type Ents who seem to be older than anything on Middle-Earth. Book four is the quest of Frodo and Master Samwise. They find themselves lost in the lands of Gondor, Rohan and at the gates of Mordor, while being followed by the elusive Smeagol. Frodo and Samwise are on a hunt to find a passage into Mordor.To me this book was not the best out of the series but the ending was good. The first hundred pages start off slow, but when Aragorn meets up with the Riders of the Mark and they begin their march to the siege of Isengard to kill Saruman the book starts to pick up. Tolkien expresses the feeling of battle well so it is easy to follow. My favorite character out of the book is Samwise. His decisions are rash at times but I think Frodo should have seeked council with him more often. It would have made the journey easier for the both of them. The end seems to express Sam as being smarter than Frodo because he seems to know what he's doing. Frodo was dazed and confused most of the time leaving Sam to do the thinking for the both of them."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"In the last book of The Lord of the Rings, Frodo finally finishes his quest. There are some GREAT battle scenes in here and some really interesting characters. It's funny because I started to read this several years ago, got bored, and stopped. Then I started again sometime later and asked myself why I didn't keep going earlier. Anyway, the only reason why I flick off one star is because I felt the ending was a little disappointing. Actually, there are TWO endings in this book. The end of the Ring of Power and the end of the book. I have no problem with the end of the book--it's great, and leaves you begging more more, but in a good sense. The second ending, though, I felt was a little too abrupt, and worst of all, unbelievable. You'll see what I mean when you get there. Also, THERE IS NO PHYSICAL BATTLE WITH SAURON. Not that Tolkien ever implied a face-to-face battle with him, though, but I feel it would have made the book more interesting. To me, Sauron comes across as DUMB and WEAK. Let's get real--here's a guy who lets the ring get stolen from him at point-blank-range and now he makes ANOTHER mistake by not surrounding Mount Doom with enemies and UNDERESTIMATING Frodo and company. But apart from that, this book is really good--an excellent ending to an excellent series. But I wonder how it's going to stand up when Robert Jordan's series comes to an end."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"In this, the second book of his extraordinary series, J.R.R. Tolkien continues where the Fellowship of the Ring left off. The Fellowship has been sundered by the events which took place at the Falls of Rauros. Frodo and Sam are off towards Mordor and a date with destiny guided by the deceitful Gollum while Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli are on a quest to save Merry and Pippin.The plot of this second novel is good, although, as it is the middle act of a three act story, it is some what slow. Tolkien is setting up the final part throughout most of the novel, so the reader should not take this as a criticism. We get a glimpse of what the war against Sauron will be like when the forces of Rohan meet those of Sauruman. Tolkien is a master story teller, one who moves his characters around as a grand master moves pieces on a chess board.The characters in this novel are well developed and continue to grow. In particular, we see the Hobbits grow out of their child-like innocence because of the weight they carry and the events they are witness to. Frodo in particular will not come out unscathed, if he is able to survive his jouney into the darkness of Mordor.If you enjoyed the first book in the series you will enjoy this one as well. You will also be eargerly awaiting the conclusion. 4.5 Stars"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"After finishing the first of the series i couldn't wait to dig in to the next one. I must admit i was a little disappointed. The first book kept me in the book and urged me to read more. This one is easier to put down. This book as a lot of boring parts and even though it is very interesting it was hard to finish."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"After reading the compelling book The Fellowship of the Ring, I of course went on to read The Two Towers. I must say I was a little disappointed by this second book. The plot was very slow, and most of the book was just the group walking and wandering. Now don't get me wrong - this is a must-read if you are ever to complete the trilogy. It's just a little tough to get through. The book is at it's best just near the end."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I liked the Hobbit and the first book quite well, yet I still have not finished reading this book. I have tried for over a year now. I lost interest because the excitement within the story is gone. It feels like the author knew how he wanted the series to end, and how he wanted to start it, but had no great ideas for the middle. The prose is slow and unenthusiastic, and the characters have not developed at all. Hobbits are reluctant heroes to the point that I wonder why they are continuing such a treacherous quest. I feel almost pained to read about these gentle, naive hobbits getting into trouble time and again. I feel bad for them, and wish they would give their quest to someone more competent and enthusiastic. I started this book right after I finished the first, and I think that was a mistake. If you want to buy this book to continue the series, put it on your wish list and wait a month. When you are really dying to know what happens, and have had a break from innocent hobbits, this book may seem less tedious."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I've been reading the Tolkien books since the 70's. I'm reading Two Towers now. I re-read them every few months."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Arrived quickly. We have listened to several readings of LOTR and our family loves Rob Inglis' narration. This is completely unabridged and well performed."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"They have excellent customer service, They are dedicated to help the customer get their order correct and contact you to make sure you are very happy with them!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I recently bought a Kindle and was eagerly anticipating buying a library. One of the books that I absolutely need to have is The Lord of the Rings. (More like three books really). I go to the KIndle store. Happily buy the Fellowship of the Ring and The Return of the King. I search for The Two Towers. Not there. What kind of cruelty does Amazon have in mind? Not only do they omit one of the three amazing and astounding books, they even take the nice option to omit the one in the middle, leaving some new readers hanging on an edge not able to read any further. The Lord of the Rings was designed to be one long book. Not reading the second and only the first and third books is like reading the first five chapters of a book then the last five. Amazon has to fix this problem. Or else how will I read the adventures of Frodo from beginning to the end? Amazon should let new and old readers of Tolkien enjoy ALL three books."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I have read the Lord of the Rings eight times. It is by far the best book I have ever read. The book has a beauty that no other book or author has ever been able to capture or ever will again.The reason, in my opinion, the Lord of the Rings are such good books is the absolute selflessness of the heroes. They are willing to give up anything. The images of Gandalf standing against the Balrog on the bridge, Boromir hurling himself into the orcs at Amon Hen, or the way every man at the Field of Cormallen was willing to give up his life to give Frodo and Sam a chance of getting to Mount Doom are the examples that spring to mind.My favorite character is Sam. He is the most courageous and noble of them all, even if he does not attract as much attention as Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Theoden, Gandalf, etcetera. Sam does not give himself a thought. He always thinks,\\"what about Mr. Frodo?.\\" Sam gives Frodo as much food and water as he possibly can, only taking just enough for himself. He even carries Frodo on his back for part of the way. Sam will never give up.Another good character is Aragorn. Yes, Aragorn is a spectacular fighter who wins fame and renown on the field of battle, but that is not the reason he is such a good man. The reason is that he knows his duty and is able and willing to perform it unflinchingly. In one sentence he sums up the whole book. \\"But I am the real Strider, fortunately,\\"he said, looking down at them with his face softened by a sudden smile. \\"I am Aragorn son of Arathorn and if by life or death I can save you, I will.\\" Aragorn would rather face the Nine with an army behind them than let down the hobbits.Many people who had previously been simple folk who gave Sauron little or no thought arose and fought. Pippin and Merry are good examples of this. In the Two Towers, when they were captured by Orcs, Pippin acted bravely and resourcefully to escape with Merry. If it were not for Pippin, both of them would certainly have been slain. Pippin later fought in the Battle of the Morannon, where he saved his friend's life and was the first to see the approach of the eagles.Merry was so loyal to King Theoden that he disobeyed his order to stay in Rohan and rode in the Ride of the Rohirrim. Then, in the Battle of Pelennor Fields, he slew the Witchking, possibly the greatest single feat in the War of the Ring. (It was Merry who slew the Witchking, not Eowyn. Altough Eowyn bravely stood up to him, it was Merry's sword forged in Numenor, one the last swords of its kind left on Middle Earth, that killed the Lord of the Nazgul. Eowyn thrusting her sword into the Ulairi's face was just a gesture.)These four characters are good examples of the characters in The Lord of the Rings. There are the people who stand up and fight because they must, and those who would rather die trying to do their duty than fail.The sheer bravery of all of the people in the Lord of the Rings is amazing. They can stand in harm's way without a thought of themselves. They do not even think about their own fate, but rather the fate of the world. And they are determined to help, and take down as many foes as possible with them, dying content if they send some enemies ahead of them to pave the way if they must go themselves.Overall, this book is about the willingness of people to die for the things they believe in. The battles and feats of arms are still very exciting, but that is not what they are about in the core, although I think that the battles and feats of arms are about as far as most people see. I hope that the people who read my review will see the things I have stated."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Lord of the Rings is a fantastic piece of literature. While all of the parts are exceptional, part two, The Two Towers, is without a doubt the best of the series. The novel starts off with Aragorn finding a wounded Boromir. Boromir explains that the Uruk-Hai ambushed him and captured Merry and Pippin. This part of the series is split up into two books (Book 3 and Book 4). While Book 4 is fantastic and details the continued adventures of the Ring-Bearer, Book 3 really shines. The chapter about the Battle of Helm's Deep might be the best chapter in any book ever. For those readers rather uninterested in what happens to Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas, Book 4 will be your favorite. An old enemy of Bilbo's is back to guide Frodo and Sam, but instead leads them into a trap. One warning though. As great as this book is, do not read it unless you can soon-after beging The Return of the King. The Two Towers has even more of a cliffhanger ending than Fellowship of the Ring did. I highly recommend this great piece of work."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers includes book III and IV in the Lord of the Rings cycle. There is a ring that makes the wearer invisible, but it also corrupts that person. The ring also gives the bearer unimaginable power. In the fantasy world where The Two Towers takes place, there is the evil ruler, Sauron. To prevent the ring from falling into the hands of Sauron, it must be destroyed. The ring can only be destroyed in the volcanic caves where it was created, Mount Doom, which is at the heart of Sauron's kingdom. Frodo and Sam, the two main characters, are sent out on a quest to finish this task. Their guide is the devious, untrustworthy and deceptive creature Gollum. I especially liked this book because of all the exciting action. There were a lot of conflicts and suspensful moments, all going on at once. These events made the book entertaining to read. I would encourage every middle school student to read the Tolkien Lord of the Ring cycle."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This is the only unabridged version of The Return of the King. The reader is pretty good but SLOW!!! You really need to speed him up or just read the book on your own. If you rip this to an m4b and play fast on an iPod, it is good. I just need to find the right Android app to speed up his talking."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The second volume of Tolkien's epic trilogy never even wavers. If anything, it seems steadier and more controlled than \\"Fellowship of the Ring,\\" as several characters become more central and the plot focus widens to envelop all of Middle Earth. It suffers from a bit of sequelitis in places, but the overall book is just as enthralling as the first.Aragorn finds that Merry and Pippin have been abducted rather than killed -- for what reason, no one knows. Frodo and Sam have left on their own. So Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli race to find the orcs and retrieve the hobbits, but are stopped by the fierce Riders of Rohan, and then by an old and dear friend: Gandalf, who has been resurrected in the new form of a White wizard. Elsewhere, Merry and Pippin must use all of their wits to escape the orcs, and then find a strange band of allies that no one could have hoped for.Meanwhile, Frodo and Sam head into Mordor -- with an eerily familiar figure, Gollum, following them. Frodo subjugates Gollum, forcing him to swear on \\"the precious\\" that he won't harm him. In return, Gollum promises to guide the two hobbits through Mordor, straight to Mount Doom. But the Ring is weighing more heavily than ever on Frodo, and is starting to reassert its old sway on Gollum...One of the most noticeable changes in this book is the shift of focus. \\"Fellowship\\" was Frodo-centric, since the narration revolved around him, as did all the events and thoughts. But with the breaking of the Fellowship, the narration falls into three categories: Frodo and Sam; Merry and Pippin; Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli. This triple style allows individuals to shine more brightly, when they are called on to do more than hike with Frodo.Tolkien also presented a wider view of Middle-Earth in general. While the slow slog through Mordor doesn't really tell or show readers much -- aside from what a hellhole Sauron is the middle of -- it's shocking to see the the effects of the orcs, Saruman and Sauron on places such as Gondor and Rohan.But where Tolkien really outdid himself is Gollum. Gollum returns, in a substantially different state. Oh, he's still addled and addicted to the Ring, but he displays a dual love/loathing for the Ring, a weird affection for Frodo (who, from his point of view, is probably the only person who has been kind to him), and displays a Ring-induced multiple-personality syndrome. Very rarely can bad guys elicit the sort of loathing and pity from the reader that Gollum does.One noticeable aspect of this book is friendship. When the Fellowship sets out from Rivendell, virtually everyone is a stranger, with the exception of the hobbits. However, in this book we get our view of how much Sam loves Frodo and wants to help him. Sam is fully aware of how much Frodo needs emotional support, and he's quite willing to be a pillar of strength for his friend. We see Gimli and Legolas's affection for Merry and Pippin; and Legolas's willingness to kill Eomer if Eomer hurts Gimli shows how far this Elf and Dwarf have come.This book is substantially darker than \\"Fellowship.\\" Frodo is starting to stumble under the weight of the Ring, and other characters die or are seriously hurt. The scene where Pippin's mind is trapped by Sauron is a very disturbing one, as is a violent and saddening scene late in the book. But there is also some wry humor, like Legolas's snippy comments about pipeweed as Gimli and the hobbits smoke up a storm, and Sam's debate with Gollum about whether they should cook the rabbits.Tolkien's second \\"Lord of the Rings\\" novel is a thrilling fantasy adventure, exploring more of his invented world than \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\" did. \\"The Two Towers\\" starts heading into darker territory, and will leave readers panting for more."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"honestly, I love this book, and yes I have seen the movie and I would much rather read the book again.

Then Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimili have to battle Orcs, Goblins, and Ura-khai in their adventurous battle for mankind! I would recomend this book for people who like fantasy books."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The third book in the series was a little slow to get started and a little slow to end. I felt as if Tolkein got bored of writing it and wrapped up the final fight of the war of the ring rather quickly which was dissapointing since he had spent two books building up to that moment. I was rather attached to each of the characters by the final book though and was pleased with the ending overall, I just feel it could have been racier and faster paced. I still give this book five stars together with the other two. I don't think I've ever read such an enjoyable book in my life and I am so pleased to have read it. The whole book was truly magical and I often found myself on the edge of my seat cheering and willing the characters along."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"(See my other reviews for \\"Fellowship\\" and \\"King\\")Of the three, \\"Two Towers\\" is without a doubt my favorite.

The only thing that would have made this one better is some more mention of Rosie, because, let's face it...Rosie and Sam are adorable."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Times have become darker as the inevitable battle with the evil Sauron approaches. The Fellowship has been split up during this darkest hour. Legolas, Gimli, and Aragorn have been sent in hot pursuit of Merry and Pippin, who were captured by the attacking Urukhai. With Gandalf lost, Sam and the highly depressed Frodo press on toward Mount Doom, their journey looking more and more hopeless as it presses on. They meet with the manic depressant schizoid Gollum/Smeagol, who guides them shadily into the vast kingdom of Sauron. How can our heroes beat an evil like Sauron when there is so much darkness engulfing all of the Fellowship? Can Frodo be strong and face this faceless opponent?This book is by far one of the greatest fictional books that I have ever read. There is almost constant action at every turn, and it can keep a person's attention for hours on end. Tolkien has used his genius to create a world of fantasy and suspense that boggles the imagination. The twists that are placed in the book and the in depth descriptions of all the characters leave no stone unturned and leave the reader with the perfect view of all the characters. This story gives you a great sense of all the times of the real world too. The way Tolkien uses the dead marshes of Mordor as a visual of what he saw in World War II and the terrible things that occurred during that war. His depictions and transitions into different storylines are almost seamless, leaving you wanting to get through the next chapter to see what happened with the first. This book is by far one of the great fiction novels of the time."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This book is incredibly written, and it keeps you hooked.

While the strange creature gollum is leading Frodo and Samwise to Mordor Legolas, Gimli, and Aragorn are battling the Oruci at helms deep. With all this in mind there is still more to tell, Merry and Pippin are also in this book escaping from the Oruci and convincing the Treefolk to wage war with Saruman himself.I'd say the climax of the story is at the very end ..."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This book definately bests its predecessor, The Fellowship of the Ring. There is less description and thank god, less SINGING! The part of the book that really won me over was Book 4. And especially the last 2 chapters! I don't want to give anything away, but I read them in one sitting. It was great. At one point, it got me crying. This is definately the best part of any book in the trilogy! The only reason I gave this book 4 stars is because of Book 3. I found it pretty boring, except for a few surprises here and there. If you read the Two Towers, just skip straight to Book 4 and fasten your seatbelts. It's going to be a great ride!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This book is the second part to a fantastic triology. I can't understand how anyone would miss out on story like this!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This book is better than the first one as all the ground work has been laid and I was familiar and attached to all of the characters by this point. It was really interesting to discover more and learn more of the character Gollum and to meet other creatures and life which wanders Middle Earth. This book was FULL of surprises that I didn't see coming with a wonderful ending that kind of gave me the creeps. I'm about the start the third and final book."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This book was good. It has adventure and battles. It was boring and dragged on in some places. I liked it because Gandalf came back. I suggest that you read The Fellowship of The Rings first. This is the second book of a trilogy The Lord of the Rings.Boromir dies while defending the hobbits Merry and Pippin from Orcs. Merry and Pippin are taken towards Saruman by Orcs. Strider, also know as Aragon, Gimili and Legolas decide to rescue them rather than follow Frodo and Sam. Merry and Pippin have to run with the Orcs, and they do for 12 days until the men of Rohan attack. A sneaky Orc tries to run off with the two hobbits but he is shot. Merry and Pippin head into Fangorn. Fangorn is an old, musty, dusty forest but fangorn is also the name of an Ent or tree herded. The hobbits meet Fangorn or Treebeard who is curious about the \\"hasty\\" folk and asks them to tell their tale. When Treebeard hears about Saruman, he is outraged, for Saruman told him he cared about the forest where he was just trying to get the Ents out of his way. Treebeard gathers Ents and they go to Entmoot, a council to decide on what they are going to do. All the Ents become angry and they leave to destroy Isengard. Meanwhile Aragon, Gimili, and Legolas are on the Orc's trail and they see many clues such as dead Orc bodies on the side of the road. The Riders of Rohan are approaching so they hide in the grass. When they go by, Strider stands up. The Riders want to know all about them and they give them two horses so they can search for Merry and Pippin. Their horses are scared off in the night so they must travel by foot. When they reach the spot where the hobbits meet Treebeard they see an old man. The man is Gandalf who is now Gandalf the White. Together they go to the Lord of Rohan. Gandalf tries to council Theoden but Wormtongue, his servant, talks him out of it. Gandalf sends Wormtongue away and then Theoden decides to fight Mordor. The riders of Rohan ride to Helm's Deep where they are trapped by Orcs. Once they beat the Orcs they ride to Isengard. There they all see what damage the Ents did, they knocked down the wall and flooded it so the only thing remaining is the tower Orthanc. Merry and Pippin meet up with Aragon, Gimili, and Legolas again. They tell each other what has happened and they go with Eomer and Theoden to watch Gandalf talk to Saruman. They can't convince him to give up Orthanc. Wormtongue throws something down and Gandalf says it's of great value.Frodo and Sam climb down a cliff using their elfish rope. Gollum, who has been following them, has climbed down after them. They try to tie him up but he screams that it is biting him. Frodo makes Gollum swear on the ring to lead them to the Gates of Mordor. Gollum does leading them through marshes and valleys. When they get to the gate, Frodo knowing no other way in is trying to decide how to enter. Gollum begs him not to and tells them of another way that isn't guard so closely. The hobbits agree and they once again start walking. Sam while cooking, his fire stars to smoke and Men of Gondor find them. Frodo talks to Faramir who is Boromirs brother. Faramir tells them that Boromir is dead but he thinks the rest of the company survived. While they are talking Sam gets angry and let's slips that Frodo has the Ring, but Faramir doesn't care. The Men of Gondor capture Gollum and they leave after farewell gifts of fine wooden staffs. Gollum leads them to a tunnel where they climb the Straight Stair and the Winding Stair, and then he disappears. Frodo and Sam make their way through. They see light and Frodo runs ahead and Shelob, a giant spider who lives in the tunnel and feasts on all who enter, catches Frodo. After shaking of Gollum, Sam comes to his rescue. Sam thinking Frodo is dead takes Sting, the Phial, and the Ring. He begins to travel towards Mordor when he hears Orcs. They take Frodo and one says that he's not dead just sleeping. Sam, who is very angry with him, follows the Orcs.You'll like this book if you read the Fellowship of the Ring. If you like adventure and magic you will also like this book. This book is a challenge because there is a lot of big words. This book also has lots of battles and fighting so if you're interested in that kind of book you'll enjoy reading this."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The second volume of Tolkien's epic trilogy never even wavers. If anything, it seems steadier and more controlled than \\"Fellowship of the Ring,\\" as several characters become more central and the plot focus widens to envelop all of Middle Earth. It suffers from a bit of sequelitis in places, but the overall book is just as enthralling as the first.Aragorn finds that Merry and Pippin have been abducted rather than killed -- for what reason, no one knows. Frodo and Sam have left on their own. So Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli race to find the orcs and retrieve the hobbits, but are stopped by the fierce Riders of Rohan, and then by an old and dear friend: Gandalf, who has been resurrected in the new form of a White wizard. Elsewhere, Merry and Pippin must use all of their wits to escape the orcs, and then find a strange band of allies that no one could have hoped for.Meanwhile, Frodo and Sam head into Mordor -- with an eerily familiar figure, Gollum, following them. Frodo subjugates Gollum, forcing him to swear on \\"the precious\\" that he won't harm him. In return, Gollum promises to guide the two hobbits through Mordor, straight to Mount Doom. But the Ring is weighing more heavily than ever on Frodo, and is starting to reassert its old sway on Gollum...One of the most noticeable changes in this book is the shift of focus. \\"Fellowship\\" was Frodo-centric, since the narration revolved around him, as did all the events and thoughts. But with the breaking of the Fellowship, the narration falls into three categories: Frodo and Sam; Merry and Pippin; Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli. This triple style allows individuals to shine more brightly, when they are called on to do more than hike with Frodo.Tolkien also presented a wider view of Middle-Earth in general. While the slow slog through Mordor doesn't really tell or show readers much -- aside from what a hellhole Sauron is the middle of -- it's shocking to see the the effects of the orcs, Saruman and Sauron on places such as Gondor and Rohan.Changes can be seen in Frodo even in this book, and which become more pronounced in the third book of the trilogy, \\"Return of the King.\\" He becomes sadder and more introspective, and the Ring's growing hold on him can be glimpsed at times. Aragorn is also changing. He is no longer merely the rugged outcast Ranger, but displays the hints of a future great king, if he can only get to his throne.Merry and Pippin also change: these two innocent young hobbits have to suddenly Sam is more promiment in this book, as Frodo's friend and personal pillar of strength.But where Tolkien really outdid himself is Gollum. Gollum returns, in a substantially different state. Oh, he's still addled and addicted to the Ring, but he displays a dual love/loathing for the Ring, a weird affection for Frodo (who, from his point of view, is probably the only person who has been kind to him), and displays a Ring-induced multiple-personality syndrome. Very rarely can bad guys elicit the sort of loathing and pity from the reader that Gollum does.One noticeable aspect of this book is friendship. When the Fellowship sets out from Rivendell, virtually everyone is a stranger, with the exception of the hobbits. However, in this book we get our view of how much Sam loves Frodo and wants to help him. Sam is fully aware of how much Frodo needs emotional support, and he's quite willing to be a pillar of strength for his friend. We see Gimli and Legolas's affection for Merry and Pippin; and Legolas's willingness to kill Eomer if Eomer hurts Gimli shows how far this Elf and Dwarf have come.This book is substantially darker than \\"Fellowship.\\" Frodo is starting to stumble under the weight of the Ring, and other characters die or are seriously hurt. The scene where Pippin's mind is trapped by Sauron is a very disturbing one, as is a violent and saddening scene late in the book. But there is also some wry humor: Gandalf's joke as he hears Saruman throttling Grima Wormtongue, Legolas's snippy comments about pipeweed as Gimli and the hobbits smoke up a storm, and Sam's debate with Gollum about whether they should cook the rabbits.Tolkien's second \\"Lord of the Rings\\" novel is a thrilling fantasy adventure, exploring more of his invented world than \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\" did. \\"The Two Towers\\" starts heading into darker territory, and will leave readers panting for more."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"\\"Return of the King\\" is the worthy climax to J.R.R. Tolkien's epic saga, the fantasy that created the genre as we know it today. Now, as the blockbuster movie adaptation is over, many readers are checking out the dramatic story that ends Tolkien's masterpiece and life's work.The story opens where \\"Two Towers\\" left off. Gandalf has ridden to the city of Gondor with Pippin (partly to keep him out of trouble), where the forces of Mordor are attacking. There is upheaval in the city itself, as the steward of Gondor is going nuts. Merry pledges his service to King Theoden of Rohan, not knowing what is ahead for the king and his relatives. And Aragorn is seeking out allies to fight Sauron on a military scale, even if they can't defeat him unless the Ring is destroyed. His search will take him to tribes of forest-dwellers, to Gondor -- and even to summon an army of the dead.In Mordor, the unconscious Frodo has been captured by Sauron's orcs, and taken to the fortress of Cirith Ungol. Sam is desperate to free his friend, but knows that he can't take on an army, and that Frodo would want him to finish the quest. Sam manages to free Frodo from captivity, but they must still brave more dangers before they can come to Mount Doom, the only place where the Ring can be destroyed. As they travel Sam sees Frodo slipping further and further into the Ring's grasp. Will Frodo be able to destroy the Ring?Usually, the climax of an epic adventure is a disappointment. \\"Return of the King\\" succeeds in almost every way, wrapping up each individual storyline, one by one. The ending has a feeling of finality; this is one story that could never have a sequel; Tolkien shows that in a struggle against evil, there is no true \\"happy ending.\\" Even if the good guys win, there will still be scarring, and death, and haunting memories of what once happened. And even if a person survives, he will never be the same.This is the grimmest of the three books in this trilogy. Aside from Frodo's emotional deterioration, we also have Merry becoming almost catatonic after the battle with the Witch King, and Denethor's descent into suicidal madness. There is a lot less humor, though it is still there: Pippin and Merry both thinking about food, Gandalf's reaction when Pippin pledges his sword to Denethor, some choice witty comments of Frodo's in the last chapters, and Gimli's half-joking threats to axe Eomer if Eomer doesn't consider Galadriel the most beautiful woman in the world.Though a section of the book near the end descends into near-biblical prose, which changes post-Gondor, Tolkien does not waver in his ability to evoke emotion. One of the most touching scenes in the book is when Sam finds Frodo naked, unconscious and being beaten by an orc. Others include Merry's farewell to Theoden, Eowyn's slaying of the Witch-King, and of course the bittersweet final scene.Frodo is almost unrecognizable in parts of this book. The bright, naive young hobbit of the first book has been worn down by the pressure of the Ring, to the point where he seems to be only a pale shadow of himself. As he grows increasingly attached to the Ring, we even see him doing what seems unimaginable: threatening Sam with a dagger. Sam has come a long way from the shy young hobbit who couldn't say a word around the High Elves -- now he's attacking orcs and carrying Frodo to Mount Doom.Merry is exposed firsthand to the horrifying consequences of war, and Pippin moves past his initial flakiness in an effort to be a serious warrior. Aragorn breaks completely from the mold of rugged ranger and into the new status as a king, leading armies (both living and dead) without flinching. As far as the supporting cast goes, Legolas and Gimli assist as well; their friendship grows deeper, even as Legolas falls completely in love with the sea. And the icily passionate war-maiden Eowyn affects the War of the Ring in a stunning way that nobody could have predicted.The story doesn't really end on the last page; for more background, especially on Aragorn and Arwen, readers should also read the appendices at the end of the book. Another good addition is \\"The End of the Third Age,\\" in which the unpublished epilogue of LOTR can be found. Though this is probably not canonical, it nicely concludes the story and is a heartwarming look at what happens in the years following LOTR.It's difficult, once the story has finished, to accept that one has to say goodbye to Middle-Earth and its enchanting inhabitants. But as Gandalf says, \\"I will not say: do not weep; for not all tears are an evil.\\""},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Lord Of the Rings part II The Two Towers by: J.R.R. Tolkien is a spectacular book to read. It's full of adventure, fantasy, and twists, this book has it all. It has the action, the drama, the suspence, the romance, and the comedy. You may have seen the movie, but you haven't seen anything, until you've read the book! My friend suggested I read the Fellowship of the Rings, so I did. After about 3 chapters I fell in love with it. Then I finished the book and I was upset with how long it took for me to read it. So I went and took a reading class to improve my skills. After I finished the course my friend lent me the Two Towers...I was nervous about reading it at first because of the length. Then I had a reading assignment and so I figured why don't I read this book. This time within the first two pages I felt really involved in the book.The Two Towers is the second part to the journey of Frodo Baggins, and his quest to destroy the One Ring that could bring Middle Earth to an end. It tells two different parties stories and how they fit together. One story is Frodo's story about his journey to destory the ring, and the obsticles he must overcome to continue on his quest. The second story is Aragorn(who is heir to the throne of Gondor), Legolas(an elf of the Woodland Relm), Gimli(a dwarf, Son of Gloin), Merry and Pippin's(hobbits, who are distant relatives to Frodo) story. They were his company and were supposed to lead and protect him from harm as the venture towards Mt. Doom, which is where they must go to destroy the ring. In the first book he left his companions to keep them from danger. This is their tale and what happens to them after Frodo leaves.If you are really into fantasy, action, drama, suspencful, or science fiction books, then you will love this book. I honestly thought I would hate this book, but I soon found out I was in love with it. I would recommend this book to people over 10 because of he vocabulary that J.R.R. Tolkien uses. I really love it and if you read it you will too."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Adventurous, that is one word that I us to explain Return of the King. True friends will be there until the end. This is really reflected in this book. I believe that everyone can relate, because you have been down and out, but there was someone there for you. Out of nowhere young Frodo Bagins was given the human race in his hands.In a little village called The Shire where all was quite lived hobbits. In the fires of mount doom Sauroman a ring to rule them all other rings that were given to kings, elves, and dwarves. Frodo has the ring and on his way to Mordor to destroy the ring. To help him along the way is his long time best friend is Sam Wise Gamgey. Along the way they have picked up a guide named Gollom or (Smegal). He helps them to get to Mordor but also causes some trouble.His friends Gandalph, Legolas, Arogorn, and Gimli are fighting to keep the human race from being destroyed. Arogorn the heir to the throne of Gondor has taken the sword to become king. He has been told to \\"become who he was born to be... \\"Once Frodo and Sam get to Mordor there friends distract Sauroman's army so that Frodo and Sam get in side the volcano to distroy the ring but there is a surprise, which I can't tell what that is.There are three other books before this one like The Hobbit, Fellowship of the Ring, and The Two Towers. I recommend that you the other books before you read this one so that you know what is going on before Return of the King. I would recommend this to anyone looking for adventure, and excitement these are the books to do so. In the books you learn more about the characters and the impact that I has on their lives."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Excellent book. I love the time and thought that Tolkein put into his charcaters."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"In only the form that Tolkien can give, we find that the Fellowship has all but split apart, where frodo and sam head of towards Mordor, while Strider and the others go off to save pippin and merry from a horrible death.The books takes the reader more in depth, emotionally and otherwise, with the main characters. We find that the fellowship has only been split up physically. Everyone is starting to find the strength in themselves to go on and fight for what they believe in even if it spells out their own death.This book is another reason why Tolkien is one of the best writers of his generation. A very moving book."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"LOTR III: The Return of the Kings, like the other works of Tolkien on Middle-Earth, is very time-consuming and yet truly worth your time.

I've just always run out of gas after the first 1000 or so pages so it made sense to just start with this one and give it the attention it deserves (especially after seeing the film). I was suprised at how much I enjoyed the journey of the hobbits back to the Shire to kick some hindquarters as toughened warriors. Also, this was the first time for me that a book (or movie) took the time to delve into the feelings of the protagonists as their heroic climax passes and they fade back into to normal life. I found it useful in my own life."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I have read this book 4 times, and expect to read it perhaps 20 or more times before I die.Such a book as deep and priceless as this simply cannot be written and marketed in todays shallow consumerist world. This book is a priceless treasure. When I finish the Return of the King, I can feel it in my bones for several weeks afterwards. The sadness and nobility of this work of art lingers like a sword-wound from a wraith, though immensly pleasurable."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"\\"Aragorn sped on up the hill. Every now and again he bent to the ground. Hobbits go light, and their footprints are not easy even for a ranger.\\" The second book in the trilogy of the lord of the rings. The book starts with the company broken into to three groups; one group is Arogorn, Legolas, and Gimli. The other group is the made up of the hobbits Sam and Frodo, Frodo is the leader of the fellowship. The final and most pitiful group is the group with Marry and Pippin the two other hobbits who have been stolen by orcs and are on there way to Isengard. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimili are following marry and pippin day and night. Sam and Frodo are headed to Morodor but are lost in a endless fog of ridges and hills. On their way to catch Marry and Pippin the men of Rohan slottered all the orcs and Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimili are know looking for Marry and Pippins. They meet up with pippin and Marry in the most unlikely of places. Sam and Frodo come across some very unfortunate encounters.I would recommend this book to adventurous people. If you really love the Middle Ages this is a great book. The book goes along at a rather slow pace. If I could find one downfall of this book it would be too much description. But overall it is a great book."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This review will tell you a brief report on The Return of the King by J.R.R Tolkein. The book starts off with Sam and Frodo adventuring. They run into many hardships. Then the war at Minas Tirith takes place. Many casualties happen in the war but in the midst of fighting Sauron's forces just disappear. If you want to know what happened... READ THE BOOK!This book was really good. It pulls you in so you can't stop reading until you finish. This is one of the major parts in the book that really amazed me. I also liked how Tolkein wrote this book. The writing really was astonishing and I think he used exactly the right words. Another element that I found in this book that was phenomenal is that he describes things in the book very well. Obviously Tolkein has a wonderful talent for writing and I feel that this book was excellent.I did not dislike this book at all. Although I wish Tolkein could describe the characters more and the scenery that a certain character is in. The other thing I did not like was that sometimes things could be too long in this book, which would make some parts boring. This was one feeling I hated when reading this book because it is pretty lengthy. The last but not least thing that I did not like about this book is that sometimes I couldn't understand at times what Tolkein was trying to say because he uses advanced vocabulary, which is why this book is not for kids. This book was wonderful but if Tolkein could fix the problems that I mentioned it would be breathtaking. Overall I did not think that this book was bad at all.I would recommend this book to any adult or young adult who loves fantasy and enjoys a long sit-down because this book is very lengthy. In my opinion before I read this wonderful book I would read the first two books of this trilogy. Thank you for reading my report I hope you liked it."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Return of The King concludes the adventures of the people of middle-earth that were chronicled in The Fellowship of The Ring and then in The Two Towers. As in the previous two installments The Return of The King is divided into two books, Book 5 and Book 6.Book 5 takes place in the land of Gondor, one of the last resisting outposts to the dark forces of Sauron. New characters are introduced such as the evil king of nazgul, Dernhelm the warrior of Rohan and most notably Denethor, the steward of Gondor and father of Boromir and Faramir who is now living in his twilight years. The characters of Faramir and Eowyn are also expanded on in considerable detail. In preparation of Sauron's dark forces waging a battle against Gondor, Aragorn gathers around his armies to fight back. Pippin and Gandalf ride into Gondor and Pippin becomes part of the towerguard. Many people of Rohan also join Gondor in the fight, including Dernhelm, King Theoden and Merry, who was left behind in The Two Towers. As the forces of Sauron approach and the great battle begins, Denethor slips into madness and becomes suicidal, wanting to pull his own son Faramir down with him.It's not until halfway through the novel, in book 6, that we get to read about Sam and Frodo. After a climactic battle in the tower of Cirith Ungol against the giant spider Shelob, Frodo is captured and now a prisoner of the Orcs. Sam however has managed to escape with the ring. His first instinct tells him that he must now carry on the quest to destroy the ring by himself but as loneliness and the weight of the ring bears in on him, he decides to turn around and attempt to rescue Frodo. As Sam and Frodo continue their journey and etch closer and closer to the fires of Mount Doom, they encounter several obstacles along the way, including marching armies of Orcs and the ever-looming presence of the slinking creature Gollum.Book 5 and book 6 are quite different in tone and structure. Book 5 is admitedly very wordy and talkative. There are lots of slow passages and in-depth character development that often made me wonder whether I really was reading the conclusion to one of the greatest epics of all time. The battle sequence is only described over 20 pages or so. The author does not go into great detail attempting to describe it however, he places such vivid images in the head of the reader that we can easily picture in our minds what is going on. The reward for reading through the at-times murky first half of the novel is that when we fnally get to follow the adventures of Sam and Frodo in Book 6 the action becomes non-stop and the suspense never lets up. Tolkien is so good at describing their journey that he managed to make me feel what the charactes were feeling. As I was reading, I actually started to feel hungry, thirsty, physically drained and increasingly sympathetic towards Sam's frustration with Gollum's antics.Curiously, by the time Sam and Frodo's journey comes to an end, there is still about 100 pages to go. These first few pages start off with reunions, gatherings and farewells. As I was reading these first few pages, I started to worry about the the daunting prospect of having to read through 100 pages of farewells and sob stories but it turns out ol' Tolkien had a few more tricks up his sleeve. As the hobbits return to the Shire, they discover one last major obstacle awaiting them. These pages are easily among some of the best in the entire series.Reading The Return of The King on the eve of its theatrical release, I can barely contain my excitement and anticipation at seeing the spider Shelob, the cracks of Mount Doom and especially the battle of Gondor put to film. It is rumoured that the battle of Gondor will be the biggest battle scene in cinematic history. In an interview I read Peter Jackson mentions that the grandeur of this battle will easily eclipse the epic battlle at Helm's Deep in The Two Towers. To give an idea of just how big the battle will be consider this: At Helm's Deep there were approximately 300 middle-earthians defending the wall and 10000 Orcs trying to barge through it. Well, multiply the number of people behind the wall by 5 and the number of Orcs by 7 and that will be the battle of Gondor.Suffice to say, I cannot recommend this book highly enough. I find The Return of The King to be the most satisfying part of the trilogy. And as for the slow moments, they are alleviated by Tolkien's beautiful artistic prose filled with ultra-clever metaphors. There is a difference between simply reading Tolkien and understanding Tolkien and I am quite pleased to see that other reviewers have enjoyed this book as much as I have."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I would have to say this Lord of the Rings book is the best of all three. It is so well written and the story is just beautiful. This is the one where all of the emotion is put out and you just want to cry in some parts or just become so tense that you feel as if you're in the battle of the Pelennor fields or on the cracks of doom. Pure beauty and a must read for ages to come for all ages."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I learned what tears of joy and tears of exquisite beauty were the first time I read this book.

Enter Middle Earth with an open heart and you will find things you never dreamt of. I just bought a ticket to watch \\"The Return of the King\\" by myself.

Tolkien is the third installment in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The book holds the final conclusion to the magical journey the \\"fellowship\\" has undertaken. Like the second book, the Two Towers, the first half of the book is devoted to the fight between men and evil, where the second part of the story chronicles Master Samwise and Frodo's quest to destroy the ring! What I liked about the book was the vivid description of the battles in the first half as well as the look in to some of the lesser known characters backgrounds and stories (Eowyn and Faramir most notably). The buildup to this conclusion had been so great and developed in the first two books, The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers, that I was a little concerned it might be too much for Tolkien to unwind. However I totally underestimated him as he brilliantly concluded the storyline in a series of well described battles and undertakings. Yet he does not stop there, after the final deed is done he still leaves a little bit of story to tell about the return to the Shire for the Hobbits.The theme of this book most undoubtedly is the rise up of smaller men (hobbits) to heroic proportions. Although this is a commonly seen theme in literature, no one has mastered it quite like Tolkien did in this trilogy of books. It is a very inspiring story to read and you can almost feel for Frodo because of the burden he has undertaken in the destruction of the ring. One can relate to Frodo when they feel like they have a burden they most get rid of and Tolkien makes it so we can confide in Frodo's story be it fantasy or not.Not only would I recommend this book to people, I think of it as a must read for all. I do however recommend reading the trilogy from start to finish not skipping books or jumping around. This way you will see the transition of growth for each character throughout the series. \\"And that's the end of that,\\" said Sam. \\"A nasty end, and I wish I needn't have seen it; but it's a good riddance.\\""},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This book is a must getter!

It begins as in medias res as it gets. We jump in to the journeys of Gandalf (the White since The Two Towers) to the great city of Minas Tirith in Gondor, the land of men. Tolkien does a great job, as in most of his novels, of displaying the setting with such vivid words that the reader needs only to sit back and watch the world move in front of him. Gloom is foreshadowed for all races of Middle Earth as they know that their only hope lies with two little hobbits of which the whereabouts are unknown. Battle is inevitable and preparations are made for such a war that the earth has never seen. It's putting it mildly to say the people were skeptical about where they would be a year from that moment. Later, in Book 6 (chapters in the trilogy) of the series, the setting immediately jumps to Frodo an Sam and their journey to the hopeful destruction of the great Ring of power in the dark lands of Mordor, more specifically Mount Doom. Many suspenseful and thought provoking situations present themselves to the reader as they are taken along for a journey through the most evil of all places in Middle Earth. The book served as a great close to a great series in which many real life situations are symbolized in the lives of different people working together for a common cause."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The final part in the three part Lord of the Rings, the Return of the King finds our heroes in a tight fix. The forces of Darkness are on the march: Frodo is captive in Mordor, Gondor is under siege, and the remainder of the fellowship, lead by Aragorn, is missing. In other words, things aren't looking good.The plot, once again, is masterful. You can't get any better than a story conceived by a professor of English Literature at Oxford. Tolkien is a wordsmith equal to the best of them. However, he doesn't take three pages to say something which can be said in a paragraph. There's something to be said for brevity.The characters have been maturing throughout the novel, and the third part is no different. Frodo is coming into his own, as are the remaining Hobbits. The question is, will they be able to step forward and do something epic in nature???I loved the way Tolkien wrapped it all up, and the appendicies are a treasure trove of information on what happens afterwards, what happened before, etc... Honestly, when I finished this book way back in high school I had a tear in my eyes. Very good stuff. This type of novel comes along once in a lifetime, if that often."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"&quot;The Return of the King&quot; is the final volume of Tolkien's masterpiece, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. There is nothing else that has ever come close to comparing to it - although many have tried. &quot;The Return of the King&quot; is a wonderful conclusion to Tolkien's fantasy. The finale by itself is well worth reading over and over again. Unless you have been completely spoiled by modern interpretations of fantasy, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; should be in your permanent library. Be sure to read the first volume =before= the new movie comes out, as I have heard that they changed many events, and left out others in the interest of brevity. Every fan of fantasy should read &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; at least once in their lives. My very highest recommendation for any fantasy book."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The powerful ending of The story of one rings fate... the final clash between good and evil is fought ONE OF THE GREATIST BOOKS I HAVE EVER READ!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"READ THIS BOOK.

It answers alot of questions I had form reading the Simirilian,and added some more. And BIG battles, when I say big, I mean BIG (well for those times :)). If you ever read a book, make it The Lord of the Rings!!!!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The urge to see Middle Earth and the sadness to see it &quot;end&quot; when I (with other reviewers) finished the book, makes me wonder if we were'nt made to inhabit some world that has more in common with Middle Earth. I mean, when I thirst;there is water:when I hunger;there is food. Now I am home-sick for Middle Earth; does'nt it exist?! Only a master writer like Tolkien can explain a world that creates such a yearning that invokes such a question. He was an avowed Christian so the answer may be in Heaven with him. If so,I wonder,is Middle Earth still &quot;in&quot; Tolkien, or is Tolkien &quot;in&quot; Middle Earth now ? If the latter is true,then I am going to ask him; &quot;Is there room for some fans of yours too?&quot;"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Of Tolkien's well-known quartet of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, The Return of the King is the best. The suspense builds as the war comes to its climax. In the West, all efforts are put towards defending the city of Gondor, chief city in Middle-earth, and main defense against Mordor. In Mordor, Sam continues to help Frodo towards Mount Doom, where the Ring can be destroyed. But the closer they get, the weaker Frodo becomes, and the stronger the power of the Ring becomes. Every scene is beautifully written, and even with all the action, the characters still take center stage. The writing is almost cinematic; is feels that real. It's a novel that scares you, grips you, makes you laugh and cry. One of the best novels ever written. After the climax, you begin reading more slowly. Not because it is not interesting, not because it moves slowly by its own nature. You read more slowly because you do not want it to end. After reading these novels, you will not want to leave this world behind. I have one complaint and one complaint only about this book: it is too short. If you die without reading The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, you have missed the greatest joy in literature. Do yourself a favor: read these books."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This is number two in an epic that has to be read. Tolkien is one of the best fantasy writers ever"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"great price, fast shipping. love that this item is not just a reading of the book, but a whole production. brings the story to life. my 11 year old son recently discovered LOTR and loves to listen to the discs at night before bed. i haven't listened to much of it, so I can't comment on whether or not the discs contain the full complete story or if its abridged in parts. the purpose of the purchase was entertainment for my son, not to take the place of the written story."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"My daughter just started this book. I had to pick it up and reread it. I had forgotten so much and yet it was an old friend that was good to visit with again."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Despite its staggering length and dreary descriptions of every leaf, Fellowship of the Ring has a certain fairy-tale sheen and epic sweep that make it readable for all. The Two Towers, though, is mostly for diehard Tolkein fans.The first 200 pages or so climax with a huge battle for Helm's Deep, but for most of that time we have to endure the stupefying company of the warriors of Rohan. These beefy blonde Nordic guys have NO sense of humor, and drone on endlessly about their ancestry (who CARES?) when they're not indulging in soporfific courtesies. I always feel uneasy around these hulks--I expect to see swastikas appear on their shields at any moment. Tolkein was channeling the Viking types immortalized in coma-inducing epics like Beowulf and Lord are these fellows boring!However, hobbits to the rescue! At one point we switch to Merry and Pippin, and once they appear, the story moves again and we can enjoy characters with human foibles. These two doughty halflings endure capture and torment by orcs (goblins, who are much more entertaining than the ski-instructor types) and then wander into the world of the ents. If you thought tree-hugger Tom Bombadil was weird, these creatures will get you howling with laughter. They are tree-shepherds (I'm not making this up) and they more or less look like trees, but they go around saying things like &quot;Hm. Hroom&quot; and drinking lots of water. Later on, they turn out to be pretty tough, bringing down a whole walled city in minutes. Treebeard is their leader and he's right out of some Saturday morning cartoon show.The second half of the book brings us back to Frodo and Sam, and their journey to Mordor. They team up with Gollum, who was much creepier in The Hobbit. Here, he's a whiny reptilian nuisance and we must conclude that Frodo is an idiot for trusting him since anyone can tell he's up to no good. When he sells out his companions to a gigantic spider, we're not surprised. Tolkien manages some wonderful descriptions in this part, of the suffocating, foggy, wet, evil weather in Mordor (sounds like Long Island in the summer). The spider Shelob is a hoot, a creature who needed to wait for computer generated graphics.Again, most of the text is filled with dreary step by step schlepping from place to place, with tedious descriptions of EVERYTHING. There are superb moments (the orcs boiling out of their hiding places like swarms of ants, the disgusting marshes) and as anyone with half a brain knew, Gandalf returns (and he is the BEST character of all). The scene where Gandalf humiliates the evil wizard Saruman is worth the price of admission. And the slinking, cowardly Wormtongue is a great creation--if Tolkein hadn't written this in the 1940's, I'd swear he was based on Henry Kissinger.So enter at your own risk. Some exciting scenes, lots of sludge, basically a bridge from Fellowship of the Ring to The Return of the King. Not for anyone with arachnophobia."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"THE TWO TOWERS was more enjoyable than I remember THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING being. There's more action and intrigue, and the thickening of the plot was enough to want me to read THE RETURN OF THE KING as soon as I was finished. There's much good to say about this book, but its two flaws are more interesting.The first flaw is endemic to Tolkien. Its what I think of as the \\"eagles drop out of the sky\\" problem. Too often, Tolkien paints his characters into seemingly inescapable situations, only to be rescued by some new, external force. I was most annoyed by this by rescuing eagles in THE HOBBIT, but the problem re-occurs, albeit to a lesser extent, in THE TWO TOWERS. The problem here is that the characters rely on un-foreshadowed luck rather than their wits, or some element introduced earlier in the book (or series). This problem is especially acute near the end of the book, where a hobbit humbles a giant spider that apparently has been so formidable for years than even armies of orcs had been at its mercy.But the ending has other problems as well, not the least of which being the missed chance for Tolkien to fool the reader into thinking that Frodo, one of the main characters, is dead (until the next book). We think that for a few pages, but the book ends, serial-like, with Frodo's friend Sam realizing that he's alive. Not only do we miss the suspense generated by Gandalf's apparent death at the end of THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING, but the ending seems too unresolved, even for a middle book."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I somehow made it long past adolescence without reading THE LORD OF THE RINGS books. I read THE RETURN OF THE KING and the others (in order, of course) because I wanted to before the movies came out. Somehow I didn't get into these books as much as I felt I should. I found the battle scenes no less boring than the over-extended descriptions of journey. The smaller-scale conflict, especially the part of the story revolving around Frodo and Sam were more interesting, but requiring a greater suspension of disbelief. The climatic moment in the final book (more than 100 pages before the actual end of the book) was anti-climatic in the extreme, and while a friend of mine who is a devotee of these books found Sauron's lack of appearance to be \\"brilliant,\\" I was disappointed. The evil faced by our heroes had a name, but no face, I guess (the move got around this by explaining that he is non-corporeal).Still, the last 100 pages, essentially a post-script, brought the whole series together for me. The allegory was strongest, or at least most obvious, here. The hobbits are a race of Cincinatuses, only wanting to mind their own business. They are totally innocent and un-ambitious. That's why they were the only ones who could be trusted with the evil ring. At the same time, they were all too quick to accept authoritarian rule without question or resistance. Frodo lost his innocence to save the world, but a little loss of innocence was needed to save the hobbits from their own apathy. The message of the last part of the book is that evil must be engaged; those who hope to ignore evil will be suppressed like everyone else, and ultimately give in to its ways.As for the battles and daring escapes, they didn't do it for me. Battle participants are often built up as Davids and Goliaths, with Goliath always losing because of David's will, luck, outside help, or reasons unexplained. Seldom do our heroes' wits or cleverness get them out of trouble, more often they are saved by eagles dropping out of the sky. Still I will miss these characters and enjoyed the movies. I'm actually thinking of re-reading THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING. Maybe someday I'll re-read this one, too."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Towers is a good book. Frodo and Sam travel closer to Mordor with Gollum as their guide. The rest of the fellowship gets the Ents (trees) to help destroy Isengard and Gandalf come back. I would recommend this book more to adults becaus they talk alot and some parts get boring. But some parts are good and make you keep reading. I recommend this book to 10 year olds and up."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The final book of Lord of the Rings is a wonderful novel which shows the last defence against Sauron. I recomend that you read the rest of the series first."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I think it&#65533;s fair to say that this book is not as good as the first one in the series, nor is it as good as The Hobbit. But as the middle piece of the trilogy of Middle Earth, it serves a method for getting from point A (Fellowship of the Ring) to point B (Return of the King). And in that, it does a good enough job.When it comes down to it, here's the truth of the matter. This is the least enjoyable of the trilogy. But if you're going to read the first and last books, you can't skip the second book. It just doesn&#65533;t make sense. Too much of the story transpires in book 2, and since the trilogy is ultimately 1 huge book divided into 3 segments, there's no way to skip to book 3 without first stopping at this one.My main problem with this book is that there isn&#65533;t enough action nor dialogue. It might be better stated that there&#65533;s too much transition and not enough action. I believe Tolkien does his best work when he's writing about character interactions in any given scene. The Two Towers lacks in presenting the reader with enough of those situations to keep them interested.The story is generally good enough, though at times you do scratch your head. Some of the story lines seem to come to a point where Tolkien didn&#65533;t know what to do next. I think, all in all, that's how this book struggles the most.The struggle is one of trying to put a few good ideas in book of this length. There simply aren&#65533;t enough of those ideas to make it go as far as it needs to go. With that, it seems to me that Tolkien invents new scenes that enable him to add pages to his story. These scenes often times seem forced, as if he didn&#65533;t even buy into them.All in all, the book does a fair job as the middle child in this 3 step series. It doesn't bore you to the point of putting it down. Ultimately, the main story line is consistent with the main arrow of the narrative; a narrative which has good doing battle with evil in 2 different arenas.As a stand alone book, this one would never be a keeper. But as it is, this trilogy is not meant to be 3 individual books but 3 read in succession. So there's no need to look at it as a book on its own.This review serves to warn the reader that #2 is not going to be as exciting as any of the other 3 in this story (including the Hobbit). However, since the reader undoubtedly will buy and read the trilogy as one, few people will be reading any review here with an eye towards trying to decide to read this book or not.So proceed on with the trilogy, get ready for a bit of a slower ride than either of the previous 2 books, and chew off as much of this one as you can as you make your way to book #3."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"ummm... where is the american kindle version? fellowship and return of the king have kindle versions in the states... please make two towers as well... then i can give you money"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"While Tolkien's epic has its obvious flaws : the blatant racism,simplistic politics and superiority of Westerners he beats you over thehead with, the wonderful setting is not to be denied.Pitched battle as decoy is not too bad a stunt either, as they try and given Sam and Frodo more time to destroy the One Ring.After this, the repercussions of this war for Middle-Earth are felt closer to home for the four fuzzy short guys."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"(See my reviews for \\"Fellowship\\" and \\"Two Towers\\" also).Return of the King is probably my least favorite of the three. I think that my main problem was that I kept getting confused with all the battle portions. Sometimes, action does not translate well into words, this is one of those times. There's nothing wrong with the book, I just have to work harder to follow this one. I do like the return to the Shire, and I wish that that portion had gone on a bit longer, or that Sam's adventures as mayor would have been written (even as a separate book...not officially part of the trilogy, like \\"The Hobbit\\"), etc."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I admit, Tolkien is an excellent writer. He is vivid, descriptive, and ultimately creative. Unfortunately, not everyone can get into Tolkien's fantasy worlds, all thanks to our MTV-based society.

Sam and Frodo press on to destroy the ring in Mt. Doom, and the rest search for the Orc-Kidnapped Merry and Pippen. This novel left me in laughter, awe, and sometimes even in tears. I don't want to spoil the ending, but I will tell you this: After I completed The Two Towers, I had to immediately start The Return of the King, just to find out if what happened really was what I thought happened (those who have read it should know of what I'm talking).Two words: Read it."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This book, THE TWO TOWERS by JRR Tolkien was incredible.

Frodo has his faithful friend Sam Gamgee and also an unlickely companion called gollum. who also seeks the power of the ring. there are only two things wrong with this book however, 1 you dont know how it started unless you read the first book fellowship of the ring, and 2 you wont know how the story ends until you read the third book return of the king."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Lord Of The Rings gets my vote for the absolute best series of all time.

Although The Fellowship was an outstanding book which sets up the rest of the story, it can't compete with The Two Towers. With far more action and different sides of the story to view from the reader is engaged in the action resulting in anticipation and wonder.The Two Towers is well written allowing an easy read for people of all ages. Although it is written in a different style than that of non-fantasy books, it is still written for an easy understanding. With a well devised structure and an effective flow in the way The Two Towers is written, the reader is more likely to stay interested in the story and want to read on. With such a detailed plot J.R.R Tolkien paid great attention to the description of each scene and what is going on to allow the reader to picture what is happening in their mind with extreme detail.Of course without a good story, there is no way a book could succeed. It doesn't matter how well it is written: if the story isn't interesting then there is no way the reader is going to keep reading. With a well thought out plot and many details to the story, The Two Towers can get a little confusing. There is always an appendix (located in The Return of the King) to look at if something is a little confusing. This allows the reader to stay with the story and not get lost.The way The Two Towers is written and such an engaging plot, Tolkien created a masterpiece that will keep even people who aren't into fantasy stories entertained. The attention to detail allowing for an easy read for people of all ages, The Two Towers will be a book read for decades to come."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers by J.R.R. Tolkien is a wonderful read. It is the continuation of the journey of the Fellowship. However, in this part of the book, the fellowship is broken. In the beginning, they are deciding where to go and they end up with an ambush of orcs. Boromir dies defending Merry and Pippin who are taken away by the orcs. Legolas, Gimli, and Aragorn fight off the orcs and end up not finding any of the hobbits. Frodo decides that he must go to Mordor alone but sure enough, loveable Sam ends up going with him. The book is broken up into showing the journey of Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli and what Merry and Pippin do as well. Another part is the travel of Sam and Frodo to Mordor that takes place at the end of the book.I have to be honest and say that I was already a fan after seeing the first movie and then reading the first book. I had to read this book and I ended up loving it because of being a fan of Tolkien. Nevertheless, it is how he writes that makes me and so many other people love his work.There was action in it that helped get me through the book. Some parts I enjoyed were Gimli, Legolas, and Aragorn on the hunt of orcs to rescue Merry and Pippin. Nevertheless, Merry and Pippin end up escaping and enter Fangorn Forest where they meet a new creature called an Ent. Actually, the Ents are the tree people, who are able to move around and talk but they look like trees and are very old.Some other neat parts are the destruction of Isengard and the defeat of Saruman and a very exciting battle at Helm's Deep that is in a way my favorite part of the book.However, for me it is somewhat hard to choose my favorite part since I like the book so much. Not every part however was as exciting as the battle at Helm's Deep, there were some down times when reading the book, but I have come to expect that when reading Tolkien.I love this book and I recommend it to anyone at all interested in The Lord of the Rings. It is worth taking the time to read which will fly by when reading such an exciting book. You will be transported into another world that is so interesting and fun. Go read The Lord of the Rings and step into the world that is Middle Earth."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This second volume of Tolkien's \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" begins with chaos. Boromir is found dead, pierced by O rc's arrows, and Merry and Pippin are gone. Frodo has tried to escape and journey to Mordor alone, but his faithful comrade Sam followed. The remains of the Fellowship, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli decide to let Frodo be. Their part of the task is over, now it is time for other battles. They try to save Merry and Pippin instead (who save themselves pretty well), and then they all travel to Isengard where the once so mighty and good wizard Saruman dwells...On the way they meet some new characters, for example the old Ents, and the riders of Rohan. At the same time Frodo and Sam struggles on to Mordor, a long and weary journey . However , they are getting some unexpected help.The Darkness is rising, and the only one who can save Middle-earth is the once so cheerfullittle hobbit who deeply regrets his thirst for adventure...The turns in this story are pretty interesting, the characters change as the great war draws nearer, and so does Middle-earth. It becomes darker, and not as cheerful as before. The Elves are going westwards as Sauron's forces draws nearer. This part of \\"The felllowship of the Ring\\" is a lot more mysterious and misty than \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\". Frodo, who used to be happy ,and mild realises what he is about to do, and the heavy burden on his shoulders almost kills him. Only one thing keeps him going, -his task, to save Middle-earth which makes him a good deal more powerful in his way of talking and acting . Luckily he has got atrustworthy comrade on the road. Sam would never betray Frodo ; even though his master is not always nice to him.. Another one who has changed a great deal since \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" is Gandalf, who returns from what everybody thought was death. Saruman has in his desperate search for power allied with Sauron, and is no longer on the side of the good. This task is now Gandalf's, he has become Gandalf the White, the mightiest wizard in Middle-earth. When he meet s Merry and Pippin they are at first afraid of him. He is very powerful and not as cosy as before. Aragorn is also changing, from the Ranger to the King.I think that it is a pleasure throughout to read \\"The Two Towers\\". In one way, it is kind of strange since the only thing they do is walk, and maybe fight a little sometimes.There must be something in Tolkien's way of writing that makes \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" so extremely good. But what? I think it is because of the fact that nothing is predictable.Suddenly a new character runs out of the forest and the story turns violently ( for example the Ent Fangorn,or Faramir). We should not forget the Palant&iacute;r who is overcome in Isengard. The stone has been the window between Mordor and Saruman since his betrayal. Now at least that link is broken. The most fascinating thing though is the change of Middle-earth. At least I was left in the \\"Shire-mood\\" longer than I probably should have , thecheerful and bright fairytale . It was a bit of a shock when suddenly everything was dark and serious. Perils and battle are one thing, but the creeping darkness is another. No one is asinnocent and light of heart as before. That is the greatest difference between \\"The Two Towers\\" and \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\". Tolkien also uses the language to create this mood. His way of writing is wonderful, after all he has come up with new languages, and new letters. It is fair, and often as wellthought over as in a poem. I have never read later fantasy with a more beautiful language.Even though the movie was extremely good, you can't compare it with the book. But promise me that whoever is reading this lousy bookreview will both watch the movie and read the books..."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers by J.R.R. Tolkien was a great book. The book was full of action, suspense, and a great thriller. Aragorn is my favorite character. He leads the battle at Helm's Deep. Aragorn is very brave and heroic. Frodo is the ring-bearer. He is the one who must toss the ring into the fires of Mordor. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who loves action and suspense."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Although ther are many fantasy books out there in terms of imaganitive power the Lord of the Rings trilogy has them all beaten.This book is in a class all of its own."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This Book is one of the greatest books ever writen and is over flowing with nonstop action. You must read the first two books in order to enjoy this one. It begains with Gandalf and Pipin going to The White City which is attacked in 5 days from their arrivel. The action does not let up tell the end. And in the end the ring ends up destoying itself."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The biggest master piece of all times. JRR Tolkien is a genius. Who ever likes good fantasy story telling, most read the works of Tolkien. Most of all The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy and The Hobbit. Ones you start reading this books you never want to stop. If you found Harry Potter wonderful, JRR Tolkiens work will blow you away."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"If you haven't read &quot;the Fellowship of the Rings&quot;, but saw the movie,you will still be sufficiently primed for the next chapter in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Interestingly the book is divided into two complete sections: one devoted to Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli and Gandalf, and the second to Frodo and Sam.This &quot;chapter&quot; of the trilogy for me contained much more heart pounding action as the stories wind up to their climaxes in the last book.Being a big fan of the Robert Jordan &quot;Wheel of Time&quot; series, I became very aware of the many similarities between the two, and where Jordan most likely got a lot of his inspiration.Reading this you can see why it's considered one of the great classic pieces of literature, while still being as vibrant and exciting as any modern work on the bookshelf."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I thought that this book was enjoyable to read because of the setting and it being a fantasy. Another reason why I enjoyed it because of the battle parts, I thought that those were so discriptive. I chose a quote from the battle seen at the Rock. \\"Yet there are many that cry in the Dunland tongue,\\"said Gamling. \\"I know that tongue. It is an ancient speech of men, and once was spoken in many western valleys of the Mark. Hark! They hate us, and they are glad; for our doom seems certain to them. 'The king, the king!' They cry. 'We will take their king. Death to the Forgoil! Death to the Strawheads! Death to the robbers of the North!'\\"To me the theme of the book is the battle of good and evil and not letting evil over take you. And also not to let evil possesions control your life and what you were meant to be in life. It relates to my life and probably everyone's life because the battle of good and evil will always be there forever.I would recommend this book to the people that have read this trilogy because if you didn't it would be very confusing. Especially if you didn't read that Hobbit, the first book, because you wouldn't know the characters in the story and you wouldn't know the struggles with the Ring and how it came about. Also if you have seen the movie, The Fellowship of the Ring, then read the book also because the movie left out some of the parts."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"'The Two Towers,' in my opinion, proves itself to be superior to its predecessor, 'Fellowship Of The Ring.' One reason that I feel 'The Two Towers' is able to accomplish this is the story's overall pace. At one point in 'Fellowship of the Ring,' seventeen years went by where almost nothing took place. In 'The Two Towers,' there is very little room for our main characters to sit and rest. There is far more action in 'TTT' than that of 'FOTR,' and it is because of this that the second of the three books in the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy is all the more enjoyable. Even the ending (which I refuse to spoil for those who've not read it) is far superior. This one leaves you thinking, \\"No! They can't end it like that!!\\" Fortunately, it doesn't end here, and next on my reading list is the final chapter of the \\"Lord Of The Rings\\" trilogy, 'Return Of The King.' After completing 'The Two Towers,' I can begin to see where George Lucas got many of his ideas for 'The Empire Strikes Back,' just as I could see how J. Michael Straczynski had gotten many ideas from 'Fellowship Of The Ring' (as well as the other two 'LOTR' novels) for his TV show 'Babylon 5.'"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers is the second Installment in The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy.It is a most beautifully written story and you will soon find yourself on middle earth,the place where the story takes place.

The creativity of J.R.R. Tolkien was aw-inspiring and strange denizens and other surprises became ubiquitous (but not overused) fast. Odd creatures and humanoid races were commonplace. Settings were amazing and truly contrived of the stuff of fantasy. Also, the storyline was unique and well concieved. All of the characters were unique and spectacularly designed and each had his/her own personality and individual dispositions. I loved the structure and how the author would describe a period in time from one place or point-of-view, and then tell what happened elsewhere during the same period of time. Ultimately it was.... well, fantastic! I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Return of the King, by J.R.R Tolkien, is a wonderfully written book concluding the three part trilogy of The Lord of the Rings. This book takes place in the world of Middle Earth, during the Third Age (there are 4 Ages in this book). The book starts out with Gandalf and Pippin riding towards Gondor and Minas Tirith. When they arrive, they find that the Grand Steward, Denthor, morning the death of Boromir, his oldest son, and trying to figure out what to do about the impending attack from Mordor. Meanwhile, Frodo has been captured and Sam goes into the land of Mordor to save him. After the rescue, they run into Gollum, and he tells them he will help them to the Crack of Doom and destroying the Rings. They begin the journey, but soon they realize that Frodo is getting weaker because the Ring is getting stronger. At the same time, in the land of Rohan, the Riders of Rohan are mustering to help Gondor in the desperate struggle. Along with them is Merry, who helps them. In the land of Rohan, Aragon is now revealed to be the heir of a great power. He goes into the land of the dead, (No, NOT MORDOR!) There, he gathers an army of dead, now, he is revealed to be the King of Gondor! Back in Gondor, all the forces are colliding, the forces of Mordor, led by the King of the Ringwraiths (Given power by Sauron, the lord of Mordor and the true owner of the Ring), the Riders of Rohan, led by Theoden King, the Men of Gondor, led by Gandalf, and the army of the Dead, led by Aragon. Who will prevail? Back in Mordor, Sam, Frodo, and Gollum are making progress towards the Crack. Will they make it in time and save the day? The writing style of Tolkien is WONDERFUL. Many fantasy novels are based on this trilogy, as is The Chronicles of Narnia. &quot; There were long hairy breeches of some unclean beast-fell, and a tunic of dirty leather. He drew them on. Over the tunic went a coat of stout ring-mail, short for a full-sized orc, too long for Frodo and heavy. About it he clasped a belt, at which there hung a short sheath holding a broad-bladed stabbing sword.&quot; This book is AMAZING!!! The trilogy is well written, and I was brought into this trilogy, that I thought that I was actually IN Middle Earth!!!!! If I could give a higher rating of this book, I would give it 2 thumbs up and 100 stars!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"A great book that continues Tolken's series Which shows the powrs of good and evil on the verge of war and the fate of the one ring this book is one of the greatist fantesy books ever writen!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers is the continuation of the Fellowship of the Ring. I would recommend this book only to those who have read the Fellowship first, for the Two Towers picks up right where the Fellowship left off. I enjoyed the Two Towers immensely. The Battle Scenes are richly detailed and present the reader with a picture that rivals the best scenes in Braveheart. I cannot wait until I purchase the Return of the King, for it is the 3rd book in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. I would recommend all 3 books to a reader who enjoys the fanstasy genre or even to someone who just wants an encompassing story with one of the best plots you'll ever find."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"you really cant put this book into words. im just gonna say that its my first love (as in books). it was the first great book ive read. but now i wish i hadnt read it first because now all other books seem dull. if you dont believe me. look at the reviews below this one."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"'The Return of the King' brings the epic 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy to a close, ending one of the greatest fantasy tales of all time.

Those who adore epic adventure, huge stories, rich histories, and interesting places to vistit will *love* this book."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"damn, and thats all u can say, damn this is a good boo"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The finale to the Lord of the Rings series has come! This book has, of course, started with the long Minas Tirith chapter, with Pippin and Gandalf. Pippin meets the citizens. Then, it goes over to Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli's point of view. Aragorn has to live out his destiny of becoming king. Next, there's Merry back in Rohan. Merry just does something. It transitions towards those points while the battle of Pelenor Fields is about to begin, and Aragorn is trying to return to his home nation of Gondor so he can get the throne. But, it goes over to what I think is the climax (Sam in Cirith Ungol attempting to rescue Frodo). Sam, the real hero, and Frodo are trying to destroy the One Ring once and for all in the Cracks of Doom. Sauron still continues to carry out his men to eradicate Gondor and Rohan's men. The battle between fate begins...This is (so far) my favorite book ever! Although, it takes long to read, you'll get immersed into it if you have a strong imagination. It's full of specific details and hordes of excitement. You may not expect the ending, but you'll love it. Better than 'The Hobbit'! You'll get it if you're in high school. No matter what you do, buy that book! If you're a hardcore fan of J.R.R. Tolkien, this is the book for you. Yes!!! - Nathan"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"What is more important in a book than the characters or the storyline of action and adventure? In Lord of the Rings the Return of the King, Tolkien creates an immense variety of important and interesting characters. These characters form a fascinating story that wouldn't be the same without them. Some of my favorite characters are Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli. These characters are the heroes, but what would the story be without villains for the heroes to battle? Among the ranks of these villains are the Dark Lord Sauron, his puppets Saruman the wise, the Nazgul, as well as the many Orcs and Uruk- Hai that are their slaves. These characters are of many races. For example Legolas is an elf and Gimli is a Dwarf.Tolkien creates a mystical story that demands to be read over and over again. This book, which is the third book in the Lord of The Rings trilogy, is quite possibly one of the best books I have ever read. When J.R.R. Tolkien wrote this book in nineteen fifty- six, the thirst of readers for fantasy was extraordinarily great. This trilogy provided a quench of this extraordinary thirst for fantasy. This masterfully written book which is in my opinion the centerpiece of J.R.R. Tolkien's career, is probably his all-time best."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"On my grandson's Xmas list. He was pleased with the larger print and I was pleased with the price!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"As with the Fellowship, this is a really terrific book. Mr. Inglis has the perfect voice for these readings (referring to the whole series). Highly recommend to other fans."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"\\"The Two Towers\\" continues \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" history in two books after the breaking of the Fellowship of the Ring as the first part follows Aragorn, Boromir, Legolas the Elf, Gimli the Dwarf, and Merry and Pippin the Hobbits seeing as the second half addresses the eventful journey of Frodo and Samwise the Hobbits towards the land of Mordor. The author expertly introduces more fascinating creatures, timeless scenarios, and awesome battles in a dark and ominous fantasy.Continuing the creative progression, amazing entities such as an Ent or objects like the palantir provide further depth to a phenomenal epic. Insight into the menacing Enemy forces arrayed against the good people of Middle-earth is realized with the many layers of deception and intrigue while maintaining a sensible yet young reading level. Shocking reunions and unforgettable events deliver quality entertainment with subtle environmental messages.Unlike most novels, \\"The Two Towers\\" divides the separate group plotlines from the original Fellowship instead of intermixing them down a chronological perspective. The method might be confusing but minor references and a moderately short time span helps organize the proceedings.The collection I own has \\"The Hobbit\\" along with all books of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" and contains inside the final novel a comprehensive appendices and index, the ultimate standard for any author wishing to compile a comprehensive series. As with about every film-based novel, I would suggest at least not watching the movie prior to reading the book if not forgoing the movie (although it is one of the greatest movies of all time) thereby leaving the story entirely to the imagination.I highly recommend the book collection to any fan of the fantasy genre.Thank you."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Certainly a key to the success of The Lord of the Rings is that it came along at the precise point in history that it did, but there's another factor, I think, that helps account for its continued popularity today. I don't know of any other book that can be enjoyed so thoroughly on so many different levels, based on so many different understandings of the story it tells.Is the ending of the story a happy one (Sauron defeated, Aragorn claiming his rightful kingship) or sad (the passing of the elves and magic from the world, Frodo injured beyond Earthly healing)? Did Frodo fail at the moment of truth, and does that make him any less a hero? Is Sam, with his simpleminded country subbornness, a hero for his stubborn pursuit of the quest, or a fool for his stubborn refusal to acknowledge any good in Gollum, to feel any pity, which spoiled any chance of Gollum's redemption? Are the most significant powers of Gandalf and the Nazgul their magic abilities or the emotions (hope vs. fear) they instill? What sort of power does the Ring symbolize?How you answer these questions depends on who you are and where you are in life. The wonderful thing about these books is that as we grow, so do they. They can be enjoyed purely and unquestioningly on the surface tale they tell, a modern myth of action and heroism, but they have depths equalled only by the deepest tree roots. Saying that you should read these books is like telling a man in the desert to drink water. My suggestion is rather that you re-read these books regularly to see how your perception of them changes, and what those changes may say about yourself."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Ok... who is this Tolkien guy and where did he get the brians, time, and insight to write the perfect set novels.As most readers know, charactor development is a time consuming effort that sometimes leaves us readers in bad shape but here it's just a pleaseure to see them grow and adhere themselves to you.

Tokien, the eight remaining members of the fellowship continue on their quest to destroy the One Ring, the cause of much sadness in Middle Earth for many centuries.The first half of the book is about Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Merry, Pippin, and Gandalf as they pass through Rohan, Isenguard, and Fangorn and meet Th&eacute;oden, Wormtongue, Saruman, Treebeard, and many other characters. They fight battles, talk to trees, and it is very exciting. The second half of the book is about Sam and Frodo as they make their way through mountains led by Gollum (Sm&eacute;agol). It is vey different from the first half, but is still very good.This is one of the best books I have ever read; five out of five stars.

This novel contains more action and is faster-paced than \\"Fellowship of the Rings.\\" As the reader has been already acquainted with much of the lore and mythology of Middle Earth, Tolkien seeks a quicker pace in their adventure tale.Tolkien continues to paint a mythological world of wonder and enchantment. The battle scenes are particularly vivid, as the Rohan riders and the fellowship attempt to stave off an assault by Orcs. Through brilliant detail, Tolkien delivers a graphic and realistic picture of a heroic battle. Indeed, Tolkien's skill for painting masterful pictures in the reader's mind continues. Although Tolkien is not flowery in his language, he nonetheless presents the sweeping battle scenes and panoramic vistas in a straightforward, yet illustrious manner.Throughout this novel, the importance of fellowship and friendship become more evident. Sam and Frodo elicit a friendship bond that may be stronger than brotherhood. Although they were certainly close at the start of their epic, their bond has grown stronger. Their loyalty to each other cannot be broken - not by Gollum, the Orcs, or any other evil creature or power. Legolas and Grimli also put aside historic animosity between elves and dwarves and become battle-tested companions. Although they may not be as close as Sam and Frodo, they display the same loyalty and camaraderie that are essential to the strength of the fellowship, and the foundation of victory for the forces of good.Saruman remains a stark reminder of the ability of absolute power to corrupt. Although he was once the highest and most trust-worthy of wizards, he has evolved into a calculating, power-hungry fiend. It is the power and lure of the One Ring that has corrupted him and turned a once powerful ally into a hideous enemy.The character of Sam continues to develop from a comic sidekick to a true hero. By the end of the novel, Sam has become a noble hero and combatant. Although he is still a pudgy hobbit, he shows valor in the face of adversary. Although he briefly abandons Frodo when he thinks all hope is lost, he quickly understands that his role may not be as the ultimate hero, but as Frodo's loyal companion, come what may. Indeed, Tolkien reminds us that one need not might and strength to become a hero, for the potential to be a hero resides in all of us, no matter how small and insignificant we may deem ourselves.The narrative leaves us hanging, as the \\"Return of the King\\" will bring us the conclusion of their quest. Yet, even though their quest may end, Tolkien will no doubt leave open many mysteries and legends of Middle Earth."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"As the last volume of the trilogy, the reader gets an end to the story, and in fact \\"The Return of the King\\" has several places where one could end, but for those who want to continue on past the end of Sauron, past the end of the War, etc., the story continues to the end of the Third Age. \\"The Return of the King\\" was originally published on October 20th of 1955. \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" was the last recipient of the International Fantasy Award for Fiction in 1957, it was also nominated for the Hugo for all-time series in 1966, and was nominated from 2002 through 2008 for the Prometheus Hall of Fame award, before winning it in 2009. As with the previous two volumes, this one contains two books.Book V is titled \\"The War of the Ring\\" and it returns to the story of all those outside of the Ring Bearers. It starts with Gandalf and Pippin arriving at Minas Tirith to deliver the news to Denethor and takes us to the start of the battle in front of the Black Gate of Mordor. This book tells the story of a large number of characters. Only the ring-bearers are absent as characters, though they are certainly in the thoughts of those who fight the war.Book VI is titled \\"The End of the Third Age\\", though it has also been called \\"The Return of the King\\" and similar to Book IV it is starts out focused on Frodo and Sam, with the specter of Gollum tagging along. Starting with Sam's daring rescue of Frodo, it continues with the two trying to make their way to Mount Doom. However, the changes less than a third of the way through the book, when their quest comes to an end, and the rest of the book involves all the characters again. Unlike many modern books and movies, the action doesn't end with the climax, and Tolkien takes his time telling the story of the aftermath of the war.As with the previous books in the series when compared with the movie I personally prefer the book, though I have enjoyed the all the movies as well. However long the movies are, they are but condensed versions of the books, and if left unread, you will miss out on many significant characters and events, as well as be unaware of the changes made by those creating the movies from what was written originally. The movies were a valiant effort to bring this epic to the screen, and they honor Tolkien's overall story, but to fully appreciate what Tolkien created, you need to read the books."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I had the hard back books which had great maps, but they where old and very musty.

I had read the Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings when I was a teenager, I loved them and if possible loved them even more as an adult. My son would jump up and down with excitement as I read. I recommend these books for kids 8 and above and for all adults!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I remember reading an article where the author discussed which towers were possibly the two towers referred to in the title of the second novel of \\"The Lord of The Rings\\". Candidates included Ortanc, Barad-dr, Ecthelion, Minas Morgul, and Cirith Ungol. One could have included the Hornburg in the list as well, but this particular discussion did not include it. The author discussed several pairs of options, but for me the answer was simple, as it indicates at the end of authorized Ballentine edition of \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" that it is Ortahnc and Minus Morgal and that is where the action is focused for most of the two books contained in the \\"The Two Towers\\". However, if you watch the film, it strongly points to two towers as Orthanc and Barad-dr. To confuse matters more, there is a letter from Tolkien to Rayner Unwin where he states that the two towers are Orthanc and Cirith Ungol, but remember that it wasn't Tolkien that split the work into three volumes and he was never happy with the title, and apparently he changed his mind later as he is the author of the note I mentioned above. Of course, to enjoy the book it really doesn't matter which two towers the title actually refers to, but it was an interesting discussion.I believe that the second volume of a trilogy is the most difficult one to evaluate. The reader is coming into a story which has already begun, and left with no real ending. In the case of \\"The Two Towers\\", Tolkien navigates those difficulties quite well. Though certainly one should read \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" first, there is a brief synopsis, and while each of the two books in the volume leaves the story hanging a bit, they are certainly reasonable places to leave the story off. \\"The Two Towers\\" was originally published on November 11th of 1954.Book III is titled \\"The Treason of Isengard\\" and covers the stories of all the characters except Frodo and Sam (who are the subjects of Book IV). It starts where Book II left off, with Aragorn hearing Boromir's horn. This book introduces numerous new characters such as Treebeard, &Eacute;omer, King Th&eacute;oden, Lady &Eacute;owyn, and of course Grima Wormtongue. It is a tale rich in characters, and in large battles, heroism, and last ditch efforts. The book ends with victory against Saruman, but that is over-shadowed by the coming battle with Sauron and the forces of Mordor, as well as the lack of knowledge of what has become to Frodo and Sam.Book IV is titled \\"The Ring Goes East\\", though it has also been called \\"The Journey of the Ringbearers\\" and by contrast with Book III there are very few characters. Frodo, Sam, and Gollum are the main characters of this book, though we do meet Faramir during the tale of the ring-bearers as they take the ring to Mordor. This book as a darker ending than Book III, as the book closes with Frodo having been poisoned by the venom of Shelob and has been taken by the enemy, with Sam struggling to rescue him.As with the first book in the series when compared with the movie, I personally prefer the book, though I have enjoyed the movie as well. However long the movie is, it is a condensed version of the book, and you will miss out on many significant characters and events, as well as be unaware of the changes which were made for whatever reason. The movies were a valiant effort to bring this effort to the screen, and they honor Tolkien's overall story, but to fully appreciate what Tolkien created, you need to read the books."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I decided to revisit this wonderful tail and read all the way through for once. The Lord of the Rings for me is more than just a story, it's a tale of love and heartache, perseverance and triumph, shadow and dispair, loss and sorrow but also victory and friendship.

Don't miss it; it's worth every dime, and this is one audiobook that you WON'T be selling to buy another."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"It's said that J.R.R. Tolkien invented an entirely new genre, \\"Sword and Sorcery,\\" by creatingThe Lord of the Rings. Some readers will insist that Tolkien's work falls under the rubric of \\"High Fantasy,\\" but the difference between the two genres seems, to this reviewer, to be equivalent to the difference between purple and violet.More relevantly, fully 30% of all fiction books published today fall into the genre, whatever name we give it. In truth, Tolkien breathed life back into the old Northern European myths about Elves and Dwarves and Trolls.Tolkien, when he wasn't teaching philology at Oxford, academically translating Anglo-Saxon epics, working on the staff of the Oxford Dictionary of the English Language, or raising his fair-sized family, spent all his adult life creating the LORD OF THE RINGS universe, which includes the entireSILMARILLIONlegendarium.Tolkien's desire was to create a mythology for England. More properly, one might say he wanted to create a mythology for Anglo-Saxon England based upon it's Germanic roots. Arguably, England's mythology would be the mythology of the original Celts who populated the Scepter'd Isle, but so much of that has been lost under the palimpsest of Roman, Anglo-Saxon, and Norman domination that only fragments remain, and during his lifetime Tolkien admitted he did not much consider the fragments compelling.Although Tolkien began writing THE SILMARILLION legendarium in 1917, it was considered bizarre and ultimately unpublishable by the decision-makers of the day. A history of the speakers of the \\"Elvish Tongues,\\" it grew out of Tolkien's invention of those tongues. Like a classical composer, Tolkien was compelled to put his favorite sounds down on paper, and once having done so, wove a history around the development of the languages he created, which were based, in part, on Finnish (Quenya, or High-Elven) and Welsh (Sindarin, or Grey-Elven).The legendarium backed into published existence when Tolkien wrote down an episodic bedtime story he had been telling his children over the years. As written down and published it becameThe Hobbit, the story of the hobbit Bilbo Baggins and his amazing journey \\"there and back again\\" to wrest a treasure from a dragon. Willy-nilly, it contained elements of his legendarium, and quite unexpectedly, it became a best-seller when published in 1937.With his publishers clamoring for a sequel, Tolkien sat down to write it. It took him twelve years to complete, finally seeing the light of day as THE LORD OF THE RINGS. I first read THE TWO TOWERS back in 1976, just as Tolkien's work began to enjoy a resurgence. Having been embraced by 1950s longhairs, and then by 1960s counterculturists who loved its vision of a pastoral and unspoiled Middle-Earth, we in the late 1970s valued it for its escapism (and not a little for the in-joke of good-natured, laid-back Hobbits indulging in \\"pipe-weed\\"). Tolkien's popularity amongst my generation spawned the publication of THE SILMARILLION, the republication of THE LORD OF THE RINGS and THE HOBBIT in leatherbound editions with typo-corrected texts, and the production of aJ.R.R. Tolkien Animated Films Set (The Hobbit/The Lord of the Rings/The Return of the King)in those years.I own the leatherbound editions, and the old Ballantine boxed set editions (seen here) copyrighted 1966 (which I bought in 1976). It's tough to carry the leatherbound editions around (or even read them in bed) and my Ballantine editions have fallen apart due to re-reading and age, so I bought a new boxed set. I'm glad to see that the text in the new set is the corrected text, though the maps in the old paperback edition were larger and clearer.Despite being called a \\"trilogy,\\" THE LORD OF THE RINGS is not a trilogy in any real sense. Tolkien conceived THE LORD OF THE RINGS as a single volume comprising six books (plus appendices) but the original publisher split the work into three, publishing two books per volume with the appendices included into the third. The titles proposed by Tolkien for separate books were: Book I, \\"The First Journey\\" or \\"The Ring Sets Out\\"; Book II, \\"The Journey of the Nine Companions\\" or \\"The Ring Goes South\\"; Book III, \\"The Treason of Isengard\\"; Book IV, \\"The Journey of the Ring-bearers\\" or \\"The Ring Goes East\\"; Book V, \\"The War of the Ring\\"; and Book VI, \\"The End of the Third Age\\".Tolkien accepted, but did not like, the publisher-created titles, the ones most readers know. He felt that THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING was properly descriptive, but felt that THE RETURN OF THE KING gave away the ending of the story. He preferred THE WAR OF THE RING for the third volume. THE TWO TOWERS is the most obscure of the titles. Does the name refer to Saruman's Isengard and Sauron's Barad-Dur, or to Gondor's Minas Tirith and Mordor's Minas Morgul, or for that matter to the Tower of Cirith Ungol? It could be any of these combinations or others.In synopsis, it is belatedly discovered that The Ring held by the Hobbit Frodo Baggins is the One Ring, the Master Ring of all magical Rings in Middle-Earth. The Ring was created by the Dark Lord Sauron more than two thousand years before, and, having recently (as time is measured in Middle-Earth) re-established his Kingdom in the Land of Mordor, Sauron is seeking the One Ring.THE TWO TOWERS is the second publisher-created volume. It begins right where THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING ends. The storyline of THE TWO TOWERS divides in three: Boromir, killed by Orcs at the end of THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING, is laid to rest by Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli, who then set out in a seemingly hopeless pursuit of the Orcs who have captured Merry and Pippin. In the course of their pursuit they meet up with Gandalf The White, travel to the Kingdom of Rohan, and bring Rohan into the War, fighting the great Battle of Helm's Deep against the corrupt wizard Saruman.Even as the Battle of Helm's Deep goes on, Merry and Pippin, having escaped the clutches of the Orcs, flee into Fangorn Forest where they become friends with Treebeard the Ent who leads his people against Saruman himself at Saruman's redoubt of Isengard. (In a book filled with invented races and their languages, Tolkien's Ents, a race of living, walking, speaking trees is a stroke of brilliance, a paean to the trees and woods he loved so much.)Frodo and Sam leave the Fellowship in secret and set out to take The Ring back to Mordor, where, if unrecaptured by Sauron, it can be destroyed in the fire where it was first cast. Along the way, they ally themselves with Gollum, the deranged Hobbit who had held The Ring for some 500 years, who acts as their guide into the Black Land.Considering the complexities of maintaining the three storylines, Tolkien demonstrates incredible care in his storytelling. This is not simply authorship, it is the detailed craftsmanship of a master wordsmith. The Moon is in a consistent phase across all three storylines and the weather varies locally but is referenced across-the-board. In all my re-readings of THE TWO TOWERS I have found only two unforced errors: That of Faramir the Captain of Gondor, who rejects The Ring in passing (although, to be fair to Tolkien, he never actually sees it), and the fact that Sam puts on The Ring within the boundaries of Mordor but is not discovered (Frodo, who does so later, is perceived by Sauron).Tolkien, who is the Shakespeare of Sword and Sorcery, sets a high standard for fantasy authors who come after him (not that he ever imagined the legions of writers who would follow in the footsteps of Frodo and his Nine Companions) by crafting his Middle-Earth with such precision and detail.Thus, we are allowed to experience, \\"the smell of a distant wood borne from afar by a cool breeze at night.\\" The trees are \\"great ilexes of huge girth standing dark and solemn in wide glades,\\" the Valley of the Tower of Sorcery, itself illuminated with \\"a noisome exhalation of decay, a corpse-light,\\" is filled with \\"shadowy meads filled with pale white flowers . . . beautiful yet horrible of shape like the demented forms in an uneasy dream.\\" Even in a battle scene, there comes, \\"A blare of trumpets . . . a crash and a flash of flame and darkness.\\" And of Shelob, the monstrous spider of Cirith Ungol, Tolkien writes, \\"All living things were her food and her vomit darkness.\\"This is poetry. Not just adventure, Tolkien created art---a portrait in words. \\"Aiya E&auml;rendil Elenion Ancalima! Hail E&auml;rendil, brightest of stars!\\" THE TWO TOWERS deserves as many stars as it can get."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This is a awesome book. i loved this book alot. i thought that it was done very well. lord of the rings is definitly a classic series. the return of the king brings it to a great conclusion and a great end. fantastic book. if you have not read this book then i recommend you do"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"My 10 yr old wanted to watch the movies...

For me, the first half of the book was not all that interesting, being mostly battle -- however, there were some significant plot twists (such as the return of Gandalf and Pippin looking in the stone) and new characters (such as Treebeard and the ents) that made it worth reading. (For what it's worth, I absolutely LOVED the ents!!) The second half of the book is what really held my interest, being the journey of Frodo and Sam led by Gollum through the mountains. The dialogue between Smeagol and his alter-ego Gollum is most fascinating, and the character development (especially of Sam) is profound. The characters really grow and change throughout their journey, but at the core is their extremely strong friendship."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I have read some of the other reviews here and I'm surprised how much people's reactions are spread across the board.

Still a favorite. There are moments when I read this book where I can hear the call by Theoden as he leads Rohan to Gondors aid. I can smell the ash in Mordor as Frodo and Sam make their way across the barren lands and creep up the side of the mountain.What is amazing to me is that, for a book that is centered so solely about the Ringbearer and his quest, there is actually not that much time devoted to Frodo and Sam. There is always so much happening, battles and the rallying taking place to get to those battles. But all the while, as I read about these huge scenes and feel the enormity of them, I also feel how closely tied everything is and how small the world is in the sense that if Frodo fails - Middle Earth fails.I have a few favorite moments in The Return of the King. One the movie did fantastically well, the other was completely ignored by the movie.The first is, of course, Eowyn's battle with the Lord of the Nazgul. If Middle Earth were a real place, if we were allowed to go there and to live in whichever place we choose I wouldn't choose the peaceful land of the Shire, the cold beauty of Lothlorian or the regal beauty of Minas Tirith. I'd choose Rohan. The strength of character in the men there is apparent even through the treachery of Wormtongue. (And I have to admit having a bit of a crush on Eomer - even more so than on Aragorn). Eowyn facing down the Lord of the Nazgul is such a powerful scene that even as I think back on it, my heart leaps into my throat and I feel a thrill from my head to the very tips of my toes.And my second favorite moment in this book is the Hobbits return to the Shire. I love feeling the confidence that they themselves feel and enjoy watching them take their newfound knowledge, skill and judgment and show themselves to be the worthy Hobbits they are. And there's something just.. satisfying about seeing their enemy reduced to what he is.I seriously could go on and on about this book and how fantastic it is. I know I've seen some comments from folks who have not read the trilogy informing me that they haven't read it because it intimidates them. Don't let these books intimidate you if you haven't read them. I envy you your chance to explore them for the first time. And if you think you know the story because you've seen the movies - let me assure you that you don't. The level of detail and back-story woven through these books is so complex that the movies, although they were beautiful and well-done, just cannot compare to the original tale put down here by Tolkien."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"There is not much that I can say about Lord of the Rings that has not already been said. I can only say how this book has affected me, and how much love I have for it. I love this book, the story, and the characters. They are not characters so much as they are friends that I am separated from only by some great distance... I am not ashamed to say that I cried when I reached the last page of Return of the King, and realized that there was no more. I was sad because it ended, because it had to end, because this was the only way it could have ended, that all of their adventures were going to go on, and that I could no longer be a part of them. I especially miss reading about Sam, and wonder what will happen to him next. Perhaps the real reason I cried was that I finished a wonderful book, and that this experience, the year or so it took me to get through the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings, that a book like this that was so real, with characterst that I still truly love and care about, was not likely to come again. Of course, there are other books I love, but for different reasons. Lord of the Rings will always hold a special place in my heart. Once you read it, it is a book that will stay with you always. It truly is as CS Lewis once wrote, \\"Good beyond hope.\\""},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Return of the King Book ReviewThe third book in the Lord of the Rings series is one of my personal favorites because it is an amazing and climactic adventure full of excitement and evil, love and hate. This book includes larger-than-life battles, and the looming reminder of evil in the form of Mordor: it is so close, and getting closer daily.This adventure takes Samwise and Frodo ever closer to an unsleeping malice, constantly searching for them. They suffer the ultimate test of friendship as Frodo ceases to be Frodo.The fellowship is broken, but they are all in the same battle, the battle for Middle Earth.In this epic novel, Tolkien really shows his true worth.

What does the king command?\\" This is when everyone finds out the question of the book's title, who really is the King. \\"The Return of the King\\" is a fictional fantasy where there are orcs, black riders, and many more mystical creatures of evil and good. Most of the story you will be traveling with the cunning and funny little hobbits that the men call Halflings.The story takes place in Middle Earth at an unknown time. The quest is for Froto to destroy the ring by throwing it into the Mountain of Doom, but then he is tricked and Sam must take the quest of the ring upon himself. Aragorn goes with his rangers, Gimli, and Legolas to the paths of the dead to fulfill a long forgotten tale that will lead to be the only hope in the war against the Dark Lord.

I find it sometimes difficult to understand what is going on in the books because they are full of so much details, but that makes it more intersting. I enjoy reading the books and finding out what each of the characters are getting up to in each book. My favourite characters has to be Legolas and Frodo.The reasons why I pick these characters is because I think they have the most intersting roles in the books and give the book at lot of character.Even though I haven't finished reading the 3rd book I found that the Appendix's were really good, it gave you alot of information about how J.R.R. Tolkein created the elvish language, the days of the months and the ages of the characters. I find Lord Of The Rings a really great set of books to read. If anybody was thinking should I read them or not, I would say that you should read the books because they are such a good read and very intersting."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"As heads roll, wizards duel, and fire consumes Middle-earth, the intricately devised world of J.R.R. Tolkien, the weight of the world rests solely on the back of Frodo, the hobbit. Small as he may be, Frodo is the only creature capable of carrying the all-powerful ring to its demise in the fires of Mount Doom. The ring was a creation of the dark lord Sauron made to ensure that he will always have power in the world. For even though the wearer of the ring has the power to defeat any force that would come against him/her, Sauron's will of evil would always shine through any goodwill that the ring wearer would intend. The defeat of Sauron's forces and the destruction of the ring is the final ending that Frodo and all creatures on the side of good strive for.The Return of the King, the third and final book of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, reveals the fate of the ring, the beginning of a new era in Middle- earth, and the final time of union for the fellowship. Many great battles ensue as legions of men at set to defend great fortresses against the force of Sauron consisting of devilish creatures, orcs. Very similar to the second book, The Two Towers, the third installment switches to and fro from the battles to the journey of the Riders of Rohan to the voyage of Frodo and his companion Sam, another hobbit. As the story goes on, the situation becomes dire for the survival of men and the castles they defend. Gandalf, the good wizard, takes leadership of the good forces and leads the men into battles that cannot be won as the battles are the only choice left for the unified troops of Gondor and Rohan.Tolkien uses the power of the ring and the hopelessness of victory to display the flaws of men. The ring is the seed of all power in the world. If a man were presented with the opportunity to have the ring, he could not refuse as Tolkien describes. Frodo, the most humblest of all the creatures, knows he cannot control the power of the ring: therefore, he is not tricked into taking the ring as his own. When Minas Tirith is then upon siege, the great king Denethor feels his days are numbered. Then his son, Faramir, is brought to him in fatal condition but not yet dead. Denethor because of the situation changes from mighty ruler to suicidal madman. He threatens to kill himself and his son and proves that men can defeat themselves just as Gandalf had warned.To say that this book is detailed is an understatement. Tolkien provides a clear description of the scenery and of each creature the lives in the world. Each kingdom of men is chronicled from king to king and war to war. Although the lineage of every man in the book is impressive, it is can become confusing when a paragraph is dedicated to genealogy and the next paragraph is a narrative of the most important decision in the chapter. The book is loaded with action and is hard to put down. With the third movie in the series coming out at the end of the year, now would be a great time to enjoy the book that answers all the questions about the ring, the fellowship, and the beginning of the new era."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Return Of The KingMy Review is on The Return of the King. The book takes placein a fantasy land known as Middle Earth.The conflict is between the forces of Mordor and Gondor, whichare countries, and between Frodo and the ring. The ring isevil and has a will of its own. It is a powerful weapon on thefinger of Sauron. The ring tries to consume Frodo as it didto Gollum, a former halfling who was corrupted by the ring.The ring is trying to get back to Sauron, its master andcreator. Sauron is the Lord of wickedness and darkness whoresides in Mordor, a wretched land.With his Ring Wraiths Sauron plans to reclaim his stolen ringfrom Frodo, who is a halfling. Frodo is trying to bring thering to Mount Doom, the only place the ring can be destroyed.At one point in the book, the King of Rohan, his emminence,known by the name, Theodin, shouts \\"Arise, arise, riders ofTheodin!\\" while he is preparing to aid Gondor. He thenfinishes with,\\"Ride now, ride now, ride to Gondor!\\"The story takes place after the prequels to it, Fellowship ofthe Ring and The Two Towers. If you haven't read the prequels,or at least watched the movies, I would advise against readingReturn of the King. The story is about the armies of MiddleEarth and Mordor clashing and the continuing journey of Frodoand Sam journeying to Mordor to try to destroy Sauron's ring atMount Doom. Gollum continues as well with Frodo and has hisown sneaky intentions.The book is large by my standards but its better that way. Itis an excellent book if you enjoy fantasy and reading of epicbattles. In the story it mentions the Paths of the Dead. Yes,this will probably confuse you at first, but it is revealedlater in the story. If you read the first two books andenjoyed them, reading The Return of the King is a must.

On there way they meet many evils and survive many great perils. Not known to them is the war going on in the pelader fields where the mighty forces of sauron are waging war with the humans. Bit by bit the forces of sauron are winning and the eye of morordor is growing stronger the forces of good are on the verge of total destruction.This book was a bit of a slow book but don't let that get you down this book has a great storyline fierce battles described areas items and people. There are some hard words but with the surrounding context it is easy to find out what they mean. Everything in this book is well thought out and nobody could match this kind of talent for such a great series. The book it thought overall was too short and it should have been at least 400 pages long and should have had a couple more battles and maybe 1 or 2 more characters to help out and play a major part in the final book.This book was definitely one of the best books I have ever read.

It tells what exacly happens to all the characters and I for one was very impressed by the detail. It did get kind of slow in the middle, but that eventually wore off like most books do.

I have read the books many times, seen the movies, and even read it aloud myself to a hearing-impaired friend -- but still, I am enjoying listening to this story, which I love so much, and am hearing more in it than I have ever experienced before. Don't miss it; it's worth every dime, and this is one audiobook that you WON'T be selling to buy another."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This is the second volume in J. R. R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy. It followsThe Fellowship of the Ringand is followed byThe Return of the King.In this part of the story, the original fellowship of nine travelers is fragmented. Some seek Mordor and the forlorn hope of destroying the one ring in the volcanic fires that produced it. Others are taken captive, and pursued by would-be rescuers. As the travelers disperse, readers become acquainted with the lands and peoples of Middle Earth. We meet the independent horsemen of Rohan, the foul orcs of Mordor, the proud men of Gondor, and the shades of past oath-breakers, eager for redemption. The schemes of wizards, stewards and wraiths become more clear. The tension builds.The middle book of the trilogy covers a lot of ground, both geographically and in character development. The characters gather their strength for war with the forces of evil. Tolkien gives his characters distinct strengths which complement the abilities of their companions. There is a growing sense that each will have a part to play in the coming conflict--a unique and indispensable part.If you have already read volume one of the trilogy, you are going to read volume two. No choice, really."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Probably considered my favorite in Tolkien's writings, Return of the King is great. Many suspenseful events end in utter triumph and inspire the reader the whole time. I think the biblical parallels can't be missed either. It does a great job tying up some details from The Hobbit, Fellowship of the Ring, and Two Towers. Wonderful conclusion to a classic work of fiction that makes the reader look for the reality to match it. I think the fingers can definitely point to the truths in the Bible to help you find to truth in this fantasy created by J R R Tolkien"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This second volume in the Lord of the Rings trilogy is faster-paced than the first and grapples more directly with the dual nature of good and evil that is at the heart of each of the three books. Each element of good has its opposite. There is the dark tower and the good tower of Gondor (hence, the \\"Two Towers\\"). There is the good hobbit Frodo and his opposite Gollum who, it is hinted, is a distortion of what was once a hobbit-like creature. There are elves and orcs. There is the good wizard Gandalf and the evil Sauron.Yet, while these pairs are opposite, they are also linked. Even Saruman was at one time a good personable fellow. Gandalf fears the ring because he can see himself becoming like Saruman and Sauron.Tolkien writes near the end of the book that the ring itself brings great power and insight, but not courage. Hence Gollum wears the ring and is sniveling; Sauron, we know, would not be so; and Frodo and Sam find courage from within. All these beings, it seems, start out as morally equivalent and should see themselves in the other. It is only after the repeated stresses of power and experience that we morph toward one pole or the other until we can barely see the resemblance. What is to account for which pole one morphs toward? I don't think it's some form of inherent virtue as much as it is chance and the cumulative force of making many good (or bad) choices that ultimately so forms our character as to overwhelm us.This book introduces the most appealing character in the work -- the ents. Whatever the metaphorical significance of these enormous, tree-like creatures (perhaps, like Tom Bombadil, they represent beings with a more perfect communion with nature than man is capable of), they are so charismatic and lovable as to steal the show.Mr. Inglis' reading is itself a work of art. He's a Shakespearean actor with the ability to give each character its distinctive voice. He interprets the text without overwhelming it. Inglis has a few peers, but there is no better reader.This is an entertaining story and great literature."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This is, as other reviewers have said, the only unabridged BOT version of this classic book. Rob Inglis does a great job reading.But: If you plan on downloading CDs onto your MP3 player, keep reading.The book is broken into 48 CDs (all 3 books (16 CDs per book)). And each CD is broken up into 3 min tracks (about 275 tracks per disc).And no freaking consistent organization.Each CD has a completely (ugh!!!) different way of titling the tracks.So, my Ipod now has 800+ 3 minute LOTR tracks . . . in no particular order!!!There's no way I can listen to the book in chronological order. Instead my Ipod shuffles randomly between tracks, changing every 3 minutes.It's a disaster.But I love this book. So, I'm listening anyway.It's the equivalent of cutting the book into 800 pieces, throwing them in the air, and then reading them: William S. Burroughs, please meet J.R.R. Tolkien."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I won't go into what Lord of the Rings is all about. If you're looking at this book you probably already know. Instead I'll tell you about the version you are looking at. This publication has a wonderful, classic feel to it. Map in the back which provides detail of Rohan and Gondor. The cover slip is great. Wonderful artwork. I purchased this version because it doesn't have the movie art work all over it. Remember, it was a book before a movie. If you're going to read the book, leave the movie behind. The Return of the King also has the Appendices and has a quality hard binding. I would recommend this version (any of three books) to anyone who wants the real Lord of the Rings experience."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"If you love the books you'll like this recording. This series is unabridged. It's something like 52 hours long for all three sets. This is what I put into my car cd player when I was trapped in rush hour traffic. It makes a good escape if you're a Tolkien fan.One reader narrates the whole book, and he does a great job of changing his voice during dialoge between characters.I've been very happy with all three of these recordings."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"the first book was just good enuph for me to try the second, but the second, this one, blew me away. JRR tolkein made this book much more interesting by cutting down on the explaining of the setting and a lot more about the plot. I also like the addition of the ents, they are just fun charactors that make you think a lot more, like how would a living tree look, and does it have a tongue? Overall, my favorite new charactor was King Theodin, how he is a ruler with many flaws, but he is still ruler, and you can't take that away. This book is a 10 out of 10 all the way, best book I ever read, and great for anyone who loves fantasy, action, blood, gore, and book that make you think."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This is the second book of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. It really kept me reading. I learned more about Frodo and Same and their quest to destroy the ring. While reading this book I could easily imagine the events. If you enjoyed the first book, The Fellowship of the Ring, you should read this book. There wasn't any part of the book I didn't like."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The final volume of \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" this novel is by far the most exciting and adventure-packed of the three. The epic battles are displayed vividly, as Tolkien delivers a masterpiece of suspense and action. From the epic battles against Sauron's minions to the Mountain of Fire and the Cracks of Doom, the action escalates toward the ultimate climax. However, the destruction of the ring isn't the end of the tale, as Tolkien delivers a rather lengthy coda to bring the quest to a conclusion, complete with unexpected twists and turns, particularly in the Shire.The most ironic chapter of this epic quest involves the corruption of the Shire. After the Hobbits have defeated evil incarnate and rid the world of the nefarious Sauron, they expect a hero's welcome in the Shire. However, the Shire has not been immune to the evil influence of Sauron and Saruman. However, this time they do not need the help of Gandalf or any other race and can handily defeat the corruptors of the Shire. Indeed, the four Hobbits have come full circle and have matured immensely. Their experiences abroad have imbued in them a noble, valiant character and act selflessly to return the Shire to its former glory.Without a doubt, Sam emerges as the hero and heir apparent to Frodo and the legacy of the Ring. In the \\"Two Towers\\" Sam performs heroically, but Frodo is still the main focus. Yet, in this volume, Sam is the true hero, as he nearly single-handedly carries Frodo to the Cracks of Doom to destroy the ring. However, Frodo certainly behaves heroically, although not in actions. The mere ability of him to resist the all-powerful allure and temptation of the ring is a victory in itself - a victory that comes perilously close to defeat, save for Gollum's treachery that backfires.Self-sacrifice and devotion to a larger cause pervades throughout this novel. For Frodo, his reward is the ability to maintain the status quo of peace and prosperity. There is no hero's welcome nor any grand reward for him. Indeed, Frodo is the most underappreciated of the four hobbits upon their return, despite his Herculean deeds. Sam's self-sacrifice and devotion to Frodo's friendship proves to be a valuable asset, as he musters every last bit of strength to carry Frodo to his goal, both literally and figuratively. However, self-sacrifice isn't just limited to the hobbits, as Gimli the dwarf, Legolas the Elf, and Aragorn and the kings of men prove time and again that their lofty goals and not about themselves, but the betterment of all races of Middle Earth.Undoubtedly, the enduring message of this novel as well as \\"Lords of the Rings\\" as a whole, is the potential for heroic deeds in all of us, no matter how small or insignificant we may be. In the Southern lands the hobbits are completely unknown, or simply thought of to be an insignificant, child-like race. However, the four hobbits in the quest perform the most heroic deeds against insurmountable odds. Indeed, if it weren't for the heroics of the hobbits in the most unlikeliest of circumstances, Sauron's shadow of evil would have permeated all of Middle Earth. The ability to be a hero lies in one's heart, not in one's brawn or muscles.Tolkien delivers a knockout punch in the \\"Return of the King.\\" Overall, the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy is a masterpiece, for sure. It is easy to see why Tolkien is revered as one of the greatest literary figures of all time."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers follows the lives of the Fellowship, shortly after they broke up. Samwise and Frodo trek on to destroy the ring at Mt. Doom, and the rest, including Aragorn, Legolas and our beloved dwarf friend Gimli search for Merry and Pippin, who had been kidnapped by Orcs. Fierce battles, amazing dialogue and very memorable characters made &quot;The Two Towers&quot; a great read. I won't spoil the ending, but, I'll tell you this: After I completed &quot;The Two Towers&quot;, I immediately went out and purchased &quot;Return of the King&quot; to see how it would end.For any fan of fantasy or fan of great writing, this is the book for you.

In the book the Two Towers a young hobbit named Frodo Baggins inherits a mystical ring. He gets charged with a deadly quest,which is to take that same ring and throw it back into the fires of Mount Doomto destroy it and to stop evil from taking over the world. He has manycompanions in his quest such as noble Aragorn, the dexterous elf Legolas, thetough dwarf Gilimi, his faithful companion Sam Gamgee and two other younghobbits nicknamed Merry and Pippin. Together they must fight darkness and bringlight back into the world. I really enjoyed this book because there was alwayssomething happening. There was only one point in the story that became sort ofdull but then it picked right back up into action. Also this book was very wellwritten and whenever it talked about a person or a place you could see them inyour mind. Another problem about this book is that is very confusing. You havetwo completely different stories going on at the same time and it is hard tokeep track of who is where and what they are doing. Overall this is a very goodbook and I would recommend it to anyone who liked The Hobbit, The Fellowship ofthe Ring, or if they like just plain fantasy."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Most young or adult readers dream about having a great book with a little bit of everything. This book has a great mix of suspence,fantasy,action, and adventure. It is divided into two parts, the adventure of Sam and Frodo, and the adventure of the rest of the fellowship of the ring. This book is much better than the first but to read it you have to read the first book. The thing that astonished me the most was how the author developed the characters, making us readers know their personalities as if they really existed. I would recommend this book to any good reader, for his dream of a great book might come true."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Tolkien is an excellent author, and if any book is needed to convince you, this is the book. I am not an avid reader, and I was suprised at how much I enjoyed reading this book. Even more suprising was how much I thought about the book when I wasn't reading it. &quot;The Hobbit&quot; was the first of Tolkien's books that I ever read, and it instantly became my favorite. After reading &quot;The Return of The King&quot; I can honestly say, I have a new favorite! No other book has such a great story, with all the friendship, drama, suspense, and action you could ask for. The only thing better than the story itself is the great ending!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Tolkien refuses to end things quite as expected in the conclusion of the Lord of the Rings.As it begins, Pippin stews in Gondor recuperating from his traumatic experience at the end of his story in &quot;Two Towers&quot; under Gandalf's watchful eye, while we see the final battle through Merry's eyes as he unexpectedly plays a major part in the end of the war. Meanwhile, Sam attempts to rescue Frodo, who is weakened both physically and mentally as they near Mordor...This is the most emotional entry of the trilogy, ending not with the war but it's aftermath as the hobbits return to the Shire only to find that trouble has hit home. Merry leads a defense as Frodo begins to learn the price he must pay for having been the Ringbearer.Not only the greatest fantasy ever written, the trilogy also becomes, in this final installment, an allegory about why isolationism doesn't work - and why sometimes the good fight has to be fought, occasionally at great cost, long before home becomes the battlefield."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers picks up the action right where it left off in Fellowship of the Ring. This installment is has a darker and more desperate tone than Fellowship. With the Fellowship sundered, there is a sense of fear and urgancy among its members. Sam and Frodo continue their journey to Mordor with the Ring. Along the way they make an unusual alliance they hope will speed their trip. At the same time, Aragorn must concern himself with treachery of Saruman while coming to grips with his own destiny.There are more &quot;action&quot; sequences in this book than in Fellowship and that may appeal to those who found the first novel dull. More interesting to me, though was how the notion of fate pervades the book. Aragorn, Frodo, Sam, and Theoden all must put a bit of faith in destiny and undertake tasks that they fear might destroy them. The notion of personal sacrifice helps put in perspective the danger that faces Middle-earth. How dreadful must Sauron be if so many are willing to lay down their lives to stop him."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"J.R.R Tolkien's writing is full of life. I have always felt as though I was watching the exiting events rather then reading them. In the continuing saga of The Fellowship of the Ring, the bond of the &quot;Nine&quot; characters proves their loyalty and unselfishness to the Ring and it's bearer. Though they are torn apart, the &quot;Nine&quot; do not break their friendship. All still play a great part in the threatening mission of the destroying the Ring. I can feel the heavy oppression all around them as they must face nightmarish reality and go where Elves fear to tread. Each characters' action determines whether all is lost or won. My only regret is that I can't read as fast as I've got to know what will happen next. Tolkien's Middle Earth is so full of unexpected creatures, humor and sorrow. He makes me want to know the intriguing stories of the Elves better, and hate the evil Orcs and Goblins with a vengeance. All the songs and poetry he writes in his books seem as though he were only translating them from the real Middle Earth itself. He puts such feeling into all the corners of his writing that it makes it seem as believable as our own history. If you have already read the Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers will take you to places you've never been, into doom or glory. Will the bond of the Fellowship save Middle Earth from destruction? Find out! Read this book of mystery, magic, love and sacrifice."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Tolkein was the original fantasy author, The Lord of the Rings his masterwork. This is the best book of the trilogy, my own copy has been reread enough that the confrontation with Sauruman is taped in, the last bit of index is missing, and the cover is well repaired. This is darker than the first, and more action packed. As the Fellowship devides, but still travels eastward along roughly the same route, we see more of Middle Earth, meet new characters, and see more action. This in an absolutely indespensible item for anyone who claims to be well read in fantasy."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This book is a great fantasy adventure full of action and suspense.In fact, I hardly ever read but with this book I read straight through! It took me through the make believe world known as Middle Earth, going into vivid details and descriptions of each area that the characters must go. From the vast forest of Entwash to the chaotic and dark kingdom of Mordor. Also, the flow of the book was steady and enjoyable because there was constant action and the book added effect by having multiple main characters.I recommend this book for everyone who wants to know what a great fantasy is like."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The magnificence of Rob Inglis' dramatization, both with respect to its place in the Tolkien Legend and in comparision to the present state of the spoken theatre, is quite simply ineffible. Here presented is THE ONLY completely unabriged reading of the Lord of the Rings to be found, and to commuters like me, it represents a long awaited opportunity to become aquianted with the work of a genius without fear of losing precious shards of his masterpiece to the whim of an editor. Worth every moment of the 20 hour listening time, from the endearing character voices to the hearty singing of songs and chanting of poetry that is sure to linger in your mind throughout the day. A purely wonderful experience for both Tolkien Veterans and the uninitiated alike."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"\\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is so secure at the pinnacle of all fantasy that any review of it risks presumption. The measure of this work's greatness can be found in the thousands of lesser works it has inspired, some in imitation, most in homage--all pale reflections of the world, the wisdom, the wonder of Middle Earth.Over the years, I have re-read this masterwork at least two dozen times. Yet it never ceases to delight me with new revelations. Over time, these revelations have evolved from discoveries about the book to reflections about myself. This is art in its highest form: it inspires, indeed, demands self-understanding.In my younger days, I was drawn to the clash of armies, the glory of battle, the valour of Aragorn and Eowyn, the sacrifice of Theoden and Faramir. But as I have aged, it is the suffering of Frodo and Sam that most moves me. The deepest courage is not found in battle, but in the act of bearing the heaviest burdens alone, beyond help, beyond hope, beyond endurance, beyond even despair--\\"that which we are, we are; /One equal-temper of heroic hearts, /Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will /To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.\\"This work is perfect in its completeness. It lacks nothing and is endowed with themes both timeless and universal.Consider the role of pity. We contemplate this theme for the first time when Gandalf reflects that Bilbo spared Gollum's life for pity. Then consider Frodo's first meeting with Gollum: \\"now that I see him, I do pity him.\\" Or Gandalf's rebuke of Denethor, \\"...for me, I pity even [Sauron's] slaves.\\" Faramir's pity for Eowyn--\\"do not scorn pity that is the gift of a gentle heart\\"--lifts despair from her soul and permits her to live and to love again. And the pity between Frodo and Sam is the bond that endures at the last when even flesh and spirit crumble. Not least, Tolkien commands our pity: and we, in the act of offering it--to Frodo, to Sam, most especially to Smeagol--take the world of Middle Earth as our own.Consider also that the little people do the bravest deeds and tread where the great dare not: the quest of the ring is undertaken not by Aragorn, nor even by Boromir, but by a timid hobbit from the Shire, whose quality is not in his pedigree or his strength of arms, but in his will and his strength of character. \\"If you do not find the way, no one will\\", Elrond tells Frodo, and, \\"This is the hour of the Shire-folk\\". Sad that since Tolkien wrote his majestic work, his erstwhile followers and imitators have fallen back on such tired cliches as swashbuckling heroes and impossibly clever heroines. The magnificence in Tolkien's creation is not to be found in the strong, but in the humble. It is about a gentle hobbit like Sam, who likes his beer and tends his garden and thinks simple thoughts, but who would stare down death while fighting orcs and trolls and giant spiders, not because he thinks himself noble or brave, but because he is far beyond the noble or the brave. Frodo and Sam are names for you and I.Consider finally, the sacrifice: Gandalf's sacrifice in Moria, Boromir's sacrifice at Amon Hen, Theoden's sacrifice on the Pelennor fields, Aragorn's readiness to sacrifice himself times beyond count. But the theme of sacrifice is most profoundly embodied in Frodo. He willingly assumes a burden that endangers not only his life, but his soul. His ordeal through Mordor and his piteous struggle up the slopes of Orodruin successively leave him with no possibility of relief, of return or, towards the end, even of release. He has long left behind any hope for himself. He goes on because he alone is charged with undoing a great evil and must destroy it or die in the trying. Beyond the terrible burden of the ring, he bears the more terrible burden of his duty to all the peoples of Middle Earth. And at the last, when he saves Middle Earth, he does so for others, but not for himself.In the end, \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is not about highbrow thematic concepts, mythic saga or epic heroism. While it is all of these things, it is also something better and simpler: a story for you and for me, centred not on impossible superheroes, but on little people--\\"The Odyssey\\" reshaped for the common folk. The enduring power of this work is ultimately founded in its simplicity. In \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", Tolkien successfully reaches the heights that all great art attains: he captures the essence and purity of transcendent truths; yet brings them home to the simplest and most innocent of sensibilities--a timeless creation not just for us but ultimately of us."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"By all means, choose this unabridged cassette version whether you are \\"reading\\" LOTR for the first time or for the umpteenth time! I debated whether to go with this cassette version of LOTR or the newly-released BBC CD set with Sir Ian Holm. Thank goodness for Amazon reviews because after reading that the CD set was NOT truly unabridged (how could they leave out Tom Bombadil?!), it simplified my decision. Rob Inglis is outstanding reader and does a fine job selecting an appropriate voice for each of the characters. I personally find it much more pleasing than a host of voices (of course if Sir Ian had done the entire CD version, I'd be back to a difficult decision). The point for me when listening to a book is to hear the story and use my imagination; too many voices or sound effects can be distracting."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Return of the King is the final part of The Lord of the Rings. In this last part the feeling of good versus evil reaches its pinnacle in LOTR. Tolkien gave incredible detail describing the War of the Ring, as it spanned several chapters. All of the characters are developed further, and for most of the TROTK, the story remains a two way split. TROTK has an amazing conclusion, and that is partly bad. Upon finishing the novel, I was sad that it was over, and I didn't want it to be over, because Middle-Earth is a great place to get lost in. You go on the journey that the Fellowship undertook, and feel everything that each member of the party felt. This is possible because throughout LOTR, Tolkien wrote vivid passages describing the regions of Middle-Earth, the characters, and what they were thinking. I read TROTK more slowly, because I wanted to stay longer than what the novel would allow. The four hobbits of the Fellowship become harden warriors, a trait that was virtually absent from their kind. Even though the novel finally came to a complete finish, it felt like it left room for more. It's to bad that there is no direct sequel, and while it answers most of the questions left from the end of The Hobbit, the reader can come up with plenty more questions upon finishing LOTR. Professor Tolkien did a work that was unexpected in its depth. He invented several REAL languages and writing systems, a complete history to back the novel, and created a wonderful world filled with diverse races and environments. Some fantasy authors may have tried to reach Tolkien's level in fantasy literature, but I am certain the The Lord of the Rings will never be duplicated. The Return of the King stands as the incredible conclusion of the greatest epic ever written. My only regret was that it ended."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"\\"Return of the King\\" is the worthy climax to J.R.R. Tolkien's epic saga, the fantasy that created the genre as we know it today. Now, as the blockbuster movie adaptation is one-third over, evidenced by Viggo Mortenson on the book's cover, waves of new readers are checking out what is yet to come.The story opens where \\"Two Towers\\" left off. Gandalf has ridden to the city of Gondor with Pippin (partly to keep him out of trouble), where the forces of Mordor are attacking. There is upheaval in the city itself, as the steward of Gondor is going nuts. Merry pledges his service to King Theoden of Rohan, not knowing what is ahead for the king and his relatives. And Aragorn is seeking out allies to fight Sauron on a military scale, even if they can't defeat him unless the Ring is destroyed. His search will take him to tribes of forest-dwellers, to Gondor -- and even to summon an army of the dead.In Mordor, the unconscious Frodo has been captured by Sauron's orcs, and taken to the fortress of Cirith Ungol. Sam is desperate to free his friend, but knows that he can't take on an army, and that Frodo would want him to finish the quest. Sam manages to free Frodo from captivity, but they must still brave more dangers before they can come to Mount Doom, the only place where the Ring can be destroyed. As they travel Sam sees Frodo slipping further and further into the Ring's grasp. Will Frodo be able to destroy the Ring?Usually, the climax of an epic adventure is a disappointment. \\"Return of the King\\" succeeds in almost every way, wrapping up each individual storyline. The ending has a feeling of finality; this is one story that could never have a sequel. With his own experiences in war, Tolkien shows that in a struggle against evil, there is no true \\"happy ending.\\" Even if the good guys win, there will still be scarring, and death, and haunting memories of what once happened. And even if a person survives, he will never be the same.Frodo is almost unrecognizable in parts of this book. The bright, naive young hobbit of the first book has been worn down by the pressure of the Ring, to the point where he seems to be only a pale shadow of himself. As he grows increasingly attached to the Ring, we even see him doing what seems unimaginable: threatening Sam with a dagger. Yet these actions make chilling sense, even when Frodo recovers his self-control only a moment later. It's a devastating demonstration of the hold the Ring has on him; he tries to resist it while knowing that he's falling too far into its grasp. When he lapses into depression and nihilism, the reader will start wondering if he can actually give it up.Sam has come a long way from the shy young hobbit who couldn't say a word around the High Elves. This book has him chasing orcs with Sting, carrying Frodo physically through Mordor, fending off Gollum, and acting as the ultimate pillar of strength for his crumbling friend right to Mount Doom. Merry and Pippin have changed as well; Merry is exposed firsthand to the horrifying consequences of war, and has a hand in destroying one of the most evil entities in the world. Pippin's adventures are tame compared to those of his friends (possibly because he's still an adolescent), but we see him moving past his initial flakiness in an effort to be a serious warrior against Sauron. Gandalf's true nature is glimpsed yet again, but in a subtler manner. Aragorn breaks completely from the mold of rugged ranger and into the new status as a king, leading armies (both living and dead) without flinching. Legolas and Gimli assist as well; their friendship grows deeper, even as Legolas falls completely in love with the sea. Gollum's degenerate journey remains intertwined with Frodo's, even though he betrayed the hobbits in the previous book; and the icily passionate war-maiden Eowyn affects the War of the Ring in a stunning way that nobody could have predicted.This is the grimmest of the three books in this trilogy. Aside from Frodo's emotional deterioration, we also have Merry becoming almost catatonic after the battle with the Witch King, and Denethor's descent into suicidal madness. There is a lot less humor, though it is still there: Pippin and Merry both thinking about food, Gandalf's reaction when Pippin pledges his sword to Denethor, some choice witty comments of Frodo's in the last chapters, and Gimli's half-joking threats to axe Eomer if Eomer doesn't consider Galadriel the most beautiful woman in the world.Though a section of the book near the end descends into near-biblical prose, which changes post-Gondor, Tolkien does not waver in his ability to evoke emotion. One of the most touching scenes in the book is when Sam finds Frodo naked, unconscious and being beaten by an orc. Others include Aragorn calling the dead, Merry's farewell to Theoden, Eowyn's slaying of the Witch-King, the literally earth-shattering climax, and of course the Havens scene.The story doesn't really end on the last page; for more background, especially on Aragorn and Arwen, readers should also read the appendices at the end of the book. I also advise readers to check out \\"The End of the Third Age,\\" in which the unpublished epilogue of LOTR can be found. Though this is probably not canonical, it nicely concludes the story and is a heartwarming look at what happens in the years following LOTR.It's difficult, once the story has finished, to accept that one has to say goodbye to Middle-Earth and its enchanting inhabitants. But as Gandalf says, \\"I will not say: do not weep; for not all tears are an evil.\\""},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"In my reviews of The Hobbit and The Fellowship of the Ring, both read by British Shakesperean actor Rob Inglis, I wrote that the sound quality on these audio books is crystal clear (neither too high, too low or distorted in any way), Inglis's characterizations are spot-on and the story itself (presented here in the only unabridged version available) is engrossing.The Two Towers continues the story begun in The Fellowship of the Ring but introduces new characters, more battle scenes and a nearly palpable feeling of impending doom as Sauron and Saruman search for the ring.Speaking of new characters, I don't think you'll ever find characters more fascinating than Ents. Ents are walking, talking trees found in Fanghorn Forest. Treebeard (a most &quot;unhasty&quot; Ent) is their leader. He's the oldest living thing in Middle Earth. As Inglis read these passages, I could almost picture the unhasty trees talking to Merry and Pippin. And I longed to look into their very old, wise eyes as they did.The bottom line: The Two Towers (part two of the Lord of the Rings &quot;trilogy&quot;) is equal to the previous books in every way.Which means there really isn't much more that needs to be written. This is, without doubt, the best audio books edition of The Lord of the Rings available.How do you know if The Two Towers read by Rob Inglis is right for you? Well, if you...1. Love Tolkien's stories.2. Have drive time on your hands.3. Enjoy hearing a British voice.4. Don't want to here a &quot;dramatized,&quot; multi-voiced version.5.

Tolkiens trilogy continues in &quot;The Two Towers&quot;, the second book of the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy. The first book, &quot;The Fellowship of the Rings&quot; (read my review on it, too!) end with the breaking up of the Fellowship. The Company is faced with a choice, whether to continue on with Frodo the hobbit to Mount Doom to destroy the ring, or travel to Minas Tirith, capital of Gondor, to help fight the evil Sauron's forces. But in the end, Frodo secretly goes off alone with his faithful hobbit friend, Sam, to Mount Doom. The other members split up to try to find them.Here is where &quot;The Two Towers&quot; story begins. Boromir is killed while trying to protect hobbits Merry and Pippin from the evil orcs. The three other members of the Company, Aragorn the Ranger, Legolas the Elf, and Gimli the Dwarf, set out to rescue them. They realize that the orcs are not of the forces of Sauron, but someone else. Then a member of the Fellowship Gandalf the wizard, whom they thought was killed, tells them that the orcs are working under the wizard Saruman. Before Saruman had been good but had turned to evil and wants the powers of the Ring. Gandalf tells them that Merry and Pippin have escaped are in the capable hands of Treebeard and the Ents. Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli to instead go to the lands of Rohan to help King Theoden in the upcoming war from the forces of Saruman. Here ends part one of the book. The second part tells about Frodo and Sam's quest to the land of Mordor with the unexpected help of... Gollum!J.R.R. Tolkien is certainly a genius, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy have such a depth to it! Middle-Earth is so believable with all the legends, history, geography, language, and races so thought out. Reading the books, I was captivated and couldn't put the books down. Probably one of the best books I've ever read, or will ever read.One of my favorite characters is Legolas the Elf. Elves are so fascinating to me. They're so mysterious, so a part of nature, and a good companion to have. It's so funny how though Elves and Dwarves don't get along too well, Legolas and Gimli are the best of companions and inseparable. Another favorite character is Pippin the hobbit. He's so cheerful, brave, and seems to always get into trouble!I can't honestly say which of the books if my favorite since they're all fantastic. My suggestion to you is that if you are planning to read the books, you should have the whole trilogy on hand, &quot;The Fellowship of the Rings&quot;, &quot;The Two Towers&quot;, and &quot;The Return of the King&quot;. Also I think it will be a good idea to read &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, which is a prelude to the trilogy and it tells how Frodo's uncle, Bilbo Baggins, go a hold of the Ring. Most enjoyable I think for ages 12 and up since I think the books will be a little complicated for younger kids."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This book starts off exactly where, &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring,&quot; (see my review) ends. The Nine Walkers of Boromir, Aragorn, Gandalf, Gimli, Legolas, Pippin, Merry and the Ring-bear Frodo set out from Rivendell. After their leader and guide fell into the abyss in Moria (an ancient palace of the Dwarves in the mountains), Aragorn became their leader.After emerging from the mountains, and passing through the land of Lorien, the Company faced a choice. Should they go to Mordor, where Frodo must go to destroy the Ring, the all-powerful instrument of evil and corruption or travel to Minis Tirith (Tower of the Guard) capital of the Gondor, a nation of Men who are at war with Mordor and its evil ruler Sauron.The Hobbits Sam and Frodo disappear and depart for Mordor. The other two Hobbits (Merry and Pippin) are taken captive by Orcs, despite being defended by Boromir, who is killed in their defence.In the first half of, &quot;The Two Towers,&quot; the tale of what happened to Pippin, Merry, Legolas, Gimli and Aragorn is related. In the second half of, \\"The Two Towers,\\" the tale of what happened to Frodo and Sam is related. Within the book, I much prefer the first section of it. The reunion of the Hobbits with Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas is one of my favorite moments in the book.In some ways, whenever I undertake to read, \\"The Lord of the Rings,\\" I dread the second section of, \\"The Two Towers.\\" Personally, I do no appreciate the pain-staking description of every mountain, rock and flower; I keep waiting for some actual dialogue or action to happen. Tolkien obviously had a vivid, EXTREMELY detailed imagination for he invented every single part of his fictional world of Middle-Earth to be believable. There is a history of behind all the races and some of the races have their very own languages.The problem that Tolkien may have run into in his epic work is that he lost something in attempting to achieve the grand scale he sought to produce. His heavy use of allusions to persons and events that the reader knows nothing of start off as evocative and then begins to get annoying. However, in terms of good epic length fantasy literature, \\"The Lord of the Rings,\\" started it and it is probably one of the best novels of the 20th century. One last note, remember, Tolkien originally wrote the story for his own enjoyment, he did not envision millions of people in dozens of languages reading his work."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I've been a fan of fantasy books for years, mainly because I read and fell in love with &quot;The Hobbit&quot; as a child. Yet I didn't read &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; until a few months ago, in anticipation of the new film. Once again I fell in love with Tolkien's Middle-Earth and story-telling ability. I loved the dramatic twists at the end of &quot;The Fellowship;&quot; indeed, I thought I had never read anything quite like it at the time. But the story of &quot;The Two Towers&quot; blew me away.In the first half, Book III, Aragorn leads Gimli and Legolas in hot pursuit of Saruman's band of orcs, who have nabbed hobbits Merry and Pippin. These five members of the now-broken Fellowship find unexpected allies in the Riders of Rohan, and the Ents, ancient dwellers of the Fanghorn forest. The battle at Helm's Deep with the servants of Saruman was riveting.Book IV, which deals with Frodo and Sam's journey towards Mordor, seemed very slow-moving after the events of Books I-III. Still, there are incredible descriptions of the often-barren, mountainous landscape, the hobbits' dealings with Smeagol, and occasional settings of staggering beauty (the groves and thickets of Ithilien, the Window of the Sunset). The sense of impending doom builds as the hobbits draw closer to Mordor. Yet I realized that there was no other way Tolkien could have built up to the conclusion more deliberately or masterfully as I read, late last night and spellbound, the staggering events in the final two chapters of this book.I never thought it possible that &quot;The Two Towers&quot; could be better than &quot;The Fellowship,&quot; but there you have it. I loved Merry and Pippin's encounter with the Ents, and the tree-creatures' deliberate ways. As a student of geology, I couldn't get enough of the beautiful descriptions of mountains and landscapes. I loved how everything in Middle-Earth is steeped in history and lore - even magical objects like the Palantir, with an ambiguous, almost-forgotten history, take on a deeper dimension. Most of all, I loved the moments of the truest kind of friendship. Friendship grows between Gimli and Legolas, two (initially) unlikely companions. And Frodo and Sam, always drawing closer towards the heartland of the Dark Lord, realize that now, more than ever, they must rely on their companionship and loyalty to each other.I couldn't recommend anything more highly, and would also caution you to have &quot;The Return of the King&quot; close at hand!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Return of the King gives a spectacular ending to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The final book begins as the city of Minas Tirith, capital city of Gondor prepares for war against the Dark Lord Sauron. The realm of Rohan musters all its remaining strength in the hope of saving Minas Tirith. Aragorn son of Arathorn, heir to the throne of Gondor, also gathers an army to try to save the city of Minas Tirith. Meanwhile, Frodo's royal servant, Sam, rescues him from the Tower of Cirith Ungol where a company of orcs holds him captive. Once Frodo has been rescued he and Sam set out to destroy Sauron's evil ring of power at Mount Doom in the heart of Mordor. Will Frodo and Sam make it all the way to Mount Doom through the orc infested barren wastelands of Mordor? Will Minas Tirith fall to Sauron or will they triumph to face him in the final battle?I recommend the Return of the King to anyone who enjoys fantasy, action or drama. Though before you read Return of the King, you should read the first two books in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Having read all the Lord of the Rings series, we have now come to the end of the road where the destinies of our lead characters are revealed.The battle of Gondor is vividly narrated & you feel the fear, pain & sadness of each character. Likewise, you witness Frodo & Sam's difficulties & sacrifices away from the battle field but fighting their greatest battle inside the tower where the evil Sauron resides.All stories come to an end & it is expected to be of a happy ending. However, successful as they may be in their quest, the story does not end there. Instead, their lives has just begun for a new age.I am certain, after having read this book, you cannot stop thinking what would happen next to Frodo Baggins while the rest of the hobbits are happily residing in the Shire. All I can do is wish him the best on his next journey."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Return of the King starts out slowly, but quickly builds to offer some of the most gripping and emotional battle scenes ever written. The seige of Gondor is awe-inspiring, so well written you'd swear Tolkien was standing there watching it happen before him as he was taking it all down.And that's only in the first 6 discs! It only gets more gripping from that point!*Reading* J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings &quot;trilogy&quot; (I think we all know now it's not really a trilogy, but rather seven slimmer books slapped together to make three fat ones), is wonderful. But *hearing* the books read by a master like Rob Inglis is nothing short of breathtaking. Inglis transforms the books from something you merely imagine into something you actually experience. Each character comes alive and becomes someone you'd instantly recognize should you chance meet him/her.The Return of the King follows on the heels of The Two Towers and picks up the tale of the quest to destroy the One Ring. King is written in the same way as Towers, with multiple tales going on simultaneously. In the Two Towers, the tale is split into three: Frodo and Sam...Merry and Pippin...and Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas. The tales never converge (Inglis' characterization of Gollum in The Two Towers is chilling, by the way -- what a brilliant performance!) and, in fact, seem to splinter even more at the very end of the book. (I won't reveal what happens lest you haven't heard/read it all yet.)King begins with Merry, Pippin, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli more or less together -- then going their separate ways again...only to come together, miraculously, at the battle for Gondor. And then...well, you'll have to listen for yourself to discover if Frodo succeeds.As with the previous RecordedBooks editions, this CD set is perfect. The sound quality is flawless. Very clear and crisp. Every nuance of Rob Inglis' marvelous voice is heard without spot or blemish. And the 16 CDs (some 15 hours!) seem to fly by. I swear there were times when I didn't want to leave the car because the action was so gripping.As I listened to The Return of the King -- in fact, as I experienced the entire series on CD -- I kept feeling a stirring inside of me that was hard to explain. I think it has to do with knowing one's place in the world, doing what's right, chivalry, gallantry, royalty, kings, queens, etc.For example, whenever I heard one of the characters address someone like Aragorn as &quot;lord,&quot; or when Merry and/or Pippin chose (out of love and respect) to serve their kings to the end if need be, I wondered if we're missing something these days. Actually, I longed to experience the same thing. Some days I just want to be commanded by my king. And I want to follow wholeheartedly as a loyal subject, bravely wielding my sword in battle. Life is so much simpler when you know exactly what to do. Much more clear-cut.But such is the world of J.R.R. Tolkien. Part of its allure is the majesty of the language. Part of it is the unparalleled imagery of the world he created. And part of it is the gallantry and bravery of the characters.If you're new to Tolkien's Lord of the Rings series, don't start with The Return of the King. That's the last chapter. Start with The Fellowship of the Ring. Or The Hobbit, which is the &quot;prequel&quot; to the series.But if you want some of the finest audio book experiences you'll ever enjoy, get this set read by Rob Inglis. His deep, expressive, British voice is perfect to make Toklien's world spring vibrantly to life."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers is the second part to the Lord of the Rings and contains book three and four. Without reading Fellowship of the Ring, the part of the novel which takes place before The Two Towers, this book would not make any sense at all. However, for those who have read the first part, The Two Towers extends the story for another 400 pages or so of pure pleasure.The story begins where Fellowship of the Ring left off- orcs attacking the fellowship which has been scattered, and Frodo and his servant Sam leaving by boat on their own path to Mount Doom. As one might come to realize, The Two Towers is just as good if not better than Fellowship of the Ring. This book contains a lot of fighting, even right from the first several pages. Much like Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers leaves the reader in a very serious cliff hanger. When I read the end, I couldn't wait any longer than it took to obtain the third book; as soon as I finished the last page, I got into my car, drove to the nearest book store and picked up the third part to the series.Anyone who is a fan of the first book would be committing a crime if they didn't read the second. The Two Towers is a great book. Not at any point does this part become boring and is magnicifently composed just as Fellowship of the Ring and Return of the King are."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"How could I possibly fit every glorious thing there is about this series of books into 1000 words? Tolkien is a genius; there is no way to deny that. He has managed to create an entirely different world, every tree, every creature, every nuance of language, every folktale; everything is on these pages that might possibly exist in middle earth. That I believe is Tolkien's true genius, his ability to construct this world in his head and to let us visit it, completely and fully for four glorious books. However, maybe that is not the extent of his genius. Maybe not because Tolkien also tells a ripping good tale throughout these novels. The prelude with Bilbo being swept up by a band of dwarves and being sent against his will to battle a dragon takes about a night to read, despite the fact that it covers over 300 pages. And then you start the true trilogy, and the ring that Bilbo finds which seemed like a neat little trick in The Hobbit (it grants the wearer the benefit of invisibility) this ring is suddenly so much more than a very handy parlor trick. It is THE ring; crafted ages ago in elven halls with unspeakable power and unfightable draw. Men kill for it, dwarves kill for it, everyone would kill for it and suddenly you are swept off on another adventure with another unsuspecting hobbit that covers all of middle earth and includes the fate of the world...all over this little unassuming ring that must be destroyed. The journey you take in these books will not easily be forgotten, here I am getting chills thinking about the epic battles between good and evil that spring up like weeds around the path of this little ring and Frodo, the hobbit who is charged with destroying it. These books are just wonderous, I cannot say that enough."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The reviewer who stated that, compared to the LOTR, all other books seem pointless and dull, really nailed it. One of its most compelling aspects for me is that practically the entire thing takes place in the mountains. Those of us who spend most of our recreational time in the hills, whether clinging to the side of a rock face, walking among ancient trees, or floating down a river, will find chapters that resonate clearly and speak to our inate sense of adventure and wonder. Tolkien clearly was a nature lover along the lines of John Muir, indeed I cannot but believe that Tolkien was exposed to Muir's writings at some point. Having read most of Tolkien's writings that are extant, my personal favorite passages are from Unfinished Tales, with its fleshed out versions of Turin's misfortunes and triumphs, and his uncle Tuor's epiphany at Vinyamar, and The Fellowship of the Ring's sojourn at Rivendell, with Bilbo's brilliant &quot;Flammifer of Westernesse&quot; poem and the ominous red star in the sky that &quot;glared above the trees&quot; like a watchful eye. But it is the chapter from The Two Towers, &quot;The Stairs of Cirith Ungol&quot;, that stands out in my mind as a pinnacle of Tolkien's art. His description of the &quot;accursed vale&quot; of Minas Morgul, and the hobbit's ascent up into it, seem to me so vivid as to have only come from someone who had experienced some of those horrors firsthand. The phrase &quot;wavering and blowing like a noisome exhalation of decay&quot; clearly refers to the gasses that rotting corpses emit, which Tolkien more than likely experienced in the trenches of World War One, and one can picture the author reacting to these and other wartime horrors as Frodo did, &quot;his senses reeling and his mind darkening&quot; ...&quot;tottering forward, his groping hands held out, his head lolling from side to side.&quot; Also, Tolkien's most fully drawn character is presented in TTT, the enslaved Gollum, and the confrontations with Shelob, replete with moving references to &quot;the back story&quot; (&quot;...as though Earendil had himself come down from the high sunset paths&quot;) and the imprisoned light of &quot;the last Silmaril&quot; blazing forth &quot;like a white torch&quot;, are sheer genius. The LOTR's power stems partly from its ability to conjure up as plausible a link between the mythology of ancient Europe and the present day as we are likely to get, and if there really is anything in English Lit that even compares, for imaginative output and for sheer storytelling ability, then I haven't read it."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Interestingly enough, you could read this from start to end without having read The Hobbit or The Fellowship of the Ring, but why would you want to?The Two Towers is a bit faster-paced than The Fellowship of the Ring, and the imagination factor is off the scale. Tolkien will take you to places you've never been: forests where tree-like Ents rule, or dark passages where vile creatures lurk, to name a few. Tolkien uses what I think is a brilliant strategy - he splits up his group and tells one's tale for awhile before switching to the other. You'll always be wondering about Frodo and Sam, or else Aragorn and his company at any given time. Hence, you'll end up loving the characters even more.Devour every detail of this book. It is exquisitely written, and it's a book that deserves to be read slowly and deliberately so you can soak up every last word. Tolkien writes very poetic prose. A friend much smarter than I suggested that Frodo is much like Moby Dick's main character. That is, Frodo is the &quot;archetypal Christian struggling to deal with something well past his private reality&quot; (his words). I don't agree 100 percent, but it certainly is food for thought."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers is the second part of Lord of the Rings. It was hard to come to a decision, but I have to say that this favorite out of the three parts. With most of the questions left from The Hobbit answered in The Fellowship of the Ring, Tolkien kicks up the action and takes the suspense to a new direction in The Two Towers. Tolkien brilliantly split the story two ways in TTT. In doing that, Tolkien allowed himself to really develope the supporting characters more easily. This becomes so apparant at times that the lesser characters seem as important as the main character, Frodo. In fact, Frodo isn't involved in about ten chapters of TTT. It gets to be noticed that the characters experience events and situations that really changes their thoughts of perceiving their world. The Two Towers is full of twists and surprises, and it leaves you wanting more. Excellent descriptions of the regions that the Fellowship pass through overflow in this book. Like in The Fellowship of the Ring, you forget that this fantasy, as the background and lore has the sense of a real and complete history. The Two Towers, overall, has a darker mood than The Fellowship of the Ring. At the end, a feeling exists encompassing the real danger that the quest might fail. The Two Towers has one real bad aspect. Near the end, the reader can feel extreme tension and suspense because of the actions in the book. Then it flat out leaves you hanging by the neck, leaving you cursing like you never cursed before, unless you have The Return of the King waiting right there to be picked up. The Lord of the Rings is not to be checked out at the library if a person wants to check out each volume seperately. Some passages will refer the reader to a Appendix, and those are in TROTK. Check out a single volume edision instead, or better yet, buy LOTR, single volume or three volume version. Lord of the Rings should be read and experienced by everyone, and acknowledge that Tolkien was a real genius. We would have suffered greatly if he wasn't born."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Two Towers is a work incomparable to anything out there. The skill with which Tolkien weaves his world creates a vivid tour through the imagination. Every word can be noted to have meaning; each race, and person for that matter, has a different style of speech. As a story, the Two Towers works alike to the Empire Strikes Back (though I am by no means comparing the two, I believe Tolkien's work far superior...Sorry Star Wars fans). It is the second act of a play, with the heros in distress and the Fellowship trying to hang together. Sam has the ring, with Frodo left for dead by the blow from Shelob. The shadow of Sauron eats evermore into the heart of Gondor, and forces are prepared by both sides. The fate of Middle-Earth hangs in the balance by the end of this novel. The Two Towers also displays a wonderful new cast of characters: we at last meet the wiles of Saruman, see the horror of Shelob, and feel the Ents' last battle. Rohan's noble Theoden and Minas Tirith's tortured Denethor also add to the mix, contrasting with each other as the Enemy's work is revealed even in the higher tiers of the Mark and Gondor. Don't miss out on the Two Towers. It is a classic of fantasy which will live on forever in the minds of those who read it."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Lord of the Rings is one of the best fictional works to date.

Tolkien's attention to detail shines here, both in his descriptions of the battle scenes, and in the attention to the struggles of Sam and Frodo. In the end, you almost feel as if you've lived through the war yourself.Tolkien has a message here. While he clearly considers war to be an evil, it is equally clear that he feels that it is sometimes necessary for good people to sacrifice everything to fight the forces of evil. Tolkien wrote these books in the aftermath of two World Wars, and that influence is almost palplable in this book. Above all, this is a story of courage and sacrifice, about standing up and fighting for what is good against those that would destroy it."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The book is great (Read it!), but personally feel Peter Jackson made two major mistakes with this movie and let his viewers down. I still think it's a great movie and probably should get the rewards it will get (and you should see it), but it is not The Return of the King that Tolkien wrote and you need to read the book to fully understand why. Here are the reasons:First, the Scouring of the Shire was completely omitted from the movie. Peter Jackson's claim that this is anticlimactic is far, far from the truth. In fact, it is climatic and that's why Tolkien put it in. There are three basic needs for a man: an adventure to go on, a battle to fight, and a pursuit (of the woman). You see all three of these in movies such as Braveheart. A young man needs to hear from his father that he has strength for the adventure, battle, and pursuit. Without this, a man is serverely wounded. Instead of being a stallion, he becomes a gelding, and one of the key problems of the church today is we have these geldings instead of stallions, and geldings cannot bear fruit.Frodo has these same needs. In the Scouring (the book), we see Frodo returning to his &quot;Place&quot; (Hobbiton) after it has been destroyed by Saruman. Frodo is in a massive depression. He essentially failed his mission (he didn't put the ring in the volcano) and is burdened by his guilt, failure, and physical infirmitiess. On his return to &quot;Place&quot;, however, he takes on his masculinity and leads the hobbits in restoring their community (&quot;Place&quot;). Frodo leaves the story as a true hero. That's climatic, not anticlimactic.Second, the Houses of Healing incident was completely omitted from the movie. In the book story Eowyn, Faramir, and Merry lie dying in the houses of healing. Ioreth, the lady attending them, says their healing is beyond her power. &quot;The hands of the king are the hands of a healer,&quot; she says, &quot; And so shall the rightful king be known.&quot; It is Aragorn, the coming king, that enters and leads all three to their healing. Tolkien pulls a little psychologica trick here in the book. After the healing Ioreth repeats the sentence again, acknowledging her perception of Aragorn as the coming king because he can heal. She seems to repeat this line again and again until Aragorn is crowned as king. She tries to repeat the line again, but fails as the trumpet drowns out her voice. By this time, however, the reader is completing the line; that is, the reader is being forced to take ownership on that statement.Now Tolkien was a devout Christian (Catholic), and was the man that led C.S. Lewis to the Lord. Tolkien is not talking about any earthly king or kingdom here. When I read this in Tolkien's book I wept. I think it's the most important quote in the book, but it's not even in the movie. It is a great movie, but it is not The Return of the King if you can't see why he is king.My guess is that Peter Jackson probably didn't understand the spiritual significance of either of these parts of Tolkien's novel. That's unfortunate, as both are the highest points of Tolkien's story.In all fairness, I think Peter did a more than remarkable job with The Two Towers. I see King Theoden, as he first appears, as the majority of the Church today, captured and powerless and not even knowing what is going on. Our heroes heal him and release his bondage, and his people rejoice to have their king again. Aragorn, knowing war has already started and Theoden's son has died in a battle, tries to encourage him to get ready.Theoden: I will not risk open war.Aragorn: Open war is upon you, whether you risk it or not.That is exactly where the Church is today. Christ said he gave his followers authority and power. To do what? That is what the Gospels are all about. There is a war going on, whether we risk it or not."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Upon rereading 'The Return of the King' 15 years later the book offered a few suprising plot twists, but more importantly recreates and fills out the magical world that Tolkien created. By the time the company reached the Grey Havens, i found myself frantically wondering what i would read next that wouldn't be a total letdown. I dug into the appendices, which i remembered from my childhood as dry and hard to get through, and found them wonderful. They flesh out the beautiful characters of Middle Earth that we've learned so little about in just three books and make me want to start all of the secondary literature that Tolkien and his sons have created (Silmarillion, Lost Tales, Adventures of Tom Bombadil, etc)."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"One might well worry that such an epic as The Lord of The Rings, such a universe as Middle Earth, such a wonderful series of books, could not possibly come to a satisfying conclusion. You need not be worried. The Return of The King is a masterpiece, as is the series as a whole. It brings the epic series to a grand, satisfying finale. You will not be disappointed. The prose is so immaculate; it's almost like you're reading poetry. I find that Tolkien is alone with this gift in modern literature. It is one of the many tenents that makes The Lord of The Rings one of the unarguable masterpieces of recent literature. This will be around as long as any book of fiction. The ending is bittersweet, and yet touching. It's perfect. There's simply nothing like this series. It's immaculate literature. It's wonderous writing. It's the best high fantasy ever written, period. I reccommend that you start with The Hobbit, and then definately read the first two books in the series, before reading this one. It's the only logical way to do it; you definately don't want to jump right into this one without reading those, as it will not make any sense to you. Read this masterpiece in chronological order. This is one of the greatest testaments to imagination ever published in any form, and The Return of The King is the series's essential grand finale. Also, very interesting to the LOTR fanatic, it contains a wealth of appendices and indexes of characters and place names. Such chronicles as the events preceding and following the series are included, as are a history of the kings, several dissertations on the various languages of Middle Earth (you can actually learn to write in, say, Elvish.) This shows just what an amazing and almost unbelievably large and complex complete universe Tolkien created with the series. It's a deserved ackwnoledged masterpiece. A must read for anybody, without a doubt. Long after countless other books of the 20th century fictional canon are forgotten, The Lord of The Rings will remain. Mark my words. You owe it to yourself to read this masterpiece of literature."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I was looking for a review of the Robert Inglis audiobook of Return of the King. I found many reveiws of the book and the Lord Of The Ring trilogy, didn't actually see any for the audiobook. Perhaps they may be there, buried in the hundreds of reviews. Well, anyway, if you find this review attached to the book or movie, sorry, I didn't put it there. Amazon likes to cross post reviews.I wish there was another unabridged version of LOTR. I don't find Robert Inglis a very enjoyable reader. He is a professional actor, but very far from an \\"A-list\\" actor. Both show. Professionally done, for sure, but just not great. I find his characterizations off-putting, and his style in general just doesn't do it for me. Maybe it's me. I am guessing that audiobook work doesn't pay very much, nor does producing audiobooks advance one's career. Maybe even hurts it. Too bad, you don't normally get the best talent. Imagine if Ian McKellan, Patrick Stewart, or other \\"A-list\\" actor would do this book! So, my 3 stars is in no way a review of Tolkien, only my disappointment in the reading given it here. The best selling fictional work of the 20th century absolutely should have had a world class audiobook. This was recorded about 1990, when nothing in particular was happening to create excitement about LOTR. If only there was a fresh, bigger budget production when the movie trilogy was released. (By the way, I'm sure the costs of production have been recouped over the 20+ years since the initial release of these CDs. Mr. Publisher, why not lower the price? Way too high. Here's an idea: Release it as MP3s for 1/2 the price of the CDs. Your per unit cost is almost zero, you would sell a bunch more units at the lower price, and still have a higher profit.)I wanted to read the negative reviews of the audiobook, to see if I was off-base, or if others wished for a better reading. Instead, I found the negative reviews were for The Lord of the Rings itself. There were a couple of types. First, the language in the 3rd book got thick, and Beowolfish. This wasn't because Tolkien \\"lost it\\" or got sloppy or unimaginative. It was deliberate, to convey that the people in the East were speaking an old-fasioned dialect of the language of Middle Earth. This was the English simulation of that dialect. That's why the characters say things like \\"Aragorn has become fey.\\" If it doesn't appeal to you, fair enough. But before you get to preachy about it's awfulness, consider that (as I write this) 5/6s of the reviews are 5 stars. Most people get it. The second type of negative review includes no reason, just \\"the books are over rated and terrible!\\" OK, again, look at the 5 star ratings. I don't happen to enjoy chocolate ice cream. Doesn't make chocolate ice cream over rated or awful. Sometimes, its just you."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers is a stellar sequel to the Lord of the Rings series. Set in a land of spectacular, grandiose adventure, the Fellowship of the Ring has been split up, with Boromir's death, the capture of Merry and Pippin, and the departure of Frodo and Sam, on their way to decimate the One Ring created by Sauron, the Dark Lord. Tolkien's story of Middle-Earth is bamboozling in how a writer can accomplish so much in such a small package, with so much adventure, emotion, and tragedy! While Gandalf is lost since Moria, Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas are looking for the captured Merry and Pippin.Saruman is still after the Ring, Sauron is also searching for his own creation of evil. Will they find it, read and find out!Alright, so what is Middle-Earth? Middle-Earth is a magical place with wizards, Men, Elves, Dwarves, and Hobbits. Wait, hold on, What are hobbits?Hobbits, more formally named as halflings, are gentle folk, about as tall as your waist, and have a taste for comfort. It just so happens that Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin are hobbits, hobbits with a mission. Okay, back to the subject.Middle-Earth is a land in peril, unbeknownst to most hobbits, but known to some. Sauron has found the Ring, and plans to catch it. If he does, the entire world of Middle-Earth will be under his evil rule. This is why the Fellowship is their only hope of winning against Sauron. And the fate of the Fellowship lies in the hands of their leader, Frodo Baggins, the Ringbearer.That is the story of Middle-Earth. But now to my review. This book is an absolute ten out of ten. I mean it is a book for readers of all kinds! Out of the myriad of books I have read, Tolkiens are the best!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This inspiring story and epic adventure was basically trying to destroy the one ring that ruled them all. What does that mean? Sauron the dark lord crafted three rings that where then given to the elven kings under the sky, seven to the dwarf lords, and nine to the mortal men. He then in secret crafted the one ring that literally controlled the other rings. Sauron wanted to control the world. Amazingly, King Isildur who is Aragorn's ascendant severed the one ring from Sauron's hand. The dark lord was defeated. The one ring could have been destroyed that day, but greed of power drove Isildur. Aragorn didn't want to be like him so he left the throne to the steward of Gondor and rode out with the elven rangers. The great council of Elrond lord of Rivendell decided that Frodo, a hobbit, would be the ring bearer. Soon, they set off on a journey to destroy the one ring and soon discover the great city of Minas Tirith of Gondor. Sauron's hordes and the armies of the Haradrim mass attack the capital city of Minas Tirith. In the nick of time Rohan, an ally of Gondor comes and defends the city. After they defeated the countless hordes, the mixed armies venture to the Black Gates, which is the entrance to Mordor. After the ring gets thrown into the fires of Mount Doom Mordor collapses. Then, Aragorn marries Arwen, an elf; daughter of Elrond and becomes king. He feels it is only right to take the responsibility and become king. That's basically the summary of the entire story of this superb novel.I really enjoyed this book. This book has taught me many ideas and functions of life. For one thing, even the littlest of people can change the world. This sentence helped me achieve everything I do. For instance, like playing basketball. If Frodo can destroy the ring, then how hard is it to do this task? Then, the job won't be that challenging.&quot;...We might as well give ourselves up...&quot;said Sam. The characters in the book had a chance to give up and go back, but they didn't. They kept going. Another great moral from this book is never give up. Never give up no matter what the circumstances are.I really liked this book. It was interesting because of all the sophisticated words J.R.R. Tolkien put into this astounding master piece. &quot;Behold the Sun setting in a great fire!&quot; The author uses a prominent amount of metaphors and great invigorating speech. It is really descriptive and in a way it is like a mastery of art floating in mid air. I love the way he writes. It is definitely the best book I have read in my entire life.My favorite part of the book is the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. Riders of Rohan arrive in the exact time of the vanquishing at Minas Tirith. The Riders bravely charge into the thousands of orcs and trolls. They stood strong and brave there. Shields were shattered and swords were broken. I liked this part mainly because of the action. It probably had the most action and fighting sequence throughout the entire book. I really enjoyed this book. I would think that this book is the best book I would ever have read in my entire life. I definitely recommend this book to anyone who loves to read action books."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"How would you like to grow up as an ordinary person in a world full of danger knowing that you are the true king of the greatest city in all of Middle-earth? Sounds cool, right? Well, to Aragorn it did not. Aragorn was a descendant of the king Isildur. However, he had not taken charge of the kingdom of Gondor because he fears that he will have the same weakness that Isildur had; falling to the temptation of the One Ring.On the other hand, how would you like to be a hobbit, only about three feet tall with all of Middle-earth depending on you to complete a task that was entrusted to you? How would you like to carry a ring that has the power to destroy all of the good things in the world, but at the same time, it has the ability to destroy all of the evil of your world? Also, the only way to destroy this item is to go into the center of the darkest place on Middle-earth and cast the ring into the fires of a volcano. This is what type of a situation Frodo Baggins was in, if he was going to save Middle-earth.Finally, how would you like to be the person that gets to listen (for 18 and a half hours) to the incredible story of how these two characters must face all the evil imaginable and still complete the task that was given to them for the sake of Middle-earth. Trust me; take the easy path and listen to this awesome conclusion to the great conclusion of this series that is hard to put down.Some of the characters of this story were Frodo, Sam, Legolas, and Gimli, Gandalf the White, Merry, and Pippin. The setting was in Middle-earth. The conflict is that as Frodo travels deeper into Mordor, he begins to fade and weaken. At the same time, Sauron, the Dark Lord of Mordor launches a full scale assault on the last city of men: Gondor. With no king, Gandalf takes command of the city. However, will the crumbling city be able to survive the full blast of Sauron? Will Frodo fall, the Ring be retaken, the Dark Lord of Mordor rise to defeat the slowly dying race of men? Finally, will Aragorn come to the aid of Gondor, and fulfill his duty as the true king? If Frodo and Sam survive, will their home be the same as they left it? Well, you will just have to listen to the awesome conclusion to this exploding series and see."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"To many people, Tolkien's Return of the King is merely a popular movie in the third installation of Peter Jackson's LOTR theatrical trilogy. Although the movie is wicked awesome, the book is the true source of the adventure and drama that makes the series so great.The Return of the King is the final account in which the remnants of the Fellowship battle and journey their way against the impossible odds of Sauron's malevolent forces to end their path in either victory or in the ruin of Middle Earth. Each and every one the characters know full well that they will most likely not make it through or see one another ever again. Yet despite these dubious chances, they continue to fight on for each other and for the world.I highly recommend Return of the King for those of you who are interested in the final stage of the harrowing journey of Frodo, Aragorn, Gandalf, and the other heroes and heroines of Tolkien's tale. If you have already read the first two books, you'll probably not want to quit here anyway. Although the movie covers many of the major ideas in the book, there are numerous differences, slight and profound, that are very fascinating. There is an entire tale of the Hobbits' return to the Shire that you do not want to miss out on, as well as many explanatory and plot developing instances and structures that the movie just could not cover. Actually, the discrepancies between the book and the film rather resemble two different interpretations of the same story. It almost seems as though, if the tale had been true, one legend had passed down two differing branches in oral tradition until the outcome was essentially the same, but with each telling containing slightly different story elements. Nevertheless, I can honestly say that I like both versions, movie and book, very much.I do have one point of caution. Some of the language, names, and references to Middle Earth history and mythology are hard to understand and remember if you have not read The Silmarillion, the essential Middle Earth equivalent to the Old Testament. But even without the knowledge in that book, these elements add a flavor of authenticity and richness that only Tolkien is able to create. Toilsome? Sometimes yes. Worth reading? Definitely yes."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"the Two Towers continues the exciting story of the fellowship of the ring. It offers more excitement and suspense as well as several surprises. Tolkien consistently stretches the reaches of imagination, and he always provides logic and reason so that his story makes sense and follows a consistent stream of creativity.As I read the rings trilogy, I found that it was helpful to have seen to the movies to help picture the events, characters, and surroundings. Of course, the movies made much more sense after reading the books, but I found reading the books more enjoyable than the movies. I am really glad that I decided to read them at a friend's suggestion.Tolkien is an excellent writer. This book along with the others is intelligently written. It is not just kid's stuff. It is stimulating reading.He tells a great story filled with complex characters and plots. The story follows a logical and understandable path that sparks the readers full imagination and range of emotions.This book offers some of the severest character conflicts in the books as the characters must make sharp decisions about their actions and alliances. It introduces new characters and species that offer fresh starts throughout the story. This book of the story in no way serves as a filler or drags on and on. It is filled with action and suspense. There is no let up in the action at all.And don't think that since you have seen the movie, you don't need to read the book. If you liked the movie at all, you will indeed enjoy the book, especially if your one criticism of the movie is that it didn't make sense. The book will fill in the gaps and will cause you to appreciate the movie much more."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I thought that this was a great book. It has a great story. I like the way that he wrote the first story about Aragorn, Gimili, and Legolas and then he told the story about Frodo and Sam. I like the second book the best because I was surprised with that part because the movie left alot of things there out. I had seen the movie before I read the book. I liked in the first book when they won the battle of Helm's Deep. I also liked when Gandalf broke Saruman's staff. The book has a great ending even though it is not happy, it leaves you hanging. the movies did a bad job,in my opinion, of illistrating the books. I liked the character Gollum.He was very strange, though. I also like the fearsome Uruk Hai. Very neat charaters. The Ents must have really been hard to make up. They were pretty off the wall. All around I might say this is the best book out of the three in the series."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Have you ever imagined what the battle of Helm's Deep was like? The Bloody swords, Orcs with arrows in them, the dead Rohirrim on the walls? It's just one of the bloody battles in The Lord Of The Rings fantasy by J.R.R. Tolkien. Have you ever imagined what the Shire looks like? If you read this novel, you'll see the Shire in your head because Tolkien is very descriptive of the surroundings.The name of the main character is Frodo Baggins. Frodo is a sixty-year old Hobbit. The setting is Middle Earth in the Third age. The most important conflict is trying to destroy a Mystical ring made by the Dark Lord Sauron. In order to destroy the one ring, a fellowship is made of nine companions, each of a different race. There are Merry, Pippin, Sam, and Frodo, who are Hobbits with swords. Then there are two men, Boromir and Aragorn, who are equipped with bows and swords. There is an Elf, named Legolas, equipped with both swords and a bow and arrow. Then there is Gimli, a Dwarf with a broad battle ax. The last character is a wizard, a supernatural being named Gandalf Greyhame. This Fellowship of the ring is attacked by many agents of the dark lord -- things, like Ringwraiths, Orcs, Uru-kai, and Easterlings.I liked the book. One of the reasons I liked the book was because it had a lot of action and humor, for instance the Battle at Helm's Deep where the action and humor is contained mostly in the book. One example of humor is, and I Quote \\" Twenty-one!\\" cried Gimli. He hewed a two-handed stroke and laid the last Orc before his feet. \\"Now my count passes Master Legolas again.\\" An example of the action is when Aragorn and his friend Eomer go to the gate and draw swords together. \\"Aragorn and Eomer ran to the gate. \\"look!\\" Eomer said, pointing to the Causeway. Both Orc and Easterlings ran towards the gate. Two dozen Orcs ran towards Legolas and Gimli, who were following Aragorn and Eomer. When they got to the gate, about three dozen lay slain on the ground. The only problem was that they were not dead. Eomer went to step through them, but two Orcs grabbed his heels, tripping him on the floor. They got up and were about to kill him, when Gimli sliced their heads off, just saving Eomer.\\" I liked the book because of the battles. The final reason I liked it was because in the battles, Legolas and Gimli bet each other on who would kill the most Orcs. On example is, from the text: \\"Twenty-one!\\" said Gimli, patting his axe. \\"Good!\\" said Legolas, whetting his sword. \\" but my count is now Two dozen.\\" \\"It has been real knife-work up here.\\" One reason I disliked the book was because the Fellowship split up in the novel before this one."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Ever have had something that many want people want to possess? Try overcoming being chased by nonliving warriors riding dragons. Have you ever felt like the fate of the world hung around your neck? If you have experienced this then you know how Frodo Baggins from the Lord of the Rings felt. Frodo was young hobbit from the Shire who really looked for adventure when ever he could find. He wanted to meet new people and see different creatures he had never seen in his life. But the only reason Frodo got to go on adventures was because his uncle gave him the ring of power. Frodo had to get the ring to Mordor and not let the ring get into the wrong hands. The ring has such power that it could conquer the whole world.I really liked the Two Towers. It is a great fantasy novel because it contains all elements that a good fantasy novel should contain. In my opinion J.R.R Tolkien created the greatest quest in the entire fantasy genre. If you read the story very carefully you can see that Tolkien kept on switching settings between characters. For instance in one chapter Tolkien would focus on Pippin and Merry then in the next chapter he would focus on Aragorn, Legalos, and Gimli. The best battle in the book in my opinion was the Battle of Helm's Deep. The only flaw was in the beginning Tolkien only focused on the other three companions that Frodo abandoned. I would highly recommend the Two Towers to any who is a fan of fantasy."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I read this after seeing the movie. There was a lot of action that never made it to the movie. This book is really great, the battle at Helms Deep was a lot different than what they showed in the movie! You have got to read this book, but be prepared it's a long one!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"By the time one gets to The Two Towers, after traveling through The Fellowship of the Ring, one feels quite at home in Middle-earth. Unlike the first novel, where the action is fairly linear, this second installment of The Lord of the Rings is divided into two books. The first chronicles Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli as they try to rescue Merry and Pippin, meet the king of Rohan, and fight the battle of Helm's Deep. The second half jumps back in time to follow Frodo and Samwise as they try to make their way into Mordor.I enjoyed this book even more than Fellowship - possibly because there is more action in it. Also, the story feels more compressed, as it deals with a relatively short amount time (a month, perhaps?) whereas Fellowship told a leisurely story that occurred over several months. Once again, as I read, I was convinced that the point of these books is not to arrive at the end of the tale, but to simply enjoy the journey. Because Tolkien is so good at his job, and has created a fully-realized world with three-dimensional characters, it is easy to understand how so many readers have come to lose themselves in the books.At this point in time, I cannot not talk about the movies. If one comes to this book AFTER SEEING the films, one will realize that Peter Jackson played around with endings. The beginning of the book The Two Towers is actually the end of the movie The Fellowship of the Ring. Also, the adventures in this book take us far into the movie, The Return of the King. I was pleased to find this out because the Hobbits' encounter with Shelob is one of my favorite parts in the story."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"It was a great book!! Very detailed description of areas and people. The book got me interested in reading again. It had hardcore battles that kept me reading for hours on end.

Fierce battles, amazing dialogue and very memorable characters made &quot;The Two Towers&quot; a great read. I won't spoil the ending, but, I'll tell you this: After I completed &quot;The Two Towers&quot;, I immediately went out and purchased &quot;Return of the King&quot; to see how it would end.I would recomend it to any one from 13 above to read it."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"J.R.R.

The first half of the book follows the majority of the Fellowship, first as they search for their captured comrades, then as they fight the forces of Saruman. The second part chronicles the voyage of Frodo and Sam (and later Gollum), as they attempt to reach the realm of the enemy.As the book progresses, the reader can really begin to see the development of each character. The long, difficult journey undertaken by Frodo, Sam, and Gollum reveals much about each character: that Frodo is struggling with the burden of the ring, the hastiness of Sam, and the inner conflict and treachery that consumes Gollum.I'm not a big fan of the fantasy genre in general, in large part due to the the massive volumes generated by authors chronicling the minute details of every quest. It's tedious to read for all but die-hard fans of the genre. This arises in the Two Towers, but Tolkien's masterful sense of setting and character manage to keep the reader's interest, in spite of the long lulls in the action.This is a wonderful second installment, bridging the gap between the first stage of the quest and the final struggle. The true magnitude of Frodo's burden becomes evident, as does the power agaist which all good must stand or be destroyed."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"RETURN OF THE KING WAS AN EXCELLENT FINISH IN J.R.R.

For years she writes in this diary. When she was 7 she's told that when she's older she is to marry the Dauphine of France (prince). At the age of 13 the official marriage proposal comes from the king. There is much preparation to be done before she is married. When she meets her husband for the first time she is repulsed by him, but later grows to love him.One of the things that I didn't like about Marie and all the royal characters in general was the way they thought of the \\"common\\" people. The rule that they have that common people can not talk to a royal or noble unless spoken to first is ridiculous. though I do know that was just the way it was in the past, I'm glad people don't act like that anymore. I did like how the author made the Dauphin though. How she made Louis \\"repulsive\\" looking but a little more lovable in the end.I would not recommend this book for everyone.

R. R. Tolkien is one of the most influential popular novels of the 20th century. Other bases of big motion pictures such as \`Ben-Hur' and \`Gone With the Wind' can't hold a candle to it as it had an influence far beyond its role as the basis for a movie script. For starters, \`Lord of the Rings' has had a large and growing readership from its original publication in the mid 1950s to the present, while I suspect practically no one reads Lew Wallace's \`Ben-Hur' any more and few people have recently read Margaret Mitchell's \`Gone With the Wind'. Another \`Lord of the Rings' offspring is the whole \`Dungeons and Dragons' role playing games phenomenon. This game originally appeared a few years after the second blooming of \`Lord of the Rings' popularity in 1965, when the books were published in paperback by Houghton Mifflin in response to a pirated copy published by Ace. This is when I first became enraptured by the stories of Middle Earth.In many ways, it is almost impossible to speak of any one of the three volumes which do not in the usual sense of the word form a trilogy of three independent novels related by common characters, location, and history. \`The Lord of the Rings' is a single novel which was serialized in three volumes published over two and a half years in the mid 1950's. When the three titles are published in a single volume, it is not hard to see that the work is really not much longer than \`Gone With the Wind' and it is certainly shorter than some notable novels such as \`Atlas Shrugged'. One virtue we did get from the division into three titles by Tolkien is that Peter Jackson had a valid basis on which to split a single story into three long movies totaling close to 10 hours of viewing time.Unlike the movies of the first and third books, almost every major scene of the book \`The Two Towers', is captured in the movie. The chapters of Merry and Pippin with Treebeard and the Ents are shortened a bit. Seems as if the Ents are much too slow for 21st century cinema. One thing the movie did get wrong in its promotional artwork is the suggestion that the two towers of the title were Orthanc and Baradur, the fortress of Sauron. Actually, the second tower of the title is Minas Morgul, the city of Gondor, originally named Minas Ithil, but renamed when the Nazgul captured it several years before the start of the events in \`Lord of the Rings'. The only piece of action I really miss is the role of Fangorn in the defeat of the besiegers of the Hornburg. And, in one of the very rare Peter Jackson additions to the story, I thought the skirmish between the Rohrrim / Aragorn and Saruman's warg riders was great cinema action, but just too much of a replay of Gandalf at the bridge in Moria, where a principle character is thought to have been killed and lost.I have read \`The Lord of the Rings' at least 10 times, and the story of Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli from the banks of the Anduin to the victory at the Hornburg is by far one of my favorite parts of the novel. Treebeard comes in a close second, as he is a piece of the same ancient history of Middle Earth to which only the faintest hints are given in the stories of Fangorn, The Old Forest by the Shire, and Tom Bombadil. Basically, Bombadil and the Ents stand for what is most worth saving from the evil of Sauron. This innocence is something that is tainted even in the sheltered lives of the Hobbits.In contrast, after about the third or fourth reading, I often became anxious to get through the chapters about Frodo, Sam, and Gollum as quickly as possible. One of the greatest of Jackson's accomplishments in the films was to breath life into the characterization of Frodo Baggins, who always seemed to be to be something of a wimp, drawn along by the inexorable hand of fate. Sam, on the other hand, was pursuing the quest entirely out of love and grit. Another great service of the movie was the realization of Gollum. I think that Gollum's implementation may be about as close as we will come for a long time in seeing a computer generated character be nominated for an Academy Award for acting.Even though \`The Two Towers' is the middle third of the complete novel, it really has a much more satisfying ending than \`The Fellowship of the Ring'. One starts to see how it may be possible to defeat the great evil challanging all the good guys in the story, but of course, the difficulty of Saruman's defeat is just a way of showing that defeating Sauron will be just that much more difficult.The second of the great three part classic!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"In the story Lord of the Ring the Two Towers its about the main character Frodo Baggins from the \\"Shire\\". This story has moral and themes that seem more realistic since the movie came out for it also addresses death, light, purity, hope, and innocence, betrayal, darkness, and redemption. Throughout the book of the Lord of the Ring the Two towers golem is constantly manipulating Frodo's mind into thinking that his friends were against him. This story is a 4 star book because of the way it deals with real life issues, and it also addresses how friendship can come over and triumph over anything because in the story it seem that friendship is the only thing that keeps Frodo pure and uncorrupt in this story friendship, purity, and hope intertwine and overlap into one another. This is why this story derserve a 4 star rating it shows human emotions that can only be brought out through the trial and tribulations of life thorough this story."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Return Of The King is a very good book.There is a mixture of war, stategy, romance, persistence, reality, fantasy, good, evil, and just about everything else!The main characters consist of small people or hobbits the size of children from a place called the shire, men from most regions, orcs and urk-hai from underground places, elves from woods, dwarves from mountainous regions, and destructive ghosts or nazgul that strike fear into people's hearts.One hobbit called frodo must destroy a ring of power in the realm of a dark lord. A twisted creature, Gollum followes frodo due to lust for the ring.Aragorn, a king in exile helps a city of men fend off the forces of the evil lord. Once he becomes king he leads his men to fight the evil lord.The character Gandalf is a wizard. He helps all events go smoothly. He seems to know everyone.I advise that you check out this book only after reading the first and second books or you'll end up in the middle of the action. You should read this before you see the movie so you can let your imagination soar.-"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I loved the Two Towers.

I LOVE the movies. I, erm, LIKE the games. I had seen each of the movies before reading the corresponding novels, and I like the movies in this order (least to greatest):\\"Fellowship\\"\\"Towers\\"\\"Return\\"I like the novels in this order (again, least to greatest):\\"Return\\"\\"Fellowship\\"\\"Towers\\"I loved all three books. They will always be masterpieces. But \\"The Two Towers\\" stands out as the greatest by far. I admit, the books can get a bit dull, but aside from one or two chapters, \\"The Two Towers\\" never lets up for a moment. It is much more exciting than most of Professor Tolkien's writing (don't get me wrong, I love everything he's ever written) and there's a lot of emotion. I also thought it was easier to read than all of the others. You mustn't go through your life without reading the trilogy, especially this one. I absolutely loved this book cover to cover and it was EVEN better than the movie."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"\\"The Two Towers\\" is the second half of J. R. R. Tolkien's epic \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy, and begins right where the previous book left off: the Fellowship has been sundered, with the death of Boromir, the escape of Frodo and Sam, the capture of Merry and Pippen, and the chase that ensues on the part of Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli. Like the other two installments in the series \\"The Two Towers\\" is split into two books, in this case it is Book Three and Book Four.Book Three alternates between the journey of Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli in their cross country race across forest and plain in order to rescue Merry and Pippen. Their pursuit takes them into Rohan, the province of King Theoden and his people, known as the Horse-Lords due to their skill and affinity with horses.Meanwhile Merry and Pippen are held captive by the terrible orcs as they race their way back to their master, the White Wizard Saruman, who has betrayed his calling and given in to his desire for the Ring. Now he wages war on Rohan, filling the court with his spies, and sends his orcs out on a mission to find the Ring before the Dark Lord himself does.The two stories conjoin when Merry and Pippen are able to escape into Fangorn Forest, where they fall into the company of Treebeard - a mighty Ent, a tree-like guardian of the forestlands who is not happy with Saruman's treatment of his land. Likewise, the three hunters also find their way into the forest, only to meet someone that they thought was lost to them...In Book Four we join up again with Frodo and Sam, who are making their lonely way toward the land of Mordor and the volcanic Mount Doom in order to destroy the Ruling One Ring. There the secretive figure that has been trailing them since Moria finally shows itself: it is the twisted creature Gollum, once a hobbit, who fell to the power of the Ring and nursed it for many years. Now Frodo employs him as their guide - despite the mistrust of Sam - to take them into the dangerous lands ahead.But they too have their fair share of danger: as always the agents of the Dark Lord are abroad, and even the \\"good guys\\" can pose a threat, considering the constant lure of the Ring - enter Faramir, Boromir's own brother, who takes the hobbits into his custody.\\"The Two Towers\\" suffers like many 'middle' books do - it inevitably does not start anything, and it does not finish anything. But one must keep in mind that Tolkien hated the idea of his work being separated into three separate volumes; he intended them to be published in a single book. The publishers however had other plans, and since then we have been subject to authors who think their books are not proper books unless they are split into multiple volumes.But \\"The Two Towers\\" continues to expand and enlarge Tolkien's most wonderful creation - Middle-Earth itself. We are introduced to the dank and mysterious depths of Fangorn Forest and the plainlands of Rohan, based on the Nordic and Scandinavian culture that Tolkien was fascinated with. Just exploring these beautiful places is reason enough to read \\"The Two Towers\\".With the release of Peter Jackson's adaptation of the three books, it is always interesting to compare and contrast the two. Often the movies fall short in certain ways - often by reducing the nobility and goodness of several supporting characters, such as Faramir, Theoden and Treebeard, who need more pushing from the likes of Aragorn, Frodo and Gandalf to do the right thing rather than reach their own decisions. However, other times Jackson takes the opportunity to divulge further into little subplots and details that Tolkien only briefly touches on - the prime example being the relationship between Eowyn and Wormtongue. In Tolkien's words Wormtongue's lust is only briefly mentioned; but Jackson devotes a fascinating little sequence to it, with Wormtongue attempting to weaken Eowyn to his will.Either way, the movie is as must-see as the book is must-read, though if you have only seen the movie and decide that it's not worth reading the book, I strongly suggest otherwise. Although Jackson creates a near-perfect visual duplicate of Middle-Earth, the book contains details and information that the movie must skim over, or neglect completely. If you want to know where Shadowfax came from, or where Gandalf went after defeating the Balrog, or Shelob's origins, then you'll have to consult the book."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I think The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King was a very good book. This book proves that even the smallest of good can overcome evil. Frodo and Sam continue their journey into the depths of Mordor to Mount Doom.While Frodo's burden gets heavier and he gets weaker, he still trudges on. You can find that friends can appear in the most unlikely places, even if you don't expect them to turn up. Sam Gamgee is a good hobbit at heart. He stays true even if Frodo brushes his ideas aside. You can also be powerful without being better then everyone else. Captain Faramir may be powerful, yet he does not take his power to overrule people. You can journey with everyone from Gandalf, Legolas, Gimli, and Aragorn to Smeagol, Frodo, and Sam. If you liked Shelob in the Two Towers, you can take off from the tower where the last book was left off at!!!The Lord of the Rings: The return of the King is an excellent book for all occassions! With action- packed and excellent adventures, this book can take you for a ride (I'd suggest a horse, the Oliophaunts are too big)! Check out the excellent movie too (the movie missed a couple of parts, but it was still excellent)!!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"All around i thought this book was spectacular. I thought it was a great follow up from The Two Towers. However, i think The Return of the King is much, much more interesting. Even though it took an immense amount of time to read, and a lot of concentration i loved it from front cover to back cover.To some people it might seem that it is just another long, boring book that takes to much leisure time to read. Yeah, it may involve actually thinking and comprehending a more vast vocabulary, but why else would you read a book?All in all, i think this is a very good book. And everyone should at least read some literature out of the trilogy, and most definitely give The Return of the King a try."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"All around i thought this book was spectacular.

It has big words that for the normal person aren't always easy to understand. Some people can get very bored of a long book when it takes them forever to read even the tiniest of details.

It is the continued story of Frodo Baggins and his journey to destroy the one ring. As Legolas, Aragorn, Gimli, Gandalf the White, and the armies of Rohan are fighting Orcs at Helm's Deep Frodo and Sam encounter Gollum and ask for his aid to the gates of Mordor. J.R.R Tolkien does a great job in the second Lord of the Rings book. For children that have enjoyed the first book The Fellowship of the Ring, The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers will be equally enjoyable. If children wish to find out what happens after the end of The Two Towers, children should read the last book in the series The Return of the King. For children wishing to know how Bilbo got the one ring, they should read The Hobbit a prequel of The Fellowship of the Ring."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"J.R.R Tolkiens novel The Two Towers is an outstanding book. Being the second part of the Lord of the Rings trilogy it is the heart of the story. The book starts off on the run and stays that way for it's entirity.Tolkien creates a world, Middle Earth, that is so real and so believable, it seems to be an actual place. This makes the book better than most fantasy tales and provides a backdrop which works perfectly for the characters, which are very unique and diverse. The felloship travels in two groups through Middle Earth climbing a seemingly unsurmountable mountain, by fighting a war against evil, but being held together by their friendship and driven by their will to survive with hopes of saving the world."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This is the final chapter in the Lord of the Rings trilogy.

Do they fall on the battlefield to the warring armies of Sauron? Is this really the end? Who dies? Who lives? What's happening back at the Shire?That I'm not going to tell you. You must read the book for yourself."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers is the second book in the Fellowship of the Ring series by J.R.R. Tolkien. It is a follow up to the Lord of the Rings. The novel is very suspenseful at times, while other times it is more relaxing and simply fun to read. Tolkien does a good job of creating a fantasy world with many interesting characters.The novel picks up with Sam and Frodo. Sam and Frodo are two hobbits that are trying to take the evil ring to the one place that it can be destroyed. Along their journey they are given help by an unlikely character. Golem is a monster that owned the ring many years ago. He is following Sam and Frodo because they have the ring and he wants it back. However, when he meets with the hobbits, he helps them when they aer met with troubles in the swamps along their journey.The novels also picks up with Pippen and Mary, two other members in the fellowship of the ring. Mary and Pippen are first captured by the evil Orcs. They are saved though by my favorite characters, the Imps. Imps are large walking trees that stomp almost anything in their way. One of my favorite parts in the book is when the Imps discuss how all trees are alive and have feelings, even though they do not all speak. I think Tolkien was making an important statement about how the environment was being treated when he wrote the book. Another highlight in the novel is when Gandolf returns. he comes back as Gandolf the White, meaning he has more power than he did in the previous novel.The heroes are faced with many evil and very deceitful enemies, but with help, they are able to continue on their journey. Tolkein does a very good job in continuing his series. I feel this book is very good for most teenagers to read and might even be good for some adults. I recommend this novel if you have first read Lord of the Rings."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I have started reading the Lord of the rings series and greatly enjoyed the first book. Now, coming to a close of the second book in the trilogy, i find myself not as satisfied as i was with the first book. Now, it is an excellent read for fantasy lovers and Tolkien is absolutely amazing at creating these complex cultures of men, elves, dwarves, and hobbits, but by Tolkien measures, i don't believe this was his best book. At this point, he is continuing on the first book and leading into the thrid, making more of a means of connection then an individual story. There is also a lot of walking. A good read nonethless. 4 stars."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I find this the most impressive of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, no mean feat for the middle book-- as the companions are separated, the world grows darker and darker. Tolkein deftly builds a brooding atmosphere that is only deepened by the contrast afforded in the flashes of humor."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I have read already The Hobbit and The Fellowship of the Rings and I have one thing to say about The Two Towers, it is awesome. After the Fellpwship you know Gandalf is dead, the fellowship is probably going to be scattered, and Frodo is going with the faithful Samwise to Mordor alone. The Two Towers, like the first book, is split in to two sections. One is with Strider, Legolas, and Gimli to set out and find Merry and Pippim and deal with the treachory of Saruman(and on hint, there is a huge suprise in store). The second is all about Frodo and Sam on the trek to Mordor with the treachorous Gollum. At first he seems to be different and wants to be called his old name, Smeagol,but you quickly learn that Gollum has two sides(named by Sam as Slinker and Stinker). It all ends with a perfect setting for the next book, The Return of the King. All in all The Two Towers is one of the best books you'll ever read in your lifetime."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"1) Gollum (Smeagle) is the epitome of the lowest creation. From the beginning when he murdered his best friend for the ring Gollum was doomed. He had the ring, but it possessed him. However, he lost the ring and even though it pained him he still loved and longed for it. It was his own, his precious. Gollum disappears, but then returns during the fellowship. After guiding Frodo and Sam he betrayed them in an effort to seize the ring. In the Return of the King he reappears and shadows Frodo and Sam. He plays an integral role in the completion of the task of the fellowship in Tolkien's ironic way.2) The unconventional way of wizards is an example of Tolkien's creativity. Most wizards have a wand, but Tolkien's wizards, though they are mystifying, seem to be the caretakers and historians of the world and are concerned for the greater well being of the earth and its inhabitants. They also seem to gain power from knowledge. When Gandalf returned as Gandalf the White he speaks of learning much and he has also increased in power. However, wizards are susceptible to the temptation of evil because a dark wizard is more powerful.3) The main object of the epic is the ring. The ring is inanimate yet it can turn anyone who possesses it towards evil even if they wish otherwise. It also could turn those who put it on invisible. The rings main purpose is to return to its master (Sauron). When it was created Sauron put part of him in it, in order to make him more powerful. It was also part of a masterful plan to force every creature under his power.4) Tolkien's depiction of the evil Sauron as a lidless eye that sees all is interesting anthropomorphism because he possesses the attributes of most evil beings, but since he is unable to take physical form he is a mysterious unseen powerful ruler. The Eye of Sauron sees all yet its attention can be focused on an area, allowing things to slip.5) The Ents are a truly original Tolkien conception. They are trees that have been awakened. Though their major role is in the Two Towers they do appear in this novel. They live to be extremely old, and don't like to be hasty. They also can break stone easily.6) Though the title of the book concedes the knowledge of the king's (Aragorn) return, after this event the book unexpectedly continues. After all the hobbit's hardships, when they reach home they still have to deal with an unforeseen difficulty. Saramen, a character who was thought to be out of the book, resurfaces at the head of the conflict. In the chapter the \\"The Scouring of the Shire,\\" Tolkien twists the plot and creates a small climax as the four hobbits rebel against men.7) This book, as with the previous two novels, showcases Tolkien's conceptual world. He masterfully is able to take the reader into this world, as if the story was fact.8) This verse opens the book. &quot;Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky,Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone,Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die,One for the Dark Lord on his dark throneIn the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind themIn the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.&quot; It sets the stage for the coming tale and leaves the reader waiting to uncover more9) A skilled linguist, Tolkien's elven language further contributes to the overall sense of reality.10) By focusing on minor characters, such as Merry and Pippin, Tolkien is able to keep the reader from predicting the next event."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"&quot;The Return Of The King&quot; is a rousing conclusion to the &quot;Lord Of The Rings&quot; trilogy. Tolkien weaves a mesmerizing account of the War of the Ring as the Dark Lord Sauron sends his armies against Gondor. With the timely help of the Riders of Rohan, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Merry and Pippin find themselves preparing for the final battle against Sauron's dark legions during the first part of &quot;The Return Of The King&quot;. The second part chronicles Frod's and Sam's perilous journey through Mordor, followed by Gollum, as they head towards Mount Doom. It also depicts the final battle in defense of Gondor against Sauron's forces. Last, but not least, the tale ends surprisingly where it all began, in the Shire, at Bag's End. I don't know whether Peter Jackson's filmed adaptation of &quot;The Return Of The King&quot; will be as mesmerizing as the book, but judging from his excellent adaptation of &quot;Fellowship Of The Ring&quot;, I think it most certainly shall."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"My daughter (Age 10) and I just read this series together.

I love how he takes time to develop each persons character. Some say that the characters are flat and two-dimentional, but if you think that, *you're* two-dimentional!! The 'heroes' have flaws (even Aragorn), the antagonists have their good qualities (however few). Particularly, this is where we get some really good insight into the characters of Gimli and Legolas.

Tolkien is an authentic book writer.The main thing about it is about a majical but evil ring that has to be destroyed in the deapths of Mount Doom. The main character is Frodo. He takes the ring to M.D. to be destroyed. My favorite character is Samwise Gamgee (known as Sam). He willingly goes with Frodo on to their quest. Called by Elrond, Sam is the only one doomed to go on this quest. No to mention that it was Sam who took care of the ring when Frodo was kidnapped by the Orcs. My next favorite character is the OLD, WISE,Hobbit, Bilbo. It was because of him that the whole quest started. Bilbo found the ring in &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. Tolkien must have been a genious to be able to think of a whole new world, including the characters, and still be able to keep the story down to earth.In the beggining of the story Frodo and Sam were not alone on the horrable quest.

Pippin and Merry were captured by orcs (That is the way they spell it in Middle-Earth), they escape into the wood, and encounter Treebeard, the Ent. Aragorn and the other two, meet Theoden, Lord of the Mark, and they all set out to find Pippin and Merry. At Helm's Deep, they fight orcs, and Gimli brags about how he hewed forty-one heads with his axe. They meet Saruman, and Gandalf captures the ball on the tip of Saruman's staff. Pippin suddenly steals the ball from Gandalf, and is enchanted by a spell, but is broken by Gandalf himself.There is much violence, but it shows every detail, that maybe not only a boy would like. There is much more in the story, but if you want to know, read the story, and be enchanted by it's great spell."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Now divided &amp; separated, the surviving members of the fellowship continued on with their individual missions. More characters were introduced (good &amp; bad alike) &amp; more actions were seen on the first half of the book - what with the battle of Orthanc. The second half was quite slow &amp; focused on Frodo &amp; Sam's search of the Tower. What made it a little exciting was the continuous suspicion they had on their newly found ally (GUESS WHO!). I think the saving grace of the second half was its ending (here, I will not divulge any further) which promised a very exciting start for the subsequent book - The Return of the King.I suggest you immediately proceed reading the sequel once you finish this book."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This book is very good like the 1st novel, the action and story are top rate, how ever after a while there were so many names of characters to remember. I would often to turn back the pages and even consult an online glossary to keep me in the loop as to who they were. Definitely worth the time."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This book was written with a lot of thought and detail. Each chapter brings you closer to Mordor and the end. I enjoyed the way that Tolkin divided the book into sections, first your on a rescue mission to find Merry and Pippen, only to find out that they can take care of themselves just fine. And then your heading out with Sam and Frodo on a quest to destroy the ring. I enjoyed meeting the new characters like Theoden and Eomer, I didn't really like Eowyn though, she just didn't get through to me. I especailly liked meeting the brother of Boromir and learning more about his past and the people of Gondor. I have read the last book and the character of Faramir and Boromir's father shows through and you begin to see why they were as they were. I also really enjoyed the old characters of Legolas, Gimli, and Aragorn. The ending of this book will leave you needing more, thereby forcing you to run out and buy the last one where everything comes to a wonderful close."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"At the end of Fellowship of the Rings, Frodo and Sam have left the fellowship to destroy the ring in Mordor but what happens after that. Divided into two books, (one for Aragorn, Legolas, Merry, Pippin, Gimli and everyone else. And one for Sam and Frodo) this story answers that question. The first book (and my preferred part) tells about how Merry and Pippin are captured by Orcs. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli must rescue them before it's too late, friends and enemies on the way. But when they reunite with an old friend they learn that they must help to defeat the evil dark wizard Saruman.The second book follows Sam and Frodo on their long journey to destroy the ring. Frodo is weakening slowly under the rings weight and needs help if he wants to finish his quest. But when he receives that help in the shape of Gollum, a dark creature who is more or less a slave to the ring (his \\"precious\\") Sam is less sure than Frodo to accept his help. Gollum may seem harmless but what plans does he have for the two young hobbits? Is he being a faithful guide or leading them into danger?I really enjoyed this book. In my opinion it was even better than the last. The first volume of this book was my favorite due to the extensive presence of my favorite character Aragorn and the creating of a new kind of friend called the Ents. This book was well written and the characters drawn wonderfully. I can't wait to read the next and final book in the trilogy. Just like the last one the end leaves you with quite a cliff hanger."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"As the sequel of The Fellowship of the Ring and part two of The Lord of the Rings, this is definetley a page-turner. The strength of Isengard while Saruaman is ruling it has become so great that the great Men of Gondor dont think they have much hope without help. In this amazing book the friendship of the Fellowship and the loyalty that Sam has for Frodo is definetley tested. Gollum is playing a big part in this book also, being Frodo and Sam's guide through the Nameless Land.These hobbits have overcome so much that that as Sam puts it, \\"they should write a song about our adventures\\". This is a wonderful, awe-striking book. READ IT!!!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Perhaps the most accessible of all the Tolkein books, THE TWO TOWERS is the quickest read in THE LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy.It is a tale told at a brisk pace, and it is primarily an adventurous narrative with less of the historical 'timeouts' that occasionally plague Tolkein works. Boromir is gone, leaving Merry and Pippin in the hands of the marauding Orc army. They escape, and, with the help of Treebeard, they manage to find their way back to the center thread of the story ... rejoining Gandalf (back from the dead in stellar form), Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli in their quest to save all Middle-Earth from the treachery of Sauron. In THE TWO TOWERS, we also see the strong emergence of Aragorn as the 'king figure,' as his heroism and derringdo at Helm's Deep captivates the reader for the better part of two chapters.A must-read for fans of fantasy and science fiction, THE TWO TOWERS shows what a gifted writer can achieve when he lets his imagination loose to wander the hillsides for awhile. Absolutely breathtaking."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"THE TWO TOWERS is the second part of THE LORD OF THE RINGS. As mentioned elsewhere, it is a shame that THE LORD OF THE RINGS was originally printed in three separate volumes except in the one whole that Tolkien intended because now we constantly have to refer to the three pieces of the whole distinctively. With that said, THE TWO TOWERS is a grand follow up of THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING.The book begins exactly where THE FELLOWSHIP ended, with Frodo and Sam setting forth together to fufill the grand quest and the remaining members of the fellowship left fighting orcs of Sauron and the Uruk-hai (that develish breeding of orcs and goblins) of Saruman. The book begins on a sour note with the fellowhip tearing asunder and the death of Boromir and ends even more dismal with the separation of Frodo and Sam and Frodo's capture. Nevertheless, there is a great amount of hope in THE TWO TOWERS. Treebeard and the Ents arise from a sleeping living to avenge themselves on their former friend and neighbor, Saruman, and the forces of good win a great victory at Helm's Deep.However, the best part of THE TWO TOWERS are the lessons of friendship, love, and loyalty that it contains. The novel begins with the fellowship torn asunder: Boromir is killed; Merry and Pippin are captured by orcs; and Frodo and Sam leave on their own. Aragorn makes a difficult decision; realizing that Frodo has made his own decision; and attempts a rescue of Merry and Pippin. He would have followed Frodo all the way to Mt. Doom but chose instead to help the companions that could least help themselves.Later in the novel and even greater act of love is displayed by Samwise Gamgee. No spoilers told, but Sam shows in THE TWO TOWERS that the Baggins aren't the only hobbits who can do great deeds (a lesson even illustrated more in THE RETURN OF THE KING by Merry and Pippin) and his devotion to Frodo is the stuff that true friendships are made. Even in the darkest hour things aren't as hopeless as they seem."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers by J.R.R. Tolkien is an epic tale about two courageous hobbits. Their fate separates them from the rest of the Fellowship when attacked by a group of orcs. In the attack, Boromir is slain and the hobbits Pippin and Merry are taken captive. The other two hobbits, Frodo the ring bearer and Samwise his trusty servant, leave during the attack on a quest to destroy the evil Ring of Power in the feared land of Mordor. The remaining members of the fellowship Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli begin their chase of the orcs to save the captured Pippin and Merry. While Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli were hunting the orcs, Frodo and Sam find an unlikely guide who takes them to the gates of Mordor and beyond. Frodo and Sam meet untold perils on their trek to the gates of Mordor. Meanwhile, Aragorn, Legalos, and Gimli take part in an epic battle that leads to a turning point in the war against Sauron, and begins Pippin and Merry on their road to fame and glory.I recommend this book to people who like action, drama and fantsy. Before you read this book you should read two other books written by J.R.R. Tolkien. These are \\"The Hobbit\\" and \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\", the prologue and first book in The Lord of the Rings trilogy, respectively. These books are all very good books and are definitely worth your time."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This book brings the masterpeice of the Lord of the Rings to a close. Our charachters are put through such trial and hardship, and stick together through it all. I don't feel that I can really write enough to express the full, rich, epic this book is."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Tower comes after The Fellowship of the Ring and before The Return of the King. Most of my favorite parts in the trilogy are in this book and The Return of the King. Some of the things that Frodo goes through are amazing. You would almost think that he wouldn't be able to go through with them. This book might be hard for young readers because of the style that J.R.R. Tolkien uses."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"&#65279;The Two TowersBook ReviewJ. R. R. Tolkien's The Two Towers is a fantastic book. It is the kind of fantasy that every person would enjoy. There is every kind of event, so even the pickiest person would be able to find something they like. The second book in a three part series, The Two Towers continues the story of the Ring. The reader meets many new characters, including the Ents and the Riders of Rohan. The Two Towers is about the quest to destroy the Ring of Power. If the dark lord Sauron gets the Ring, all of Middle-earth will be destroyed. The broken fellowship now insists of three groups: Legolas, Aragorn and Gimli, Merry and Pippen, and Frodo and Sam. The novel starts with the death of Boromir, who was taken over by the Ring. Legolas, Aragorn, and Gimli immediately set out to find Merry and Pippen. Merry and Pippen have been captured by the enemy and must be rescued. Thisbegins The Two Towers, with many more adventures to come. The Two Towers is a must-read for anyone who likes fantasy and adventure. There are no weaknesses. I enjoyed reading the novel very much. The beginning starts out slow, but things speed up quickly. Anyone who likes fantasy will enjoy it because every page in this masterpiece is very well written. The Two Towers is definitely a great book."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Tolkien is fabulous at revealing the atmosphere of the worlds that he creates. He describes these places with such detail that I wonder how they are going to pull off the next two on the big screen. The story dives deeper and deeper into hell by putting our heros into the most dreadful positions. Eventually the get brought out through fighting for there lives. I will probibly read this over as there is just so much to absorb . Beautifully developed and wonderfully woven. The first part dives into the battle for Gondor and it is dark. Yet the march into Mordor in the second part is as evil and as fantastic as you will find. Absolutly magical."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The second book of the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" series is named \\"The Two Towers.\\" The first part of the book is about the company of Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas following the trail of an Orc company who captured two of their Hobbit companions (Merry and Pippin). With the help of an old friend and other the company finally finds the lost Hobbits and they overtake Saruman at Isengard in the process.During the second part of the novel Frodo and Sam (two other Hobbits) were traveling to seek Mount Doom to get rid of the evil ring. They capture Gollum who had been following them for a long time and he agrees to take them where they want to go. They trust Gollum and follow him. Eventually Gollum flees in fright of Boromir's brother. Frodo and Sam however stay and get great provisions from him. Then they move on and run into danger witch leads Frodo and Sam to be separated.I have enjoyed the trills of the first two books in the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" series. I am sure to read the final book soon. Even if you do not enjoy the science fiction genre I still recommend this book. It is a great read and always keeps you interested."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"\\"The Two Towers\\" opens with the dispersal of the Fellowship Of The Ring. Boromir, eldest son of the Steward of Gondor, is killed by marauding Orcs intent on capturing Merry and Pippin. In a sense, his heroic death is an act of redemption on his part, after trying to seize the Ring from Frodo. Merry and Pippin are carried off by these Orcs, servants of the corrupt wizard Saruman. Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas begin their trek towards Minas Tirith, the capital of Gondor, hoping to overtake Saruman's Orcs. And Frodo and Samwise proceed towards Mordor and Mount Doom.This second installment of \\"The Lord Of The Rings\\" is in two parts; the first deals with the exploits of Merry, Pippin, Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas. The second recounts Frodo's and Samwise's perilous journey to Mordor. Without a doubt, this is the most character driven installment of the entire \\"Lord Of The Rings\\" saga. Without giving away the plot, the book is an insightful survey of the main characters and their motivations. Suffice it to say that their interactions amongst themselves as well as with important minor characters such as Fangorn, the chief of the Ents, play an important part in determining the outcome of the war of the Ring.Much of Tolkien's best writing can be found in this book. I found \\"The Two Towers\\" as engrossing as either \\"Fellowship Of The Ring\\" or \\"The Return Of The King\\", the third book in the trilogy. Incidentally, \\"The Two Towers\\" refers to Saruman's tower, Orthanc, at Isengard, and the Dark Lord Sauron's tower in Mordor."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I was blown away by the excitement and thrills that kept you wanting to turn the page over and over. Tolkien creates a world where you are actually there, amongst the magical creatures that are created with it, his descriptiveness and word use is the best I have read yet. The plot keeps you &quot;on the edge of your seat&quot; and is filled with wonderment. I strongly reccomend this book to all who havent read it yet, it is a must."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Fantasy tales have long been recognized for their tales of magic, mythical creatures, and far-off lands of make-believe. Magical rings have often been used in such tales of magic to provide an intriguing source of magic and mystery. Most of these rings play important roles in the stories they are found in. Howerver, there is one magical ring whose significance far exceeds the importance of any other magical ring in any other fantasy story so much that it causes an entire trilogy to evolve around it. This ring is known as the Ring of Power. The continuing story of this magical ring and its bearer, Frodo Baggins, a young hobbit of the Shire, is told the second part of J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy, The Two Towers. The Lord of the Rings tells of the adventures of Frodo Baggins in his quest to destroy the Ring of Power. In the land of Middle-Earth, the trilogy's setting, Frodo, along with his friend, Samwise Gamgee, must take the fated voyage to the land of Mordor. When the two travelling hobbits cross paths with a villain who is having second thoughts about his villainous ways, they must decide how they will get to Mordor. Now it is up to Frodo to decide whether or not it is worth placing the entire fate of Middle-Earth into the hands of a creature that was once a member of the enemy. While reading this book I found myself totally absorbed in the story. In this sequel to The Fellowship of the Ring, Tolkien once again uses vivid descriptions of people, places, battles, and thoughts to captivate his readers. Be it a character or a plain old rock, Tolkien takes the time to describe every detail. Tolkien has written the book so that there is never a dull moment in the story. The battles are so real that the reader feels that they are in the middle of the action. These are only a few of the qualities that made J.R.R. Tolkien such a great author. What lies ahead for Frodo on his journey to Mordor? Frodo and Sam both know that people who achieve something great are remembered in songs. If Frodo can accomplish this task, he could possibly be the subject of a song that will live longer than time itself. How could such a small creature like Frodo accomplish the single greatest challenge that all of Middle-Earth has ever seen? Only time will tell."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers consists of the second part of three in The Lord of the Rings trilogy. Itis about a group of people and their quest to destroy the source of all evil in Middle-Earth.At the beginning of the story, Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas are searching for Pippin andMerry. They find them living with Ents (very big, strong, talking, walking, trees). Theyand the Ents fight a bloody battle with orcs. The action then turns to Frodo and Sam whoseparated from the \\"Fellowship\\". They are led by Gollum to Mordor, where they areattacked by a giant spider. The rest is a mystery for you until you read the book foryourself!One of my Favorite quotes in this story occurs when Gandalf, Aragorn, and therest, find Saruman in his tower and call him out for a chat. \\"Have we ridden fourth tovictory, only to stand at last amazed by an old liar with honey on his forked tongue? Sowould the trapped hound speak to the hounds, if he could.\\" This describes Saruman, avery evil man, trying to sweet-talk his way out of a jam. As you read The Two Towersyou find many unique quotes like this one. It is one of the reasons that I like the book.I would recomed this book to a patient reader who doesn't need non-stop action,and likes vivid descriptions. The author takes so much time describing the events in acertain scene that not many events really take place in the course of the story. This book,and the whole trilogy for that matter, is perfect for someone who enjoys fantasy and usingyour imagination."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"i didn't like this book because i thought it was scary"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I think if you are going to write a book about elves, do so. If you are going to write a book about dwarves, do so. But, to write a book about dwarves, elves, farries, gnomes, wizards, and dozens more creatures is a bad move. The language of this book is excellent. It is very discritve and flows wonderfully, but the differences betwen what an elf is, and what a gnome is, is confusing. The plot I think is predictable. The characters seem to make a long journey through a woods, tunnel, mountain and meet another species in every chapter."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"most boring book ever better of reading song of ice and fire this book is all bout walkin can't believe its so good chuck away its sux"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Tolkien wrote an undescrible book and it cannot be done in any way and i think , that how his son tried to finish the whole series, is bad and he shouldn't have touched it because it's J.R.R.'s not Christopher's and he should have not killed the Dark Lord [Sauron] because evil must stay in the land of Middle-Earth because thats what gave the book meaning"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This book is SLOW. The characters aren't real at all, and they each have about 50 names. Take Aragorn for example: Strider Aragorn, Estel, King Ellisar, Plain Ellisar, etc. The names are unoriginal, like Arwen and Eowyn, different by one syllable. The book is rather confusing by itself, then if you read all the appendixes, you don't know who is who. The whole book is simply fighting and killing, with an occasional appearence by Gandalf. Merry and Pippin are the only source of humor, if they ever come up in the book. Did I mention that the characters are totally fake? Their actions are random and unpredictable, even for a fantasy, their speech is ridiculous. The \\"Greatest Fantasy Epic of our time\\" is a silly name for a book this long and boring. Totally overrated, this book stinks. What's worse is that it is the best book out of the series. For once the movies are better than the books. Even if they are saturated with special effects."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"All of you who believe that Tolkien's works have any substance could not be more mistaken. The Return of the King is the perfect example of why Tolkien should never have been born. In the history of literature never has there been a book which has recieved more unworthy praise. Everything from its banal and totally meaningless plot to its incredibly idiotic and unimaginative characters miserably fail in masking one of the worst books of all time. Tolkien attemps to hide his lack of substance behind a transparent wall of deplorable descriptions and stupid childish songs. His entire series is a collection of rubbish in need of decomposing much like his reputation. It is about time that we did away with the rediculous notion that Tolkien has written a classic and simply accept that his life's work is worthless nonsense. His work sucks, he sucks, and anyone who admires either is right down there with him. Lord of the Rings should crawl in a hole and die... P.S. ~ This is a joke. LOTR is a master piece."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I came into this book thinking it would be out-of-this world good, only to be disappointed. Maybe I had too high of expectations, or the fact that I had only read the Hobbit and the Two Towers, skipping the Fellowship of the Rings, might've thrown things off. Maybe it was because I knew what was going to happen(destruction of the Ring) and couldn't wait. I couldn't stand the long drawn out fluff details of the book or C.S. Lewis style writing about the \\"color of the landscape\\" for twenty pages. I would give this book .5 stars because I only enjoyed 1/10th of the book(the last part of the book that really didn't have much to do with the earlier portion), but the smallest rating a person can give is one. I would only suggest this book to people that have read the first three books in the series(people that would probably read this book as no matter what...)"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I don't think that I need to tell anyone out there how amazing Tolkien's tales are. My cup runneth over. My imagination was thoroughly stimulated and I think I may end up reading this again in a few years."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers is a great and provoctive book, in my mind one of the best books of the century. J.R.R. Tolkien should have recieved a nobel prize for his works. It displays the greatest examples of fantisy and fiction in the modern and ancient world.His creatures have set the stage for all of the current and future storytellers. Tolkiens collection of creatures runs fromkobolds to hobbits he is the epitimy of what all fantisy writers should be like.The Two Towers I believe is his best book in the trilogy and to which all fiction writers should set there compasses. The detail that it includes is amazing. In some parts of the book I feel that Im there. I see what they see and the dialog is absolutly astonishing. So I recomend that this book be read by all."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This book has the fellowship scattered in every which way. Frodo is traveling through Mordor with Sam, while Pippin and Merry show incredible inner strength in their encounters with orcs. Gandalf (who is supposedly killed in book 1) resurrects with gallantry as Gandalf the White. The characters begin to take on more and more challenges. Frodo is gettin guided by who but Gollum and a new type of soldier emerges--Ents. Readers are introduced to Faramir, Theoden, Wormtongue, and the Rohirrim. The trail to the final battle between good an evil narrows ever-more as the book draws to a close. Each reader has begun to see each character in a new light, truces are made, blood is shed, and now readers can begin to decide who is the most important character in the book. I personally have never been able, as all characters play such an immense part in the story of the rings. I recommend both the book and the recording (Rob Inglis is the most incredible reader)."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"First off, i would like to address some of the faults that others found in this book. I noticed that a lot reviewers, thought the book was too descriptive. Yes, this book is very descriptive, but tolkein was only trying to paint a picture for his readers, and if you can understand the way he described it in, he did a very good job. You have to remember, that this book was written by a genius, and if your looking for an easy book to read, this isn't for you. Others said this book was a bit boring. In my opinion, it was quite the contrary. the book splits up essentially into two different stories, one following aragorn, legolas, gimili, merry, pippin and gandalf, and the other covers frodo and sam. Frodo's adventures are a little boring, but the rest of the fellowship had me on the edge of my seat. You also get to meet the ents, interesting creatures by far. All i can say, is read the book and decide for yourself. This isn't a book to read while your being distracted by something. and of course, make sure to read the first one before this, or you will be lost."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"First of, this is an excellent book. Although not really a life-changer it will probably do a lot to dispel the idea that fantasy books are boring. As a person who isn't a particular fan of the genre, I personally loved this book. The story is a follow up from the first novel in the set, 'The Fellowship Of The Rings'. Split into two sections it mostly concerns the aftermath of the dismemberment of the fellowship. In the first half Merry and Pippin are hobbit-napped by orcs, and Strider, Legolas and Gimli follow in pursuit, on the way meeting battle and an old friend. The second half is mostly taken up by the character Sam, as Frodo feels the weight of his task ever more, becoming ever more weary as they come closer to their destination. On the journey they find help from an unwanted ally - Gollum.Obviously there are several problems with the story, such as characters like Treebeard that are dull and often unneeded. However, despite this it can be very exciting in parts and brings a whole new dimension to the 'journey' story. All of the characters are drawn exceptionally well, even if some are clearly more interesting than others. In addition, the fight scenes are a lot more than the usual hacking and chopping but include some surprising light humour that really helps dispel the possibility of boredom. Even if the homoerotic overtones between Frodo and Sam are a little on-the-nose then at least you've got Shalob the giant spider at the end to give a pounding finale with a great cliffhanger. Plus, it's certainly a plus that Tolkien can write in a giant spider without his reader questioning it for a moment and just enjoying the moment.This is a great book, although I'm worried as to how they'll transfer characters such as Shalob onto the big screen later this year."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Gandalf is gone. Boromir is dying. Frodo and Sam are gone, and the rest of the Fellowship has been disbanded. Things couldn't be worse for the 9. But things eventually begin to go up. Frodo and Sam encounter Gollum, the creature that Bilbo took the Ring from, and he promises that he'll help them get to Mordor to destroy the Ring. However, things and people aren't always what or who they seem to be. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli search for Merry and Pippin who were captured by Orcs. Gandalf returns to help them in their search, and plans to take on Saruman in a duel to get at least one enemy out of the way. Merry and Pippin meet up with the Ents, a species of talking trees, and they agree to help in the fight against Saruman because of Saruman's tendency to kill trees. Meanwhile, Frodo, Sam, and Gollum meet Faramir, Boromir's brother, and then they are off to Mordor. But when they get there, things go horribly wrong... Once again, this is an amazing story, and if you liked Part 1, continue with this one."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"All I can say is out or 5 stars it gets a 7. This is the best medival book I have ever read. The word use is a little hard to grsp if you are young but the story plot was outstanding. Tolkien really knew how to write a story.

Don't worry, I won't tell you what that thing is. The Fellowship still remains split up and some things that you wanted to know at the conclusion of the last book are revealed, as said above. That is as much as I'll tell you for this book because if I tell you anymore the book will be ruined for you.As in &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring,&quot; J.R.R. Tolkien gives you luscious descriptions and phenomonal writing. He goes into some matters that were brought forth in the first book with such skill that only Tolkien could pull off. At the end of this book you will feel a craving to pick up &quot;The Return of the King&quot; right away.&quot;The Two Towers&quot; is the second book in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and the best of the first two volumes. Tolkien brings you into his beautiful world that you won't be able to get enough of. Before delving into this, be sure to read &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; first so you won't feel like you're reading material that makes no sense to you.

The spine is in perfect shape and so are the pages. The dust cover shows some wear but that is to be expected."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This is the third book of the Lord of the Rings, and like the first two, is divided into two \\"books.\\" Spoilers for the next five paragraphs.The first book chronicles how Pippin and Gandalf ride to Gondor, and Theoden of Rohan does the same with his army, responding to Gondor's call for aid. Aragorn and his friends head for Gondor as well, but they take a different and more dangerous route; known as the Paths of the Dead. Pippin becomes a guardsman of Gondor, and soon finds that Denethor; the steward of Gondor, has gone mad with despair, and ordered the execution of both his son Faramir and himself. With the help of Gandalf, he moves to rescue Faramir from the mad steward.Arriving in time for battle, King Theoden is slain, and his daughter Eowyn; disguised as a horseman, faces off against the Nazgul king; the second in command of Mordor. Aragorn moves in with reinforcements, but even when they win the battle for Gondor's gates, they still have to make one last, suicidal attack against Mordor if they want to distract Sauron from the real prize; the ring of power.The second \\"book\\" of the Return of the King chronicles Frodo and Sam as they complete their journey through Mordor, and bring the ring of power to Mount Doom, where Gollum attacks them again, just as the ring finishes corrupting Frodo. Both Gollum and the ring fall into the fires, but Frodo and Sam are rescued by Gandalf and the Eagles, and Aragorn's forces finish mopping up the enemy once the ring is destroyed.After that, there are several subplots involving Eowyn and some of the other minor characters. Eowyn casts aside virtually all of her previous character development, and becomes \\"more of a woman,\\" for Faramir, but I actually consider this a relatively minor fault in the writing, despite Eowyn's large impact on the story so far. Arwen appears again, just in time to marry Aragorn, but barely gets two lines of dialogue in doing so. I much prefer her depiction in the movie, but this isn't really a weakness in the book; she's just a very minor character here.Finally, they all part ways, and before the main characters depart the land forever, there's a plot about a brief war in the shire, between a band of \\"ruffians,\\" commanded by Saruman, and the shire hobbits he's been enslaving with what essentially amounts to socialism.The characters and meanings to be found within the first half of the book are numerous and intriguing. I could spend an hour discussing the meaning of Denethor's madness, Eowyn's motives, Aragorn's plans, Gimli's shame and the role of Gandalf in it all. It's a beautiful story with a lot of very strong plot points. However, for enjoyability, I can't give it a perfect score, and there are two reasons for this.The first is that, as I've said, I'd rather be reading a story about fantastic things and strange beings. The first half of the book is largely concerned with the actions of men and armies, and the deployment of troops, which isn't as much my thing as the battle at Helm's Deep was. This is a purely personal issue, however.The real problem is that the book drops too many names, and uses them too often, not really assigning substantial characters to most of them. Some characters, like Beregond; have interesting stories told about them, but just weren't considered important enough to be in the movie, while others, like Halbarad, Ghan-Buri-Ghan, Imrahil and about a dozen others are essentially names without any clear stories behind them, except to fill up space in lists of names of warriors who defended Gondor valliantly. Certainly, real historical records might take this tack, but in fiction, it's acceptable, and expected, to stick to the story in question. I felt that this weakened the narrative, rather than strengthening it. These are the only reasons, in my mind, for taking issue with the first half of the book, however. On the whole, I really enjoyed it.With respect to the book's second half; in my opinion, the final battle of the book was a bit anticlimactic for a final battle, but not a bad little plotline by itself, and even fairly amusing. I was always somewhat disappointed that the major conflict is resolved a third of the way into this book, after which everything else seems like a step down. Still, it never really upset me all that much. I wasn't really bothered by any of the things I've just described.The only thing about this book, and indeed, this book series that ever really angered me was the message, near the end, of good things passing away and the world moving on without them. Many of the ideas and concepts contained in this book are friendly to the Catholic ear, but this is not. Only evil things will come to an end. Good things continue forever, and without a better understanding of the Gray Havens, and its relationship to Middle Earth, the message of these segments can come off as \\"if you've already done a lot to help people, just go off on a vacation overseas somewhere.\\" For good Christians, the fight doesn't end until you're dead, and even then, it doesn't really END end, it just takes a different form until the final judgment. The ending of the Lord of the Rings always bothered me for this reason, ever since I was a child, and it does to this day.Finally, after finishing the last of the six \\"books\\" of the Lord of the Rings, there is a selection of appendixes at the back. The appendixes provide some backstory for some of the races and characters, some information on the languages, cultures, family trees, etc, of Middle Earth.Unfortunately, this section gets even drier than most of Tolkien's other writing; particularly when he discusses languages and historical records. Still, it's not without it's high points, providing some history for Aragorn and Arwen, as well as some interesting stories about the dwarves and their feud with the orcs, and about the man after whom Helm's Deep was named. There's also a passing reference to the Silmarillion, which I may also undertake one day.Still, many of the characters in these parts of the story are vain, prideful, thirsty for revenge, and generally act out of self-centered motives, but they all suffer losses appropriate to their vices. The only reason I even bother to bring this up is that there's no Gandalf-like central hero in these parts of the story; nobody to show how things should be done right.The points down that I give the appendixes in enjoyability come almost entirely from the fact that they read like an encyclopedia. The content is very entertaining, but the format is not. I don't feel there's any point in disguising that.Still, it's a good book overall, and a very compelling story of trial, danger and loss. It was just as good as I remembered it being, and I hope you'll enjoy it too."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"NOTE: This review contains major spoilers. So if you haven't read the book (or haven't seen the movie) yet, then don't read what I've written below.---------------------------------------------I've just finished \\"The Return of the King\\" (and the entire LOTR trilogy) just two days ago. It was an outstanding conclusion to the epic fantasy. Although there were some things that bothered me a bit, I still found myself satisfied with the third installment.First let me say what I DID like about this book.Tolkien has created so much fantastic details with characters and settings. From Minas Tirith to Barad-dur, from dwarves to orcs, he's basically the Emperor of Fantasy. Indeed, modern fantasy writers such as Terry Brooks, Robin Hobb, and the late Robert Jordan (RIP) have been inspired by LOTR. Works like \\"The Wheel of Time\\" and the \\"Sword of Shannara\\" series contain clear evidence of the Tolkienesque influence. I still prefer \\"Wheel of Time\\" over LOTR, but I do admire LOTR for its fantastic detail, and Tolkien's writing style.Frodo sure has changed. In \\"Fellowship\\" he's just an average guy in Hobbiton who just happens to have a famous (or should I say \\"infamous\\") uncle named Bilbo. When he continues his quest in \\"Towers\\" and \\"Return\\", he completely changes in personality. The Ring becomes a heavy burden, and it tries to consumes him when he comes closer to Mount Doom. What makes the story deeper is that Frodo tries hard to keep the Ring away from his closest friend Samwise Gamgee. He doesn't want Sam to be consumed by this thing as well, and that's pure friendship right there if you ask me.The Battle of Gondor is probably the most exciting thing that happens in the entire trilogy. So much happens in the chapters \\"The Siege of Gondor,\\" \\"The Ride of the Rohirrim,\\" and \\"The Battle of the Pelennor Fields\\". You have Gandalf, Aragorn, Gimli, Legolas, Merry, Pippin, the Riders of Rohan, the soldiers of Gondor, the orcs of Mordor, the Southrons and Easterlings with their gigantic Ouliphants, and the Army of the Dead all in one battle. It doesn't get any better than that.The chapter with Eowyn and Faramir called \\"The Steward and the King\\" is especially touching. Both have gone through so much that they deserve each other. And it's a shame that this is mentioned in just one minute in the (Extended) film. Five more minutes could've helped.All right, now here's what I DIDN'T like about this book.That's it?! Only Theodin and Denethor (as major characters) die in the entire war? The death of a good and noble king is such a f**kin' cliche in the world of fantasy. Couldn't Tolkien kill of several more characters to make us more emotional about this trilogy?I also had a problem with the Southrons and the Easterlings. Was Tolkien racist? Because obviously the Easterlings and Southrons are reminiscent to Middle Easterns, Asian Indians, and Chinese; and they're enemies of Gondor. These people have experienced a huge loss in the Battle of Gondor as much as the orcs from Mordor. I can't help but get pissed off. All of the races in the North (Eriador, Rhovanian, Rohan, Gondor) are basically all White, while the races in the East and South (Mordor, South Gondor) are all Eastern. I can see the racial diversity when it comes to elves and dwarves and men, but why leave out the Asians? But of course, it was only the 50's, and fantasy nowadays have far more racially diverse characters. So another point is taken away from LOTR.And finally, The Scouring of the Shire. I think I agree with Peter Jackson that this is a bit to anti-climactic in both the book and the film (and thank God that they never filmed it). Okay, so the Shire is being destroyed by Saruman and his wild men, and yes, this is a pretty exciting chapter, but is it necessary? Yes and no. Yes for the fact that our four Hobbits have matured and are now ready to face their enemies. No for the fact that we've just read through a major battle in Gondor and near the Black Gate of Mordor, and we've just experienced the climax to the entire trilogy. It gets quite tiring when the second to last chapter is being read.With all ups and downs, The Lord of the Rings is still indeed a classic that must be read. And even though I'm not a big fan of Tolkien's/Jackson's work, I gotta give credit to the men for making me wanting to be a novelist.Grade: B"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"the great quest to vanquish evil forever ends in this book, that i would consider dissapointing. Tolkein picked back up with putting too much detail into everything and ended it in an odd way. I was expecting for the dwarves to come out of the ground and the elves out of the woods and everyone would live together, but instead he made it more realistic, so it actually coule have happened because only men are left, but i guess that might be a good thing, a good change of pace that makes you think, and i enjoy those kinds of books. They have a massive war in this book, and Tolkein wrote it wonderfly,he showed just the right amount of detail in that part that you knew what was going on, but not too much so you were falling asleep in a war. I would call this a 8.5 out of ten, good, but not as good as it could have been."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Peter Jackson has created an OUTSTANDING masterpiece in it's own right with his interpretation of the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy... but Tolkiens books are some of the best literature of the 20th century.Jackson takes several liberties with some key points of the story line, not the least of which is making Frodo a \\"Naive Young Hobbit\\" when in fact, Frodo and his companions didn't set out on their quest to Rivendell until AFTER his 50th birthday. Little inconsistencies like that between the movies and the books aboud, reason enough to pick up copies of the books to see Tolkiens original narrative."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The second book of J.R.R. Tolkien's three piece story. It has a lot of action and suspense. The book has basically two different stories intwined togather. One of the stories is the becoming of a king. The other story is about the small hobbit who has to save the world by destroying the magical ring of power. Aragorn and his fellow friends are trying to tarck down their other friends who were captured by some orcs. The two hobbits that were captured gathered up some tree-like creatures and destroyed one of the two towers it was called Isengard. While the small hobbit named Frodo is led on by an evil being named Gollum who leads Frodo it to a trap near the end. This book is a real page turner. You may never want to put this one down. There is so much developement within each of the characters that you feel like you have known them for a long time. I would reccomend this book to somebody of any age who likes action-packed fanstasy stories."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I read Lord Of The Rings The Return Of The King. Written by J.R.R Tolkien it is the last in the series. I loved the book it has action that makes you keep on reading non-stop. It probably has more action than the other books.The book started in Minus Tirith. The war for the ring had started. Minus Tirith called for the aid of Rohan in battle. The battle of Middle-Earth was fought at Minus Tirith. Frodo and Sam are in Mordor for most of the book. They are clad in orc-fashion most of the way to Mount Doom. The weight of the Ring grows in Mordor. They destroy the Ring. Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin head back to the Shire and find that it was ruled by a terrible person. Ruffians were sent to make sure the hobbits were paying up. At one point, a ruffian made Pippin made so he Merry and Sam drew swords and slew him.I felt that I had to read this book because I saw all three of the movies and read the first two books. You must read the other two books first!!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Love this series and love the final book. I just re-read it to prepare myself for the movie. As much as I love the books, I'm so glad Peter Jackson veered from the book and beefed up the roles of Legolas, Gimli, in addition to the battle scenes. Tolkien was one of the greatest creative minds of all time, but he didn't do a good job with the action, nor with Legolas and Gimli. I do love how he wrote Aragorn, Gandalf, Frodo, Samwise and the other hobbits. All in all, a great book and a great series (and an amazing set of movies!). I wish Tolkien were still around to write more adventures. I would have loved to know what happened to some of those guys and gals!!!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This book seemed much alike the movie. The author wrote the book in a way that made us feel like we were actually there while the story was being told. If you see the movie,In this book, the sword was put back together and the king was reborn. He was able to find ghosts that the previous king cursed for fleeing from battle and he was able to make a promise to them. He promised that if they fought for him, he would free their souls. So the ghosts took over some orc ships, and pretended to be orcs. When the other orcs came to greet them, the ghosts jumped out and attacked the orcs. With out the ghosts it would not have been a victory.In the mean time, Frodo was going to throw the ring into the mountain and destroy it. But the ring was calling to him and telling him not to. It was telling him to keep it and he could have all the power that he wanted. But Smeagle stole the ring from Frodo and fell into the lava. That was the end of the ring, after this everything was restored and every one was happy. The throne was given back to the rightful person and the hobbits went back to the shire.But, gandalf goes back to the Shire and Brings frodo on another journey that takes you on another adventure. So another serise continues..."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"To some, Tolkien's greatest stregnth is creating a different world. To me, that is to some extent, his greatest weakness. He seemed to indulge that creativity too much in the third book. I found that the story and character development was greatly hampered by the constant description of locations. I know some love that aspect of the book, but to me, it made it unbearably slow at times. As soon as the action began, Tolkien would launch into detailed descriptions of places and their relation to other places. I could have skipped half this book and not have missed a thing. While I did enjoy the ultimate conclusion and happy ending, as well as the farewell between characters, this book largely could have been subsumed in the maps!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"&quot;The Two Towers&quot; -- the second volume in Tolkien's model-train-set of a novel, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; -- has fewer of the pleasures to be found in the first volume (&quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;), while enlarging many of the first volume's faults. As everyone in the world must know by now, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; basically tells how various good-hearted fantasy creatures strive to destroy a magic ring that, if acquired by the Enemy, would result in the end of decent society. Here the journey continues just as in the first volume, but Tolkien now moves much more slowly. He introduces us to fewer characters and &quot;wonders&quot; than in the first volume (most interesting, to me, were the Tree Shepherds, the revamped Gollum, and Boromir's brother), while filling many pages with tedious faux Arthurianism involving the Riders of Rohan, and with deadly landscape descriptions that are at once long-winded and vague. Nevertheless, the old excitement returns often enough -- particularly in the last few chapters -- and by the end my desire to find out what happens in the final volume was as fresh as ever."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Let's face it, \\"The Return of the King\\" is easily the worst of the trilogy (as far as the books go), but that doesn't stop it from being an beaitifully written and exciting conclusion.

I loved this book, except for Chapter Eight of Book Six, \\"The Scouring of the Shire.\\" But then, very few people do like that particular bit."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This is the third book in the Lord of the Rings series. It tells how the ring is destroyed, and answers a lot of questions that you may have had in your head from the first two books. It really had only a few interesting parts. It is a drag between the cool parts. They talk about things that already happened in the other books. And it is confusing. In the second half, they talk about things that happened in the first half, and say they have not yet happened. You will like this if you want to find the ending of the Lord of the Rings, but otherwise, probably not."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"There is no question you will read this book. Like any trilogy, after you read the first 2, you feel obligated to complete the series and read the final one. No matter what I say in this review, nothing will deter you from reading the third of the trio. This review is written for posterity's sake, and in keeping with my practice of reviewing books after I read them.The book is mediocre-good, much like the first one. It's better than the second book and probably not quite as good as the first one. Towards the end of book 5 (the 3rd of the series actually contains Book 5 and Book 6) it seems to me that Tolkein is so far off the deep end that he loses all ability to communicate words in a digestible manner. The writing borders on horrendous, and the reader cannot differentiate one speaker from the next. Everyone speaks in the same voice, with the same grand tones, saying the same trite things.Book 6 is better. It wraps up the series and allows the reader to put the book down satisfied with the series. Without book 6, I don't think that would have been possible. One problem is this. There's no suspense for too many pages. Relatively early in the narrative we see the &quot;return of the king&quot; and the tidy conclusion subsequent to that. After this, there's no suspense, no reason to keep reading. If it weren't for the hijinx in the Shire at the end, this book would have been pretty bland, all in all.I have thought before, and this book again shows me, that Tolkein had a great imagination but was a weak writer. Pages upon pages are devoted to the most mundane of things, while action scenes are over in mere paragraphs. It seems the author wanted to gloss over most of the action, preferring to work with the majesty and pageantry he had created in his mind. If Tolkein could have forgone the written word and found a way to allow people a brief glimpse into his head, Peter Jackson's films would seem mundane in comparison.But the reality is we're dealing with the printed word, and this is not the strongest medium for Tolkein to have chosen. In his time, it was all he had. Now Jackson has taken that and worked wonders with it. I think the movies are a better reflection of what Tolkein would have liked to portray. The books, other than the Hobbit, could have been done better.Still, as I said, you will read it. It's a good enough ending to a classic series. Assuredly, the time it takes to read this book is worth it, even if it does drag a bit. It's a fantasy classic, and you should immerse yourself in it for the sake of the experience."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Lord of The Rings: The Return of the KingBy J.R.R.

Then it tells how they ride on the Road of the Dead.I thought this book was alright. To tell the truth this book was kind of slow in the beginning. A lot of it was just talking. But once they finally got to some of the fight scenes it was really good. Over all I thought this book was pretty good mmm'kay. I give it ***1/2 (three and a half stars).By A Gilpin County Sophmore"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The book Two Towers by J.R.R. Tolkien is the second book in his trilogy of The Lord of the Rings. The book picks up exactly were the first on ends. Froto and Sam are on their way to Mordor the evil empire. The rest of the broken fellowship will trail behind and they will meet again later. The book is based on a series of mini wars that lead to the destruction of the two towers. These two towers are points on the earth were Soron and his army build and destroy.In my mind the book did an all right job at putting a few hours of film into a 300-page book, but there needs to be more dialog. I read through the book reading the author's words and nothing about what the characters thought.I also liked the two wars that they had. The author did a great job at giving you a detailed view on what is going on at the battlefield.The one thing that I have learned in the past is that you have to read over and over to get the right idea. I read the book then watch the movie to get both point of views.I would advise reading this book and not skipping it to read the last book in the trilogy. The Two Towers is an important part of the trilogy. It gives a middle ground and puts you in place for the next book Return of the King.If I were to give a grade on this book form one to ten it would be a seven. I would give it a seven because it kept my attention and keep up the pace in the trilogy. The book could be read from 16 and up.

It was difficult and boring for me."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"It's Tolkien! Nothing more need be said."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"If you haven't read &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy and are even remotely interested, please do. I won't waste time extolling the trilogy's virtues as a piece of fantasy. Suffice it to say that Tolkien crafted an incredibly believable fantasy world. Each time I read the series I become (almost) convinced that Middle Earth does indeed exist. The story, land, and characters feed the imagination and envelope the mind.With a work that's so highly regarded, it's always a bit dangerous to offer a negative criticism. I do have a (dare I say) problem with &quot;The Two Towers&quot;. I'll call it a problem of pacing. The novel is divided into two books. The first book details the adventures of all the members of the fellowship except Frodo and Sam. The second book concerns only Sam and Frodo. The narratives in both books cover roughly the same time frame. While the first book is fairly fast paced, the second book (with a few notable exceptions) moves along slowly. In the second book, Tolkien recounts how Sam and Frodo make their way into Mordor. To be honest, not much happens. Much of the text is devoted to them walking from place to place, camping along the way. The story is never boring, and I would never suggest removing a word of it. However, I can't help but wonder if it might have worked better if the two books had been intermingled. Not only would the reader get a better sense of the chronology but it would have broken up Sam and Frodo's travels with the adventures of the rest.This is really just a very small complaint I have. It should never stop someone from reading the the trilogy. Keep in mind that, at his worst, Tolkien wrote better books than 95% of fantasy writers before or after him."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This is the second part to Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy.

Two of these characters must go into Mordor the land of the dark lord to destroy the ring of power.The turmoil starts early in the book and keeps on coming with new twists and new unimaginable danger. Some of the new characters that come in to this book are quick to develop and quick to go into action. Tolkien creates this strongly weaved tale that will come to life before your very eyes.The Two Towers is a heart-stopping book and will keep you stuck to the pages and then make you come back for more of this epic tale.

Anyway, BUY THIS BOOK! But make sure that you read &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; first, otherwise, you're not going to know what the heck is going on. And don't rely solely on the movie, there is sooooo much more in the book that they left out (for obvious reasons). AND don't read &quot;The Return of the King&quot; UNTIL you have read this one. Fair enough?"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"In this , the second volume of Tolkein's classic trilogy , the pace of the action really picks up! After a modestly slow start in &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; , all of the major characters are in place and an action filled epic unfolds in a magical world best viewed in the marvelous images created by the author in one's own mind. Each reader has his own mental image of Frodo--of Gandalf--and of the despicable orcs.After the fall into the abyss of Gandalf the Grey with the Balrog in &quot;The Fellowship&quot;, we see a new and awesomely powerful Gandalf the White emerge (an almost Biblical resurrection , to make a comparison).In this volume Treebeard the Ent is introduced , and the episodes of Merry and Pippin with the Ents are marvelously entertaining. The little folk , the Hobbits , show an unforseen inner strength that is one of the things I enjoy most in this tale.The strength of will and devotion of Samwise Gamgee to Frodo is heartwarming. The segement &quot;In Shelob's Lair&quot; is one of the more genuinely scary parts of the book.I probably shouldn't reveal too much more about what transpires in the story and spoil it for a first-time reader ; of the three volumes in the trilogy this is probably the most action filled and fun reading one , and is therefore my favorite.If you haven't read it yet--what are you waiting for?! Five stars don't do it justice!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Frodo is presumed dead. Pippin is in trouble with the Nazgul. And Sauron is gaining power. This is the amazing conclusion to J.R.R. Tolkien's legendary trilogy. Merry becomes a soldier of Rohan, and Pippin becomes one of Gondor, Boromir's home town. Both of these armies prepare for an upcoming battle with Sauron's army of orcs and Ringwraiths. Along with them are Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, and Gandalf. Meanwhile, in Mordor, Frodo and Sam have been betrayed by Gollum, and Frodo is in the hands of Orcs. But soon Sam frees him, and they are off again to Mount Doom to toss the Ring into the magma and destroy it. Gollum makes one more appearance, but what happens I'll let you find out. But is the ordeal in Mordor really the end? What has happened to Saruman? What's going on back in the Shire?"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Return of the King has very detailed and interesting characters. Aragorn used to be a Ranger and roam around the wild land. But now he is leading the offensive against Sauron, but there is more to the offensive than meets the eye. It is a diversion to get Sauron's troops to move away from somewhere else where something much bigger, and important will happen.This is a very good book. The characters are very unique, and interesting. Especially Aragorn he is my favorite character because he is mysterious and intriguing. Aragorn was raised by Elves and is Elvish himself, he is mostly solitary unless his own people are present. He is very powerful, and dangerous in battle. But in peace times he is gentle and a healer. The Return of the King is just as good if not better than the rest of the books in The Lord of the Rings trilogy. I strongly suggest you read it."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Here we find it to be the concluding book of a trilogy. The tension of the book is still building while we find the characters excately were we left them in the TWO TOWERS. A fight for the whole of Middle-Earth. As we get into the book we find that the shaky allience between sam, frodo, and gollum is crumpling fast. We also see that the rest of the middle-earth hero's are on the way to help were it is necissary. In this book there is a great deal of passion, pain, loss, and love.This book is the reason why so many readers have come back to this book over and over again. WE find that the ending is rightly built up and that the characters finally come together. A great story that anyone and everyone should read."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I am a senior in high school, and usually don't enjoy reading that much, because it is hard for me to find a book to get in to. I read The Lord of the Ring The Return of the King by J.R.R Tolkien, I read this book for the sole purpose to have something to read for class. I picked it because it was the only book in the library I recognized. I saw the movies so I thought it would be an easy read. But I read the book, I saw that it had more in it and was much better than any movie.Well as most of you know, The Return of the King is the last chapter in one of the best trilogies ever made. This is an excellent book to read, so if you loved the movie you will love this book too. It better than the movie because it is more in-depth on what the other characters are doing. Like showing what Marry and Pippin where doing during their time as loyal followers of Denethor lord of Gondor and Theoden lord of Rohan. It also shows a little more to what everyone else was doing during their journey. The one thing I didn't like was lines of dialogues which got boring sometimes. Overall, I liked the book and I would recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"People who complain about the slow pacing of the books probably haven't made it past Fellowship of the Ring. That book, for all its merits (and it has many) could have been called \\"LOTR: The Onset of Exposition\\" at times, so heavy does the weight of backstory fall on the reader. However, I like the backstory and find that it makes Middle-Earth richer and more realistic, knowing that for every offhand reference to some hill that the characters walk past, Tolkien came up with an entire history for that very hill and we're only hearing a tiny bit of it. I have no choice but to admire that. The other hurdle for readers of the first book was that the plot was resolutely linear in nature, since all the companions were together you basically have Point A to Point B stuff, first they walk \\"here\\" and then they go \\"here\\" and things happen and so on. Two Towers fixes those problems with style. With the Fellowship split, Tolkien divides the plot into Frodo/Sam and everyone else. Having already dealt with setting up the premise (ring=bad) he can go to town on the plot itself and it's amazing how breakneck things are, considering this is coming from a mild mannered Oxford professor. Aragorn and company range across Rohan trying to find the hobbits, trying not to get killed, running into friends and enemies while meanwhile the rest of Middle-Earth is waking up to the fact that Sauron really does want to kill everyone . . . at the same time Frodo and Sam start to realize that they might be on a bit of a suicide mission. Fantastic locations abound and Tolkien's imagination seems endless as he whips out magical setting after magical setting, switching from wondrous to horrifying to just plain beautiful in chapter after chapter. As big and epic as the events of the novels are, he never loses sight of the humanity of his characters and often contrasts the workings of the important immortal characters (Gandalf, the elves, etc) with the regular people who populate Middle-Earth and getting their perspective on things. And he never forgets to include moments of small humor and delight, Merry and Pippen finding a stash of food, Frodo and Sam discussing how people will remember their tale for years after it's over, so that the characters seem like real people who are simply caught up in things beyond their reckoning and just trying to figure out how to make it through alive. Again, it's not perfect but it's as close to the distilled essence of epic fantasy as we're likely to get. One thing I did notice that I didn't remember from my first time reading it is that the novels are almost like musicials, Tolkien must have been a frustrated songwriter because it seems like every few pages (this is more pronounced in the first novel) people stop to sing a song about something, anything. Not saying it's good or bad, just commnenting. And for those coming in from the movies, this book seems most affected by the transition from text to film, with whole sections chopped out to get crammed into the next movie and a lot of stuff simply just changed. So don't think because you've seen the films you've seen it all, the novels are still the first source and still highly preferred for those so inclined. So for all those folks who said \\"all they do is walk around!\\" this is where they start to get proven wrong."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This is the second book in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. This book continues the journey of the fellowship. Their task is to destroy the ring of power. Unfortunately, the fellowship is broken up. The hobbits, Frodo and Sam, continue on towards Mount Doom. The rest of the group race to save Merry and Pippin, who have been captured by Sauruman's troops.This book races through events and follows the two groups as the story unfolds. Where will the fellowship find help? Can Gollum be trusted? We are introduced to the people of Rowhan, Gondor and the wonderful Ents. We witness the first great battles of the war (at Isengard and Helm's Deep). We can feel the tension increase as the hobbits get closer to their goal. However, the closer they get, the harder and harder the road becomes. It is similar to a wave cresting right before crashing into the rocks.This book continues the wonderous tale of the ring. Tolkien's life long work on Middle Earth comes to fruition in these books. Tolkien's focus on the details that back up the story and myths of Middle Earth reaps tremendous rewards to the reader. It is a great read!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The third Lord of the Rings was my favorite of all of them. It had so many cool things that they didn't show in the movie. My favorite part was when the hobbits go back to the Shire and they see that Saruman has taken over. Then they gather their friends and family and go to take it back no matter what the consequences. I recommend this book to anyone who can read. It was really one of the greatest!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The conclusion of JRR Tolkien's fantasy epic is nothing short of astounding, and is recommended to all. In the third part of the trilogy, Frodo and Sam get closer to Mount Doom every day, guided by Smeagol. In the mean time what is left of the Fellowship of the Ring head to Minas Tirith, the capital city of Gondor, to fight the forces of the evil Lord Sauron.Tolkien is absolutely one of the greatest writers of all time. And I hope that many more readers will embrace this amazing story."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"What would you do if the survival of the world was cast upon you in a package that could fit your finger, but at the same time, have the power to destroy the whole of Middle Earth? This is what Frodo Baggins has to suffer through everyday. When you read J.R.R Tolkien's: The Lord of the Rings, the Return of the King, you will be embraced by a story of power, faith, and war. When young Frodo is entrusted with destroying the powerful Ring of Power in the fires of Mt.Doom, where it was first forged, he must accept the quest. Along with the Dwarf Gimli, the Elf Legolas, the Human, Aragorn, and his 3 hobbit friends, Merry, Pippin, and of course, Sam, he will journey to Mt. Doom to undo the evil that has been done. I think the moral of this story is that a small person can do a very big thing. One of the weak points of the book is its length. It will take a day to read each book, and understand them thoroughly. On the other hand, this book's strong point overpowers its weak points completely. It is a book of twists and turns, thrills and chills, which you will remember forever. This book is for people who love spine-tingling adventures. Other books written by this author are, The Hobbit, The Fellowship of the ring, and The Two Towers."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers continues at the point where the first book ends; Frodo leaves the fellowship to travel to Mordor with only his faithful friend Sam as his companion. Merry and Pippin have been taking captive by orcs sent by Saruman. Aragorn decides to leave Frodo to his quest and to follow the orcs in hopes of rescuing Merry and Pippin. The Two Towers is divided into two parts; the first part tells the tale of Aragorn, Gimly, Legolas, Merry, and Pippin while the second part of the book talks about the journey of Frodo and Sam. I found the first part of the book really enjoyable; this is where most of the action was and where the story became more interesting. I felt the second part of the book was a little dull, mostly consisting of tedious description. It didn't hold my interest as well as the first part of the book.During the first part of the book Aragorn's pursuit of the orcs leads him, Gimly, and Legolas to Fangorn forest where Gandalf makes his triumphant return. The four of them travel to the land of Rohan to speak with King Th&eacute;oden who is currently under the control of Saruman. After Gandalf breaks his Saruman's hold the people of Rohan flee to Helms Deep to prepare a defense against Saruman's army.Meanwhile, Merry and Pippin's encounter an Ent, kind of walking, talking tree, named Treebeard. Merry and Pippin learn of the Ent's hatred of the orcs and Saruman because of the harm that they were bringing to the forest. The Ent's agreed that Saruman must be stopped and they begin their march on Isengard after Saruman has sent his army to attack Helms Deep.There were many exciting and interesting events that happened in the first part of the book. I especially enjoyed Aragorn's pursuit of the orcs; it truly demonstrated his skills as a ranger. He was able to deduce several events that took place by simply analyzing various tracks and imprints on the ground. During this pursuit Tolkien also describes Legolas' keen senses. Legolas was able to see across great distances and make out minor details. Tolkien also mentions the great endurance that Gimly and other dwarves possess. Gimly was able to run for long periods of time without resting or getting short on breath.This was one aspect that I thought Tolkien improved on in his writing. He began to write about some of his characters in greater detail. I've always thought that his characters were interesting and now that I began to learn more about them I've come to like them more. Stories with interesting characters are far more enjoyable than stories that are entirely driven by their plots. When the characters are more interesting I become more concerned with the events surrounding them, making me more interested in the plot.This was on reason that I didn't find the second part of the book as enjoyable as the first. It didn't have the same level of excitement as the first. Much of it was tedious description of every rock and plant Sam and Frodo passed as they continued on their journey. The main reason that I was interested in the second part of the book was because of Gollum, who I thought was another very interesting character.Gollum was in possession of the ring for so long that it gave him an unnaturally long life and corrupted his mind. He practically had split personalities. His \\"better\\" half was Sm&eacute;agol, or who he used to be before he found the ring. His more evil and selfish side was Gollum, one who desired to have the ring above all else. Gollum wasn't a villain when compared to Sauron or Saruman, nor was he a hero. He was a poor twisted soul that had been corrupted by the ring's evil power.Gollum became bound to the ring; it was something that he had to have and he followed Frodo throughout most of his journey just to get it back. When Gollum finally encounters Frodo and Sam they capture Gollum. Like Bilbo, who had encountered him long ago, Frodo couldn't kill Gollum. Instead Frodo spares him. Gollum swears to serve his new master, Frodo, and to guide them to Mordor. Sam is unsuccessful in his attempt to get Frodo to either kill Gollum or leave him behind and shortly after the three continue on their journey.I found their journey dull for the most part because it didn't really compare to the journey that the others experienced in the first part of the book. It wasn't until towards the end of the book did Frodo and Sam's journey become more interesting. Gollum had led the two hobbits to Shelob's liar in an attempt to reclaim the ring. Shelob is a giant spider creature that had existed on Middle Earth since almost the beginning of time. Once Gollum leads them to the lair he leaves the two hobbits in the dark as pray for Shelob. I thought this was an interesting change of pace because it portrayed Sam as a hero and he displayed the same courage that Aragorn and the others displayed in the battle of Helms Deep.Overall I felt that the Two Towers was a good story but I thought it would've been better if Tolkien had made Frodo and Sam's subplot alternate with the subplot of Aragorn and the others instead of separating the book into two sections. It was hard for me to change from the great suspense of Aragorn's pursuit, the battle of Helms Deep, and the Ents siege on Isengard, to a much slower pace story. If they hadn't been done separately the story would've been much better in my opinion because there wouldn't be such a large change of pace between the two parts of the book. However, I still felt that this was a great story."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"With the war of middle earth about to start its final hours with Aragorn, Gandalf, Merry, Pippin, Sam, Legolas, Gimli and of course the ring bearing Frodo Baggins. But before that they need to reach the lands around Mt. Doom. Now with this being in J.R.R. Tolkien's three part series, The Two Towers is the second. Along with it being in the Lord of the Rings three part trilogy, this book also has three parts. The first part is Sam and Frodo being led around Mordor to reach the mountain that can destroy the ring, the second part is Merry and Pippin's journey with orcs and ents. Now the final part is Legolas, Gimli, Aragorn, and Gandalf on what they did to reach Mordor. Now in the book everything seems to be running smoothly for the heroes until Frodo and Sam have a brief running with Gollum... yeah... brief... and that they find a King is possessed. Everything seems to turn around while the ring gets closer to Mt. Doom.Now with the Two Towers being the second part of the trilogy. I find it to be the best. For the reasons that without knowing the journeys to Mordor and what Sam and Frodo ha to go through, it wouldn't be as important of a story. Another reason is that Gollum doesn't get killed so he plays an important role as follow the leader. And the battle of Helms Deep is one of my favorite battles because it shows death with sadness, but soon hope. I highly recommend this book to anyone that likes fantasy, but the series needs to be read in the order of 1 2 3 or else it just won't make sense.No other books in my mind can compare to the legendary Lord of the Rings. From the facts that there are no tag-along for the fun of it characters. They all have a great role and factor to playing out the story. Also, the Lord of the Rings has to be the most serious book I've ever read. Which seems difficult to do when talking about hobbits, elves, dwarves, humans, and the supernatural. But that makes it the interesting story it is today. The Two Towers stacks up to be the best book I've ever read. So read it and be happy. ^^"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"j.r.r tolkein was a brilliant man. his books inspired millions to create and begin writting. this book starts right were the fellowship left off. bomir is dead, mary and pipen have been captured my the uruk-hai, frodo and sam have set off for mordor to destroy the one ring that sauron formed from the evil of his own body. it was the one ring TO RULE THEM ALL! frodo and sam along the way find a unexpected freind golum or also known as smeagol."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Well, Tolkien obviously has many many devotees and there are lots of reviews below mine, so I'll keep my comments brief. I like this series a lot and this book is a worthy successor to &quot;Fellowship of the Ring&quot;. The only additional comment I'll make is that I like this series much more as an adult (I'm almost 30&quot; than I did as a child. There is a lot of interpersonal interaction &amp; emotion and not so much swordplay &amp; action. Consequently this series is certainly acceptable for children but I think it's more geared towards the adult reader."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The writings of Professor Tolkien are absolutely Timeless. These books are the gauge by-which all Fantasy books are measured. The Hobbit and The Trilogy have been the Inspiration for decades of works by other authors, yet I have not ever seen these works surpassed by anyone. Terry Brooks is the only author I have read who even compares to J.R.R. Tolkien and his epic style. I became fascinated with The Hobbit and Trilogy when I was in the seventh grade. I borrowed them from a friend and snuck them home. I was completely enthralled with the world Tolkien created. I was not allowed to read anything that was even remotely related to Wizards, Witches, Astrology, D&amp;D, etc., so these books were like nothing I had ever seen, before. I was captivated and felt the call to become a Writer. Previously, the poetry and such that we were studying in school BORED me to tears. I found my schooling to be mind-numbingly BORING and Tolkien became my Inspiration to Learn, create Poetry, Write stories, Study, become an Anthropologist, delve into Masonic Lore and so much more.... Throughout High-School, I had pictures of Prof. Tolkien on my wall and I desired to be like him. Not-only was he the Greatest Fantasy Writer the world has known, but he was &quot;Professor of Anglo-Saxon, at Oxford University, from 1925 to 1945....and professor of English Language and Literature....and a Fellow of Merton College from '45 to his retirement in '59.&quot; Check out his translations of (book title:)&quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Pearl, and Sir Orfeo&quot; (J.R.R. Tolkien) Also, Prof. Tolkien wrote wonderful stories like &quot;Smith of Wooten Major (&amp;) Farmer Giles of Ham&quot; for children. Pop those titles into the search box! I can honestly say that reading Tolkien changed my life...for the Better! Tolkien created the highest standards of writing for generations of authors....I am quite sure he would be deeply disappointed with the majority of books published today, with numerous spelling errors and pathetic grammar. I believe Tolkien is a god-send to English teachers. Perhaps, he can still inspire young people to elevate their Writing and English skills, from beyond. I would fight to keep his works on the shelves. I was not allowed to do my Senior Thesis about this author, despite the fact that he is such an amazing author and advocate of Literature. I lost interest in doing my thesis and threw something together at the last minute. Perhaps teachers should Recognize the potential for inspiring youth, via the works of J.R.R. Tolkien."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Im gonna make this short and sweet. I dont like to read much but this book was great and it is the best book i have ever read. Also read The Hobbit,The Fellowship Of The Rings, and The Return of the King( I recently finished). Tolkien is the best author i know of."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This book continues the events that took place in the Fellowship of the Ring, as now the Fellowship is broken up. Each small party explores different parts of the land, Middle-Earth created by Tolkien. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimili explore the fields of Rohan, Merry and Pippin befriend a survivor of an ancient race, and Frodo and Sam go straight into Mordor, leaded by the creature, Gollum. This was a great book and keeps you interested all the time. It really is hard to put it down once you start reading it. Afte rteh Fellowship of the Ring, I strongly suggest picking this book up (whether it be from a library or a store) and read it! It will keep you wondering what will happen in the third edition of the series....."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The road may go ever onward but, for us at least, the journey is done. It is difficult not to be emotional arriving at the end of Return of the King after making it through the entire trilogy. The thing about this particular book, for me, is it seems much such shorter than the other two. At least half the number of pages are devoted to the Appendices. The Two Towers had brought us so far that all that remains in Return of the King is climax after climax. Here, Frodo and Samwise's journey through Mordor is much more arduous than in the movie. It is in the third installment I think that we get the despair that Tolkien felt coming home from the Great War. He, like Frodo, must have found it impossible to pick up the threads of his old life.Like the movie, there is a very long denouement after the climax of the story. You may think it is over, but we have to find out what happens to all the characters. Peter Jackson left a lot out of the film - especially what happens to Saruman and the Shire.Now that it is over, I realize who my favorite characters are by who I will miss. Oddly, I don't miss any of the Men. Aragorn, for all we are told we are supposed to love him, falls rather flat on the page. Yeah, he is heroic, but I can't relate to him. I will miss Gandalf - he was fun. Legolas and Gimli are too thinly drawn to have any true love for them. Ultimately, Lord of the Rings is the hobbits story. They have personality. I feel for Frodo and the task that has been thrust upon him. I feel I know him and Samwise. That is the true statement the books have to make about heroism - you don't have to be a super-human like Aragorn. As Gandalf says, \\"you just have to do the most with the time that is given.\\"It's sad to watch your friends sail off into the sunset, but ultimately, that is the only way the book can end."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The conclusion of the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy is an excellent read, and is only the least of the series when compared with the quality of the first two books. By itself, 'The Return of the King' is a tale for the ages. It ties up nearly every loose end. Readers might wonder why the book does not end where it seems like it should. Not to worry, for it continues because there is still one more adventure... one more challenge waiting for the Hobbits when they return home after completing the Quest. Our heroes are forever changed from the individuals they were back when we first met them in 'Fellowship of the Ring,' as are their surroundings. Such is the nature of the Hero's Quest. As with any good fantasy adventure (though 'Lord of the Rings' can be interpreted as a mythology of sorts), all characters within the story earn what they receive, and those that do evil get what they deserve."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Inevitably, after reading The Fellowship of the Ring, the natural reaction is to reach for The Two Towers. The second part of a classic trilogy, The Two Towers picks up exactly where The Fellowship of the Ring left off. With most of the main characters already established and the main focus of the journey identified, the truly exciting scenes begin to take place. The novel splits up into a pair of books that take the reader through two different adventures based on the now divided characters. The two books take place during the same time line, which I felt was a very interesting way to observe the storylines. Talking about all the amazing qualities of Two Towers might spoil your own experience, but if you are ready to read Two Towers, you are already have an idea of what type of brilliance lies ahead.The imagery laid forth by Tolkien is simply dazzling, he was a master of the written word and this book exemplifies as well as magnifies that fact.Full of excitement and adventure, this continuation of the quest to rid the world from the threat of evil takes the reader right through the heart of one of the most colorful, well known and amazing fantasy adventures of all-time. After being left breathless at the end of this one, the reader will take part in his or her own journey to get their hands on The Return of the King to finish out the trilogy. Simply Spectacular!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I think this part of, \\"The Lord of the Rings,\\" is the grandest part and has an epic ambience to it. In particular, the ascension of Aragorn to the Throne of Gondor and the other events in the south of Middle-Earth are evocative of early Middle Ages (c. 1000 AD) both in the pomp and circumstance of the feasts and ceremonies and in the speech of the characters.Even though, \\"Fellowship of the Ring,\\" is my favorite part of the story there are certain sections of the part that stand out in my memory. The concluding chapters, which have a royal and somewhat majestic feel, are:The Field of CormallenThe Steward and the KingMany PartingsOne of the most famous chapters in, \\"The Lord of the Rings,\\" is, \\"The Scouring of the Shire,\\" where the four hobbits; Pippin, Merry, Frodo and Sam, return to the Shire (their homeland) after traveling around for over a year. Many have thought this chapter is some sort of comment on the effects of the industrial revolution on England; Tolkien has consistently denied that any events of the book are based on the real world.One of the most endearing qualities of that chapter is the fact that the brave four hobbits lead a rebellion against Men (who in addition to being twice the height of the average hobbit, are much stronger) and corrupt hobbits. This is such a change from, \\"The Hobbit,\\" and the depiction on the Shire in, \\"The Fellowship of the Ring,\\" where the hobbits merely worry about food and live their lives in ease. The fact that their homeland was touched and damaged by the War of the Ring surprises the hobbits; they always expected to come back to find it unchanged.Finally, the Elves, the oldest Race of Middle-Earth, depart and end the Third Age of the World. After the War and the departure of the Elves, the Fourth Age, the Age of Men begins. For those that are interested, there are several appendices at the end of this part that explains some of the background of the history, languages, characters and races of the novel.As for why I love the novel so much, it is difficult to pin it down exactly. The sense of a simpler world without so much technology and bureaucracy, with mysterious forces moving about to do great deeds is part of it. So much of modern fiction is so dreary or mundane, that a bit of fantasy is good. The sense that the novel is a feigned history, almost mythical, is another endearing quality of the book, for I have always enjoyed reading history.If you want to start reading, \\"The Lord of the Rings,\\" either buy a single volume or buy it in the three parts. The story is continuous and there are not breaks as such between the parts."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The title of Tolkien's third part of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; is both true and misleading. It points away from the heroism of the minor characters who carry all three parts of the Ring Saga, and it points to the tragic nature of the heroic epic. The dark and hopeless tone of the first two parts of the novel are fully realized and brought to a bright, if overcast conclusion in &quot;The Return of the King.&quot; Despite my bleak overview, the plot and characters are still masterfully rendered as the epic concludes.&quot;The Return of the King&quot; begins, as does its predecessor, &quot;The Two Towers,&quot; with everything in chaos. Here, the Fellowship of the Ring is further fractured - Merry departs with the newly-resuscitated wizard Gandalf for the beseiged fortress of Minas Tirith (the primary fortress of Gondor) to rejoin the valiant Pippin; Aragorn, Gimli, Legolas, and the Riders of Rohan pursue supernal aid on the Paths of the Dead; meanwhile, Sam faces despair as Frodo is borne away by a band of Orcs out of the dark maze of Cirith Ungol. Tolkien's plotting is fantastic, even Dickensian, as characters separate, reunite, and coincidences and chance govern the fate of Middle-earth. The action of &quot;The Return of the King&quot; involves Gandalf and Aragorn's attempts to stave off the elimination of their patchwork defense at the hands of Sauron, desperately trying to buy time for Frodo to complete his mission.Unfortunately, for me, the intensity of the denouement necessitates Tolkien to privilege, in the main, plot over character development in &quot;The Return of the King.&quot; Where character does govern the story, as with the first two parts of the Ring Saga, minor characters manage to take precedence over the huge scale of the action in which they move. In this context, &quot;The Return of the King&quot; belongs to two little hobbits, virtually overlooked by everyone in the novel, Merry and Sam - their efforts and concerns make them the most human and fully-realized characters in the third part of &quot;The Lord of the Rings.&quot;The legacy of &quot;The Return of the King,&quot; is just that - the title - the consolidation of power by Men - as the final confrontations between the forces of good and evil envelop dwarves, elves, and hobbits alike, Men begin to assume a place of leadership and control. Herein is the melancholy of the Ring Saga and of part three in particular - this is what Tolkien offers his readers, 50 years after the epic was first published. As important to-day as it was in the aftermath of World War II, what do we of the 'race of Men' do to make our world habitable? Tolkien's final installment of the Ring Saga implores us, the legatees of a fictional, fantasy world to act, as rather ordinary human beings, to be welcoming and hospitable to each other in this Dark Age; to reconcile our differences and somehow find lasting peace. Whether we are judged as Gandalf or Saruman, as Sam or Gollum is in our hands. It is a heavy burden, but one which Tolkien asks us to embrace."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Return of the King is one of the best novels I have ever read. This novel is so intense I could feel heart pounding. At the end of book five, where Tolkien returns to Sam and Frodo's journey, I could not put the book down. I read the remainder of the novel that day. Suspense keeps building and building until the very end. I actually find the ending to be sad. The final pages and parts and appendix seem very sad to me. I think the appedix is well worth reading.The story of Gandalf and Pippen sets the stage for the battle before Minas Tirith. The Witch King of Angmar leads his forces to destroy the White City while the men of Umbar sail against the Pelagir. When all seems hopeless, the Riders of Rohan arrive, and Aragorn walks the Path of the Dead. Sam and Frodo travel through Mordor even as the last battle is nearing its beginning. The Nazgul fly from battle as the ring nears its destruction. Will Frodo and Sam finish their quest? The suspense is staggering.The Return of the King is amazing, but if you wish to learn more of Middle Earth, of Beren and Luthien, and of Feanor, read not only the Return of the King, but the Silmarillion as well."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Loved it, the illustrations are like pieces of art!

This book shows that the struggle between good and evil will only end when the mind of the master has run out of words to express it in. I thought that the book began a little slow. When Gondor is preparing for the battle of Pelennor Fields and when the Rohirrim are gathering to go and help Gondor. Also when Aragon is going to raise the Army of the Dead. It begins to pickup when the battle of Pelennor Fields begins. The end of this part of the book happens when they decide to attack the Black Gate to give Frodo and Sam more time to reach Mount Doom and destroy the ring. Then the second part begins while Sam is trying to rescue Frodo from the orcs in The Tower of Cirith Ungol. Then it goes on to conclude Frodo and Sam's Journey across Middle Earth. It also tells of their final battle with Sm&eacute;agol. It then goes on to tell you of the conclusion of the battle before the Back Gate. Then it sums up the end of the story the crowing of Aragon, the return journeys of everyone and the fate of the Shire and how the world has changed. The only thing wrong with this book is that it ends and leaves nothing for a sequel to be made from. All in all I would have to say that I enjoyed the book very much and will read it many more times and enjoy it very much. I would like to thank Mr. J.R.R. Tolkien for this masterpiece in the literary world."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"What can I say? After over 65 years, the Lord of the Rings trilogy is still the ultimate fantasy epic. I won't go on and on gushing in praise. I will just note one of the brilliant literary devices that Tolkien uses that sets this book apart from so much other fantasy work. Tolkien weaves a complex narrative with many characters and plot twists, but also manages to set up brilliant parallels between them. For example we see two leaders (Theoden and Denethor) who face strikingly similar challenges, but Tolkien shows them responding differently. The former leads his men against evil, while the latter is cold and despairs. This use of paralleling gives the book so many layers and adds lasting value. Indeed, it's no wonder people can read this book many times over and not get bored. While the Peter Jackson movies are great, it doesn't - and can't - capture all of the nuance in the book.

Much less cheesey than the radio play. This really is the flagship of LOTR audio recordings."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"this is the second book to the lord of the rings. this is a phenomenal series. this is an awesome book. sometimes hard to get into but really good. if you have not read this book then i recommend you do"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers is the second volume of the Lord of the Rings, and like the first, it's divided into two \\"books.\\" Spoilers for the next five paragraphs.The first book covers the further splintering of the fellowship, as Merry and Pippin are carried off by a band of orcs, which have just killed the warrior Boromir. Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas pursue them towards Isenguard, but soon discover that all the orcs were killed by the horsemen of Rohan, and the hobbits escaped into Fangorn. They pursue them, but eventually, find Gandalf; alive and dressed in white, who tells them that the hobbits will be fine.Indeed, Merry and Pippin are alright; having befriended a monstrous tree-being named Treebeard; leader of the ents. Soon, the ents are going to war with the wizard Saruman, who sent the orcs into their land.Gandalf and the others, however, travel to Rohan to muster their horsemen against Saruman's remaining forces. There's a battle at Helm's Deep, and a confrontation with the wizard Saruman himself to endure, but ultimately, it's only a foretaste of the tremendous conflict to come; with Sauron, and Mordor.The second book of the Two Towers chronicles the journey of Frodo and Sam across the lands outside of Mordor; the cliffs, the marshes, and the crossroads, where after discovering that traveling through the black gate isn't an option, they meet the Gondor captain Faramir. He finds out about the ring, but refuses to try to claim it, or take it back to Gondor with him. Instead, he lets the hobbits go on their way again, towards Cirith Ungol; where a tremendous spider lays in wait for them.Over the course of this book, the hobbits meet and befriend Gollum, who, for a while, guides them towards Mordor, but ultimately betrays them in the hopes of getting the ring back. The book ends with a climactic fight between the giant spider Shelob and Sam; struggling to protect the life of his best friend Frodo.The themes of good and evil are perhaps a bit less pronounced during the Saruman arc, but not by much. It's pretty clear that he's the bad guy from the start, and this story delves much more into the specific things that evil does to a person who was once good. The face-off scene between Saruman and Gandalf is, in my opinion, quite possibly the most complex and magnificent scene in the entire book; showcasing the true differences between the two, and the difference between minds accustomed to good, and to evil.I also found the first book just a bit more exciting than its predecessors, though I won't say it was perfect. The parts with Treebeard moved rather slowly, and at times, it became difficult to tell who was responsible for what evils. I also found the ents just a tiny bit threatening; not in terms of being scarey, but because they reminded me of modern naturalists.Still, even on those terms, anyone trying to use ents as an analogy for naturalism would be basically shooting themselves in the foot, because there's no serious comparison of the sort that could be made. Ents are intelligent, and trees aren't. If trees were intelligent, they too would have civil rights, and naturalists would be out of a job.I also feel I should say a few words about the battle at Helm's Deep. I really enjoyed reading it, and liked the way it was resolved. In fact, I'm sort of not sure which I like better; the movie version or the book version, and up to now, I've liked the movie version of most Tolkien battles better. Maybe it's just that this is the first battle he actually took time to dwell on and describe.As for the second book, I honestly think that it's the best I've read so far, out of the first four. It has tension, which doesn't really let up at any point during it, and the final battle against Shelob is one of the best in the book series. I was also very impressed with the strong relationships between the characters of Frodo and Sam, and the constant development of the character of Gollum throughout the book. His character in particular is both amusing (at times) and also an interesting illustration of what happens to a person mired in, and addicted to grave evil; how they develop when shown kindness, and how easily they betray when tempted again.I found Faramir to be an interesting character, in a sense, although many of Tolkien's human characters seem to ring a bit hollow to me, perhaps because I personally prefer stories of the fantastic, while he seems enamored with humans (a major thread in LOTR, at any rate, though less in the movies than in the books.) Faramir doesn't really suffer from this, however, because he has the chance to develop relationships with Frodo, Sam and Gollum, and to show what kind of man he is by the choices he makes. Because all this effort was put into him, I find him to be a well fleshed-out character, and a boon to this book, rather than a drag.On the whole, I was very pleased with this book, and like the others, I reccomend it to those with patience and good reading skills. It was a pleasure to read."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"When I read the first two books and the hobbit I was immensely impressed with the greatness of these novels. But I must say, The Return of the King blew them out of the water, into the air, and flopped them up on shore. The pure literary beauty of this book is stunning. There were several parts in this book where I was covered in chill bumps and and at other times I was close to tears. At Mount Doom when the ring was destroyed and Frodo says to Sam, \\"I'm glad I'm here with you at the end of all things, Sam.\\" It was an emotional roller coaster. Plus the book has a whole chapter that is left out in the movie. So if you think that you know Middle Earth by just seeing the movies you are wrong!!!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"OK, first of all, \\"The Return of the King\\" is not a stand-alone book. It is the third book in the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy. And, since that is the case, you should not read it until you have first completed \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" and \\"The Two Towers.\\" These books were written as one seamless story by JRR Tolkien, but the manuscript was deemed to long to publish in one volume, so it was originally released as three separate books...and they read that way. The first book ends abruptly, and the second one begins the same way...through the end of \\"The Return of the King.\\" While I'm sure they could be released in one volume, tradition as seen them continuing to be released as three separate books.Another thing you should know about \\"The Return of the King\\" is that this book is noted to be about 550pp long, but the story ends efore you reash page 400. The remaining pages in this volume contain appendices that will be of interst to the more devoted Tolkien fan. Those appendices include the family history and lineages of several of the main characters in the story, some background of Aragorn and Arwen, and similar selections of background material.This is a satisfying conclusion to the longer tale.The main story of the trilogy sees growing darkness and treachery reaching out of Mordor and into the free and happy lands of western Middle Earth followed by the first blows in the battle for control of Middle earth, and finally, the resoluton of the confrontation between good and evil, light and darkness.Some readers may complain that the end is somewhat anticlimactic after the events of the main battle and resolution of the story, but I prefer to view the conclusion of the book as the calm after a storm: a time when people begin to realize the significance of events that have passed and start to adjust to their new reality.I have read \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy at least a dozen times, more often in my youth than in recent years, but every time I embark on this literary journey I know that I will be swept away into Middle Earth -- a land that on the one hand presents honor, boldness, faith, and truth, and on the other hand falls to fear, lies, deceit, and evil.This is a classic tale of adventure, battle, romance (a bit), and the significance that even the smallest participant can make.A fine book for readers of ALL ages.5 stars! Thank you Tolkien! Thank you for the adventure!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I am not a dedicated \\"fantasy literature\\" fan, but I've been a \\"Lord of the Rings\\" fan since I was in college (er...back in the late 1970s - OK, I've dated myself). Anyway, I still remember getting to the end of \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" (a book assigned in a Reading Lit class), and being left hanging as the fellowship was broken. I finished that book one evening, and I couldn't wait to get to the bookstore the next day to pick up a copy of \\"The Two Towers\\"...which I then proceeded to devour.I've read this entire series several times since those heady college days, and the Lord of the Rings (trilogy) remains one of my favorite stories.What should you know about \\"The Two Towers\\" if you are thinking about picking up a copy?1) Make sure that you buy not only this book, but the other two books in the Lord of the Rings trilogy (The Fellowship of the Ring: Being the First Part of The Lord of the RingsThe Return of the King: Being the Third Part of The Lord of the Rings)2) Each of the books in the trilogy do not stand alone. You need to not only read all three, but you need to read them in order. Tolkien wrote the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" as one cohesive story, but because of the length of the story it was published in three volumes. The first two books end abruptly, and the story picks right up in each of the following volumes...so you'll want to have all three handy when you start reading.3) The writing and imagery is crisp and vivid. The world Tolkien created and the people and other creatures that live there will draw you in.4) I prefer to read this book in a quiet, somewhat dimly lit room...it adds to the atmosphere.5) There is no foul language in these books. They are a pleasure to read.6) These books work well for readers of many ages - I actually read all of these books to my children when they were still in their elementary school years (years before the movies were produced). They remain favorites of some of my children and got them started on their own adventures in reading.This series is certainly in my top-10 list of books, and depending on the day, almost always falls out near the top of that list.This is not a book to be missed.5 stars, no doubt and no mistake!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"\\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is the sequel to J.R.R.

Tolkien. This book is the last chapter in the trilogies that is recognized world-wide. The book is entertaining because it has lots of imagery, excitement and foreshadowing, which made it much more exciting then the movie. It had many messages and underlying meanings that added depth and intelligence to the reading, which kept me more involved in the story then the movie. I would rate the book a 4.5 out of 5 stars because the ending was a cliff hanger. I was disappointed that the conclusion did not finalize the series, since this was the last book of the series.This book took place in the Third Age of Middle Earth. Being that it is the third book in the series it starts at the point of Frodo continuing his journey to Mordor. He is still trying to take the One Ring to where it was created in order to stop the antagonist Sauron from regaining his physical form and conquering all of Middle Earth. The first chapter starts with Merry riding with Gandalf on the back of Shadowfax who was charging towards Minas Tirith for the purpose of meeting the Steward of the city. Why is this important? This is important because they needed to notify him that his son was killed after getting hit with seven arrows.There were many main characters, but Frodo, Sam, Gollum, and Sauron in my mind, were some of the most significant characters. Frodo and Sam were protagonists in the story, because they were trying to save the good on Middle Earth. Frodo's responsibility was to carry the One Ring to Mt. Doom in order to toss it in the lava where it was created so that it could be destroyed which would mean that he saved the Middle Earth. By doing this, it would cause Sauron to be weakened beyond recovery. Sauron, who was the main antagonist, was trying to rule the Middle Earth. Sam chose to follow Frodo and assist him in accomplishing this task. Gollum was a trickster; he was another antagonist who wanted the One Ring in order to satisfy greed. Gollum was the navigator around the lands of the east. Gollum was controlled by the One Ring, which made him strangle his best friend, because the One Ring wanted to be found and taken to Sauron. The One Ring took Gollum and twisted him into an evil rotten character with two personalities. He would talk to himself, by looking at his reflection in water. Some people would say that Aragorn and Gandalf would be considered the main characters because they led the attack on the Black Gate of Mordor to distract the Eye of Sauron from spotting Frodo and Sam who were making their way to Mt. Doom. Also, Merry and Pippin followers of Denethor steward of Minas Tirith and Theoden lord of the Mark were key characters because their journey helped to move the story through the different episodes of the book. I also see the One Ring as a character in its own right, it can control others, has much power, and there was a poem written about it in the book that stated, \\"One Ring to rule them all. One Ring to take them into the darkness and bind them.\\" As you can see there are lots of characters that play very important parts to help the story lines in the book.Many conflicts during the plot of the book took place. Some were more significant then others, but all played an important role in moving the story towards the climate. The Battle of the Black Gate of Mordor caught my attention as a reader because it established a distraction as Aragorn and Gandalf tried to distract the Eye of Sauron from spotting Frodo and Sam who were making their way to Mt. Doom. At the same time in the book, Frodo and Sam were having adventures as they scurried toward destroying the One Ring. Another conflict was when the forces of Mordor attacked Minas Tirith, they came by land and sea. These antagonists were made up of Orks and trolls from Minas Morgal, and Corsairs of Umbar. They came to over throw the city of Minas Tirith, but found it too difficult to do so, as the soldiers of Minas Tirith were well prepared for the attack. Aragorn and Gandalf were at this battle and this meant that they were unable to support Frodo and Sam in their current position. The next major conflict was between Eyomer, who was a female warrior and the Witch King. This duel was important because if the Witch King, who was the leader of the Nazgl, was destroyed so would his nine other followers. The Witch King was trying to kill Gandalf and Aragorn which would have made it easy for Sauron to spot Frodo and Sam. Fortunately, Eyomer was able to kill the Witch King by stabbing him in the face even though he has boasted about winning when he said, \\"No man can defeat me.\\" The most important continuing conflict throughout the book was the temptation that Frodo and Gollum shared, because they both wanted control of The One Ring. The One Ring had power over both of the weak minded men; they wanted to keep the ring under their possession. Even though Frodo knew in his heart he had to prevail over this power and throw it into the lava. The ring's power was more then either could overcome. The two men battled each other trying to gain control of the ring, Gollum bit off Frodo's finger and the ring fell into the lava. Gollum jumped into the lava after it and melted. Then the land of Mordor began to crumble under their feet and Frodo realized that he had accomplished his long time mission of destroying Sauron by the melting of The One Ring.The book as compared to the movie described more details of the characters' journeys and episodes. The one thing I really liked were the lines of dialogue because of the type of words the characters used. Overall, I liked the book a lot and I would recommend it to everyone who likes fantasy.Sage Bittner"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Lord of the Rings needs no review by me. It is what it is, a timeless classic. This edition is a very high quality paperback, and a big enough format that the book is easy and enjoyable to read."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I recently reviewed Recorded Books Incorporated's unabridged rendition of Fellowship of the Ring. I return now to review the second installment of the trilogy, The Two Towers. The Two Towers pics up right where Fellowship left off. Frodo and Sam have left to find a way into Mordor, while Merri and Pippin have gone in search of them. Aragorn, drawn away from his search for Frodo by the urgent call of Boromir's horn, finds the man mortally wounded in a clearing, surrounded by the bodies of many Orcs. With his last breath, Boromir confesses his attempt to take the ring from Frodo and warns that Pippin and Merri have been captured by the Orcs. After a simple ceremony in which the body of Boromir is laid to rest in one of the three Elven-made boats in which they travelled and sent down the river to the falls of Rauros, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimley resolve to hunt down the Orcs and rescue the captive Hobbits.Thus begins the second installment of Lord of the Rings. As before Rob Englis delivers a top notch performance. He continues his trend of actually singing the songs in his good tenor rather than just reciting them as other narrators have done. He portrays each new character very well as far as I'm concerned, which makes for a great listen.

Even at the price of $12 this book is WELL worth the money."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"With this book, the second installment in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" (a single extremely long novel, not a trilogy), things start to fall into place.The Fellowship of the Ringwas great, but it felt like it was basically build-up for bigger things to come. Well, by the time \\"The Two Towers\\" starts, the ball is rolling, and fast.I was weary about the decision to split the book into two halves, one half dealing with Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Merry, and Pippin, and the other half dealing with Frodo, Sam, and Gollum, because I thought it might have been a wiser decision to mix it up a bit; have one chapter deal with Aragorn and company, the next with Frodo and company, and so on. However, the way it is set up is probably for the better. Each half read very well, advancing this classic story in big ways.Again, as I mentioned in my review for \\"Fellowship,\\" Tolkien's work isn't for the impatient reader. His beefy sentences demand that you comb through them, soaking in the language and appreciating the intensely thought-out sub-creation of Tolkien's Middle-earth. Thing is, that kind of writing isn't for everyone. I've read pompous reviewers insulting those who don't appreciate Tolkien's style, but the \\"get on with the story, Tolkien\\" complaints are not without merit. I thoroughly enjoyed \\"The Two Towers\\" and consider the overall arc ofThe Lord of the Ringsto be a classic and timeless story, but the style of writing can, at times, grate against one's patience.So I'll end my review for this book by including something I said in my review for \\"Fellowship,\\" which very much applies here: \\"Pour a cup of tea. Heck, sit it on a tea cozy. Turn off your phone, and absorb the writing. Visualize the mountains, rivers, all of the scenery. Feel what is happening, don't just read it. True, there is a lot of back story that could have been taken out, but it wasn't. So deal, and read it--most of it, if not all, is interesting.\\"PS: The character arc of Gollum (and his dialogue!) alone is worth reading this book.

The first hundred pages might be fairly slow but that would be what it would be if it were real life. Also, the pages after the first hundred are more gripping and exciting than almost any section in the entire Fellowship of the Ring. Even after the boring pages it is still a good read."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I have read already The Hobbit and The Fellowship of the Rings and I have one thing to say about The Two Towers, it is awesome. After the Fellpwship you know Gandalf is dead, the fellowship is probably going to be scattered, and Frodo is going with the faithful Samwise to Mordor alone. The Two Towers, like the first book, is split in to two sections. One is with Strider, Legolas, and Gimli to set out and find Merry and Pippim and deal with the treachory of Saruman(and on hint, there is a huge suprise in store). The second is all about Frodo and Sam on the trek to Mordor with the treachorous Gollum. At first he seems to be different and wants to be called his old name, Smeagol,but you quickly learn that Gollum has two sides(named by Sam as Slinker and Stinker). It all ends with a perfect setting for the next book, The Return of the King. All in all The Two Towers is one of the best books you'll ever read in your lifetime."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"1) Gollum (Smeagle) is the epitome of the lowest creation. From the beginning when he murdered his best friend for the ring Gollum was doomed. He had the ring, but it possessed him. However, he lost the ring and even though it pained him he still loved and longed for it. It was his own, his precious. Gollum disappears, but then returns during the fellowship. After guiding Frodo and Sam he betrayed them in an effort to seize the ring. In the Return of the King he reappears and shadows Frodo and Sam. He plays an integral role in the completion of the task of the fellowship in Tolkien's ironic way.2) The unconventional way of wizards is an example of Tolkien's creativity. Most wizards have a wand, but Tolkien's wizards, though they are mystifying, seem to be the caretakers and historians of the world and are concerned for the greater well being of the earth and its inhabitants. They also seem to gain power from knowledge. When Gandalf returned as Gandalf the White he speaks of learning much and he has also increased in power. However, wizards are susceptible to the temptation of evil because a dark wizard is more powerful.3) The main object of the epic is the ring. The ring is inanimate yet it can turn anyone who possesses it towards evil even if they wish otherwise. It also could turn those who put it on invisible. The rings main purpose is to return to its master (Sauron). When it was created Sauron put part of him in it, in order to make him more powerful. It was also part of a masterful plan to force every creature under his power.4) Tolkien's depiction of the evil Sauron as a lidless eye that sees all is interesting anthropomorphism because he possesses the attributes of most evil beings, but since he is unable to take physical form he is a mysterious unseen powerful ruler. The Eye of Sauron sees all yet its attention can be focused on an area, allowing things to slip.5) The Ents are a truly original Tolkien conception. They are trees that have been awakened. Though their major role is in the Two Towers they do appear in this novel. They live to be extremely old, and don't like to be hasty. They also can break stone easily.6) Though the title of the book concedes the knowledge of the king's (Aragorn) return, after this event the book unexpectedly continues. After all the hobbit's hardships, when they reach home they still have to deal with an unforeseen difficulty. Saramen, a character who was thought to be out of the book, resurfaces at the head of the conflict. In the chapter the \\"The Scouring of the Shire,\\" Tolkien twists the plot and creates a small climax as the four hobbits rebel against men.7) This book, as with the previous two novels, showcases Tolkien's conceptual world. He masterfully is able to take the reader into this world, as if the story was fact.8) This verse opens the book. &quot;Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky,Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone,Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die,One for the Dark Lord on his dark throneIn the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind themIn the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.&quot; It sets the stage for the coming tale and leaves the reader waiting to uncover more9) A skilled linguist, Tolkien's elven language further contributes to the overall sense of reality.10) By focusing on minor characters, such as Merry and Pippin, Tolkien is able to keep the reader from predicting the next event."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Return of the King picks up where The Two Towers left off. In this final installment our attention turns to the western part of Middle-earth as the Ring continues its journey toward Mount Doom and Aragorn and Theoden lead their armies toward Minas Tirith.I've read some reviews here that express disappointment with the lack of a final face-to-face conflict with Sauron. They ask &quot;How could he be so dumb?&quot; These people, I think, have missed the point. Just as I think the second book is about the acceptance of destiny, The Return of the King is about the arrogance of Evil. Sauron and his minions never believed they could be defeated. Gandalf said as much when he figured that Sauron couldn't even imagine so simple an assault could be his undoing. Also, I find Sauron more frightening in his non-corporeal form. If he made a physical appearance at the end it would have greatly diminished his ability to frighten.I find that the strange ending with Saruman works. It shows how the Shire can no longer be isolated from the affairs of the world. The Ring Quest dragged the Shire, kicking and screaming, into the Fourth Age all the while seasoning her future leaders for the tasks that lie ahead.The appendices included here are invaluable to anyone who either wants to read more about Middle-earth's past."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I am new to the fantasy genre. As I started on the first pages of THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING (in anticipation of the movie), I did not know exactly what to expect and was initially put off by the many songs and by &quot;Tom Bombadil&quot;. But after that brief state of confusion, I have come to thoroughly enjoy Tolkien's writings, the luscious details of history and geography, and - of course - the characters.In THE TWO TOWERS Tolkien dazzles us with his imagination and continues to bring all the components of Middle Earth to full life, in a description so vivid that one thinks that it must exist. Each half of the book builds up to climactic experiences as we journey through the lands of men and darkness, while the presence of the hobbits - their simplicity and naivete' - anchors us firmly to the human side of the epic. Characters are given more chances to express their individuality and to prove their worth as they face physical demons, and the ones that reside in their heads. The growth in characters such as Samwise Gamgee is very genuine and gripping. We are left at the end with a cliffhanger that compels you to read the last part of the trilogy. (I wonder what Peter Jackson will do about that?)One could argue about the lack of humor and female characters, but ultimately it is the beauty and the sense of purpose behind Middle Earth, its inhabitants and its history that should win over even the most skeptical of readers."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Honestly, after finishing Lord of the Rings, I can't help but feel sad because it's over!!!This story is incredible, the characters are profound, and very real, the Middle Earth comes to life in such a way that it becomes impossible to think that it doesn't exist, and there are so many different tales left untold that would be worth telling.There really isn't enough I can say about this books, and especially about the Return of the King. We find each character following his own destiny, and facing his deepest fears, we see inner struggle, a huge war where each piece is as important as the rest and where they all move wisely and bravely into what awaits them, we discover courage in whom we least expect, and above all we find ourselves celebrating with them victory and love. It is simply incredible.The only complaint I have is that it is too short!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Without a doubt, the best fantasy series of all time."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Wow! These books are amazing. Absolutly amazing! Tolkien writes so magically. The description in these books is fantastic. You get to know the characters and fall in love with them. (In my case-Aragorn) He used a great balance between dialogue and discription. I could not put these books down. I highly recommend The Lord of the Rings to anyone, anyone at all. Regardless of wheather they like Sci-fi fantasy books or not, they will love LotR."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This is the best book I have ever read. It's exciting, suspenseful, and full of adventure. If I ever reccomended a book it would be this, but I would advise that you read \\"The Hobbit\\" by J.R.R. Tolkien first."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I love the conclusion to a series. For example, for pure enjoyment, give me &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, to see the ends tied together. I like the sense of inclusion and completeness when you finish a great series.Like it or not, the Lord of the Rings trilogy is one of the most influential books of the century - it spawned an entire genre in its ideas and precepts. Some people find Tolkien too slow, his ideas to archaic and/or derivative (but since he was in many ways the original, Middle Earth at least is not derivative).This is not an entirely happy ending trilogy - Tolkien did live through the second world war after all. It is high fantasy at its best, glinting, tragic, fighting against evil, the characters larger than life and vulnerable at the same time. I read these books every summer as a treat. Some people find them boring, too slow, too much description (it is a very rich world). All I can say is that if you read fantasy, any fantasy at all, then you should love these books."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I loved this book.This is my favorite book out of the three (or two, I have not yet read &quot;The Return of the King&quot;) because it really focused on the characters that in &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; were just the supporting characters. The character development in this book was incredible. You start the book not really knowing anything at all about these people and end it knowing so much. I think Tolkien was able to do this because the book did not entirely focus on Frodo.My favorite part in the book is Golem. I really liked the little part he played in &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and in &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; but I liked him the best in this book. It's really cool how Tolkien showed him as he loved and hated the ring and also how he had this strange affection for Frodo.This book is amazing. I loved everything about it from the way it was written to the art on the cover. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I read this book after seeing the first movie. It is extremely well written, thorough storytelling. The adventures in this book are at least as exciting-if not more than-the first movie. (I say movie because I did not read the first book yet, I only saw the movie.) The characters become more interesting, more three dimensional in this second book. And the settings are spectacular. I was moved to draw several of the places mentioned in this book. I found myself wishing to visit an Ent-hall, to explore beautiful hidden caverns, to look out upon an ancient city. Absolutely worth the read."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Well, if you liked The Fellowship of the Ring of The Lord of the Rings series, then you'll have a ball with The Two Towers. In the second part of this story, it continues off with the scattered fellowship looking for their ring-bearer, Frodo, who somehow disappeared along with Samwise. Along with that, the quest continues with Frodo continuing his quest of destroying the ring of all evil in Mordor.J.R.R. Tolkien is a tremendous writer. Besides The Lord of the Rings, others stories like The Silmarillion is a great example of his work. This book is like an introduction of Middle-Earth, which is where The Lord of the Rings series take place. If Tolkien hadn't existed in his time, then how would fans of the him be able to live without his stories? Without J.R.R. Tolkien, then his stories wouldn't exist and how could we live with that? He also uses great imagery in his stories, which is a great asset to the series.For the fans of Tolkien, The Lord of the Rings is highly recommended, for it is written by a great author. Not only that, you don't even have to be a fan of the author. If you love stories with magic, friendship, and a fight between good and evil, then this series is a perfect match for you. For friendship, both Frodo and Sam will go far beyond the dangers of Middle-Earth to destroy that ring. If one falls, then the other falls also. That's how friendships work between Frodo and Sam. Their bond is their courage to continue on to Mordor. For me, this is why I love this story."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"In my review of his reading of the Fellowship of the Ring, I gave poor old Rob Inglis a bit of a drubbing (rated three stars). And, in my review of the second set, I am going to give him a bit of a break.My general comments about Inglis stand. He is a bit one paced. Because of the nature of his voice he is limited as to the range of voices he can adopt. And he as a tendency to read in an arch, almost pretentious manner which does the book and many of the characters something of a disservice. I think that because of his own age, Inglis has a tendency to make his characters sound older than they should. The best example of this is Aragorn and it was my wife who made this point first. I have always seen him as a young, vigorous man - early thirties. This is how Peter Jackson also saw him if his casting is any judge. But Inglis' rendering suggests a middle-aged man - in his mid fifties.However, my recommendation, then, as now, is to buy this version as it is the only extant unabridged version of Lord of the Rings that is available.Having said that, he seems appreciably better in his rendering of the characters in this volume of the trilogy - perhaps he grew into the reading as he went along - this often happens. There are certain characters which he has \\"nailed\\" - among them Tree Beard and most importantly of all, Gollum. Inglis' rendering of Gollum is near letter-perfect.For all my quibbles, I was completely addicted to this reading. I drive about 30 minutes to and from work each day - and have a 2 hour drive to and from our farm on weekends. If I ever found myself in the car at the end of a set of CDs, with a long drive ahead of me, I almost went stir crazy. I should also say that my brother, also a LoTR aficionado does not have the same problem with Inglis - he even likes listening to the songs! - which I still find un-listenable."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"One of the most astounding traits of Tolkein's writing is his uncanny ability to create different races that are unique in their ownright but altogether familiar to us personally. Tolkein seems to have taken a very personal vision and expressed it in a universal way.

Nonetheless, this rates a full five stars as the loose ends from the first two parts are tied up.The way things are resolved are both brilliant and follow from what is hinted at before. From the final fate of the Ring to the problems in the Shire, it all fits. In addition, the appendices add a richness to the world of Middle-Earth, giving it a depth in history and language that is incredible.Books have been written about this trilogy, and hundreds of books have tried to imitate it, so it is obviously not a small task to praise it appropriately in this small area. It is sufficient to give it five stars and let it speak for itself."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers has always been my favorite book in the Lord of the Rings trilogy because there is no introductory material as in Fellowship of the Ring or winding-down material as in Return of the King. It is instead the heart of the story.Divided into two halves, the first half follows the majority of the Fellowship as they contend with the secondary but still very dangerous villain, Saruman. The second half follows the hobbits Frodo and Sam as they are forced into an uneasy alliance with the weasely Gollum and approach the hellish land of Mordor.Since this is the middle part of a larger story, few things are resolved. This is fine, as this is not meant to be read as a standalone book. It does, however, represent great storytelling, with rich detail and characters.Many have tried to imitate this trilogy and few have come even close to being near Tolkien's level. This story is not only one of the greatest fantasy stories ever, it is one of the great fictional works of the 20th Century."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers follows the lives of the Fellowship, shortly after they broke up. Samwise and Frodo trek on to destroy the ring at Mt. Doom, and the rest, including Aragorn, Legolas and our beloved dwarf friend Gimli search for Merry and Pippin, who had been kidnapped by Orcs. Fierce battles, amazing dialogue and very memorable characters made &quot;The Two Towers&quot; a great read. I won't spoil the ending, but, I'll tell you this: After I completed &quot;The Two Towers&quot;, I immediately went out and purchased &quot;Return of the King&quot; to see how it would end.For any fan of fantasy or fan of great writing, this is the book for you. A great sequel to &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; and an excellent read.Three words: Read it now"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Although it is not light reading it is really a great book. It is part of a series and is the second one in the series. If you have not read the first one (which is called The Fellowship of the Ring ) you will not understand this book at all.The most common good races that you see in this book are: elves, dwarfs, men, and hobbits.Hobbits are very short and have curly hair. They dislike adventures, ( And in this book there are four hobbits having adventures.)This book is a great one and I hope you will read it and enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Why is this book not available on American Kindle yet? This book will definitely get 5 stars when I can read it again. I've read this series so often, I've had to replace my books. I've even watched the movie version ( which I rarely do as they never compete with the books. I got my Kindle for Christmas this year and wanted to place this series on it just to find I couldn't. what's the deal?"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"NOTE: This review contains major spoilers. So if you haven't read the book or haven't seen the film, then don't read what's below this sentence.-----------------------------------------It's fairly obvious that there are differences between the film and the book. And it's safe to say that there are some (but not all) improvements that were made for the film.First off, this second volume of Lord of the Rings contains two parts. The Fellowship of the Ring has separated: the first part deals with Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, the return of Gandalf, and the people of Rohan. It also contains Merry and Pippin finding themselves in Fangorn Forest, home of the ancient Ents. These two plots are connected with Isengard in both its rise and fall from grace. Then the second part deals with Frodo, Sam, and the creature Gollum as they journey to the land of Mordor, where Mount Doom and Barad-Dur stand with the shadows. Before I read Two Towers, I knew that this book separated Frodo and Sam's adventures away from the Rohan/Isengard storyline. And having watched the (Extended) film many times, I went ahead and read the book as if I watched the film. For example, I read the chapter \\"The Black Gate is Closed\\" as soon as I finished reading \\"Treebeard\\" and \\"The White Rider\\". It may not be what Tolkien intended, but I enjoyed it this way. I still don't understand why Tolkien didn't have all three main adventures integrated in with each other, instead of segregating Frodo/Sam's adventures away from the journeys of Pippin/Merry & Aragorn/Gimli/Legolas/Rohan. Maybe in the 50's, that way of storytelling never occured to anybody. Oh well.Anyway, \\"The Two Towers\\" is far more exciting than \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\". For one thing, you have The people of Rohan. Their bonding with horses fascinates me: they're vikings, but with mammals instead of ships. Then, you have the Dead Marshes, which is probably THE scariest setting in the fantasy genre. You also have the dark and gloomy lair of Shelob: the sequence is so intense that the goosebumps are a must. Now in the film, I found Gollum to be a bit too exaggerated and very annoying at times. But in the book, his schizophrenic personality really works. And finally, it's nice to see a completely different Faramir in the book, though the film version is much better: Denethor wanting the Ring makes for a big motive when you really want to impress your father.But of course, this book does have its disadvantages. Having Boromir die in the very first chapter seems a bit too improper. The son of Denethor dies and it all turns exciting, but then in the next chapter, all Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli do are run across the river Entwash and in the fields of Rohan. That slows the whole book down, unfortunately. SEcondly, the return of Gandalf wasn't really at all shocking: when you bring back a character that's presumed dead, that's more like a typical Hollywood moment. Maybe it's just me and that I've seen way too much mature films and TV shows.Then, we have Eowyn. To tell you the truth, I have to thank P. Jackson, F. Walsh, and P. Boyens for making her more of a central supporting character in the film. In the book, she's almost pushed aside (though, in \\"Return of the King,\\" she gets her chance with what she has to say and do). It's arguable whether Tolkien was a sexist (or even a racist), because there are hardly any female characters about. The Fellowship is consisted of only males. I know that LOTR is a trilogy for males, but the author could've at least make one of the four hobbits female, or maybe Legolas. Luckily, Robert Jordan's \\"Wheel of Time\\" series gets a point for giving females a chance at breaking the female cliche found in fantasy.Theodin as the good and noble king is also a tired old cliche. The character's way too nice; again, the film version improves on this very greatly. Here, he's much praised by his people and he makes all the right decisions and yadda yadda yadda. Makes me want to read George R.R. Martin's \\"Song of Ice and Fire\\" series immediately after finishing LOTR.With all the things that got me down while reading \\"Towers\\", I still enjoyed the book nonetheless. There are plenty of action, humor, drama, thrills, chills, and huge spiders. Memorable characters and interesting races make it all the more compelling.And I have to give credit to Tolkien and his LOTR trilogy, because without LOTR, there wouldn't have been The Wheel of Time, A Song of Ice and Fire, The Farseer Trilogy, etc.Grade: B"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Chad RodgersThe Return of the KingThe Return of the King, part three of The Lord of the Rings trilogy is one of thebest books I have read in quite a while. In this book Frodo and Sam are approaching theconclusion of their long and exhausting quest, but Gollum is tight on their trail. Merryand Pippin have been estranged into two different kingdoms. Pippin is a warrior, whoserves to king Th&eacute;oden. Merry is a servant to the steward of Gondor. Aragorn has amajor decision to make, and is on his perilous journey back to Rivendell, because ofArwen.I think that this book is very well written, and has a lot of complex words that canimprove the readers vocabulary. The Return of the King is the third in its trilogy, and Ithink it would be allot easier for the reader if he or she read the first two Lord of theRings books before reading on to the third. This book was very exciting and I think thatit is one of the greatest epics of our time. I also think that this is the best book out of thethree Lord of the Rings books. Over all this is a really great book.This book took me quite some time to read and I think that a more skilled readerwould be able to go through it and enjoy it more resourcefully. I also think that guyswould be more interested in this book because there is a lot of fighting and warfareinvolved in it. I would recommend it to high school aged people because it is really acomplicated book to read. Anyone who has enjoyed books about warfare or fantasywould take pleasure in reading this book a great deal."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Brilliant. Awe-inspiring. Masterfully written.J.R.R. Tolkien creates another world--indeed, another culture and language--in what many consider the greatest novel of the 20th Century, \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\" A sweeping, all-encompassing tale of a make-believe world, LOTR is the product of an imagination that may never be equalled again.THE TWO TOWERS, the second part of Tolkien's LOTR trilogy, takes the reader on a remarkable, almost breathless journey: chasing orcs who have captured Merry and Pippen; galloping across the plains of Rohan with Riders of the Rohirrim; the bloody battle of Helm's Deep; the vast wasteland of Isengard; the perilous journey of Frodo and Sam to the borders of Mordor, accompanied by a most unlikely ally. Unlike \\"The Fellowship of the Ring,\\" Tolkien's first installment, which at times was compelled to slow to a snail's pace to patiently set up the story, THE TWO TOWERS moves the reader along at a rapid clip, from the first page to the last.Here we are also introduced to a rich variety of new characters: Eomer, King Theoden, the evil Wormtongue, Treebeard the Ent, Faramir of Gondor, and a nasty assortment of snarling orcs. Tolkien's mastery of the written word brings these characters, and the places of Middle-earth they inhabit--to colorful life. The rich imagery he creates is unsurpassed; THE TWO TOWERS is storytelling unsurpassed. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The fact that US customers can buy Kindle versions of Fellowship, Return Of The King, The Hobbit and even The Silmarillion but NOT The Two Towers is ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS!! What possible reason could there be for excluding just the middle volume of a trilogy???"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Is it okay that I didn't really like The Return of the King, or the entire Lord of the Ring Trilogy for that matter? I feel like a fantasy fan failure admitting that, but just put the pitchforks down and hear me out.The Fellowship of the Ring was just okay for me. The Two Towers was difficult to get through and The Return of the King was pretty much the same. I had to force myself to finish. I'm something of a completist. I had already put the time and effort into reading the first two and people kept telling me was that I had to read the last one, so I really tried to like it.The story is great. The characters, fantastic. I truly loved the movies. The books were something akin to torture, though. The names, the places and the descriptions were all lost on me. I would have needed a large cheat sheet to keep track of everyone and everything I was supposed to remember to follow the story. I constantly had to backtrack to figure who was who and to what they were referring. Strangely enough, the only thing I could keep track of was the different races of people. I suppose I could have gotten really into it had I read the trilogy as if it was a textbook, but this was supposed to be leisurely reading.The Return of the King dragged on and on with no end in sight. 85 pages of saying goodbye to one another is just overkill. The last many pages, on returning to the Shire, was the highlight of the entire trilogy for me, but couldn't help overcome my distaste for the rest of the book.I know people love this trilogy and this book specifically. It's constantly mentioned on favorite book lists and must read lists. I even understand how and why people like it (thanks to the movies). Reading the books just did not work for me. At all. I think it may have hurt my brain."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This book is excellent! If you haven't read The Hobbit, you'll understand the first one a little better. Only one problem, but it has nothing to do with the way the book is written. Now, most people who read this book says that Shelob the spider is right from Harry Potter. EXCUSE ME, BUT THIS BOOK HAPPENED TO BE WRITTEN PRACTICALLY 50 YEARS BEFORE THE HARRY POTTER SERIES(around 1955). WHAT I THINK IS HARRY POTTER'S SPIDERS ARE FROM LOTR. TOLKIEN IS MY FAVORITE AUTHOR AND I'M SURE HE'D BE INSULTED THAT SOME PEOPLE ACCUSE HIM OF COPYING A MUNDANE BOOK CALLED HARRY POTTER, WHERE KIDS LEARN MAGIC TRICKS THAT HAVE PEOPLE \\"FLINCH\\" AT A SINGLE, PATHETIC NAME, \\"VOLDEMORT\\", AND ALSO THE LOTR MOVIES ARE BETTER THAN HARRY POTTER, WHERE EVERYTHING IS MADE OF COTTON,AND PLASTIC."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I thought that this book, the last of the Lord of the Rings series, was a slight disappointment. I had been reading the LoTR from the Hobbit onward and I thought the climax was rather anticlimatical. It was too quick, too &quot;easy&quot;. We readers suffered the anquish of transporting the Ring from the Shire all the way to Mount Doom. But I think the Mount Doom episode was too hasty. I was expecting a final showdown - perhaps a greuling battle - that did not occur. The chapter left me very hollow. &quot;What? That's it? The deed is done and there's over a hundred pages left?&quot; No doubt, Tolkien was tiring from writing this massive epic and it seems he cut a few corners at the end. Perhaps some Tolkienophiles take this as blasphemy, but nonetheless, I was very capitivated by the LoTR epic and I feel the book could have received a better climax. Of course, if you've read the first two books in the triology, no doubt you'll want to read the finale. Perhaps my opinion! will change when I inevitably reread the series in the future."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"People have a love affair with Tolkien. People I admire and respect, not just bozos either, people who know good books and good writing and who say Tolkien works are the be-all and end-all of fantasy. Open your eyes.That might have been true when his works were first published. Tolkien deserves all the credit for putting fantasy on the map, for legitimizing the epic quest subgenre. But today, his books fall short when compared to contemporary works in the field.I think the reason for all the love is that people read The Lord of the Rings when they were young, and therefore look back at Tolkien with longing and nostalgia of better days. I read The Fellowship of the Ring when I was twenty-three, and The Two Towers when I was twenty-five, after having received a BA in English and beginning an MFA in Creative Writing. I can't, in good concious, say that any of his works match up with the powerful stories of George R. R. Marting and Terry Goodkind.Let's look at this book specifically. The one thing I liked were the Ents. Aside from that, the structure of the book is all whacked. The first half is spent entirely with Aragorn and his crew. Frodo doesn't even make it on stage until close to the last third of the book. Is this considered good, when your main character is not even present for the majority of the book? The effect of Tolkiens structure is disorienting. Once getting to a certain point in time with one group of characters, he moves to the next group and recounts what happened to them through the same period of time. Why not intersperse their chapters and weave the events together?Once we finally do get to Frodo, the same problem persists as did in Fellowship: Frodo can't really do anything. He takes one significant action, and that's to spare Gollum and bring the little runt with him and Sam. Sam does more than Frodo, saving him from a huge spider-demon. That was a great scene, by the way, but scenes like that are few and far between in this and the previous book.To sum up, after reading Fellowship, I swore off all Tolkien's books, but the movie got me excited again. I thought, well, maybe I was wrong, let's give it another shot. I did, and struggle mightily to finish this book. The only thing that will get me to read the final book is if the second movie rocks. Now, I know many of you will consider this review blasphemy, so go ahead and bash me. But before you do, pick up the book again, and read it with open eyes."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Frodo wasn't the only one asleep!!

I give it 3 out of 4 stars."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"For a criticer or reviewer to post a fair and honest review he or she has to take care not to get caught in the atmopshere of popularity of the title involved, likewise for the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; a novel cherished by Millions of readers. It has found itself into the collective memory of the European Mind and has become a firm part of Western culture.However, this should not misguide away from the fact that popularity does not stand for quality. Tolkiens imagination was unlimited, his passion unequaled, yet he was not a proffessionel Author and therefore his Books often suffer from a lack of Character description, depth, and descriptive climax. This is obvious in the Final Chapter of &quot;The Lord of The Rings Trilogy&quot;.It seems like Tolkien was so impassioned and involved in the Rising Climax that he forgot the basic pillars of creative writing. There is an interesting analogy between Biblical text and Tolkien narrative. For example all through the first half of his Novel Tolkien uses phrases such as &quot;Lo&quot; and &quot;they were amazed&quot; and &quot;he appeared unto them&quot;. These phraes used in the current context do not fit the particular storyline and narrative and slow it down, without adding suspense or depth to the story. Whole Chapters are filled with such writing and the reader often feels that he is attending a Bible session not a Fantasy story.The second Half of the story does not use this type of story telling and is therefore more involved with the reader yet it is lacking action, not depth. The End sequence where Saruman seems to have ensnared Hobbiton seems unnessesary and overstretched. Yet the conclusion of the Novel is mystical and somehow powerfull.Somehow Tolkien did not know how to add up all the pieces and this wasted a lot of imagination put to paper, cutting away most of the suspense and serioulsy harming the Readers involvement."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I did not like this book, it seems as though Tolkien ran out of words, so he started describing things that didn't need describing. The whole boook was good till the middle, it started slowing down, till it became boring. I read the first book in the Lord of the Rings series, and I liked it. But it seems as if Tolkien lost all sense of anything interesting. Don't bother to read this book."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"No, this book warrants more than 1 star, but this is to get the attention of anyone who's getting ready to dive into this voluminous book and wants to know what to really expect (It seems most of the reviews here are written by people so captivated by Middle Earth, they don't talk about this book based on its literary merits.)In a Nutshell:Pros:1. This one reads a lot faster than \\"Fellowship\\", in which it takes half the book to get to the Prancing Pony. Good plot twists and turns.2. Incredible storytelling, character development, and background history to the legends and mythos of middle earth.3. Not as many songs as \\"Fellowship\\"...good thing Peter Jackson exercised artistic license, or the movies would have been musicals.Cons1. Sorry, lightning might strike me, but Tolkien is no Joseph Conrad...the writing is stilted throughout...but with a storyline this great, who cares.2. If you are a hardcore fan of the movies there is some silliness throughout Jackson wisely removed from the movies. (Treebeard lives in a house and sleeps on a bed, and don't forget the gay ranger, yellow jacket wearin' Tom Bombadil from \\"Fellowship.\\")Tolkien said it took him 7 years to write the trilogy, and when he finished, there was nothing more to tell...an absolute masterpiece. Enjoy>"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This book would have been so much more interesting if Sauron had just gotten his ring. Those hobbits and elves were just annoying. My mind kept screaming for them to die, but they never did.Tolkein is the most depressing autor ive ever read. Every character he makes me fall in love with he has killed by every character he makes me hate. Sauron, Sarumon, Durins-Bane (the Bolrog), The Witch King, and not to mention all the Orcs. I remember crying after the Hobbit because Smaug and all the Orcs died in the last battle.One of my biggest complants about this book was how he portrayed the battles. He spent a good twenty pages describing the all mighty power of the Witch king, and then had him die in five seconds at the hand of a woman. That, and his descriptions of the battle was very generalized. He basicaly said, that the good guys won and that the Evil was very strong.It would have been so great if Sauron could have gotten the Ring and taken over middle Earth, the story would have been much more interesting. The hobbits were just annoying.Tolkein's book had so much potential, sure its a classic and will be popular even another 50 years from now. But it will never be as great as it could have been."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I have read all three of the trilogy and a great number of other fantasy works. I have no choice but to say that while Tolkien made a indepth backrgound for his story that was all he did. Tolkien built a world, but he never wrote a story. I have never read a fantasy book less entertaining than these. He bores you with the details. Textbooks have fewer appendixes than his books. The only two redeming bits are the symbolism and world building. However, he missed one main concept, its all as borring as can be. Only a few obsessed people out there learn to speak elvish, for the rest of us he could have spent some time on an action scene and just written gibberish because thats all it is. His symbolism is certainly not deep enough to make the books worth reading either. The first and foremost reasons to write any book thats not a textbook is to entertain or make a point. He makes a simplistic point and keeps you saying, 'This sucks!'."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I would encourage this book for people with high reading ability, to read this book. Two Towers' is a very action packed book with lots of emotion and glory. Before you read this book you should be sure to read the book The Fellowship of The Ring or watch the movie so you can get some background information. I like this book because it shows the friendship of each other and their willingness to stay together. The hardships that they are faced with are very trying and testing of themselves. \\"But if we hold true to each other we will do what needs to be done.\\" This is a quote from the book. The two Towers' is totally a book to read if you are into action and adventure."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Michael Simmons12/09/03Pd.7 ReadingImagine given a magical ring that could destroy the entire world if the forces of evil get it, if you don't destroy it. This is what Frodo Baggins had to do. This story is about a struggle for a ring of power in a place called middle earth. The two sides of the struggle are the free peoples and the forces of the dark lord called Sauron. Characters in the story are Frodo (a Hobbit), Sam (also a Hobbit), Legolas (an Elf), Gimli (a Dwarf), and Borimer, Arogon, Gandalf, Saruman, and Theoden (all Men). The setting takes place in a place called middle earth. In middle earth there are many regions were these different people live. Like the Shire (where the Hobbits live), Rivendel (where the Elves live), Gondor, Rohan, and Isengard (where the Men live), and all in the mountains live the Dwarfs and the Goblins (part of the evil side), and finely where the Orcs (evil) live in Mordor. The plot of the story is that a dark lord called Sauron, a spirit, has his minion's try to take the ring from Frodo. While he is doing that, armies of Sarumans from Isengard attack the people of Rohan. This is where the struggle of Rohan to survive comes in. Now the heroes have to split up.First, My over all opinion of this book is that it was a good adventure book but too many details. This book is a Fantasy book. The only way that this was a page turner book is because of the action.Last This book was Fantasy because none of the book was true. The book is part of a 3-book series, and this is the second one of the series. In conclusion, I recommend this book to people who can remember things."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Fellowship of the Ring has broken up. Although they banded together to protect Frodo and the One Ring to Rule Them All in the first book of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, at the end they were going three different directions. Frodo and Sam snuck off to Mordor so the others could not follow them. Merry and Pippin were taken by the Orcs. The remaining human, elf, and dwarf know they cannot follow Frodo. Instead they attempt to rescue the kidnapped hobbits.They get involved with more Men, warriors, and the Riders of Rohan. They have to abandon their quest and go with the Riders. Mordor is growing stronger. The Orc armies are attacking further into Middle Earth and all are in danger. Merry and Pippin find themselves in strange company. The Orcs want them alive. They want to escape. Pippin is able to use his wits to prepare for that chance. He also is able to leave a message for the others in their group that he and Merry are alive. One battle kills off almost all the Orcs with them. He and Merry escape and meet the Ents. Treebeard is probably the oldest, and oddest, being in Middle Earth. Aragon, Legolas, and Gimli find unexpected help from an old friend. They then band together with the armies of Men to fight the beings from Mordor. The war will not be easy, but must be fought. Frodo and Sam discover it is no easier getting into Mordor than it is getting out. The dark land is well guarded. They gain an unexpected companion and guide, Gollum. Gollum wants the ring. Frodo has it. He promises not to hurt Frodo; he doesn't give up his dream of owning the ring. Sam doesn't trust Gollum. Gollum hates Sam. The trio have an uneasy truce as Gollum leads them through hidden paths into the Dark Lord's lands.This middle book of the trilogy is filled with lengthy battles and wars. The Ents help make this book lighter, but this is the darkest third of the trilogy. It is difficult whether to feel sorry for Gollum or to despise him for what he has become. Everything that happens in this book is needed to bridge the beginning and the end in The Return of the King. Although only my second favorite of the three books so far, the description of Middle Earth, the characters, and the battles are outstanding."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Never in recent memory have I been so enthralled by a fantasy epic. I was aware of The Hobbit, but never read it until recently. Then I absolutely devoured the following trilogy. I won't go into detail here regarding the Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers, BUT THIS STORY IS THE GREATEST, MOST MAGNIFICENT AND THOUGHT PROVOKING work of fiction I have read in a long, long time. Frodo and Sam, making their way across the desert to Mt. Doom, was agonizing. Being able to witness the personal, not to mention physical, maturity of Merry and especially Pippin, was gratifying. I got choked up when Aragorn was coronated, and also when King Theoden died. But most touching to me was the deep love, devotion and affection shared between Frodo and Samwise, a gem of a hobbit if ever there was one. The parting of Frodo and Sam at the Grey Havens absolutely broke my heart - I sobbed so much I couldn't believe it! It takes a truly genuine work of literary art to wring such an emotional response from me. One last aspect of the story, that certainly rings true today, is the devastating effect of evil and cruelty that survives in the world. And that if it endures unchallenged, how very important it is for each of us, no matter our station in life, our size, or belief that one person cannot make a difference to change things for the better, is to stand up for what is right and good. YOU CAN and you MUST.So, if you enjoy the movies, please read the books. They are wonderful beyond compare."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I hadn't read this book since the eighth grade and wanted to re-visit it before seeing the movie. I should say that I am not a Lord of the Rings afficianado, nor do I want to be. The book moves a bit faster than Fellowship and doesn't have quite as many long poems to disrupt its flow. It is interesting to read this book from a geopolitical perspective to see how the themes that Tolkien touches on get played out in todays world, probably one reason for the book's lasting appeal. Once you get used to Tolkien's somewhat annoying style of writing and into the tale, the story really moves along."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers by J.R.R. Tolkien was a great book. The book was full of action, suspense, and a great thriller. Aragorn is my favorite character. He leads the battle at Helm's Deep. Aragorn is very brave and heroic. Frodo is the ring-bearer. He is the one who must toss the ring into the fires of Mordor. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who loves action and suspense."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien's The Two Towers continues the delightful adventures of the now-divided Fellowship. The story moves at a faster clip than the first book with action bouncing through the story of Pippin, Merry, Legolas, Gimli and Aragorn and a terrific sense of suspense crawling and creeping through the story of Frodo and Sam. The emotional resonances among the characters are also much deeper in this volume, particularly in such aspects as the relationship between Sam and Frodo. The two main reasons, though, for this readers' joy are the Ents and Gollum. The ents are the most dazzling creation by the author of Middle Earth and Treebeard should live as one of the most memorable fantasy figures of all time. And as for Gollum, I was pleased to discover how much I liked his prescence. I found him a little trying in The Hobbit but here he works so very well.

Merry and Pippin manage to escape on their own, and they reach Mirkwood. They then befriend Treebeard who is an ent. Treebeard and his fellow Ents thenn storm and invade Isengaurd which is where Saruman was hiding. Meanwhile, in Mordor, Frodo and Sam encounter Gollum, who Frodos uncle Bilbo took the ring from.

There they team up with the ever treacherous Gollum, and attempt to enter the dark land without being seen by the ever watchful eye of Sauron atop the tower of Baradur.This is a great book that makes you want to keep on reading it. It is of course a continuation of the first book The Fellowship of the Ring and it is recommended that you read it first.

The book is much more detailed than I anticipated and sometimes the story goes off on tangents, but I always found them interesting.Mostly, I like this book, and the entire three part story, becuase it is filled with so many mythological symbols and lessons. I am a huge fan of Joseph Campbell and his writings on &quot;The Power of Myth&quot;.

This is because the book is good with all the twists and turns, you don't know what's going to happen next. But the book is so long that the author spends too much time trying to describe places or towns that the book starts to get boring. I couldn't say that I was surprised at most of the events that happened in this book.He should of put a few random twists and turns. So this book is ok.The book starts in a place called Middle-Earth, a dark lord called Sauron created a ring, which had the power to destroy the world. Now Frodo and Sam have that ring and are on a quest to destroy that ring.This book was created by a man named J.R.R. Tolkien. He was born in Bloemfontein, South Africa in 1892.

After that he found his wife and started the Lord of the Ring books."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Return of The King which is the third book in the series The Lord of The Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien is an amazing book. Tolkien tied up all the lose ends that were left from the other two books very eloquently. He doses a great job of not leaving out to much information. Closure is brought to almost everything in a detailed manner so that just enough is left to the imagination. Just when you think the book is getting dull or boring Tolkien throws in a few small plot twists to keep your attention. On the way home from there adventures the group which you come to know very well though out the series says its good byes. These are very touching and heart felt. As the book nears its ending you think everything is calming down and going to be peaceful. There is yet another surprise awaiting the hobbits when they get back to town.

Tolkein, is the middle book in his science-fiction trilogy, The Lord of the Rings. This book takes place at the end of the third age in Middle Earth. Frodo the Hobbit had set out from his home in the Shire located in western Middle Earth. At the start of this book he has just broken up from the rest of his fellowship, which set out from Rivendell, an Elvish town. Frodo and his servant Sam head off to destroy the dark lord, Sauren's, ring. Elsewhere, Two other Hobbits, Maryodock Brandybuck and Paregrin Took, have been captured by Orks. Trying to defend the Hobbits, Boromir, the ere to the thrown of Gondor, was killed. Now trying to rescue the Hobbits are Aragorn, who descends from the line of Isildur (an ancient king of Gondor), Gimli the Dwarf, who comes from the lonely mountain, and Legolas the Elf, who dwelles in Mirkwood. The final member of the fellowship is thought to have been killed, in the mines of Moria. He is Gandalf the Wizard. The first half of this thrilling novel is the quest of Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas to find the two captive Hobbits. As it turns out the Hobbits escaped from their captors when a battle between the Orks and the riders of Rohan occurred. The Hobbits head to the dark forrest, Fangorn. Their they meet the the Ints, a peaceful treelike people. The ints head off to destroy the citidel of Saurumen the wizard, Orthanc, who betrayed Middle Earth. The three warriors find the Riders of Rohan and go with them to battle the Orks who escaped from Orthanc. The last part of the novel tells of the journey of the ring barrer. Frodo and Sam head towards Mordor, the land of Sauren, to destroy the one ring. The two Hobbits meat Gollum, a creature who once possessed the ring. Together they head to Mordor.

I didn't even know that it was the second book in a series of three. I had just picked it at random from a row of library books.When I started to look at it I was disappointed to see that it was the sequel to a book I hadn't read. I persevered for a few pages - and I was hooked!It was the character of Aragorn that drew me in. In other fantasies that I had read human beings were dupes or pupils of supernatural creatures. Yet here was a man to whom an elf and a dwarf deferred. The action was non-stop. I didn't know what had happened but I could empathise with the choices that Aragorn had to make and with his worries that his choices were going awry.At the half way stage when the action turned to Frodo and Samwise I was disappointed. But soon I was engrossed again.When I finished the book I went onto TRoTK to see what happened in the end, and only went back to TFoTR and The Hobbit after that.I still think that's quite a good order. TFoTR contains a lot of stuff that is boring unless you already have an overriding interest in Middle Earth."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Lord of the Rings is the best fantasy story of all time! Tolkien is a master storyteller, and his secondary world of Middle Earth is so true, and so beautifully described. The Lord of the Rings is published in three volumes [Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and Return of the King], but it is really one story told straight through; to appreciate part of it, you must read all three books. The Hobbit is considered a prelude to the trilogy, and is more accessable to younger readers. [It is much lighter in tone, and is of course much shorter, only being 287 pages long.] The Return of the King is wonderful, containing the climax and the end of the Third Age of Middle Earth. While some conclusions are predictable, other twists in the plot are rather unpredictable. If you haven't read these stories, be wary of reviews that reveal the plot. Knowing what happens is empty compared to knowing how it happens, and hearing the story through the words of a master storyteller. The entire work fits together so well, Tolkien's dedication to perfecting the story is evident. For those readers who feel disappointed that the story is ended, and want to read more about Middle Earth, many of Tolkein's writings were published after his death, such as the Silmarillion. One warning though; no hobbits. These stories deal with the First and Second Age, being tales of Valinor, Elven kingdoms [Gondolin, Nargothrond, Doriath] in Middle Earth, and the days of Numenor before its fall. I highly recommend anything Tolkien has written, because his stories have such deep meanings, and his fantasy world is so well developed to make almost any other appear shallow. Because he was writing one story, some readers may find The Fellowship a bit slow in getting started, but The Return of the King more than makes up for it. Stick with it; this is a quest you will never forget, and you may find yourself wishing to visit these enchanted, almost real lands..."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"all in all this was a good book, except for the begging.

The story in THE TWO TOWERS is tremendous, creative and truly profound. And don't make the mistake of thinking that this book or any of the others from Tolkein are children's books.I recognize that everything in the book cannot be translated to film but there are spectacular things in this book that were left out of the movie. Watch the extended version of the movie? Yes, but READ THE BOOK first. Some of my favorite characters and characters essential to the total story were not included. There are also some unnecessary twists taken by Jackson and his crew that are simple and beautiful in the book.THE TWO TOWERS wonderfully takes up where THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RINGS leaves off and continues to follow the progress of The Fellowship as they continue their quest to overcome the powers of Sauron as he tries to regain the great ring and to dominate Middle Earth.But A WORD OF CAUTION: should you read THE TWO TOWERS you won't be able to stop there. The next thing you know you'll be picking up THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING and then wrapping up with THE RETURN OF THE KING. You won't be able to start with this one and stop there. And if you haven't read THE HOBBIT yet you will likely be adding that one to your library as well.The GOOD NEWS is that you will not regret a single moment!I could go on and on.

Fortunately, The Return of the King is as good as or better than its companion books.The book opens (unlike the also excellent Peter Jackson movie) with Pippin and Gandalf riding to Minas Tirith, Aragorn &amp; Co. In Rohan pondering their next move, and Sam trying to rescue Frodo from the orcs of Cirith Ungol - granted, you don't pick up this final thread until over halfway through the main text (a synchronized version of events appears in Appendix B). If your only interest is in seeing the Ring destroyed, skip directly to Chapter 3 of Book VI. If you can stand some \\"irrelevant information and/or dialogue,\\" go ahead and read Book V and see if Gondor can be saved from Sauron's minions.Don't stop reading at the end of the main text, though.

While not required reading, they really add to one's appreciation of Tolkien's masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This book, The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King, is the perfect ending to this wonderful Fantasy Fiction series. This book has amazing descriptive writing by J.R.R. Tolkien about the lands of Middle Earth. He describes the vast landscapes of Rohan where the book starts with Gandalf, Aragorn, Pippin, Merry, Legolas and Gimli in service to the king. From how he describes it, the land is gorgeous and mountainous. Like Gondor, the lands are grassy and vast. It reminds me of the mountains of Switzerland or Australian plains. In the beginning, when he describes all the work they're doing for the king, he talks and rambles on a little, but after you get through that, it's all good from there. .. There are many battle scenes here, where the orcs come from Mordor, and Tolkien has good descriptions of it, so it seems like you're almost there, in a land that doesn't exist.After all the fighting scenes and the battles are over, Tolkien begins to describe Frodo, Sam, and Gollum's quest to destroy the Ring. Of .. .. The ending is stupendous, and it's worth reading the first two just to get to the ending of this book. It's really touching and it may draw a few tears.Tolkien had the writing style of explaining things that may not be very significant at the time, but he does explain things very well enough so you can fully understand what's going on. For characters, he may go on about their heritage a little too long, but he does explain very well what their certain quest is to do and how they can do it. He may put a little too much talking in there, so much that you could become confused as to what is really going on, but you can get the main concept.The readers who would enjoy this book the most would be probably teens because the vocabulary is really expanded, but that can never be bad. It is a harder level, but I wouldn't even bother reading it if you haven't read the first two, because you would probably become really confused. I definitely recommend this book; it is a must-read. It's full of action and adventure. It also has a love story between Aragorn and Arwen, along with a story of wits and determination of two young hobbits.Tolkien is in my opinion the most brilliant writer of his time. The Lord of the Rings are without a doubt the greatest epic novels of all time, with the amazing characters, landscapes, and story plots. This story has no boring parts; it is filled with excitement and drama. The end will make you feel wonderful and just make your day. I hope you enjoy it and love it as much as me, along with millions of others have."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The second part of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, The Two Towers written by J.R.R. Tolkien, starts to summarize the trilogy about a quest to destroy a dark, powerful ring. This book demonstrates the feelings of love, hate, peril and deception.This fiction book is about a hobbit (halfling) named Frodo and his journey to destroy a weapon of mass destruction, a ring created to rule all the peoples of Middle Earth. This book picks up where the first part of the series, The Fellowship of the Ring, left off, at the watchtower of Amon Hen. This story follows Frodo and Sam all the way to the watchtower of Cirith Ungol. It follows him through his troubles through the darkening lands before Mordor. The book also follows his companions, Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas through the Gap of Rohan to their great battle at Helms Deep, and their quest to find two hobbits, Merry and Pippin, who had been captured by Saruman's Uruk-hai.This book is an outstanding work of literature. It can keep you on your toes through the whole thing. J.R.R. Tolkien was not just a scholar but an amazing linguist. He came up with three languages and expanded them into over five. The story shows that no matter what, you shouldn't trust new people, no matter how trustworthy they seem. Also, no matter what, you will almost always find what you are looking for, even though there may be some unexpected twists along the way.I highly recommend this book. It is an extremely righteous piece of literature. It is a great way to follow the characters through their separate journeys, after their separation, through Middle Earth."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two towers by J.R.R. Tolkien was one of the greatest books I have ever read. This book is the sequel to The Fellowship of the Ring by J.R.R. Tolkien and it continues the story of Frodo the ring bearer, and his gardener Sam. I really enjoyed this book because the story line was very well thought out and Tolkien knew exactly how he wanted to put things. I also liked how Tolkien didn't just write a fantasy book that takes place in the places and times that we know. He created his own land and his own time, and this just gave him endless abilities to make the reader get into his book. I also liked how Tolkien described his characters. He didn't just tell us what they were like, but he showed us what they were like through the choices they made. Most authors would have had a tough time trying to show the reader with words what they saw in their minds, but Tolkien using a lot of detail does an excellent job of getting the reader to see what he sees. I also like this book because it really stretches the imagination and makes you think what it would be like if the world was like it was in this book. I have read the entire Lord of the Ring series and this was my favorite by far. I loved how this book sets up the ending in the third book. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes fantasy or is just looking for a good book to read."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Return of the King is just as amazing as the other two books in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. It has no boring parts, and is action packed and filled with excitement. If you've read the first two books in he trilogy, you must read this. The conclusion is amazing, and will leave you feeling warm inside. You will enjoy every second of it, and will miss the series when it's over. This book is another classic in the without a doubt best fantasy series ever written. I hope you enjoy it as much as i did."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers has become one of my favorite literary works. The Fellowship of the Rings left the reader hanging, but this novel builds more anticipation than the first. All I can say is I am glad I already own the Return of the King, so I can begin reading it immediately. I have read other fantasy novels and there is something about Tolkien's work that isn't in other novels. I think it is emotion. I can feel the sadness felt be Gimli when he leaves Lorien. When Aragorn is on the hill in Lorien and it reads, he never came there again as a living man, I am saddened. In the Two Towers, I can feel the emotions of Sam at Cirith Ungol. I guess that is the difference between Tolkien and other fantasy authors. An author can write a great novel, but it may only stimulate anticipation and excitement. Tolkien creates anticipation and excitement while stimulating other emotions.What Happens. It begins at the Rauros. With Sam and Frodo gone, the remaining members of the fellowship seek those taken captive. The pursuers reach Rohan in time of peril and find one they do not expect. They ride with Theoden and Eomer to Helm's Deep to make battle with Sauraman's Orcs. Wormtongue deals a heavy loss to his master. Book four begins with Smeagol joining Sam and Frodo. They journey first to the black gates and then to Cirith Ungol. They meet Faramir along the way, but he does not detour them.Tolkien is the best fantasy author I have read. I encourage you to purchase this book if you liked the movie, because if you read it once, you will probably read it again."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"&quot;The Return of the King&quot; completes &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy that began with &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; and &quot;The Two Towers.&quot; J.R.R. Tolkien took Arthurian legends and Norse mythology and recreated the realm of high fantasy in the 1950s that continues to be popular today.That Tolkien was able to forge a bond with &quot;Fellowship&quot; then split up the characters was a masterful stroke. In &quot;Return&quot; we follow Pippin and Gandalf to Minas Tirith, where Pippin becomes part of the tower guard for Denethor, the Steward of Gondor and father of Boromir and Faramir. Merry, left behind in Rohan, bonds with King Theoden, and later secretly rides to battle with the mysterious Dernhelm. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli take with paths of the dead to recruit an army that must fulfill its destiny to become free of a curse. We also get the sub-stories of Eowyn and Faramir. And Frodo and Sam don't even appear until the second half of the book!What I liked about &quot;Return&quot; is that Tolkien continued to raise the stakes and throw obstacles in the way of his characters. Merry and Eowyn pay a price during their encounter with the ringwraithes. Frodo gets stabbed, stung and bitten. Yet, each character gets to be a hero in a believable way. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli are already larger than life heroes, so the hobbits are really the source of humanity in the story, the observers who rise above their stature and perform great acts of bravery. That Tolkien could show growth in so many characters, and even in Aragorn as he gradually accepts his destiny as the king of his people, was remarkable.The book is filled with excellent detail about the lands and history of the peoples, and I found myself glad that there were handy maps in the back for reference.After the climax, there are another fifty or so pages as the characters make their way homeward and Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin must retake the Shire from the thugs who have assumed control. This would be unheard of in a book today, since the main action has been completed, but Tolkien is going completing the journey by having the characters return as champions. In the &quot;Scouring of the Shire&quot; chapter, we see how much the hobbits have truly grown, as they must wage a campaign without their other friends to help them. Finally, &quot;The Grey Havens&quot; draws our story to a close.The appendices are also worthy of perusal, as they are filled with historical details of the world of legend, when Isildur battled Sauron, etc. as well as what happended to the principle characters after Frodo returned to the Shire. By reading these pieces, one glimpses the amazing scope that a writer can undertake to create a world filled with fascinating stories, rich history, multi-dimensional characters, and sweeping landscapes.This series is highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Lord of the Rings reads like one very long book that the reader finds themselves unable to put down. It goes without saying that you must read &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; and &quot;The Two Towers&quot; before you read this one. This, the third segment, is the climax to what the other two stories built up. This was astonishingly real for a book about wizards, hobbits and elves and I loved it. It is the only book that I have ever found myself crying when it was over. It was a sad sort of ending, (I won't spoil it), but it wasn't because of that. These vivid characters whom I had come to know and love for the months that it took me to go through &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and the other Lord of the Rings books were abandoning me. They would go on with their lives and have glorious new adventures of which I could not be a part of...I miss Sam most of all. The afterward of this book is a gem as well, since you can learn to read and write in Elvish and in runes, and find out histories and afterwards behind the epic. This is a must read for anybody. You are missing out if you do not read this. (And I might add that if you haven't, you are among a shrinking number of people, since the series continues only to grow in popularity.)"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I been reading these books since I was a kid.

Also included is an abandoned review I wrote for \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" all the way back in early 2000 but was never posted on Amazon, explaining how Tolkien's life work of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is NOT a trilogy but rather three parts of one work divided up for publishing purposes]Over the past several decades, THE LORD OF THE RINGS has sold millions of copies and is commonly regarded as one of the most influential fantasy novels ever published. Many first time readers have began their trek into Middle-earth with Frodo and the Company of the Ring in recent years. What they will encounter there has been loved by millions of readers before them, and if they allow themselves to respond to Tolkien and his Myth will doubtless become a loyal and ardent fan of Tolkien and those furry-footed hobbits. What's also notable about THE LORD OF THE RINGS is, for a book as long as it is, many of its readers reread the novel many times over. Yet despite its enduring popularity, Tolkien is often held in complete disregard by the literary establishment.The real question is why? In the literary climate that is characterized by modernism and post-modernism where the twentieth and twenty first century is a wasteland why does a \\"series\\" of fantasy novels become one of the most beloved works in modern times?It's because the power of myth over the human imagination works wonders, creating a longing and a hunger that, Tolkien argues, is met by the Christian religion. Tolkien and C. S. Lewis are the flip-sides of the same coin, with Lewis giving us accounts of the longing and Tolkien providing the books that would create that longing. And what about the longing? It's that longing for Myth, that love for those beauties which Tolkien shows us in THE LORD OF THE RINGS. It's that longing that sets man apart from all other creatures in the universe: a craving for beauty and for joy. The German word for this longing is \\"senhsucht\\". In a time characterized by fast-food, cell-phones, materialism, superficiality, the account of a Hobbit working against all odds in a mythic landscape so captures the human imagination (and this is NOT hype) that an entire genre is created. It is because of how Tolkien so masterfully handles Myth that he has been so highly treasured by such a large fan base.Still, there are a few things to consider when reading Tolkien nowadays. Looking over the reviews, it proved rather shocking to me that people have been complaining that, although it was original when it was published, much of what Tolkien has done has become cliche and that other writers are much better working with these cliches and making them more exciting than Tolkien. They complain about his \\"endless descriptions\\" of the natural world, very detailed accounts of geography and not enough \\"characterization.\\" The characters are unrealistic: the \\"human drama\\" required by the book's very nature is beyond Tolkien's scope as a writer. THE FELLOWSHIP is both uneven and very weak in pacing, with so much invested in the world and its history Tolkien forgets to make us care about the characters themselves. Another fault oft cited against Tolkien is the lack of \\"female characters,\\" and there have been accusations that Tolkien is racist; one of my favorite misconceptions is that Frodo and Sam are homosexuals.Academia has no time for Tolkien, and many of our key critics have denounced Tolkien as ill-written or escapist (Harold Bloom said that THE LORD OF THE RINGS is a period piece which will simply not die but just keeps lingering on long after its relevance. This is the stance taken by a lot of professional critics with a grudge against Tolkien, and wonderfully have been proven wrong). To this day, while not nearly as openly hostile as previous decades, academia in general harbors resentment against Tolkien and everything he's done. As far as they're concerned, he's done something that is actually popular and therefore unworthy of study. It's one of those \\"high-brow vs. low-brow\\" situations, and instead of producing \\"worthwhile\\" academic research, Tolkien instead writes a \\"series\\" of novels which become one of the most established authors of this century. In recent years, academic support has grown tremendously for Tolkien, but he is still a very hotly contested modern writer, unlike some other \\"academically undeniable\\" classics such as James Joyce. Unlike the academic favorites, Tolkien highly polarizes the professional literary establishment. Fortunately he has gained some ground here though.Much of the complaints voiced against THE LORD OF THE RINGS are both unimportant and irrelevant. Tolkien is working with literary traditions not in-tune with the modern mind, but is instead handling narrative threads of Myth. Tolkien gives us solid archetypes to work with, bringing out the very qualities of masculinity and the beauties and stark wonders of femininty, but all expressed in mythological terminology. The idea of Sam and Frodo as homosexual is both ridiculous and totally unfounded. In Myth, good is characterized and seen as \\"White,\\" and the evil is dark and perverted. Those who say Tolkien is racist approach him from the wrong standpoint.As for the modern fantasy reader, those who complain about Tolkien's originality (while acknowledging it, but that later writers do a much better job with it) is like saying Shakespeare, while a good dramatist, is not that good because other people take his principals and make them more exciting, etc. I heard a story once about a person who went to see a Shakespeare play and went away complaining there were too many quotes in the play to make it any good. Shakespeare is the source of these quotes and he did not even realise it.Most people know that Tolkien founded modern fantasy. Tolkien laid down the template for the fantasy genre in general, and anyone who reads fantasy has been touched, directly or indirectly, by Tolkien's work. Almost all of the major fantasy authors have acknowledge their debt to Tolkien, and the shadow Tolkien casts over fantasy literature is very long indeed. Because there is fifty years separating us from the original publication, it is much harder to approach THE LORD OF THE RINGS as those first reviewers, for those who have grown up reading fantasy literature are now accustomed to Dwarves and Elves and Dark Lords and Epic Quests, but when it was issued THE LORD OF THE RINGS transformed and invented an entire new genre. It is not Tolkien's fault that his vision of a mythology was so successful that everyone else decided they would try their hand at fantasy and work within Tolkien's templates. The main problem with fantasy authors in general are they are more interested in emulation than they are in true \\"myth-making.\\" Much like early rock and roll, which, because rock was not an established form of music, the early musicians relied on other forms to create a new genre, Tolkien did not have this tradition to fall back on so instead he used various literatures and epic poems to create his own vision of myth. A lot of fantasy writers do not work in the context of myth any more, but rather rely on genre stereotypes which are generally found in Tolkien. Many readers who are interested in \\"pulp\\" fantasy get bogged down in Tolkien because he takes the time to fully explain his world and its cultures, because his goal is different. There is plenty of action in LORD OF THE RINGS, but those raised on the pulp fantasy will not care for it.Ultimately, THE LORD OF THE RINGS's criticism has shown itself to be of little important on its durability as a major text. Ever since its publication in 1954, 1955, and 1956, LOTR has become one of the most important literary works our era has produced, highly regarded and passionately loved by an enormous amount of people. Despite the very vocal minority who despise Tolkien and his work, THE LORD OF THE RINGS has consistently topped the polls for the best book of the last one hundred years. Whatever the critics say, THE LORD OF THE RINGS is here to stay because popular imagination has grabbed hold of Tolkien's vision and ran with it. Tolkien and Lewis have been wonderfully vindicated in their belief that there is an enormous adult appetite for Myth and fantasy literature.For many, it's more than a mere novel. It's a glimpse of the divine.It is like water in a dry place...-----THE LORD OF THE RINGS is NOT a trilogyI have been looking over the reviews THE LORD OF THE RINGS. There is one consistent problem that keeps jumping to my attention: the reviewers keep talking as if each volume in \\"the trilogy\\" is a self-contained novel. They are not actual novels. THE LORD OF THE RINGS is not a trilogy - it's a single novel divided into three parts for publication purposes. That's why they're published Part I, Part II, and Part III instead of Book I, etc.When Tolkien wrote it and had it published by Allen & Unwin, Sir Stanley Unwin had doubts about its size and the market (remember, this was back in the 50s, and THE HOBBIT had been a book for children - now they have this book that has all the hall marks of a publishing nightmare). Instead of publishing it as a whole, they decided to divide the novel* into three parts. Because there were six subdivisions therein (although I might be mistaken, and these Books I-VI might also be publication impositions), they chose to publish THE LORD OF THE RINGS in three books. One purpose for this was to hide the sheer size of the book. The second reason for doing so was to get three reviews instead of one. Tolkien himself, however, always made it a point to tell people that it is not a trilogy but a single, unified work.Although THE LORD OF THE RINGS basically invented the fantasy genre, from a publisher's standpoint, it was a dangerous gamble. It had to be sold at a high cost (21 shillings) to the reader, but Rayner Unwin (Sir Stanley's son) thought it a \`work of genius', so they published it. Instead of usual royalty payments, Tolkien got half of all profits, which meant that if the book flopped (most probable) he wouldn't get anything, because the book had to pay for itself before either the author OR the publisher got profits. Obviously Tolkien came out far ahead on that deal than had he gone with a more traditional publishing arrangement with Stanley Unwin."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The second volume of Tolkien's epic trilogy never even wavers. If anything, it seems steadier and more controlled than \\"Fellowship of the Ring,\\" as several characters become more central and the plot focus widens to envelop all of Middle Earth. It suffers from a bit of sequelitis in places, but the overall book is just as enthralling as the first.Aragorn finds that Merry and Pippin have been abducted rather than killed -- for what reason, no one knows. Frodo and Sam have left on their own. So Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli race to find the orcs and retrieve the hobbits, but are stopped by the fierce Riders of Rohan, and then by an old and dear friend: Gandalf, who has been resurrected in the new form of a White wizard. Elsewhere, Merry and Pippin must use all of their wits to escape the orcs, and then find a strange band of allies that no one could have hoped for.Meanwhile, Frodo and Sam head into Mordor -- with an eerily familiar figure, Gollum, following them. Frodo subjugates Gollum, forcing him to swear on \\"the precious\\" that he won't harm him. In return, Gollum promises to guide the two hobbits through Mordor, straight to Mount Doom. But the Ring is weighing more heavily than ever on Frodo, and is starting to reassert its old sway on Gollum...One of the most noticeable changes in this book is the shift of focus. \\"Fellowship\\" was Frodo-centric, since the narration revolved around him, as did all the events and thoughts. But with the breaking of the Fellowship, the narration falls into three categories: Frodo and Sam; Merry and Pippin; Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli. This triple style allows individuals to shine more brightly, when they are called on to do more than hike with Frodo.Tolkien also presented a wider view of Middle-Earth in general. While the slow slog through Mordor doesn't really tell or show readers much -- aside from what a hellhole Sauron is the middle of -- it's shocking to see the the effects of the orcs, Saruman and Sauron on places such as Gondor and Rohan.Changes can be seen in Frodo even in this book, and which become more pronounced in the third book of the trilogy, \\"Return of the King.\\" He becomes sadder and more introspective, and the Ring's growing hold on him can be glimpsed at times. Aragorn is also changing. He is no longer merely the rugged outcast Ranger, but displays the hints of a future great king, if he can only get to his throne.Merry and Pippin also change: these two innocent young hobbits have to suddenly Sam is more promiment in this book, as Frodo's friend and personal pillar of strength.But where Tolkien really outdid himself is Gollum. Gollum returns, in a substantially different state. Oh, he's still addled and addicted to the Ring, but he displays a dual love/loathing for the Ring, a weird affection for Frodo (who, from his point of view, is probably the only person who has been kind to him), and displays a Ring-induced multiple-personality syndrome. Very rarely can bad guys elicit the sort of loathing and pity from the reader that Gollum does.One noticeable aspect of this book is friendship. When the Fellowship sets out from Rivendell, virtually everyone is a stranger, with the exception of the hobbits. However, in this book we get our view of how much Sam loves Frodo and wants to help him. Sam is fully aware of how much Frodo needs emotional support, and he's quite willing to be a pillar of strength for his friend. We see Gimli and Legolas's affection for Merry and Pippin; and Legolas's willingness to kill Eomer if Eomer hurts Gimli shows how far this Elf and Dwarf have come.This book is substantially darker than \\"Fellowship.\\" Frodo is starting to stumble under the weight of the Ring, and other characters die or are seriously hurt. The scene where Pippin's mind is trapped by Sauron is a very disturbing one, as is a violent and saddening scene late in the book. But there is also some wry humor: Gandalf's joke as he hears Saruman throttling Grima Wormtongue, Legolas's snippy comments about pipeweed as Gimli and the hobbits smoke up a storm, and Sam's debate with Gollum about whether they should cook the rabbits.Tolkien's second Lord of the Rings novel is a thrilling fantasy adventure, exploring more of his invented world than \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\" did. A truly enthralling experience."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"It is not really appropriate to rate this book as a standalone volume, as it is really just a third of a greater story. Nonetheless, this rates a full five stars as the loose ends from the first two parts are tied up.The way things are resolved are both brilliant and follow from what is hinted at before. From the final fate of the Ring to the problems in the Shire, it all fits. In addition, the appendices add a richness to the world of Middle-Earth, giving it a depth in history and language that is incredible.Books have been written about this trilogy, and hundreds of books have tried to imitate it, so it is obviously not a small task to praise it appropriately in this small area. It is sufficient to give it five stars and let it speak for itself."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers follows the lives of the Fellowship, shortly after they broke up. Samwise and Frodo trek on to destroy the ring at Mt. Doom, and the rest, including Aragorn, Legolas and our beloved dwarf friend Gimli search for Merry and Pippin, who had been kidnapped by Orcs. Fierce battles, amazing dialogue and very memorable characters made &quot;The Two Towers&quot; a great read. I won't spoil the ending, but, I'll tell you this: After I completed &quot;The Two Towers&quot;, I immediately went out and purchased &quot;Return of the King&quot; to see how it would end.For any fan of fantasy or fan of great writing, this is the book for you.

THE RETURN OF THE KING is the third and final part of THE LORD OF THE RINGS. This final climatic chapter in Tolkien's masterpiece brings not only the War of the Ring to a close, but it tells of the final days of Middle Earth as well and the beginning of the Fourth Age, the Age of Man.Sam is left to rescue Frodo from the Dark Tower while Merry, Pippin, and Gandalf wage war in defense of Gondor. Meanwhile Aragorn has gone with a small host, including Gimli and Legolas, to fufill a prophecy and pay an old debt. The days were never darker and Sauron's power grows even admist the victories of light. Still all have a role to play (even Gollum) and things aren't always what they seem.THE RETURN OF THE KING ends bittersweetly as one parts with the companions they have traveled with so long. Yet, life goes on and so must we all. Though this journey ends, there is another waiting to begin just around the corner."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The second book of The Lord of The Rings, The Two Towers is superior, in my opinion, to The Fellowship of The Ring - a fine book in its own right. This picks up right where that book left off (on a semi-cliffhanger.) The book is broken up into two parts (arguably not the best way to tell the story): the first part concerns the exploits of Aragorn, Legolas and the rest of the Party (sans Frodo and Sam.) This is a fast-moving and exciting part of the book that sets up some important events that come to fruition in The Return of The King. There are several important plot point (and surprises) in this section that would alter the course of the series. The second part concerns Frodo and Sam, and their journey to Mordor with Gollum (!) as their guide. This is a very exciting and dramatic section of the book, and it moves very fast and is a joy to read. I think it's overall better than The Fellowship of The Ring, as it is a great joy to read and very fast-paced - much tighter than The Fellowship, which could move slowly at times. But, of course, the entire series is a masterpiece, and should be read. This book ends on an extreme cliffhanger, so you will want to pick up The Return of The King right after finishing this. The Lord of The Rings is one of the true masterpieces of recent literature, and deserves to be read by everybody. No matter what kind of books you like to read, it is a masterpiece that everyone should be able to say that they've read. And this is perhaps the best overall installment in the series, though they are all essential. Read this masterpiece; it will enrich your life."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I like this book for many reasons; adventure, excitement, and a well developed plot all work together to form an excellent book.Some of the parts that I liked were in the beginning, on the trip towards Isengaurd. I also liked the journey with Gollum torads the Black Gate, although it didn't end once they reached it. This book is perfect for readers ages twelve and up. I would also reccomend the other books by J.R.R. Tolkien. They all are full of everything that anyone could want."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Sometimes the middle of a long story is accused of being boring or, at least, inferior to the story's beginning and end. This is not the case with \\"The Two Towers,\\" which lives up to its status as the second of the three volumes of J.R.R. Tolkien's \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" by being the true heart of the entire work.After the death of a major character (an event depicted at the end of Peter Jackson's film adaptation of \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\"), Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli search for Merry and Pippin, who have been captured by Orcs. The Three Hunters, as they call themselves, encounter a major plot surprise, meet several new characters and take part in an enormous battle before finding their friends, who have escaped their captors and encountered Treebeard, a kindly Ent, or \\"tree-herd,\\" who looks something like a walking, talking tree. Meanwhile, Frodo and Sam are joined on their journey to Mordor by the sinister, conflicted Gollum, a background presence in \\"Fellowship\\" who now steps into the spotlight.The scenes in the first half of the book with the Elf Legolas and the Dwarf Gimli develop their characters and their unlikely friendship to an extent not found in \\"Fellowship.\\" Tall and short, pointy-eared and gruffly emotional, Legolas and Gimli are both the C3PO and R2D2 and the Spock and McCoy of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\"; their contest to see who can kill the most Orcs during the Battle of Helm's Deep is gruesome yet delightful. The star of the second half of the book, however, is Gollum, and his interactions with Frodo and Sam serve to define their characters more strongly than before. Imagine that you and your best friend are on a long, dangerous journey with a disgusting, dangerous creature who desperately wants something your friend has and would kill to get it. All your life you have heard the story of how your friend's uncle got this object from the creature and barely escaped from him alive. You never expected to meet or even see the creature yourself, but here he is in the wilderness with you, having sworn to serve your friend. Now you wish the two of you could get rid of the creature -- but you need his help to reach your destination and thus save the entire world. That's the situation Sam Gamgee finds himself in, and the resulting interplay between Sam, Frodo and Gollum makes for great drama. In the book version of \\"Fellowship\\" Gandalf tells Frodo that Gollum both hates and loves himself; readers of \\"The Two Towers\\" will come both to love and hate Gollum. It's no wonder that when the Beatles were planning to make a \\"Lord of the Rings\\" movie starring themselves, John Lennon apparently desired the role of Gollum, considering it the starring role of the whole story.If you've enjoyed the book or the movie of \\"Fellowship,\\" you should enjoy reading \\"The Two Towers\\" and finding out what happens next. Even if it were not the central third of one of the great novels of the twentieth century, \\"The Two Towers\\" would be one of the world's greatest fantasies in its own right. However, be sure to have a copy of \\"The Return of the King\\" handy when you finish \\"The Two Towers,\\" which, unlike \\"Fellowship,\\" ends with a fairly spectacular cliffhanger..."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"J.R.R.

While they are searching for their hobbit companions(kidnapped by orcs) Pippen and Merry, hobbits Frodo and Sam are led by Gollum to Mordor and Sauron's dwelling in an attempt to destroy the ring...The Two Towers is a book that would be properly enjoyed by older, more mature children. Tolkien uses an endless supply of powerful adjectives and description. The story is written with complex sentences and is full of emotion. Aaragorn, Gimli, and Legolas alley with the Riders of Rohan, Riders of the Mark, Gandalf the wizard, and the ents of Fanghorn to fight against Saurumon and his horde of orcs and wild men at Isenguard. The companions share both happy and terrible times with each other. Sometimes in songs and poetry or anger and harsh words.The Two Towers is written in third person point of view. There are two books or sections in The Two Towers. It is like the book is divided up into two parts. Then those parts are divided up into several chapters. The first book is about our companions fighting Saurumon then going there own seperate ways. The sceond half describes more about Frodo, Sam, and Gollum on their way to Mordor.The Two Towers is an extremely well written fantasy. There are orcs, beast, wizards, elfs, dwarfs, and everything else imaginable blended in with race of men. The Two Towers is the second book published in 1956 in the trilogy The Lord of the Rings.This brilliant written fantasy novel, The Two Towers is for the young adult or mature child reader. \\"There are very few works of genius in recent literature. This is one,\\" quoted Michael Straight."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I think The Two Towers is a lot better than the Fellowship of the Ring because it has more action. It is also better than the Return of the King because it has an action packed beginning that blew me away.Some of my favorite characters are Treebeard, and Gandalf because he is magical. I also like Saruman even though he is evil.I think it is cool how J. R. R. Tolkien made up his own language. I wonder how the publishers wrote the elvish writing on the ring.I saw the Fellowship of the Rings movie the day it came out and I was amazed at the graphics. This was an awesome book and a mysterious series. I think this book would be great for all ages; young or old."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This is a great book for a set. They are hard to find in stores, so finding this made for a great way to complete the set."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This book, and series is AMAZING! The quality of the paperback is very good as well. This is my favorite series of all time.BUY IT, READ IT! NAO!!!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This is the third volume in J. R. R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy. It followsThe Fellowship of the RingandThe Two Towers. Be sure to read both of them first.In the final volume the two main story lines reach their common end. The hobbits Frodo and Sam have been slowly working their way toward the volcano deep in Mordor where the ring can be destroyed. The other main characters and their allies converge by diverse paths on the city Gondor, where they will stand without hope against Sauron's invading armies. No matter what the outcome, there will be some who will not see each other again.This book is necessary if you have read the first two volumes. In fact, it would take tremendous will power not to read it to see how the story ends. A warning if this is your first time through the trilogy. After finishing this book many readers experience a lingering melancholy, a sense of loss for a time. This seems to be only partially due to the story's events. Having traveled, suffered, and grown with the characters, you may miss them. There isn't any easy way to dispel this feeling. In time it will fade."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I really liked this book, even though there were parts of the story that slowed down too much. I liked how this book jumped straight into action where the first book left off. If you haven't read the first book I advise that you do read it before reading this one, or at least read the summary that is found in this book. I enjoyed the first half of the book where you are with Aragorn and his half of the company, but the second half with Frodo and Sam wasn't as exciting. The story kind of lagged and became a little boring. I had already seen the movies and that helped me to stay interested through the slower story line. However, I kept pushing through to the end and I was not disappointed. The ending leaves you wanting more.J. R. R. Tolkien did a great job of creating and illustrating Middle Earth. I feel like I'm living the legend with the main characters. Tolkien did a great job of illustrating the characters. All of their personalities made me feel like I was with them. Here is one of my favorite examples of imagery: \\"Disturbed as if out of a gloating dream by his small yell she turned slowly the dreadful malice of her glance upon him. But almost before she was aware that a fury was upon her greater than any she had known in countless years, the shining sword bit upon her foot and shore away her claw.\\" This is in the part where Sam fights Shelob, but I won't spoil anymore of the book."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"\\"Return of the King\\" is the worthy climax to J.R.R. Tolkien's epic saga, the fantasy that created the genre as we know it today. Now, as the blockbuster movie adaptation is over, many readers are checking out the dramatic story that ends Tolkien's masterpiece and life's work.Gandalf has ridden to the city of Gondor with Pippin (partly to keep him out of trouble), where the forces of Mordor are attacking. There is upheaval in the city itself, as the steward of Gondor is going nuts. Merry pledges his service to King Theoden of Rohan, not knowing what is ahead for the king and his relatives. And Aragorn is seeking out allies to fight Sauron on a military scale, even if they can't defeat him unless the Ring is destroyed. His search will take him to tribes of forest-dwellers, to Gondor -- and even to summon an army of the dead.In Mordor, the unconscious Frodo has been captured by Sauron's orcs, and taken to the fortress of Cirith Ungol. Sam is desperate to free his friend, but knows that he can't take on an army, and that Frodo would want him to finish the quest. Sam manages to free Frodo from captivity, but they must still brave more dangers before they can come to Mount Doom, the only place where the Ring can be destroyed. As they travel Sam sees Frodo slipping further and further into the Ring's grasp. Will Frodo be able to destroy the Ring?Usually, the climax of an epic adventure is a disappointment. \\"Return of the King\\" succeeds in almost every way, wrapping up each individual storyline, one by one. The ending has a feeling of finality; this is one story that could never have a sequel; Tolkien shows that in a war like this, there is no true \\"happy ending.\\" Even if the good guys win, there will still be scarring, and death, and haunting memories of what once happened. And even if a person survives, he will never be the same.This is the grimmest of the three books in this trilogy. Frodo and Sam are stuck in the vividly horrific Mordor, while the city of Minas Tirith is on the verge of completely crumbling. Tolkien does a phenomenal job of exploring the madness, despair, rage and sorrow that accompany a war, and the way it can affect even the idyllic Shire. And he doesn't forget the slow period of healing that follows -- for people, for civilizations, and even for nature.Though a section of the book near the end descends into near-biblical prose, which changes post-Gondor, Tolkien does not waver in his ability to evoke emotion. One of the most touching scenes in the book is when Sam finds Frodo naked, unconscious and being beaten by an orc. Others include Merry's farewell to Theoden, Eowyn's slaying of the Witch-King, and of course the bittersweet final scene.Speaking of Frodo, this trilogy's hero is almost unrecognizable in parts of this book. The bright, naive young hobbit of the first book has been worn down to a pale shadow of himself. As he grows increasingly attached to the Ring, we even see him doing what seems unimaginable: threatening Sam with a dagger. Sam has come a long way from the shy young hobbit who couldn't say a word around the High Elves -- now he's attacking orcs and carrying Frodo to Mount Doom.And the supporting characters are not neglected either, with the younger hobbits being exposed to the horrors of war, Aragorn breaking fully into his role as the future king of Gondor, and passionate war-maiden Eowyn affecting the war as nobody else could. Some much-loved characters are lost, and others will be permanently changed.The story doesn't really end on the last page; for more background, especially on Aragorn and Arwen, readers should also read the appendices at the end of the book. Another good addition is \\"The End of the Third Age,\\" in which the unpublished epilogue of this book can be found. Though this is probably not canonical, it nicely concludes the story and is a heartwarming look at what happens in the years following \\"Return of the King.\\"It's difficult, once the story has finished, to accept that one has to say goodbye to Middle-Earth and its enchanting inhabitants.

If anything, it seems steadier and more controlled than \\"Fellowship of the Ring,\\" as several characters become more central and the plot focus widens to envelop all of Middle Earth.

Frodo and Sam have left on their own. So Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli race to find the orcs and retrieve the hobbits, but are stopped by the fierce Riders of Rohan, and then by an old and dear friend: Gandalf, who has been resurrected in the new form of a White wizard. Elsewhere, Merry and Pippin must use all of their wits to escape the orcs, and then find a strange band of allies that no one could have hoped for.Meanwhile, Frodo and Sam head into Mordor -- with an eerily familiar figure, Gollum, following them. Frodo subjugates Gollum, forcing him to swear on \\"the precious\\" that he won't harm him. In return, Gollum promises to guide the two hobbits through Mordor, straight to Mount Doom. But the Ring is weighing more heavily than ever on Frodo, and is starting to reassert its old sway on Gollum...One of the most noticeable changes in this book is the shift of focus. \\"Fellowship\\" was Frodo-centric, since the narration revolved around him, as did all the events and thoughts. But with the breaking of the Fellowship, the narration falls into three categories: Frodo and Sam; Merry and Pippin; Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli. This triple style allows individuals to shine more brightly, when they are called on to do more than hike with Frodo.Tolkien also presented a wider view of Middle-Earth in general. While the slow slog through Mordor doesn't really tell or show readers much -- aside from what a hellhole Sauron is the middle of -- it's shocking to see the the effects of the orcs, Saruman and Sauron on places such as Gondor and Rohan.Changes can be seen in Frodo even in this book, and which become more pronounced in the third book of the trilogy, \\"Return of the King.\\" He becomes sadder and more introspective, and the Ring's growing hold on him can be glimpsed at times.

Gollum returns, in a substantially different state. Oh, he's still addled and addicted to the Ring, but he displays a dual love/loathing for the Ring, a weird affection for Frodo (who, from his point of view, is probably the only person who has been kind to him), and displays a Ring-induced multiple-personality syndrome. Very rarely can bad guys elicit the sort of loathing and pity from the reader that Gollum does.One noticeable aspect of this book is friendship. When the Fellowship sets out from Rivendell, virtually everyone is a stranger, with the exception of the hobbits. However, in this book we get our view of how much Sam loves Frodo and wants to help him. Sam is fully aware of how much Frodo needs emotional support, and he's quite willing to be a pillar of strength for his friend. We see Gimli and Legolas's affection for Merry and Pippin; and Legolas's willingness to kill Eomer if Eomer hurts Gimli shows how far this Elf and Dwarf have come.This book is substantially darker than \\"Fellowship.\\" Frodo is starting to stumble under the weight of the Ring, and other characters die or are seriously hurt. The scene where Pippin's mind is trapped by Sauron is a very disturbing one, as is a violent and saddening scene late in the book.

But the thing I always hated most about this story, and which is even worse in the book than in the movie versions, is how Frodo makes it all the way to the Crack of Doom only to fail in his resolve to destroy the ring, which is only accomplished by Gollum biting off his finger and then accidentally falling in with it. In the crucial moment, the story is ultimately about original sin and redemption by some ineffable \\"higher\\" power. This seriously undercuts the story's drama and heroism.Rob Inglis's narration is quite good---I enjoyed listening to his characterizations and performances of the songs and so forth. Three and a half stars."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"With the Fellowship broken Sam and Frodo set off to fulfill their destiny alone, following the path into the fires of Mordor while Aragon, Legolas and Gimli set out in pursuit of their captured hobbit comrades, Merry and Pippin. The novel is split into two parts consisting of the friends' separate adventures as the tale of Middle Earth continues to unfold. The world teeters toward the brink of dark destruction with its fate resting squarely on Frodo's shoulders.Tolkien's second installment in the beloved Lord of the Rings trilogy captivates the reader with the same magical gravity and mystical allure as the Fellowship of the Ring and its predecessor, The Hobbit. However, this book did not seem to posses the same depth of substance. As a bridge between the beginning and end of the series it had more of a transient feel; a piece rather than a whole.As always Tolkien writes lyrical flowing prose which captures the very spirit and dark majesty of Middle Earth. He paints vivid pictures of fanciful landscapes, gruesome battles and creatures both terrifying and beautiful. Though the story does tend to drag at several points it never truly grows boring; Tolkien's masterful storytelling and flowery descriptive language is enough to compensate for lags in action. In the end Tolkien leaves another nail biting cliffhanger that will have you clambering for the next part of this epic adventure!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"My favorite book series of all time is the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. As a side note, it is also my favorite movies series. My favorite book of the trilogy is probably the third one, \\"The Return of the King\\". It ended the series on an excellent note. I personally identified with many of the characters, particularly Sam, Aragorn, and Eowyn.Here is a summary of the book. The first half of the book chronicles the attack on Minas Tirith, the capital city of the country Gondor. The book opens with the wizard Gandalf and the hobbit Pippin arriving at Minas Tirith. The city is preparing for war, and they have lit their signal beacons to call for help. They go into the city and meet Denethor, the Steward of Gondor. Denethor is nowhere near the moron that the movie version makes him out to be. However, he is starting to go crazy as he uses dark magic to discover just how powerful Sauron is. He is mourning the death of his oldest son, Boromir. Boromir died in the previous book, in an attempt to protect Pippin and his friend Merry from the Orcs, or Goblins. Pippin tells Denethor this, and offers himself into Denethor's service. Pippin becomes part of the tower guard. Sauron's Orcs invade Gondor. In the battle, Faramir, Denethor's youngest son, is seriously wounded. Denethor, thinking Faramir is beyond saving, gets ready to burn himself and Faramir together. Meanwhile, in Rohan, king Theoden is rallying his armies to come and help Gondor. Aragorn, a Ranger, decides to go to enlist the aid of a group of undead traitors who live in the Paths of the Dead. He is accompanied by Legolas, Gimli, and a group of Rangers. Back at Gondor, Sauron's armies have surrounded Minas Tirith. They are led by the Witch-King, the king of the Nazgul. However, Sauron's army is defeated by Theoden and the Rohirrim, who arrive just in time. The Nazgul king is killed by Eowyn, with the help of the hobbit Merry. The attacking fleet of Corsair ships arrives, but is revealed to have been taken over by Aragorn, the rangers, and the army of the undead. Sauron's army is crushed. Denethor burns himself to death, but Faramir is saved by Gandalf, Pippin, and the guard Beregond. Gandalf and Aragorn decide to march on Mordor, Sauron's country. They want to create a diversion to allow Sam and Frodo a chance to get through Mordor unseen. Frodo has Sauron's ring. If the ring is destroyed, then Sauron will likewise be destroyed. A battle ensues in front of the gates of Mordor.The second half of the book chronicles the journey of Frodo and Sam. And the end of the previous book, Frodo was captured by a group of Orcs, and imprisoned in a tower. Sam enters the tower in and recues him. The two of them then continue their journey through Mordor. The ring, possessing it's own conciousness, weighs heavy on Frodo in an attempt to wear him down. After several adventures and narrow escapes, Frodo and Sam reach Mount Doom, where they hope to destroy the ring. Frodo has the chance to destroy the Ring, but at the last minute is corrupted by it's power. Just then, Gollum appears. Gollum is a creature who possessed the ring for five hundred years. It drove him insane, and now he wants to have it back. He attacks Frodo, and bites off Frodo's finger in his determination. Gollum jumps up and down in his joy at possessing the ring once again, and accidentally loses his balance and falls into the fire. He is destroyed, along with the ring. He has unintentionally done Frodo's job for him. Sauron is destroyed, and his armies run away. Frodo and Sam are reunnited with Aragorn and the rest of the characters, and the four hobbits are proclaimed heroes. Aragorn is then crowned king of Gondor, and marries the elf Arwen. After many long farewells, the hobbits journey back to the shire. To their surprise, they find it has been taken over by a group of men, working for someone named Snarkey. Using what they have learned in their travels, the hobbits lead a revolt and drive the men out of the Shire. Snarkey is then revealed to be Saruman, a wizard who had allied himself with Sauron. He had lost his powers in the previous book. He is murdered by his servant, Grima Wormtongue. Over time, the Shire is healed. However, Frodo cannot heal from his wounds. He was stabbed by the Witch-King is the first book, poisoned by the spider Shelob in the Second book, and had his finger bitten off by Gollum in the third book. He decides to go to the undying lands with the remnant of the elves.My love of this book has to do with my love of many of the characters. My three favorite characters are Sam, Aragorn, and Eowyn. First of all, Sam. Sam is simple, unintelligent, and loyal. He is much like other hobbits, in that he has never ventured far from the Shire. He decides to become Frodo's servant on the long journey to Mordor. Sam is in my opinion the most important character of the story. His simple love for Frodo is what gives Frodo the strength to carry out his task. Throughout the whole trilogy, but particularly in the third volume, Sam's simple courage is what keeps Frodo going. Towards the end, Frodo is completely worn out from carrying the ring. Sam decides to carry Frodo the last leg of the journey, up until they are just in sight of the doorway to the mountain. Sam's loyalty is what end's up saving Middle earth in the long run.Another good character is Aragorn. He is the heir to the throne of Gondor. For many centuries, the country has been ruled, not by a king, but by a steward. The stewards serve as substitutes for the king, ruling in his absence. By this time, however, many people consider the rule of kings over, chief among them the current steward, Denethor. Aragorn is the last survivng member of his line, and he is the only one who can claim the throne and unite the kingdom. He has no wish to do this. He prefers to live as a ranger, hunting the Nazgul and living in solitude. In the end, though, he accepts his responsibility and puts his personal desires aside. He is descended from a family blessed with long life. He and Arwen rule Gondor for one hundred years, before he finally dies.My last important character is Eowyn. She is the neice of king Theoden, and she wishes to go into battle and earn valor. She falls in love with Aragorn after he helps the wizard Gandalf to heal her uncle. When she asks Aragorn to allow her to go into battle with him, he refuses, saying that she needs to care for her people and rule in place of her uncle. He also tells her that he does not return her love. Crushed, Eowyn says that her greatest fear is \\"a cage\\", and that she fears that she will be forced to \\"stay behind bars until use and old age accept them, and all chance of great deeds is gone beyond recall or desire\\". She fears that she will die of old age before she has the chance to gain valor. She ends up disguising herself as a soldier and rides with the army to the Battle outside Gondor. There, she is able to defeat the King of the Nazgul. Now, the Nazgul king is a very fearful presence. He has the power to cause the bravest, most courageous man to run from him in terror. When the Nazgul is about to kill Theoden, it is her love for her uncle, not her bravery, that allows her to stand and fight against the Nazgul.In conclusion, The Return of the King is my favorite book of all time largely due to my love and admiration for the characters. I admire Sam's strong spirit, which enables Frodo to complete the task set before him. I admire Aragorn's selflessness in taking up the crown when it is the last thing is the world he wishes to do. And I admire Eowyn's love which enables her to kill the Nazgul king and most likely win the battle of the Pelennor Fields."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Return of the King by J. R. R.

BRILLIANT. It took me a little adjusting to get into, though, because the pacing is so much slower in \\"The Hobbit\\"--so much more drawn-out, so much more detail--but once I got into it I was hooked, and read all three books straight through. Tolkien creates a magical alternate reality--yet one that applies metaphorically to our modern world. He addresses themes such as good versus evil, the destruction of our planet, personal choice on our life's path, sacrificing comfort for growth, treating life as a journey, the dangers of selfish leaders, the temptations of addiction (The Ring of Power!).I sometimes, felt, though, that he was metaphorically speaking about modern human races--black, white, Asian, etc.--when he spoke of the different \\"races\\" of Middle Earth, and that made me uncomfortable, because I didn't feel the message was that enlightened... But he may not have meant it at all. I don't know if others sensed this.But overall, this series, and particularly \\"The Return of the King,\\" like \\"The Hobbit,\\" is a grand reminder that the little guy can rise above and change the world. And don't we need to hear this message now more than ever?"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Nicely done! The book was in very good shape, matched the one I lost, and was shipped and received promptly. Just what I hoped I'd get. Hardly any wear, which is rare in an old paperback; but just as advertised. Good job!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I can't imagine someone getting the first two audiobooks and NOT wanting this last book, too. The reader is up to his usual high quality. It ships with 16 CDs -- but only 12 CDs are associated with this third book. The last 4 CDs are JRRT notes, summaries, background material, etc that only the most diehard fan would appreciate."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This concluding volume includes dramatic war scenes between larger-than-life characters that read like a latter-day Illiad. The climax of the story solves in a dramatic and satisfying matter the riddle of how Frodo can dispense of the ring despite its irresistible power over anyone who bears it. Much of the morality tale consists of the need to abstain from revenge and evil means in dealing with evil, lest one be corrupted by it. It's an ancient theme of many myths, and one that, for example, George Lucas uses to great effect in his Star Wars movies.The final third of the book is post-climactic though not necessarily anti-climactic. There is a great odyssey homeward and the casting out of ruffians and evil pretenders. And there is a sadness to the book's ending given the long-term effects of war and the ring on the heroes.This is a great epic tale. Inglis' reading is very effective and adds to the richness of the work."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This is the final episode of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". Intense reading, makes you wonder what the next page holds in store...highly recommend !"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"product was in good condition as described, though cover fell off after a few days use. but its a book, who needs the cover anyways?"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Welcome back to Middle-Earth in J.R.R. Tolkien's third and final portion of the amazing &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; Trilogy. In &quot;The Return of the King,&quot; we join the Fellowship as they fight the War of the Ring and follow Frodo and Sam across Mordor.Tense battle scenes waltz side by side with touching emotional moments. Throughout the battle scenes, readers find themselves holding their breath; eyes glued to the page. Throughout the tender moments between Frodo and Sam, or any other member of the Fellowship, readers discover their emotional attachment to these characters.All but the most callused of hearts will go out to the characters when suffering befalls them. Whenever trouble confronts Frodo, Sam, Merry, Pippin or whoever it may be, readers feel the desire to leap into the pages of the book in hopes that perhaps they can be transported to Middle-Earth, take up their sword and smite the wicked in a great act of courage.J.R.R. Tolkien uses a unique and appealing style of writing. Through his portrayal, readers feel like they are accompanying the Fellowship on their quest. Tolkien illustrates Middle-Earth through elaborate detail. This detail may become tedious at times, but the action and grand storytelling throughout the novel balance out the extensive detail. &quot;The Return of the King&quot; delights fantasy, adventure and action lovers."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Return of the King is the third book in the trilogy of J.R.R. Tolkiens Lord of the Rings. This book demonstrates the frustration and darkness of the ring on the young ring bearer Frodo Baggins. With darkness falling upon the fellowship, the time has come for the ultimate battle between good and evil. The evil power of Sauron has grown strong and may not be able to be stoped. With the help from the king and some unexpected friends, the forces of Sauron are taken on. The book is a little long winded and does drag on towards the end but some scenes truly allow a vivid depiction of the events and makes you feel as though you are in the book. But this book truly involves some surprising events which make the book very worthwhile to read. This book makes my top 10 and I do suggest that any fan of mistery and adventure should read this book as well as the other two books in the trilogy."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This is the third book in the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy. It continues the quest of Frodo trying to destroy the ring in the city of Mordor.John Ronald Reuel Tolkien was born in South Africa in 1892. When he was 3 years old he moved to England with his mother. After graduating from college, he became a professor at Oxford university. He formed a literary group with other writers called the \\"inklinks\\". In this group he wrote many of his stories. John died September 2, 1973.Out of the 3 \\"Lord of the Rings\\" books, \\"he Return of the King\\" was by far my favorite. From cover to cover i could not seem to put this book down. Tolkien keeps your interest throughout the entire novel. \\"The return of the King\\" describes the battle between the men of Gondor, and the evil army of Sauron. It also continues Frodo's quest to destroy the ring at the top of Mount Doom. Qverall, I thought this book was great, but I thought the end was kind of sad and could have been better.If you are planning on reading thois book,I highly suggest that you read the first 2 books instead of watching the movies. If you watch the movies instead of reading the books, much of this novel won't make sense to you."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"For years, I had heard enough people say that The Lord of the Rings was too long and dated to be worth reading that I avoided them. Recently, I picked up the first one, The Fellowship of the Rings, and I found that those people were flat wrong. The books have aged well. The characters are extremely interesting and loveable and the plot is well paced and exciting.The Two Towers picks up right where Fellowship left off. The narrative is split between the two divisions of the fellowship. The first two books follow Merry, Pippin, Gimli, Legolas, Aragorn, and others as they join forces with the Ents (the coolest characters in the series so far) to fight against the rising power of Saruman. The last two books in The Two Towers follow Frodo and Sams' continuing quest into Mordor to try and destroy the ring. They face some interesting obstacles, and there are quite a few plot twists in the narrative.The Two Towers is a truly entertaining read. The narrative in this is pretty fast-paces (except for one section at the beginning). There are some new characters and creatures which are really interesting. The conflicts are intense, and there are a lot of plot twists to keep you entertained. The book is especially exciting near the end. It really leaves you needing to read the last chronicle. I can't wait to experience the rest of The Lord of the Rings. I only wish I hadn't waited so long to get to it."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Return of the King is definitely the best book I have ever read. It is the ultimate ending to Tolkien's fantastic trilogy; it is a story of love, bravery, magic, and terror all wrapped up in one. I must admit that the ending was slightly disappointing, however, Middle Earth was better for it. I will read this book again someday-once you start, you can barely put it down. I LOVED IT!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"In the second piece to the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, the story gets divided up into two parts. The first is concerning Arogorn and Gimli and Legolas and it is my favorite part of the series. Tolkien is a master at building up the tension and then leaving the reader hanging by moving on to another side of the story. The timing and portrail of the story is the best there is for story telling in any fashion. The second part moves on to Frodo and Sam's journey into Mordor and it is eary and dark. The description of this evil country leaves the reader thankful that he does not have to make such a journey himself. The characters grow and are quite changed by the events that surround them. I always thought that if the characters were not changed by a story, then how is the reader ever going to be affected? Well, no lack of that here. Please read and you will charish this world for the rest of your life."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"In \\"The Return Of The King\\" by J.R.R. Tolkien, Tolkien does a wonderful job of ending an amazing story that has branched through a mystical trilogy of magic, hope, good and evil...My favorite character in this book is Sam, my favorites have changed throughout the trilogy. He sticks with Frodo throughout the whole story and is his will when Frodo wants to give up. Sam puts his life on the line for Frodo many times in this story, he was truly what kept Frodo going.I enjoyed the ending to this trilogy, some minor characters came into the spotlight and showed their true colors, and the book wrapped up nicely."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This is the third time I have visited the magical world of J.R.R Tolkien's unique Middle-Earth, and I'm sure it won't be the last time! The Return of the King is the final, and in my opinion the best, book in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. With just as much action, adventure, suspense and romance as the first two, the final episode breaks all bounds with not a dull moment in its entirety.The book resumes the story of the remnants of what was the Fellowship of the Ring, now the Grey Company. Each have gone their separate ways, and Frodo and Samwise have journeyed to Mordor to fulfill their dreadful task of destroying the Ring. Peregrin and Gandalf set out for the slowly dying city of Minas Tirith to inform its Steward, Denethor, of the death of his son Boromir, who died protecting Peregrin and Meriadoc. While Gandalf and Pippin ride East, Merry, with the rest of the Fellowship and the host of Rohan, rides to Edoras to consult the lady Eowyn, daughter of the king of Rohan. However, a new path is revealed to Aragorn and the Grey Company: The Paths of the Dead. All paths hold danger for each company, though Frodo's is the gravest. With Sauron's Eye upon him constantly, the Ring weighs heavier on his conscience than ever, slowly working its evil on his heart. Having lost all hope, Frodo succumbs to despair and even Sam's optimism cannot lift the heavy burden from his mind.Following the end of the novel, there are the Appendices, which describe the history of each ancient race and its background. Including some excerpts from Bilbo's Red Book, they are a great help in understanding Middle-Earth as a whole.I could not stop reading this book once I started, and I believe the reader will find it just as addictive. Tolkien combines all of the human weaknesses and strengths into this magnificent story of betrayal, temptation, courage, love, hate and valor. Journey with Frodo and Sam as all of the Races join in the fight that will seal the fate of Middle-Earth and end the Third Age. I guarantee it will be an adventure you will never forget."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"&quot;The Return of the King&quot; is the end to the fantasy epic, &quot;The Lord of the Rings.&quot; It finishes off the trilogy in such a beautiful way that you'll be craving to get more of Tolien's Middle Earth. With adventure, comedy, love, and wonderful writing, &quot;The Return of the King&quot; leaves you with such a nice, warm feeling within you that you'll want to re-read it again.In this book of the epic trilogy, we are finally intoduced to places that have been mentioned throughout the book various times such as Minas Tirith. In this novel you will find out about each member of the fellowship and their doings. More adventure that you have seen in the other two novels is present and the suspense building up to the dramatic and wonderful conclusion is great.&quot;The Return of the King&quot; should not be read unless you have read &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; and &quot;The Two Towers&quot; before this. This book is the end to J.R.R. Tolkien's gorgeous trilogy and you'll savor every word of it. This is wonderful reading and will be loved by most fans of the fantasy genre. If you haven't read this book yet you must read it. If you have read it go and read it again. This is a beautiful work and I strongly recommend it. This is one of the most popular fantasy novels of our time and should not be missed.Happy Reading!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This book was the best of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. I loved the battle scenes and heroic importance the hobbits had and their big part in winning the War of the Ring. Meriadoc and Peregrin were the greatest; it touched me to see the friendship between the two, and the cheerfulness and ignorance of Pippin, who did nothing but ask questions. My favorite part, though, was the second part, which followed poor Samwise and Frodo as they entered Mordor. Sam's love and loyalty to his master amazed me, and without his hope and strength, the Quest would never even had a chance.As the made their painful journey, Sam helped dying Frodo with his will and physical strength as well. When they traveled to Mount Doom, I almost felt as if I was there, the depression, hopelessness, thirst,hunger,fatigue....It seemed so real, I couldn't put the book down. The ending saddended me, when the four hobbits came home to nothing they expected, and Frodo struggles with the remberance and cost of being the Ring-bearer. This book is my favorite, and I defintely think anyone could read this book and be satisfied....Before reading this bbok though, you might want to read first the Hobbit, and then the rest of the LOTR trilogy (it makes it alot more easier to understand...)"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"J.R.R Tolkien has become my favorite author very quickly. His books are amazing to read, and stimulate my mind. I read this books for a series of school book reports, and enjoyed remembering the beauty of this book. The Retern of the King, being the most exiting book in the series, has a wonderful plot that keeps you in the book to the very last page.In the Retern of the King the last forces of the free people defend themseves from the rising evil in the land of Mordor.

I have finally finished the Lord of the Rings. Savouring the last page of J.R.R. Tolkien's The Return of the King is a bittersweet moment. It is hard to say good-bye to these wonderful characters. The first half of this book was dazzling in its darkness and the entire book was only marred a little by the anticlimatic last hundred pages (excepting the delightful last two chapters set in the Shire, still amounting to four chapters of good-bying.) But that is being too nit-picky for a trilogy that gives such intense pleasure and created such vibrant figures of fantasy. Gandalf and Frodo, particularly, will always live on as they deserve to do."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"If you have seen the other two movies or read the books, you will love this book. It is amazing! You finally find out what happens to Frodo ad the rest of the company. If you have seen the other two movies but have not read the books, I strongly suggest reading them, especially reading this one before the movie comes out. I think they are all worth reading even if you have already seen the movie. I love these books!!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers is the continuation of The Fellowship of the Ring, and the second part in what is known as Lord of the Rings. This book is also the best part from the Lord of the Rings.The book is mainly divided into two parts. In the first part, we follow the acount of Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli. As the trio continues to search for Merry and Pippin, they run into the White Rider. Is this White Rider a friend or foe? And you will also follow them as they travel through the land of Rohan, and combine forces with Rohan's king and army. Join the crew as they travel to Helm's Deep, and face the forces of Isengaurd, and a final confrontaion with Saurman is at it's hand. The part with Saurman is very alarming and different that what one would expect.The second half of the book revolves around Frodo Baggins, and Samwise Gamgee. The duo is traveling throuh Eymn Muil, with hopes of reaching the Dark Gate, and to make their way to Mt. Doom. On their way, Smeagle, or Gollum catches up with them, demanding his Precious. The lust filled creature is somehow tamed by Frodo and Sam. Soon Gollum becomes a vauleable ally to the Hobbits. Soon the trio meet up with Faramir, Boromir's brother. Yet unlike his brother, Faramir is able to resist temptation by the Ring. But when a accident occurs, and Gollum misunderstands the situation, the outcome is disasterous.This book was beautifuly written by my favorite author JRR Tolkein. This book will leave you on end, as it did me. It has more action, and drama than the first book, and that is why it stands as my favorite of all of Tolkein's works. If you have just seen the Fellowship movie, and liked it, I highly suggest this book. If you have seen the Two Towers movie, and liked it, I very highly suggest it. This book will remain a constant favorite of mine"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers is a follow up to The Fellowship of The Ring. Although The Fellowship was an outstanding book which sets up the rest of the story, it can't compete with The Two Towers. With far more action and different sides of the story to view from the reader is engaged in the action resulting in anticipation and wonder.The Two Towers is well written allowing an easy read for people of all ages. Although it is written in a different style than that of non-fantasy books, it is still written for an easy understanding. With a well devised structure and an effective flow in the way The Two Towers is written, the reader is more likely to stay interested in the story and want to read on. With such a detailed plot J.R.R Tolkien paid great attention to the description of each scene and what is going on to allow the reader to picture what is happening in their mind with extreme detail.Of course without a good story, there is no way a book could succeed. It doesn't matter how well it is written: if the story isn't interesting then there is no way the reader is going to keep reading. With a well thought out plot and many details to the story, The Two Towers can get a little confusing. There is always an appendix (located in The Return of the King) to look at if something is a little confusing. This allows the reader to stay with the story and not get lost.The way The Two Towers is written and such an engaging plot, Tolkien created a masterpiece that will keep even people who aren't into fantasy stories entertained. The attention to detail allowing for an easy read for people of all ages, The Two Towers will be a book read for decades to come."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"A grim, tragic, brooding and beautiful book, shot through with heroism and hope...this is the 2nd volume in Tolkien's epic adventure. If you haven't read the 1st book then I strongly recommend that you read it before you read the second one(you won't fully understand the story if you don't read the first one).Frodo and his Companions have been beset by danger during their quest to destroy the ring of power. While Frodo and Sam made their escape, the rest of the Company was attacked by Orcs(aka Goblins). Now the two hobbits, Frodo and Sam, make their way alone down the River Anduin-alone, that is, except for the mysterious creeping figure that follows wherever they go. The rest of the Company--Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli--set off in a different direction; toward the fast-marching Orcs who captured the two remaining hobbits--Merry and Pippin. The Fellowship is broken. Will Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli be able to catch up with the Orcs? What doom awaits Merry and Pippin? Will Frodo and Sam be able to reach Mordor and destroy the ring? Read the book to find out!I read this book a year ago when I was 12. The book is very detailed and has a background of measureless depth(which makes the book seem like a pre-history). For some people it may seem boring. And in truth some parts take a little longer to read(because of the detailed background). But thats what makes the events in the book seem like it actually happened. If you love fantasy books like me, and you like adventure stories, then this is the book for you. I also recomend this book to people who read and liked the 1st book, The Fellowship of the Ring. You won't be disappointed, this book is as good, or even better than the 1st book.This is a good book for people 12 years old and up. The Two Towers is one of the best books I've ever read, with elements of high adventure, suspense, mystery, poetry, and fantasy. An extraordinay work--pure excitement."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The highest I can give this is 5 stars?! That's all I can give it?! If you love mideval fantasy with extremely suspensful battle sequences, then don't pass over this book. Any of the people who give this bad ratings don't know wht they are talking about. The plot is awesome! The coolest character is Legolas, he is like the best elven archer in Middle-earth. Elves are the best archers."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Tolkien's power with words reaches it's apex in this , the third volume of the trilogy. From the simple descriptions of the characters to the battle scenes , and Frodo's efforts to scale Mount Doom , the author brings the entire epic to life here in the grand conclusion of the tale. Anyone who can read this and not feel &quot;as one&quot; with the Hobbits has no soul and is devoid of emotions.The book commences with Sam Gamgee believing that Frodo has died in Shelob's lair and undertakes to become the Ringbearer. Denethor prepares to defend Minas Tirith but seemingly has fallen under the influence of Mordor and attempts to cremate the still living Faramir and himself on a funeral pyre. The riders of Rohan are mustered and ride to the assistance of Gondor...All in all there is much action leading to the victory of men against the hosts of Sauron. Meanwhile Frodo and Sam creep ever nearer to Cracks of Doom to destroy the One Ring.Even though I originally read this book 30 years ago , I was once again entranced with the world of Middle Earth on reading it again. One of the few books of the 20th Century worthy of the title &quot;Literature&quot;. Much better than any of the later imitators in the fantasy genre."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This book will hold you until the end with the continuity of the suspense. Mordor is a relentless force and the ring is even worse for Frodo Baggins and Sam Gamgey. They have tried to abandon Gollum, but he has proved helpful in this book to the end. The final battle between good and evil takes place, with all the forces of Middle Earth against all the forces of Sauron and the One Ring. Once you have begun this book, you will not be able to stand the suspense. It does NOT end after the battle, for all of Middle Earth is in disrepair and many of the elvin kind are leaving. This truly is a clever ending to an epic tale of the One Ring. You cannot read just one of these books!I recommend the audio recordings for all three books, as well, Rob Inglis is a spectacular reader."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I started reading the Lord of the Rings after I saw the movie, and it changed the way I think about books.

It begins right after the end of the first novel. Frodo and Sam have left the group in order to journey undetected. As Aragorn searches for Frodo, he finds Boromir mortally wounded by arrows. Before Boromir dies, he tells Aragon that Merry and Pippin were kidnapped by Saruman's Uruk-hai. With Legolas the elf and Gimli the dwarf, he begins follow the Uruk-hai captors. Meanwhile, Merry and Pippin escape from the Uruk-hai into the nearby Fangorn Forest, where they encounter Treebeard, the leader of the Ents. Aragorn is able to track their prints that lead into Fangorn, where they meet Gandalf, whom they thought had died in the mines of Moria. The four ride to Rohan where Gandalf warns King Thoeden of Saruman's growing army.While all this is going on, Frodo and Sam continue on their journey towards Mordor. They discover that Gollum has been following them for several days. They capture him when Gollum attempts to steal the Ring from Frodo. Gollum promises to lead the pair to the Black Gate in exchange for his life. He leads them through the Dead Marshes in order to avoid being spied by Orcs. Upon reaching the Black Gate, Gollum stops them as the way is guarded to heavily. Gollum tells them of a secret entrance to Mordor. They head south into Gondor, where they are captured by a group of rangers led by Faramir, the brother of Boromir.J.R. Tolkein's use of language in describing Middle Earth is astonishing. Every scene of the book is described in extensive detail, not to mention the history. Tolkein has created a world, a world of men and elves, that has such a detailed history that it feels like it could exist. With it's legends, history, geography, and language, Middle Earth is quite a place. Personally I feel this book is the best out of the three, with its extensive plot and characters.

They seemed to get progressively better, of which I'm glad because I wanted to know what all the hype was about since this was my first time reading the series. For those who have never read any of the books as well, don't start at this book, start at the beginning or you can be completely lost in Tolkien's rather largish world.In this we have two different story lines. One is of Frodo and Sam. When we last left poor Frodo he had been captured by Orcs and taken to a tower as prisoner. Sam has to rescue him, and even when he does, they are left deep behind enemy lines and must make their way to the mountain where the ring can be destroyed. Meanwhile, the rest of the characters are at war. Each has his own place in the war and they must defend Gondor and break the Black Gates of Mordor to survive. But even if they do win, they don't have any idea of what is waiting for them at home after so long a journey.There is a second part to this book in the appendices. They are filled with lore, language, and history of Middle Earth. While I enjoyed the language section it is interesting to note that history for Middle Earth seems to be written like history in real life, and as such, was kind of boring for me. Despite that though I will not be including this section in my rating of the book as I believe that a good portion of the people will buy the book for the story and find the appendices a bonus.The characters are better developed and really start coming into their own in this novel. Even the language is more unique to each of them, especially the hobbits. I was sad to see that while Gollum played an important role in this book, it wasn't a very large one. I also still thank that Sam is the best of the hobbits on the journey.The writing is still very descriptive but doesn't bog down the story quite as much as it does in the others. Towards the end they do seem to make a big deal of names and this can get tedious at points. There is some violence, but that part isn't as descriptive and nothing is really too offensive in this book. Most importantly, since this is the end book, there is a sense of closure.I'm glad to have finally read all of this series for the first time and mostly enjoyed it. While I don't see myself rereading near in the future, I suspect that I will return to it someday. Its a great fantasy for lovers of the genre.Return of the KingCopyright 1955340 pages, with appendices 470 pagesReview by M.

Granted, it is not for the fainthearted or the disinterested, but like many great novels requires a certain commitment in order to experience the many benefits that it affords. Tolkien's world is fascinating, his characters resonant, and the narrative... epic at the least. For the beginner I would recommend either a guide to middle earth, which can be found on the web or on amazon, or to use wikipedia, this may help with some of the frustration that can come with not knowing the names and places. Tolkien provides a map, and with these tools the reader can begin to appreciate some of the more difficult sections. For those rereading the books this is less of an issue and the reader is able to take in a deeper world with exciting secondary narratives supporting the grand narrative.

Now, as the blockbuster movie adaptation is over, many readers are checking out the dramatic story that ends Tolkien's masterpiece and life's work.Gandalf has ridden to the city of Gondor with Pippin (partly to keep him out of trouble), where the forces of Mordor are attacking. There is upheaval in the city itself, as the steward of Gondor is going nuts. Merry pledges his service to King Theoden of Rohan, not knowing what is ahead for the king and his relatives. And Aragorn is seeking out allies to fight Sauron on a military scale, even if they can't defeat him unless the Ring is destroyed. His search will take him to tribes of forest-dwellers, to Gondor -- and even to summon an army of the dead.In Mordor, the unconscious Frodo has been captured by Sauron's orcs, and taken to the fortress of Cirith Ungol. Sam is desperate to free his friend, but knows that he can't take on an army, and that Frodo would want him to finish the quest. Sam manages to free Frodo from captivity, but they must still brave more dangers before they can come to Mount Doom, the only place where the Ring can be destroyed. As they travel Sam sees Frodo slipping further and further into the Ring's grasp. Will Frodo be able to destroy the Ring?Usually, the climax of an epic adventure is a disappointment. \\"Return of the King\\" succeeds in almost every way, wrapping up each individual storyline, one by one. The ending has a feeling of finality; this is one story that could never have a sequel; Tolkien shows that in a war like this, there is no true \\"happy ending.\\" Even if the good guys win, there will still be scarring, and death, and haunting memories of what once happened. And even if a person survives, he will never be the same.This is the grimmest of the three books in this trilogy. Frodo and Sam are stuck in the vividly horrific Mordor, while the city of Minas Tirith is on the verge of completely crumbling. Tolkien does a phenomenal job of exploring the madness, despair, rage and sorrow that accompany a war, and the way it can affect even the idyllic Shire. And he doesn't forget the slow period of healing that follows -- for people, for civilizations, and even for nature.Though a section of the book near the end descends into near-biblical prose, which changes post-Gondor, Tolkien does not waver in his ability to evoke emotion. One of the most touching scenes in the book is when Sam finds Frodo naked, unconscious and being beaten by an orc. Others include Merry's farewell to Theoden, Eowyn's slaying of the Witch-King, and of course the bittersweet final scene.Speaking of Frodo, this trilogy's hero is almost unrecognizable in parts of this book. The bright, naive young hobbit of the first book has been worn down to a pale shadow of himself. As he grows increasingly attached to the Ring, we even see him doing what seems unimaginable: threatening Sam with a dagger. Sam has come a long way from the shy young hobbit who couldn't say a word around the High Elves -- now he's attacking orcs and carrying Frodo to Mount Doom.And the supporting characters are not neglected either, with the younger hobbits being exposed to the horrors of war, Aragorn breaking fully into his role as the future king of Gondor, and passionate war-maiden Eowyn affecting the war as nobody else could. Some much-loved characters are lost, and others will be permanently changed.The story doesn't really end on the last page; for more background, especially on Aragorn and Arwen, readers should also read the appendices at the end of the book. Another good addition is \\"The End of the Third Age,\\" in which the unpublished epilogue of this book can be found. Though this is probably not canonical, it nicely concludes the story and is a heartwarming look at what happens in the years following \\"Return of the King.\\"It's difficult, once the story has finished, to accept that one has to say goodbye to Middle-Earth and its enchanting inhabitants. But as Gandalf says, \\"I will not say: do not weep; for not all tears are an evil.\\""},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The middle novel of the Rings trilogy opens with the tragic (though decidedly heroic) death of a second member of the Company, and sees the small band that stands in opposition to Sauron entering its darkest hour. Gandalf, the Company's leader, has at the end of the last novel, fallen in combat with the dreaded balrog; Bormoir has been slain at the start of this book, in desperate battle with a group of orks; the Company is diminished by losses, its members scattered, and Aragorn feels himself a failure in the face of the backsets that have been delivered upon him and his comrades. Where many might abandon a mission that surely seems lost, Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas continue on in pursuit of the hobbits Merry and Pippin, captured by Orks in service to the traitorous wizard Saruman, while Frodo and Sam push on into the foul land of Mordor, home of the Dark Lord and location of the volcanic Mt. Doom, into whose fires the pair intend to cast the One Ring, which has brought so much misery onto Middle Earth. In this oft-disrespected second volume, a reader comes to understand the full depth of Saruman's enslavement by Sauron, recoils as Frodo allows the despicable Smeagol to travel along on his journey, comes to meet the ancient ents, and delves full-force into the battle of Helm's Deep, a conflict which stands to decide nothing less than the fate of the world."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"\`The Return of the King', the third of the three volume novel, \`Lord of the Rings' by philologist J. R. R. Tolkien is one of the most influential popular novels of the 20th century. Other bases of big motion pictures such as \`Ben-Hur' and \`Gone With the Wind' can't hold a candle to it as it had an influence far beyond its role as the basis for a movie script. For starters, \`Lord of the Rings' has had a large and growing readership from its original publication in the mid 1950s to the present, while I suspect practically no one reads Lew Wallace's \`Ben-Hur' any more and few people have recently read Margaret Mitchell's \`Gone With the Wind'. Another \`Lord of the Rings' offspring is the whole \`Dungeons and Dragons' role playing games phenomenon. This game originally appeared a few years after the second blooming of \`Lord of the Rings' popularity in 1965, when the books were published in paperback by Houghton Mifflin in response to a pirated copy published by Ace. This is when I first became enraptured by the stories of Middle Earth.In many ways, it is almost impossible to speak of any one of the three volumes which do not in the usual sense of the word form a trilogy of three independent novels related by common characters, location, and history. \`The Lord of the Rings' is a single novel which was serialized in three volumes published over two and a half years in the mid 1950's. When the three titles are published in a single volume, it is not hard to see that the work is really not much longer than \`Gone With the Wind' and it is certainly shorter than some notable novels such as \`Atlas Shrugged'. One virtue we did get from the division into three titles by Tolkien is that Peter Jackson had a valid basis on which to split a single story into three long movies totaling close to 10 hours of viewing time.Like the movie version of \`The Fellowship of the Ring', the \`Return of the King' movie leaves off one important chapter. And, unlike the Tom Bombadil / Barrow Wight episodes in the first volume, the deleted \`Scouring of the Shire' chapter in \`Return of the King' created what was virtually the only real criticism of the movie, because the drama of \`the scouring' was left out of the events between the celebrations in Gondor over the defeat of Sauron and the departures at the Gray Havens. So, we get a half-hour of celebrating and saying good-bye. Not too much in relation to the previous nine and a half hours, but a bit tedious in the context of a three hour movie. So, for the three of you who are reading the books for the first time, you have a great \`lost' event to look forward to in reading \`The Fellowship of the King'.One of the easily most important parts of this third volume is the very long historical appendix which lays out the major events of the first three ages of Middle Earth. One of the most satisfying aspects of both \`The Hobbit' and \`The Lord of the Rings' is the sense of the great depth of history. The appendices show that the history of the One Ring just scratches the surface, as Isildur wrested the ring from Sauron (see the opening scene of \`Fellowship of the Rings') at the beginning of the Third Age. There are two earlier ages of Middle Earth from the time of the birth of the elves to the end of the first war with Sauron. It is a knowledge of this history which tells us why a ranger from the distant north is an heir to the throne of Gondor and why Denethor, the Steward cannot be King. One thing which amazes me is that no reviewer has noted is wondering about the fact that Arwen and Aragorn are very, very, very distantly removed cousins, since it is quite possible that Elrond was the brother of Aragorn's great,....great grandfather. This is because Elrond and brother Elros Tar-Minyatar were given the choice of immortality as a half-elf or very long life and a homestead on the island of Numenor, removed from the sorrows of Middle Earth. Elrond chose immortality and \`exile' to Middle Earth'. Elros chose long life on the Eden-like island.This appendix contains a great many other bits of miscellany. The most important for those who have seen the movie is the story of the love between Arwen and Aragorn, which is not in the main narrative. This history is easily one of the most elaborate fictional histories created to date. Other fantasy histories such as Robert E. Heinlein's future history (in which he predicts the turmoil of the 1960's with amazing accuracy) is tiny in comparison. And, according to Tolkien's own writings, almost all this history was created before he began writing \`The Lord of the Rings'. For those of us who get pleasure from such invented worlds, these appendices were just a little amuse-bouche. Enough to give us a taste of how deep this history went, without giving us many details of the great events of the first and second ages. It was this hunger which created such demand for \`The Silmarillion', the last complete (posthumous) work by Tolkien, assembled by son Christopher Tolkien.If you have not read \`The Hobbit', I strongly recommend reading that before picking up \`The Lord of the Rings'. And, I suggest you read or at least browse the appendices at the end of this volume before starting \`The Fellowship of the Ring'. I am almost inclined to suggest you read \`The Silmarillion' before reading \`The Hobbit', but \`The Silmarillion' reads a lot more like history than like dramatic fiction. It is a much poorer novel than either \`The Hobbit' or \`The Lord of the Rings'.Truly great ending to the greatest fantasy novel, ever."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two towers is the second book of the epic adventure of the series of the Lord of theRings based in Tolkien's tale The Hobbit. This story takes place in the Middle- Earthduring the Third Age just after the Fellowship of the Ring separate in the Shores ofBurien River and Boromir's death. In this book J.J.Tolkien explored different aspects andcharacteristics of its characters Where the Ents, the elves, the dwarves, the mans ofGondor and the Rohan raiders have their own perspective of the battle. Also emphasizeddeeply the struggle of Frodo's attempt to destroy the one ring of the Dark Lord Sauron.When I read this book about three weeks ago, it helped me to understand that I didn't know anything about the true meaning of fantasy and epic adventure until I read aboutTolkien's Middle- Earth. A place where the fantasy materialize in form of a fantasticnarrative that satisfies the most demanding readers. Also it is important to consider that the book contain magnificent poems ,songs ,verses and tales that contribute in thedevelopment of a clear image about the character, the Middle Earth and the battle for thering.In this book you can explore the epic land of the Middle -Earth, the setting of the battlefor the one ring. A setting that changed constantly, from the Burien River to the forest ofFangor and from there to Rohan and then to Helm's Deep. In those chapters in the TwoTowers the main characters Aragorn the future King of Gondor,Gilmi the dwarf andLegolas the elf attempt to rescue Meriadoc and Peregrin. Then they met once again withGandalf in Fangor forest, after he finally defeated Balrog in the Moria mines. Then together they went to Rohan to adverse King Theoden about Saruman's intentions.In Rohan appeared an important character, Wrima Wormtongue ,whose dark speech powerstransformed King Theoden into a Saruman mind slave. For that reason WrimaWormtongue was expelled from Rahan.Then Rohan was evacuated to Helm's Deepfortress where the orcs of Isengar will attempt to destroy Rohan's future. MeanwhileMeriadoc and Peregrin were capture by the orcs of Huru-kai and later met withTreebeard and the council of Ents in Fangor and together destroyed Isengar and defeatSaruman .However Frodo and Samwise attempted to enter to Mordor the Dark Land, todestroy the one ring in the crater of Doom Mountain guided by Smeagol through thisdangerous path . But instead of entering through the dark gate, they decided to take a safeway through the ruins of the ancient city of Osgilath. But they were captured byFamamir's army .In Osgilath Faramir was commanded by his father Derethor to stop theorcs army before they take Minas Tirith.But in this way they will be betrayed byGollum's will. Then later Legolas,Aragorn ,Gandalf and Gimli will met with Sarumanonce again, where they will discuss about Sauron and his betrayed and corruption againstthe human kind and will.If you are interesting in Tolkien's Hobbit or any other stories of epic adventure .TheTwo Towers will not disillusion you, especially the chapters Roads of Isengar ,Thevoice of Saruman ,Helm's Deep and Treebeard. Those will keep the reader in suspenseand deep fascination until the end of every chapter with a marvelous narrative. But firstyou must successfully read The Fellowship of the Ring ."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I think Tolkien envisioned the trilogy not as three separate books but one gigantic novel (along the lines maybe of Proust's In Search of Lost Time, except you know, with Balrogs and stuff) which might be why people who treat the series as three separate novels tend to get bored early on, while the rest of us are urging them to keep going. Because the series as a whole does follow the classical arc of a novel, with the first book consisting of the exposition and setup, the second book the rising action and this last portion being the climax (or climaxes, as it turns out) so that when read straight through the structure makes a whole lot more sense. Tolkien does epic like no one else had done before, thrusting the heroes into impossible situations and making the whole affair so epic that it hurts. Immortal people and run of the mill working class folk mingle and fight and die together, while the fate of everything hangs in the balance. My favorite type of epic fantasy is the kind where the heroes are essentially running for their lives throughout the whole story and there's a palpable sense of \\"Geez if we screw this up everyone dies\\" permeating every page . . . Tolkien pulls this off masterfully, all the while retaining a sense of wonder and an eye for humor at the small things that leads you to believe that these are just regular people involved in extraordinary events. Thus, the third novel wraps up the final plots, with Aragorn and company fighting off Sauron's hordes, all the while having no idea where Frodo and Sam are, or if they're even still alive, waiting for a sign that the Ring is either destroyed or that Sauron has it and they should start looking for other lines of work very quickly. Meanwhile, Frodo and Sam continue the longest walk ever in epic fantasy (really, when you look at the map and the scale, that was a haul they made, on foot!), with an untrustworthy guide and the evilest inanimate object ever created. The grandeur and despair practically leap off the page, with the heroes literally dragging their way to the end of the quests and when the truimph eventually comes, it's more than earned. But even after the celebrations are finished and it's time to go home, there's still one more task left to complete, with a key scene left out of the movie but utterly familar to those who have read the book, and a chilling fate for the last remaining villain in the series. If Tolkien did one thing, he brought a sense of humanity to epic fantasy and successfully captured the feeling of little ordinary people caught up in great things. None of this would have worked half as well if he hadn't constructed a ridiculously detailed history of everything and it's the weight of that prior history that informs the novel, even though only like a tenth of it is actually referenced in the story, it hovers there and acts as a living force on the narrative itself, so that the reader really gets the impression than an Age of the world is passing into history. The ending gets me every time and I can't imagine how it could be anymore perfect, bringing home the point that after all the epic stuff is done, the monsters are vanquished and the kings are brought high, everyday life goes on, beautiful in its simplicity. After the main story is over, there's a slew of appendices, for those not convinced how much crazy detail Tolkien went into to give himself a firm foundation to base the story on. The first few are the most interesting, one for giving us a fairly good history of the Ages and the events that led up to the War of the Ring, as well as what was going on while the narrative focused on the characters. Even better there's a chronology of what happened after Aragorn became king and the events of his reign, detailing the fates of everyone in the Fellowship. It has the feel of real history and it's just as fascinating in its own way as this world. Not perfect, this series is the closest we've gotten to a perfect epic fantasy in terms of emotional scope and historical feel, mixing the high and the mundane and it goes to show that the majority of epic fantasy has only been a pale shadow of what Tolkien did here, so great was his influence (granted there's bit a lot of entertaining shadows, but nothing I've read has surpassed it yet). So you can like or dislike this all you want, but if you're at all interested in fantasy you can't risk ignoring it. Probably going down as one of the greatest novels of the last century (if there's any justice) this was well worth the time to reread and I'm certainly glad I did. The memories of a ten year old just don't do it justice. People who have only seen the movie, by all means, don't stop there. The real heart of the story is here."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"There are many opinions and discussions that one could have on Tolkien's great epic, but one thing is for certain: he saved the best for last. Even Peter Jackson, the director of the film trilogy was heard to say: \\"I made the first two movies so that I could make the third.\\" Everything that has been building in the first two installments now explodes across the pages: battles, intrigues, madness, escapes, disguises, rescues, chases - it's all here as the allied forces of Middle-Earth (Hobbits, Men, Elves, Dwarves and Ents) make their last desperate stand against the converging forces of evil.Like the previous volumes, \\"The Return of the King\\" is divided into two books: Book Five and Book Six. Book Five concerns the reunion of most of the Fellowship and the lengths they take in order to draw the Dark Lord Sauron's eye away from Frodo and Sam. But this togetherness is not to last - soon Gandalf whisks Pippin away to the white city of Gondor in order to stir the city up for battle, whilst Merry swears fealty to King Theoden of Rohan and attempts to find a way to follow him into battle. In even more peril is Aragorn, who decides to take the dread Paths of Dead in order to muster the ghoulish allies that may be found there - with Legolas and Gimli at his side.They will all converge once more in Gondor, (along with Faramir, Eomer, Eowyn and Denethor, the grim Stewart of the King) where the battle of their time will take place outside the walls...In Book Six, Sam finds himself alone in the terrible realm of Mordor after realising that Frodo is not dead, but now captured by the Enemy. After Gollum's betrayal, Sam has nothing left to do but sneak his way into the very fortress of the Dark Lord in the attempt to find Frodo and continue their journey to Mount Doom. But with the Ring now in his keeping, he becomes aware for the first time of its terrible lure...Everything that Tolkien has set up in the previous books come to fruition and is dealt with in its proper time and place - not always to happy endings, but to satisfactory and bittersweet ones: the fading of the elves, the cost of battle, the return of the king, and even Tolkien's subtle but vitally important Christian resonances in the course of the story. To point them out directly would be to take away your opportunity to discover them yourself, but keep in mind the triad role of Frodo, Gollum and the Ring: Frodo's continual mercy toward him, Gandalf's past words that \\"he has yet a part to play, for good or for evil,\\" and the divine grace that seems to intercede at a crucial moment, where the fate of the entire world seems to hang in the balance.At the end of the day, credit must be given where credit is due, and in many ways the hero of the piece is Samwise Gamgee. By the time we reach Book Six most of the journey is seen through Sam's point of view in order to better witness Frodo's decline and the intense devotion that Sam bestows on him. Perhaps my favourite part of the book is Sam's epiphany, when he gazes up at a lonely star in the sky - but again, I'll let you discover that for yourself.Reading \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is an amazing experience. By this stage, you'll probably be intensely invested in these characters and their situations, as well as enveloped in the detailed and three dimensional realm of Middle-Earth, the most vivid and realistic sub-creation that the literary world has ever seen, bar none. From the movement of armies to the pitiful sight of two tiny hobbits crawling up the side of a mountain; Tolkien can effortlessly describe both epic and intimate moments. In fact, in this contrast lies one of his most tear-stirring ideas - the careful and deliberate decision on the part of Aragorn, Gandalf and their allies use themselves as bait in the hope of the barest possible chance that Frodo will be able to complete his mission. The display of such enormous self-sacrifice is just...well, I'm lost for words to describe it.Just as Peter Jackson made the first two movies in order to make the last one, reading the first two books definitely has its payoff in this magnificent conclusion."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"J.R.R.

The story in THE RETURN OF THE KING is tremendous, creative and truly profound. And don't make the mistake of thinking that this book or any of the others from Tolkein are children's books. You will be amazed at the depth of story here.I recognize that everything in the book cannot be translated to film but there are spectacular things in this book that were left out of the movie. Watch the extended version of the movie? Yes, but READ THE BOOK first. Some of my favorite characters and characters essential to the total story were not included. And there are also some unnecessary twists, turns and interpretations taken and made by Jackson and his crew that are established in simplicity and beauty in the book.THE RETURN OF THE KING is an essential sequel to THE TWO TOWERS and is the culmination of the adventures of the The Fellowship, Theoden, and the people of Middle Earth as they continue their quest to overcome the powers of the evil Sauron.But A WORD OF CAUTION: should you read THE RETURN OF THE KING first you won't be able to stop there. The next thing you know you'll be picking up THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING and then wrapping up with THE TWO TOWERS. You won't be able to start with this one and stop there. You may even end up reading this one again in proper sequence.

Frodo's one mission: to destroy a small gold ring that will give the Dark lord ultimate power. One small compilcation: the ring can only be destroyed by throwing it into the mouth of Mt. Doom, right next to the dark fortress Barad Dur. I thought this was a good book an its one you can read more than once."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers is the second book in the Lord of the Rings trilogy by J.R.R. Tolkien. The book starts off in a forest where Orcs--evil creatures who act under the direction of Saruman--have been sent to find the Fellowship (which consists of hobbits--Frodo, Pippin, Merry, and Sam; two men--Aragorn and Boromir; an elf--Legolas; and a dwarf--Gimli), kidnap the hobbits, and bring them to Saruman--alive.The main character, Frodo, is the bearer of the One Ring, created by Sauron, which holds an immense amount of power and evil. This is why the Orcs must capture the hobbits. The book had very good imagery included, giving us vibrant descriptions of the characters and scenes.During the battle between the Orcs and the Fellowship, Boromir is shot with arrows while trying to save Merry and Pippin--who get kidnapped by the Orcs--and dies when Aragorn finally makes it to him. This really teaches a moral to the Fellowship, because Boromir had tried to take the ring from Frodo not much earlier.Luckily, Frodo escapes from the Orcs and ends up heading towards Mordor (which is the one place that the ring can be destroyed) alone. That is, until his &quot;loyal servant&quot; Sam catches up and comes along. This splits up the plot, of whole flow of the story, into three different parts--Frodo and Sam trying to make it to Mordor, Merry and Pippin's attempts to escape from the Orcs, and Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli's attempts to track down and find the Orcs to hopefully save Merry and Pippin.Eventually, Frodo and Sam encounter the creature Gollum--or Sm&eacute;agol--who helps lead them to Mordor. Meanwhile, Merry and Pippin escape the Orcs, heading off into the Fangorn Forest, where they meet Treebeard and the other Ents (tree-like, living, talking, walking creatures).I like this book because the way J.R.R. Tolkien writes is very creative, as are his ideas. In it a whole new world is created, where there is a seemingly endless war going on. I loved the fantasy elements and the new creatures and places. The whole concept just adds to the great sequel to The Fellowship of the Ring."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I finished this one right around the end of October 2002. I found this installment to be a much easier read than the first, with fewer expository sections. The action was fast-paced and relentless. The detail was outstanding, though I was expecting no less after reading the first part. There was a surprising amount of character development nestled within the combat and plotting. I found myself laughing out loud more than once at the burgeoning friendship between Legolas and Gimli. I also found Tolkien's characterization of Gollum masterful. I felt sympathy for him even in my suspicion. The book was truly epic."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I had read the Lord of the Rings trilogy several times before in the past but this year with the realease of the film trilogy by New Line Cinema I decided to read them once more.The Two Towers is the second book in the trilogy. It begins right where the first one left off with Frodo and Sam just beginning to venture into the dark land of Mordor. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli are heading off in search of the captured friends Merry and Pippin.The main conflict in this book is an large advancing army of Uruk-hai, large disgusting beasts bread for the single purpose of destroying life. This army was created by the evil wizard Saruman who is now in alliance with the Dark Lord Sauron, thus the books name, after each of these characters places of residence.The book ends with the army defeated and the country of Rohan saved but with much work still to be done. Sauron's power is still great and Frodo has not yet destroyed the ring.The story continues in the third book, The Return of the King. I reccomend this trilogy to all readers, fantasy lover or not. This series is one of the greatest literary works ever published. The depth and detail with witch Tolkien writes is amazing."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"J.R.R Tolkien continues the first part of an adventure The Fellowship of the Ring with this great sequel The Two Towers. This book took the first part and made it look dull compared to all the adventure and action in this one. I loved this book because it makes a whole new world of imagination and has description that it makes it seem like your actually apart of the journey. I also liked it because of the adventure and action sequences that take place in this book. But even though this book has action and adventure there is also the emotion that may even make you emotional. I don't really relate to my book except for when it comes to the characters, because I do relate to the characters. All in all, this book is so good not only will people who love fantasy, but all sorts of people will be shoving their faces in this book."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"There are few books out there that can even come close the the triumph Mr. Tolkien has created. Return of the King is the final part in the Lord of the Rings trilogy and is my personal favourite book of the saga.All the creatures in Middle-Earth rise up against Sauron and his army as they march towards Minas Tirith for the final battle; the Pellanor Fields, which truly dwarfs Helm's Deeps. Legolas, and Gimli follow Aragorn through dangerous and frightening adventures, and Sam, Frodo, and Gollum make their final journey to the Mountain of Fire.If you enjoy the films, you will adore the books. Do not miss this enchanting, and amazing peice of literature. It is indeed the greatest story of the 20th century."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Brilliant. Awe-inspiring. Masterfully written.J.R.R. Tolkien creates another world--indeed, another culture and language--in what many consider the greatest novel of the 20th Century, \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\" A sweeping, all-encompassing tale of a make-believe world, LOTR is the product of an imagination that may never be equalled again.THE RETURN OF THE KING, being the third and final installment of this novel, takes the reader on a magical journey as the Third Age of Middle-earth comes to its dramatic conclusion, as the Fellowship of the Ring confronts for the final time the Dark Lord and his evil minions. The battle is waged on the Pelennor Fields outside of Minas Tirith in Gondor--a battle that is costly, harrowing, intense. . .exhilarating. Meanwhile, Frodo and Sam continue their journey into the heart of Darkness itself--the inhospitable, deadly land of Mordor--to continue Frodo's quest to destroy the One Ring in the blazing inferno of Mt. Doom. And as Tolkien pulls all of the wonderful components of his epic story together, one man steps forward to claim the throne of Gondor. . .to bring healing to the war-ravaged lands of Middle-earth.THE RETURN OF THE KING is the pinnacle of storytelling, but in my opinion is the weakest of the trilogy, as Tolkien creates a powerful climax then lingers for almost one hundred pages wrapping up his story. This is augmented by the actions of Frodo, Samwise, Merry, and Pippin upon their return to the Shire; the sudden \\"machismo\\" of these Hobbits as they confront the corruption of their homeland is inconsistent with the inherent vulnerability of the characters as depicted through the books.Despite my slight misgivings, THE RETURN OF THE KING is a marvelous book--an exceptional read. Having read this epic several times, it's always a bit sad to come to the end, to say goodbye to such wonderful characters. Highly recommended.--D.

Arwen, Elrond's daughter, must decide between a mortal or immortal life. This book, I thought, had a sad ending, but, I still liked it.

Part 3 stands out the most because all of the sub-plots are brought full circle and ended in a way that really defies description. Every major character is now a prototype often copied by contemporary writers. In every aspect of the work: style, diction, etc., Tolkien shines masterfully. Not even Chaucer or Shakespeare come close to matching his storytelling. Robert Jordan is a terrific writer in his own right, but &quot;Tolkien&quot; is written over every one of his thousands of pages of WHEEL OF TIME. He is simply a &quot;literary Puff Daddy&quot;. Fantasy writing post-LOTR is for all practical purposes plagiaristic."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"more blood and turmoil then the rest of the books combined! this one made this series!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"JRR Tolkien beautifully interweaves the plot in The Two Towers, told from a third person point of view. His bright adjectives are amazing in his descriptions of cities, forests, and characters. In this story, the second part of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, Tolkien narrates the story of Frodo the Ringbearer and the rest of the Fellowship of the Ring. When Frodo and his servant Sam leave the Fellowship for Mordor, ill things come to the rest of the group. An Orc ambush leaves Boromir dead and the two hobbits Merry and Pippin captives. Ever since the fall of Gandalf, Aragorn the Ranger led the group. Now he leads Legolas the spirited Elf and Gimli the surly Dwarf on the chase of the Orcs. When the Orcs were near their destination of Orthanc, the stronghold of Saruman the traitor, the trio of warriors and the Riders of Rohan that they met with, finally catch up to the Orcs. The five score Riders overcome the vicious army of Orcs in a battle at the break of dawn near the mysterious forest of Fangorn. The hobbits, confused, retreat to Fangorn. After a vicious, bloody battle between the Rohirrim and the thousands of Orcs, Isengard is defeated. But Gandalf had returned, and spurred the King of Rohan to attack Orthanc. Gandalf had broken Saruman's staff and banished him finally after the slow, but vicious Ents had destroyed and flooded Isengard, defeating the traitor ultimately. When all of that is going on, Frodo and Sam journey over a wasteland of hills and rock. The evil character Gollum has caught up to them, and they knew they were being followed. With an ingenious plan Frodo captures Gollum and almost trains him to guide them to Mordor. As he writes, JRR Tolkien intricately describes the places that the hobbits pass through, the setting almost telling the future of the story. As the hobbits journey with Gollum as their guide, they meet Faramir and the soldiers of Gondor, and end up befriending the proud warriors. Later Gollum leads them to Mordor, and to an unknown resolve to the story... One of the best parts of the book to my opinion was when Tolkien told of the soldiers of Gondor as though he personally knew them. He closely detailed their clothing, weapons, armor and gear as though he was one of them. The second part of my favorite scene is when the soldiers are fighting the evil men under Sauron's control. Tolkien consistently describes everything going on around, from individual men to how the setting affects the battle. \\"Four tall Men stood there. Two had spears in their hands with broad bright heads. Two had great bows, almost of their own height, and great quivers of long green- feathered arrows. All had swords at their sides, and were clad in green and brown of varied hues, as if the better to walk unseen in the glades of Ithilien. Green gauntlets covered their hands, and their faces were hooded and masked with green, except for their eyes, which were very keen and bright.\\" This book is masterfully crafted by Tolkien's genius, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes adventure or fantasy or both. The beginning was slow, maybe the first 40 pages or so, but it is a wonderful tale. I really loved it and I'm going to also read the final book to find out the ending. I think you should find out what happens too..."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This book has to be one of the best books ever written.

Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli try to rescue them but are soon caught up in their own problems; defending the people of Rohan and fighting Saruman. This half is mostly told by Aragorn and Pippin while the second part is seen from Sam's point of view.In the later half Frodo and Sam try to get into Mordor and the only one to lead them is Gollum, former owner of the ring.I highly recommend this book, don't leave it unread."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I spent alot of time finding the right version of this book so that it would match the other ones that I had.

It is a good book for kids ten and up. It starts off with Gandalf riding with Merry to Minas Tirith, a city in Middle Earth (Middle Earth is the land were all this happens) but far away Sam, who is a Hobbit from the shire (the shire is a peaceful place were Hobbits live) is trying to make up his mind to save Frodo from Orcs (Orcs are creatures who were mutated by evil) who have captured him. Frodo is another Hobbit from the shire. The other option for Sam is to keep going and destroy the ring of power so that evil will be gone forever. Will the ring be destroyed or will darkness rule, it all depends on two hobbits? Meanwhile back in Minas, Tirith the armies of Mordor have gone to destroy Gondor (the main land of men). Will Aragorn and his company Legalas Greenleaf, the Elf and Gimli, the Dwarf save the day once again and will Arogorn take his place as the rightful king of men? Aragorn is the heir to Gondor and a ranger in Rivendale. I recommend that you should read the first two books first. At the beginning of the trilogy the Hobbits thought they were going on a small journey but in the middle of the trilogy they were gloomy and had hardly any hope and at the end they pushed and resisted evil and they were glad. I learned that if you want something hard enough you can achieve it. At first the book is confusing because it is switching from Frodo and Sam to Aragorn and his companions. What I really liked was the detail he put into the world were the books take place.Books also written by Tolkien: The Silmarilian (the book of the beginning of Middle Earth), The Hobbit (prelude to The Lord of the Rings), The Fellowship of the Ring (book one in the Lord of the Rings trilogy), and The Two Towers (the second book in the Lord of the Rings trilogy)."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This is the greatest book ever.

It is called the Two Towers because each evil sorcerer has a tower, Saruman has Orthanc and Sauron has Barad Dur. I think when you read this book you should be about ten to fifteen years old because it gets really complicated at parts. This thrilling, action-packed fantasy takes place long ago and starts with Boromir, a man of Gondor, getting shot with arrows by orcs (creatures who are like evil men) who capture Merry and Pippen, two little hobbits. Two other brave hobbits, Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee, who have the Ring, are journeying to Mordor, the one place the Ring may be destroyed, because that is where it was created, in the fires of Mount Doom. Mordor is the land where the wicked lord Sauron lives. The Ring is a power that is beyond any others. It can drive a man mad and, if in Sauron's hands, it could end the world. In it is his hatred and power. A curious creature named Smeagol or Gollum later joins them and acts as a guide to Mordor. Meanwhile the rest of the company, Aragorn, the son of Arathorn a ranger and leader, Gimli, son of Gloin the dwarf, Legolas, a greenleaf elf and Gandalf the Grey, a wizard are battling Saruman the White and his grand orc army the Uruk-hai. Other creatures help like ents and huorns. This is a book where characters learn bravery and loyalty. Will Middle Earth survive? J.R.R. Tolkien is a fantastic author who loves action. You will learn much about warfare and hope because many times there are huge battles and there are some very despairing times. I thought it was good because it is a fantastic plot and has a whole world of its own. This is by the author of The Hobbit, The Fellowship of the Ring and The Return of the King."},{"Title":"The Stone Of Time","review":"\\"The Stone of Time\\" is the sixth and thankfully final book in the Young Adult fantasy series, Runesword. The story is continued by two previous authors, Rose Estes (known for her early D&D; Endless Quest and Greyhawk novels) and Tom Wham (board game designer). Different authors for each book seem to have been the theme for this series in efforts to quickly crank out more stories. While the authors may be different, the characters pretty much remain the same. Cal the warrior, Bith the sorceress, Hathor the troll and Endril the elf are all back together again on their sixth adventure. The Norse God Vili (Brother of Odin) once again tasks them in finding and destroying another Runesword in attempts to reclaim more of his divine power. In a last ditch attempt to halt the Dark Lord's advancing army and wall of mist, the adventurers must find and journey to the fabled city of Abaton where the legendary Stone of Time is kept. By obtaining and learning to use the stone Bith hopes that she can alter the past so that the Dark Lord's forces never exist. Here are my thoughts on The Stone of Time;Pros+ Quick and easy read.+ Cover by Larry Elmore.Cons &lt;Contains SPOILERS>- Story jumps around too much and never really focuses enough on one thing. A common occurrence in this series.- Cover art never actually occurs in the story. The characters do meet such creatures but are never actually attacked by or fight them.- Hathor's mother is named Gething in one chapter then Gethring in the next. Where was the editor?- The \\"Dark Lord\\" is remained almost completely faceless and not really a character, just a name.- Bith and Cal's squabbling is still persistent and annoying. Quite possibly two of the most annoying characters I've ever read about in a fantasy series.- Extremely abrupt and clich&eacute; ending. I never saw an army defeated so quickly and easily. Everything was way too convenient.- At the end of the book it's revealed the Runesword was a fake and the group was tricked by Loki. Then Gunnar Greybeard shows up on behalf of Vili and requests the group to search for another Runesword. What? How exactly is this a conclusion? To me it seems the series was just cancelled after the sixth book was finished.- No world map.The cover of the book boasts \\"The Thrilling Conclusion to the Epic Adventure Series.\\" Now if you've read the entire series you can't help but laugh at such a statement. The Stone of Time was pretty much on par with the previous books in the series. The story is loosely connected and the authors do make mention of the Outcasts previous adventures. My main issue with this series is believing the group of four characters stays together. Sure they're united at the beginning of each book by the god Vili to recover another Runesword, but beyond that it's sometimes difficult to see them adventuring together. Regardless, the books are short, easy reads so I continued the series to see what the other authors could contribute. Sadly, it wasn't much."},{"Title":"The Stone Of Time","review":"AND DON'T EVER BUY A SINGLE BOOK OF THIS SERIES...THE SERIES IS AT BEST MEDIOCRE, BUT THE FINAL NOVEL ENDS WITH THE GREATEST ANTICLIMAX THAT COULD EVER BE CONCEIVED.

The writing was really not that inspired either, sure these types of books tend to be from the war college point of view, but his writing is not even that entreating.

Ron provides us with a commons sense approach to the important task of being successful at raising our chldren. With the many emotional and often heart warming stories, we are allowed to share some of his childhood memories and also many of those of his children. He takes those memories and provides us sound advice as he guides us while addressing many of the everyday issues we face as parents. The advice on discipline, lying, honesty, tantrums, education, and buliding self confidence are just some of the topics Ron addresses. You will find the book enjoyable reading and a valuable guide, well worth the effort, as you take on that tremendous responsible of raising your children.

He gave Judy her due many times. He talks about how he got goosebumps the first time she sang in rehearsal. He freely attributed the \\"Get Happy / Happy Days are Here Again\\" duet idea to Judy Garland. He talked about Judy's idea for an American tribute show after Kennedy was killed, and how it was quashed by the network brass.He also talked about Judy's darker side, and how that affected the show.He also talked about the problems the show had with the network / format changes, etc.He seemed to be pretty self-aware, and talked about his problems along with the rest.I think he was still bitter over the outcome, who wouldn't be? I think this book was his way of getting closure on an intense experience which had good and bad parts."},{"Title":"The other side of the rainbow;: With Judy Garland on the dawn patrol","review":"I adore Judy Garland. (I also appreciate Mel Torme's singing.)She is one of the greatest entertainers of the 20th Century.That said, this book is a journal of what a nightmare it can be like dealing with what the French correctly call a \\"sacred monster\\".Torme doesn't tarnish Judy's legacy. Here he harshly but honestly illuminates a dark corner of her life.She wasn't perfect. By this time of her life, she was somewhat impossible to work with: like an injured creature, wounding those around her.This isn't an easy read for many Garland fans, I know. But it is a valuable contribution to understanding her."},{"Title":"The other side of the rainbow;: With Judy Garland on the dawn patrol","review":"First published shortly after the death of Judy Garland in 1969, this book attempts to show the true personality of the legendary performer. Written in a manner that points all criticism for the failure of Garland's CBS Television series to her, and away from him and others behind the scenes, Torme instead shows how much bitterness he still had 5 years after the demise of the show. Inaccuracies abound throughout the book and, after reading it, you feel Garland was a shameless has-been. Nothing could be further from the truth. As testament one only needs to view the recently released DVDs of the complete television series which show Garland as a powerful entertainer who elevated show after show to something quite entertaining even today. For a better view of Garland and the TV-series, read &quot;Rainbows End&quot; by Coyne steven Sanders - a book that puts you center stage for all of the shows, and behind the scenes for all of the intrigue that helped doom the show. 'The Other Side of the Rainbow' is a poor choice of reading material to learn about the magic that is (still) Judy Garland."},{"Title":"The other side of the rainbow;: With Judy Garland on the dawn patrol","review":"What an a##!!....and a bitter one at that. What kind of man writes about someone who is, to many, still the worlds greatest entertainer, so shortly after her tragic death...or for that matter....after her death period....I would hazard a guess he was the worlds greatest coward. Demons, Ms. Garland most certainly had, though...she proved relentlessly that when it came to her public...her fans...her art....she could and would rise above them...as she so stunningly proved to the world with her CBS show in 1963-64 (Save your money and purchase the DVD collection of her CBS sitcom)......It wasn't, as...umm...what's his name again?....her fault the show ended...but rather a constant and intolerable assault by the powers of CBS...and even, perhaps..what's his name...though I rather doubt he had any type of power to do such a thing.Years from even now, 2006....people will remember the great Judy Garland....and still wont know what's his name or what he even did.....I hope Ms. Garland has finally found the peace she never did in her lifetime.....what a tragic waste......and she is still missed...even so many, many years after her death.Save your money...this book is only good for starting a fire in the fireplace."},{"Title":"Web Services Platform Architecture","review":"As an architectural book this is a fine work. It's short, somewhat terse but not overly so. Graphics are consistently well used throughout. And the author has a genuine grasp of the subject.If you are looking for an architectural level work, or a high level introduction to web services, then you may have found your book. But if you are looking for something that presents both the architecture and some examples of implementation you won't find what you are looking for here."},{"Title":"Web Services Platform Architecture","review":"What do you get when you put a number of Web Services gurus from IBM in a room for a while? You'll get the \\"Web Services Platform Architecture\\" book. In short, all the authors that assisted in writing this book are Web services experts from IBM who have either wrote the specs or assisted in writing the Web services specs in question. The nice thing about the book is that is it an easy read. It is not a dry, boring, \\"reading-these-specs is-putting-my-to-sleep,\\" book. As you know, there are a number of specs that cover Web services, so the authors have a taken a short-and-sweet approach to each protocol. Each protocol is covered in detail, but the detail surrounds why you would want to care about this protocol, and not what paragraph 4, subparagraph 8 of chapter 2 of WS-Security says about naming conventions, for example. Each chapter ties the business needs to the technical aspects of the protocol, and talks about how the protocol can be used to solve a given business problem.The following protocols are covered in this text:Messaging-type protocols such as WS-AddressingDescription-type protocols such as WS-Policy, and WSDLProtocols that are used for QoS specification such as WS-Security, WS-Reliable Messaging, WS-Atomic Transaction and WS-Business ActivitySecurity type protocols (WS-Security) and other related protocols such as WS-Trust, WS-Privacy, WS-Federation and WS-AuthorizationWorkflow and composition type protocols such as WS-BPEL.As the authors move \\"up\\" the stack (the protocols are presented and classified very similar to what I described above - layers atop of the transport protocols such as TCP/HTTP), the business examples get more and more involved and complicated. You need to realize that there is not much code writing actually occurs in this book, but a high-level architectural methodology of how different pieces of the Wed services stack fit together, and compliment each other. The different examples given demonstrate another very crucial fact: an architect can pick and choose the protocol and standard s/he wants to get the job done. Web services protocols are by no means an all-or-nothing concept. This is why interoperability of various protocols very important, and the main reason why some of these protocols are stuck at the \\"final\\" stages of approval committee for such a long time.Two case studies are presented at the end of the text that covers the end-to-end model of the protocols. Authors also discuss a number of competing protocols that have come out of various Web services standard committees, and why each one is needed. Future trends in Web services is the last topic discussed in the text with a brief talk of Web semantics.All and all, this is a great book on Web service protocols - the topics are easy to read and follow - something that each and everyone one of us involved with Web services can use given the number of protocols and standards that are out there."},{"Title":"Web Services Platform Architecture","review":"Web services has grown beyond just the basics, and there are a number of new standards emerging. To keep up from an architectural standpoint, a good choice might be Web Services Platform Architecture by Sanjiva Weerawarana, Francisco Curbera, Frank Leymann, Tony Storey, and Donald F. Ferguson (Prentice Hall PTR).Chapter List:Part 1 - Introduction: Service-Oriented Architectures; Background; Web Services: A Realization of SOAPart 2 - Messaging Framework: SOAP; Web Services AddressingPart 3 - Describing Metadata: Web Services Description Language (WSDL); Web Services PolicyPart 4 - Discovering Metadata: Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration (UDDI); Web Services Metadata ExchangePart 5 - Reliable Interaction: Reliable Messaging; TransactionsPart 6 - Security: Security; Advanced SecurityPart 7 - Service Composition: Modeling Business Processes: BPELPart 8 - Case Studies: Car Parts Supply Chain; Ordering Service PacksPart 9 - Conclusion: Futures; Conclusion; References; IndexIt used to be you only needed to know a few basic things about web services, like WSDL, SOAP, and maybe UDDI. But now there's a whole new slew of standards and acronyms for web services, usually starting with WS- (WS-Policy, WS-Addressing, and so forth). The first step you need to take is to figure out what the new standards are and how they fit into the overall picture. The authors do a good job of this in the book. They present an architectural diagram that shows the whole SOA stack of where each piece fits. Then they have each \\"part\\" of the book cover the current and new web services standards that fit in that area. For instance, when you read the section on discovering metadata, you'll get the explanation of both UDDI (the common current standard) as well as coverage on WS-MetadataExchange, which is where things are going. That combination of current and future standards makes for a strong understanding of the technology as well as the opportunity to compare and contrast quite easily.This isn't a book I'd recommend to someone who wants an in-depth understanding of any single standard that's covered. The information is just detailed enough to give a system architect the skills they need to design an application using the technologies, but not enough to answer all the \\"how do you glue this to that\\" questions a coder would ask. But I'd still recommend it to the coder and the architect so that they'd learn what it is they don't know, and learn how to frame all the details in their further studies.Good material, and one of the more current and up-to-date titles out there..."},{"Title":"Web Services Platform Architecture","review":"This book is all about Web services platform architecture and standards. It cooks well on most of the alphabet soup of web services standards. This book would guide you instead of browsing over the internet for what is what. The book falls short on guidelines for implementing them. The book also a bit old in its evolving specifications and endorsed standards coverage particularly less about WS-I and WS-Security* standards. That is disappointing."},{"Title":"Web Services Platform Architecture","review":"Web Services have been rapidly evolving. This entire field is in a state of flux as many companies, including IBM, Amazon, eBay and Microsoft, search it for a killer app. The book and the field groan under the weight of a slew of acronyms - SOA, WSDL, SOAP, UDDI, WS-Security, BPEL and more. Unfortunately, there is little that you can do about this but pay attention.The key idea in the book is of Service Oriented Architecture. It gives us a loosely coupled system; made of nodes that asynchronously communicate using message oriented protocols. A non-blocking mode that greatly improves the robustness of the entire system. The book goes into all this and far more.A major merit of the book is that it is very up to date. Including an explanation of Business Purpose Execution Language. This is the latest big innovation in Web Services. It grew out of the realisation that Web Services Description Language was not expressive enough to describe intricate business logic across different interacting Web Services, even in a declarative format. So BPEL was devised to handle this shortfall. Essentially, any other book on Web Services that omits mention of BPEL is now obsolete."},{"Title":"Web Services Platform Architecture","review":"This is a great reference book for the Web Services Stack and all the new specification and how they all fit in. Good starter when looking for a solution, but you will need other references for implementation."},{"Title":"Web Services Platform Architecture","review":"This book is specially interesting by its chapter of introduction to the BPEL, since it is a subject that does not treat in almost any book of technical form.It is a very interesting book so that it introduces to the reader in all the concepts and technologies involved in the Web Services focusing it towards a services oriented architecture.It does not get to be a complete book on SOA, tries it either, but it provides good bases.What makes very interesting to the book is that each concept and architecture introduce it very correctly and later makes one more an approach more technical, with examples of code, or definitions.Everything and not to be a complete guide if who provides a very ample vision and detailed enough, so that the reader concretely knows that he is being spoken at every moment and he knows by where must extend its knowledge.He lays the way to the knowledge of the technologies implied in the Web Services.A very special chapter is of the BPEL where aside from introducing conceptually it gives it a good technical introduction providing to the reader the technical foundations to know the BPEL and power to confront a following deeper learning of the matter of more comfortable form.It provides the necessary keys and concepts, as well as a general vision, allowing a later learning of the matters that interest easily but.It is a book that nowadays is updated with the technologies that treatment.Recommended for a very good conceptual and technical introduction to the Web Services, of form independently and like tool of SOA."},{"Title":"Web Services Platform Architecture","review":"There are several other books, that are over 2 years old that do the same job as this book.

Best of all, there are lots of examples. The author doesn't just slap them on the page and tell you to figure it out yourself. The author walks the reader thru them.Cons:Some areas reads like a technical manual.. causing me to reread sentences over and again.

I usually don't go for the &quot;in 21 days&quot; type books because I'm worried it might be too quick and novice like. However this title is well written, with each chapter going over another area of xslt in the proper sequence. There are plenty of examples to guide you when writing your own transformations. The index makes it easy to find what you need, but I'd recommend going chapter by chapter as quickly as possible if you are confident with programming in scripting/web languages. You can do the whole thing in 7 days if you like.At this point this book and the W3.org site that hosts the xml official specification documents (xsl, xslt, xpath) is all I need.

For James Garfield the choice is easy (the only competition being the short bio from the American Presidents series) and thankfully Mr. Peskin has left almost no room for another book to take its place as the definitive Garfield biography.In short, this is among the best \\"academic\\" Presidential biographies that I have read. Peskin has clearly done an exhaustive amount of research as well as having a thorough command of the time period in American history. The book is extremely well organized and Peskin's writing style is fluid and engaging. The book is adept at presenting in depth material in a way that is easy to understand and ideas and story threads follow logically through the book. It is possible that some may find the detail level a bit much but it is certainly appropriate for this type of biography and in my opinion Peskin has struck just the right balance of detail and related background information without losing focus on the main subject and important themes. I highly recommend this biography, it will clearly be the definitive Garfield biography for quite some time to come."},{"Title":"Garfield: A biography (The Library of the presidents)","review":"I had the pleasure of being a graduate student of Dr. Peskin's in the late 1980's and one of the things he taught us was how to write. Strangely, he never used Garfield as an example of superb historical writing or scholarship, but it is both. It is generally considered the finest biography of Garfield's life in print, and it is.I picked it up on a lark one weekend and spent the entire weekend reading it. I couldn't put it down!! It is that good and the scholarship is great! A must-read for history buffs!"},{"Title":"Garfield: A biography (The Library of the presidents)","review":"This was an interesting biography about an accomplished General, Congressman and President. Peskin has done a great job of discussing both the military and civilian accomplishments of this great man. The book is usually entertaining and informative; however, at times it becomes a bit dry. Moreover, I wish Peskin would have spent more pages on the academical accomplishments of this one time professor. An interesting read for persons interested in post-reconstructionist United States."},{"Title":"Garfield: A biography (The Library of the presidents)","review":"If you are looking strictly for facts about James Garfield, this is a good book on a President in which little is known or written about. This deals with his religious upbringing, Civil War experience, and his political career. As I was reading I always anticipated the author was leading me to the climax of the situation, but I found myself only stumbling into more tedious facts about Garfield. For example, there are a few references to Garfield being a strong backer of our money being linked to the gold standard. I was anticipating the book leading me into insight as to why Garfield felt so strongly about this and commentary he made concerning this. But the author doesn't delve into it."},{"Title":"Garfield: A biography (The Library of the presidents)","review":"James Garfield's Presidency, like many of his predecessors and successors after Abraham Lincoln, and before Theodore Roosevelt's is shrouded in obscurity. His was brief, and tragic. As the author, Mark Peskin, bemoans at the end of the book, it is difficult to remember that period of history as to who was bearded, and who bewhiskered.Mark Peskin has undertaken what has to be called the definitive biography of our 20th President. This is a classic biography, tracing Garfield's roots, childhood, political ascension and wartime contributions. He does not fall in love with his subject, and paints a seemingly objective portrait of the man's life.Garfield was a decent man, yet it is easy to judge him against today's standards, where the treatment of blacks as anything but equals is odious. Society's standards were not the same in the 1870's and 1880's, and even Garfield's pro-Reconstruction stance can be looked at character weakness.Garfield does not deserve the obscurity he swathed in. He was a central figure in Congress for almost twenty years, a conduit for many of the central issues of the day, and a tireless worker to pass laws and budgets through Congress. His Presidential legacy is slim, because of his brief term in office, but there are indications of both potential greatness, or potential weakness. We will never know.The book itself is fast moving, despite it's 600 plus pages. Like many biographies of 19th century american figures, it is colored with meloncholy. Life was difficult in those times. Garfield lost two children, and his day to day life, including his brief Presidency was often monotonous. The central characters, or \\"friends\\" are often devious, such as James Blaine, or self-serving. His enemies, such as Roscoe Conkling, are worse. Even Chester Arthur, his running mate, is portrayed as being two-faced.Garfield's death, even at a distance of over 130 years, is horrifying. Such were the times.Yet, Peskin has done American History a service with this biography. It is a must read for anyone wanting to learn about our Presidents."},{"Title":"Garfield: A biography (The Library of the presidents)","review":"Book is a bit daunting and dry in some areas. However, it can not be more thorough, well written, and informative. All 600 some pages are packed with information on this interesting lad from a small corner in Ohio. Garfield is a dynamic influence before he war, during the war, and reconstruction. Despite some mishandling at the beginning of his presidency he might have turned out to be one of the better ones. Its a shame we know Lincoln's and JFK's assassins but not Garfield's and Garfield's killer may be more interesting as outlined in Peskin's book. Truly is a must have to any presidential library and civil war libraries. I'm reading a book on every president and this one is in the top 10 at least."},{"Title":"Garfield: A biography (The Library of the presidents)","review":"I found this Presidential biography to be very honestly written...meaning that it did not overly praise the former Chief-Executive and it really opened his life up and showed his mistakes and his poor character traits as equally as it showed his good qualities and his political abilities. I do recommend it since it really explains the importance of Garfield's political life and short Presidency and it covers the assassination fairly well. I did read an additional book on the assassination that delved more into Guiteau, the assassin. I recommend doing that to get better insight into Guiteau's madness because this biography does not strongly focus on Guiteau so much."},{"Title":"Garfield: A biography (The Library of the presidents)","review":"Slowly making my way through biographies of all the presidents.

I am used to Illustrator, and this book really helped me tie all the programs together. The projects are easy to do, but challenging enough to keep up your interest. They also build up your skill level so you increase your capabilities as you work in the programs.The book is divided into three sections - one for each of the programs - and projects from one program are used in the other programs. There's just enough difference between the program interfaces to confuse you, but Ms. Evans has done an excellent job in clarifying them.I especially enjoyed the rotating fishing lure exersize in the Flash section. I've wanted to do that effect for a long time, and her explanation got me through quickly and easily.All in all, the book really will help you if you are putting up a website and haven't done a lot of graphic work before. The integration of these three programs is important, and the author did an excellent job in teaching. I recommend it heartily!"},{"Title":"Integrating Flash, Fireworks, and FreeHand f/x & Design: Solutions for Web design workflow","review":"I must say I was pleasantly surprised with this book. I actually learned a ton more than expected which is unusual for a book not meant to teach all 3 programs. It is certainly at an intermediate level as stated which is also a refreshing surprise.The Fireworks section is quite extensive since all the examples rightfully are designed in or a major part of them are designed in Fireworks where they are then cut up, interactivity added (except for the Flash examples) and then exported.The FreeHand section deals with primarily the tools that differ from Fireworks and things like perspecive, contour blends and bleneding. The blending feature allows you to do a shape tween type of effect and then use it in Fireworks for animation. Then there is extensive tips and tricks for preparing FreeHand files for use in Flash.The Flash section is great fun and extremely useful. The entire section deals with ActionScripting projects, the author doesn't try to teach you Flash but useful ways to use it in conjunction to the other two programs. The projects such as the puzzle teaches more than it may appear on the surface. Sure, you may not need a puzzle, but it was a great way to demonstrate how to load movies that replace prior ones versus loading movies to a new level. This is just one example. There is also a jukebox that has four pieces of music (included) that uses a trick to load very quickly. A product display that rotates a full 360 degrees, a banner ad that allows you to print a brochure from within Flash and a banner ad that uses the color feature of Flash. There are more projects in this section.Even though Dreamweaver isn't in the title of this book, it wasn't left out of the mix. There is an Appendix which takes an entire Fireworks design and places the images in DW and adds the behaviors, CSS Style Sheets in DW. There is also a section on adding FW pop-up menus in DW.There are some great contributors that added value to this book as well. What I liked is they added VALUE not just their names. For instance, Hillman Curtis did a nice introductory piece on, &quot;Motion is the Message&quot; imparting some of his wisdom to us. There is also an entire interface given to us from Eyeland Studio that we can use and modify (with instructions on how)and banner ads from Figleaf Software.All in all, I don't think you'll be disapointed in this book. I walked away with much more than I expected. This review took much longer to do than anticipated because the book is almost 500 pages (480) and is packed. Not only did I learn the strong points of each program but how to work more efficiently as well."},{"Title":"Solaris 7 Performance Administration Tools","review":"Solaris 7 Performance Administration Tools is by far one of the best books that I have found on performance tuning under Solaris. While it isn't as complete and readable as Accelerating AIX, it is the best book on the topic for Solaris. Frank Cervone spends a great deal of time discussing a number of important issues from capacity planning to optimizing RAID and hard drives. I have found the book indispensable for my job.If you are a person who tends to read technical books from cover to cover you will find that a great deal of time is spent with theory. Mr. Cervone spends many pages discussing every topic theoretically, and even gives good descriptions of useful command flags and what things you should be tuning.The big failure of the book, that I've found, is the lack of examples. For the most part, the books is devoid of this important tool. However, this book is not intended for the beginner. By the time that you get around to using this book you should be able to understand man pages and figuring out how to issue commands based on the archaic writings of Sun engineers (enough of my ranting on Sun man pages). So if you can read man pages you can figure out, based on the book, the commands you need to issue for maximum performance.I highly recommend this book for any professional who uses Solaris daily for their livelihood, although I would hold off purchasing it if you are a novice Solaris admin."},{"Title":"Solaris 7 Performance Administration Tools","review":"My friend at work bought this book.

The self destructive behavior and emotional outbursts that Rachel describes are all to real to me. This is a must for anyone who asks the question, &#34;What was it that I did for her/him to act this way to me?&#34; Rachel Reiland answers that question and many more. This book has allowed me to understand my ex-wife clearer."},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"\\"Borderlines\\" has already become a reviled word in the world of professionals managing clients with BPD, used to describe some of the most challenging clients. The word is starting to percolate in society and become stigmatized. This book highlights the anguish individuals with this illness experience and the projection of this pain that their loved once have to face. Authors honesty about her own thoughts and feelings helps the reader empathize with her, even as they might wonder, how can she not see what she is doing? This book provides insightful information and realistic hope to families and patients of BPD."},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"I had struggled with my adult daughter's hateful outbursts toward me and her apparent inability to cope with everyday life. Her counselor recommended that I read this book. It was like reading a book written about my daughter. It helped me understand her so much better. This book gave me hope and understanding."},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"I bought this on the strength of the other very favourable reviews, seeking to understand more about the condition which my wife has suffered from, seemingly for some years now. As soon as I started reading there were so many similarities between Rachel's story in the book and my wife's story that I was desperate to get to the end of the book as I knew it had a happy ending. Although this is just one woman's story there will be something in this book for anyone who suffers from BPD or the people who love them and wants the inside story. One word of caution - leave the psychiatry to the experts, my wife did not appreciate me telling her that her inner child was acting out."},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"i cant explain how amazing and touching and inspiring this book is nothing else to say, if u have BPD buy this book immediently. it has helped me so much and i know it will help u, i promise."},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"It is so difficult to deal with people who are sick, when I am sick. It is great to read about someone who finds a wayto discover thier illness, espically when part of the illness is to blame other, scream at other, throw things at others. When there is complete denyal about one's participation in illness and wellness, it is most difficult.THis person's story of stumbling into recovery and the help of so many people is nice to read, much better than a fiction novel and there are bit of jems that help me to this day.I am greatful to have stumbled onto this book and reading it was a pleasure and enlightneing.Now I AM ALL BETTER, and it really is EVERYONE ELSE Fault (Just kidding)."},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"Instead He Sent Me Angels...: I prayed for deathI first read Rachel Reiland's book a few months after I was diagnosed with BPD. Her story gave me such hope! Whenever I felt like giving up, I would go back to her book and her words would speak straight to my heart. I was deep into the self-injury aspect of the disorder; including, but not limited to, cutting. As I went through therapy, I would continually refer back to Rachel's book. I had pages marked and passages highlighted. In a sense, her book became my bible. \\"Get Me Out of Here\\" is definitely a must-read for those who either suffer from BPD or KNOW someone who does. Rachel's book gave me the courage and desire to not only get well, but to write my own story once recovery was complete. It's with a grateful heart that I thank Rachel for sharing such a personal journey."},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"Rachel Reiland's Get Me Out Of Here is a very challenging read. Rachel seemingly leads us through every minute and nuanced detail of her arduous recovery from (what is still commonly referred to as) borderline personality disorder (BPD). It appears that she spares the reader very little, hence a page-count which invites committed participation in a very unsettling story.A particular aspect of this book that does not sit comfortably with me is the way Rachel Reiland (not actually her real name) is so gushing in her praise of the health care services which assist in her recovery. She singles out her therapist, Dr Padgett, for almost unconditional acclaim. It would certainly appear that the services and practitioners are indeed deserving of credit - they have, after all, helped Rachel to overcome a seriously limiting condition and enabled her to live a much fuller life. But it also seems to me that there are ways in which the care provided is less than helpful.Rachel's periods as an in-patient in a psychiatric unit are especially unsettling. It is, in fact, a relatively common-place situation that leads to her initial admission: she succumbs to the stress of keeping house and caring for her demanding young children - essentially, she \\"loses it.\\" But the unit is hardly an understanding and compassionate environment.The bulk of the book, however, focuses on the out-patient therapeutic relationship between Rachel and Dr Padgett. Padgett (the Medical Director of Psychiatry at the unit) offers Rachel very frequent psychoanalytic therapy sessions over a considerable period. Rachel exhibits alternating attitudes to Padgett; one minute she idolizes him, and the next she loathes him (this is portrayed as classic BPD behavior). But from the very start she appears to be unhealthily dependent on him, and he almost seems to encourage this dependence - not that she ever criticizes him for that.As a reader involved in the unfolding story, I found myself increasingly ambivalent about Padgett. On the one hand, he is the key figure in Rachel's recovery, the one who makes it all possible. But on the other, he comes over as the one calling the shots in an extremely unequal relationship. It seems to me that Padgett enables Rachel's recovery, not by working in partnership with her, but by demanding that she yield to his will and superior status.Get Me Out Of Here is, of course, a positive book. The fact is, Rachel recovers, and in doing so she offers hope to other sufferers of the same condition. I can't help wondering, however, if she would have recovered just as well - if not better - if she'd had a therapist using a different and more collaborative approach. Rachel, however, is perfectly satisfied with the approach taken by Dr Padgett, and she, after all, is the one best placed to judge."},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"An excellent read - hard to put down. Inspirational because of the efforts of the author to cope with her illness."},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"very relatable for those who are or have a family or friend with borderline or even borderline tendencies. provides hope."},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"Rachel Reiland was suffering from a severe case of Borderline Personality Disorder. When she reached a point where her life was falling apart, she could easily have committed suicide. Instead she got the help she needed. Even making the choice to get help is very difficult for someone with mental illness. The treatment was intensive and lasted for three years. Rachel was fortunate that she had a strong marriage, a wonderful husband, and an outstanding therapist. Her therapist was loving and compassionate and very skilled. He acted as a surrogate father to Rachel and helped her understand what had gone wrong in her life and what she needed to do to heal. He was there for her unconditionally, though he set firm boundaries that she needed. In the end, though, Rachel could not have gotten well without her willingness to walk into the unknown and deal with the pain of recovery.The story is honest and detailed and is mostly a recounting of Rachel's therapy sessions. Though it bogged down in a few places through repetition, overall Get Me Out of Here is a fascinating look at the therapeutic process.Mental illness is no picnic. The fact that Ms. Reiland recovered through her hard work and her determination gives hope to other sufferers of BPD."},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"I highly recommend this book, it is a great story and her will power to recover is very touching. I had to cry at least a couple of times while reading it. There are some psychology intellectual concepts which can be understood on the practical level with this book, as the concepts are explained within the lines of the story being told.The woman in the story was very wounded for sure, but she didn't necessarily had an actual borderline personality disorder per se. Some of us are more wounded than others, but we can still relate to each other for the suffering and struggle that our wounds bring us. I think this book is very helpful for people in general and not necessarily for people who are exclusively labeled with a particular personality disorder.The process of being loved unconditionally for who Rachel is, is amazingly portrayed in this book. It is like a process of re-parenting which finally allows her to heal. The therapist is also firm when he calls out Rachel's negative behavior. After all, it is still a re-parenting healing process.I loved the book, it is definitely one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"This book was very well written and accurate about an individual diagnosed borderline personality disorder. It was really nice knowing someone else has gone through what I have gone through and that it was a real person. I look forward to reading more books dealing with real people who are diagnosed with a mental illness"},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"This book provides hope not just for people with BPD and their families but also for those who suffer from other mental illness. The insights and honesty with regards to the authors feelings and therapy and pain and behavior is truly a gift and a blessing. This author is very articulate and the book is a compelling read. While it can be triggering, if a person who is suffering from mental illness reads it in its entirety rather than stopping at the triggering moments, I believe it can be very helpful. It can bring up a lot of stuff though so it is good to have a great support system around if you choose to read it.Thank you \\"rachel\\" and thank you \\"dr. padgett\\" for taking this journey to wellness. And thank you \\"rachel\\" for your candor and honesty. I don't think I have ever read a book that has touched me so much and has given me such hope. It is definitely your gift to the world.UPDATE: I allowed my teen daughter to read this. She is suffering from PTSD and has borderline traits. She is psychologically sophisticated and can understand the topic. She is in therapy herself. With those things in mind, it has turned out to be a great thing for her. It has given her hope, given her courage to face her own inner demons in therapy, helped her to feel not so bad about herself for feeling the way she does, etc. So, depending on your child and your situation, and their treatment, this could be helpful to their treatment. You could always let the therapist read it to get their opinion.UPDATE 1/8/10: I have bought this for 2 of my friends and they have also both found it extremely helpful and hopeful. 1 of the friends was diagnosed with BPD and the other was dealing with general anxiety and depression. They both felt that the book gave them insight as well and an anchor to turn to when things got desperate for them--because this woman had a difficult journey and was painfully honest and came through it empowered."},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"This is a brilliant book for those with BPD and those that love and support them.

It's gripping, moving, well written, and a great source of hope and inspiration.It must have taken an incredible amount of courage to write a book like this. Rachel doesn't shy away from showing the uglier sides of borderline personality disorder, and many reviewers have dismissed her as a \\"spoiled brat\\". However, I was impressed by her strength and determination in overcoming her problems, and her guts in sharing her story to help others.One thing that struck me when I read the book was Rachel's financial situation. From previous reviews, and from the knowledge she had psychoanalysis three times a week, I had assumed she must be a very rich woman who could afford to see her therapist as often as she wanted. This turned out not to be the case at all. In order to pay for her therapy, Rachel had to accept handouts from family members who'd abused her, get into debt, and at one point make a deal with her psychiatrist where she cut back on sessions and he lowered his rates. I think it was this resolve to get the help she needed and pay for it however she could that allowed Rachel to recover, where many others would have given up.I have just discussed Get Me Out of Here with a friend who has BPD, and who read the book herself a few years ago. She told me it was Rachel's memoir that encouraged her to get back into work, so that she would be able to afford to choose her treatment. She is now seeing a private therapist and well on the way to recovery.I would recommend this book as a source of hope and insight to anyone who has BPD, and as a source of understanding to anyone who doesn't.

I want to have Rachel as a friend. Her honesty literally saved me because I had so many \\"hidden\\" secrets that I dared not bring up to my therapist-nor anyone else for that matter, and couragous Rachel went there and bravely talked about those same feelings.

I cannot put it down. I thought I was living with two borderlines but after reading this book and the extent of her mental illness and how these people can still function and work is amazing. I know now that my two family members are only mildly afflicted. (Father and Daughter). This woman is full blown and I don't know how her family and her psychiatrist could jump into her tornado with her and ride it out when the tornado always comes back. I think she could have been alittle more self disciplined and tried to control some of this bad behavior, it sounded more like she was a spoiled two year old than an adult. I have read two other books on borderlines and Rachel's case is the most severe yet. Her husband should have removed her children from this toxic environment and left her in the institution until they had her psychosis under control. All in all I do recommend this book but this woman had a more severe case than any I have heard of."},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"Terrible- a long whining expose of poor-poor Rachel's BPD.

I can only dream of getting all the help I need and can't get away with the things she does.

By the end of the book, I honestly wanted her husband to leave her (with her poor kids)and for her therapist to call the cops.

It is not always a pleasant place to visit, it can be very painful. I would assume that most people who would choose this book do so because of some personal connection to BPD. To watch Rachel and her family struggle through her illness and recovery can touch 'almost' too close to home. But, you find yourself hoping for them all.Rachel is a storyteller, and this book is written in a beautiful and very readable style. The clinical information that is presented as part of the story is palatable because it is so well ingrained into the actual storyl.Someday soon I am going to take the time to write a long letter to Rachel Reiland, and to Randi Kreger (&quot;Stop Walking on Eggshells.&quot;} These two women have put a tremendous amount of time and energy into giving us all a better understanding of Borderline Personality Disorder.If you've taken the time to read this review, then I strongly suggest you read Ms Reiland's book.

Do you people know what its like to have something you never asked for? She was abused!! The fact that she lashed out at others doesn't make it right, its a reality. And if someone had helped when she was growing up, she would not have any problems. This book is painfully real, obviously detailed accounts. It takes a courageous woman to face her demons. I have been abused horribly, in my childhood and adult years, and nothing upsets me more that to hear someone say \\"She's got PROBLEMS!\\" duh you think??? Rachel goes a long way to show how bad it can get before it gets better and I applaud her for sure. Mental illness is a ILLNESS and I think people forget that. This book is a 10 star in my review.

I had read the \\"self help\\" books and the books that tell the symptoms accurately, and in depth, but what I wanted this time was a book written by someone like me, in hopes of feeling less alone. When I was reading the reviews for this book, I found many of them that said the book was \\"inspirational\\" and everything like that, and then I read reviews that said it was \\"simplistic\\" and \\"reiterated points over and over\\", and I wasn't sure if I should even bother.After getting the book for free, I decided there was no reason not to at least read it.The book starts off as described by negative reviews: simplistic. Symptoms of borderline that everyone with borderline sees in themselves were laid out in plain language and not presented in any way that can't be found in the vast \\"self help\\" books. At this point, I started to become disappointed and afraid that the book was going to be a waste of time.As the book progresses, Rachel becomes worse, she finds herself, although in recovery, lashing out in ways she never imagined and hurting everyone around her. There were times that I read the book and I found myself hating her, and worse, I hated myself.And then, as Rachel finds herself becoming sucked in to the depths of her disorder, and getting out of control, layers and layers of broken coping mechanisms that had appeared nothing more than abusive, manipulative and selfish reveal the true nature of the borderline personality: never ending fear of being forever alone and unlovable.It was at this point that the mere presentation of common symptoms became much more: as Rachel begins to understand herself, the symptoms are shown to the reader as more than dysfunctional coping mechanisms: they are given a sense of humanity and drive and begin to show the motives of nothing more than a terrified, humiliated child, reaching out to be unconditionally loved.This was when I realized that the progression of the book was perfect: the book begins, as described, very simplistic, as Rachel doesn't understand herself and only sees destructive behaviors that she can't make sense of. And then eventually the complexity of the book becomes overwhelming, as Rachel sees her inner most feelings and tries to cope.This book, to be blatant, could not be fully appreciated by someone who has not personally felt what it is like to live with borderline personality disorder. To someone on the outside: it is just a case of a psychotic woman who finds treatment and recovers. To someone with borderline: it is a chilling account of their very own life, innermost fears worked through by complete strangers.There are so many things in this book that are revolutionary for me, that trying to sit here and convey them feels almost impossible. Although I read reviews of the book that complain that it is reiterative, and the basis of therapy is nothing more than constantly repeating the same explanation... that is the core of the borderline personality. A persistent need by that person to find love and hold on to it as tightly as possible, and no matter how many broken coping mechanisms they force themselves to work away from, they find themselves with more, different broken coping mechanisms in hopes of achieving the same task.Dr. Padgett presents a therapy technique for Rachel that is so much more than I could have ever imagined experiencing in therapy. He presents the one thing that people with borderline truly need: unconditional love, a feeling of safety, while still experiencing limits and boundaries in the face of their destructive behaviors. Although Rachel becomes painfully aware of how dysfunctional she has become, she is never led to feel by Dr. Padgett as though she is bad or wrong, or that she doesn't deserve to be happy. Without this, I don't believe that her feelings could have been dealt with.The explanation of the book is correct in saying that it is in no way a self help book, and will never lead anyone to recovery. What it offers, instead, is something much more realistic: measurable, achievable results for someone suffering from severe borderline, in turn giving the reader an intense sense of hope. The book shows the many many layers of borderline defenses come crashing down, and never for once is there an unrealistic overnight \\"Aha!\\" where Rachel suddenly feels better, because this is not how it works.As someone who has suffered from borderline for what feels like every waking hour of my entire life, and struggled with therapy and medications to find no answers, this book gives me something to hold on to and helps me believe that I can one day be like Rachel. I hope that many other people with borderline, out of answers, pick up this book and find the strength to continue on."},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"I too suffer from a severe case of Borderline Personality Disorder. And while I am only a teen, I related strongly to Rachel Reiland's feelings and behaviors exhibited in this book. It is a great read both for anyone suffering from BPD and those who would like to understand it more. She really gets you inside her head. It's almost frightening at points but it does have a good ending. This book helped me find hope and also helped me to understand myself much better. I would recommend it to anyone with BPD and anyone wanting to know more."},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"This book shows you the true, strong, feelings and emotions that are involved in borderline personality. It's not psychobable. It's an honest and straightforward picture of what it is like to be borderline. Without giving out the ending, the title does mention recovery; a possibility not always widely recognized in the mental health field. It's a definite, I don't want to put this book down type of book. Thank you to the author for sharing her story."},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"Get Me Out of Here is a brilliantly written book about Rachel Reiland's struggles with Borderline Personality Disorder. Reiland does a great job of verbally expressing the pain and anger that this disorder caused her, as well as helping to explain why she developed the disorder (her childhood experiences). Some may be shocked by the intensity of her anger and outbursts, but one must keep in mind that these outbursts are just a sign of her problems with BPD. She was lucky that she had an understanding husband and a very patient psychiatrist. A lot of patients with this disorder aren't as lucky as she and end up being dumped by either their family or their therapist or both."},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"i am a graduate student in a program of clinical psychology. i picked up this book for pleasure reading.. and to gain more understanding about borderline personality disorder. i thought that the book started out slow, but picked up very quickly. i was impressed with her ability to provide such a raw portrayal of herself, as well as incorporate her observations about her therapist. once i was about half way through the book, i was hooked all the way till the end. she provides a great portayal of her journey through her therapeautic process, and really highlighted key stages in therapy, such as the termination process. i thought the book was great and would highly recommend it to anyone trying to understand more about borderline personality disorder and the therapeutic process."},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"I am a BPD (male, 28), and I must first say that I came to this book after 3 other BPD books - 3 books that totally disappointed me (I list them at the end of this review). This book was so wonderfully different and touching ! It made me both laugh and cry throughout its course. Unlike \\"guide\\" books that are written by \\"experts\\" and simply list steps to take to supposedly \\"fix\\" BPD, this book was written by someone who actually went through the kind of suffering that we BPDs go through everyday and really understands BPD. It was just what I was looking for !What's great about this book:- The language used is simple and easy to follow, unlike other authors that can't stop using really obscure vocabulary that makes you run to the dictionary every sentence (which can get quite annoying)- The flow from chapter to chapter is natural and intuitive, making it easy for the reader to follow. Also, she doesn't jump wildly back and forth between the past and present, which other books do, and which can be disorienting.- The author found a way to reach out and touch me with her warm (as opposed to cold and satirical) style of writing and describing her life. I was very much able to identify with some of her behaviors. Some passages in this book made me cry quite a bit, and that felt really satisfying. If a book can do that to you - the reader, you know that it has some value to it.What I thought was missing in this book:- As some other reviewers pointed out, it would have been great if she could have explained or analyzed, in a bit more detail, how the therapy helped her actually recover long-term.Bottom line: A great book and a must read for BPDs (even male BPDs like me !)Other books I read prior to this one: Lost in the mirror (Moskovitz), Girl interrupted (Kaysen), and Sometimes I act crazy (Straus & Kreisman)"},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"Exceptionally well written account of Rachel's life experiences with bpd. I could relate, at times I felt like she was writing my story. I came out of this feeling like there is still hope for me. Thank you Rachel."},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"This book has given me breakthrough understanding of what my sister is experiencing! I am hoping she will agree to read it to gain insight and hopefully recognize the diagnosis of BPD as her own. I now know how to love her better and can encourage her treatment in the hope of a full recovery (or at least improvement). Thank you Rachel Reiland for baring your soul."},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"I very much enjoyed \\"Rachel's\\" account of her life and recovery; I found I couldn't put the book down. She does a good job explaining the feelings and thought patterns behind her \\"crazy\\" behaviors. The book flows very well, too. There aren't any huge gaps without some kind of transitionary explanation. I've noticed in some other borderline memoirs, there can be huge jumps, as if the book were simply a collection of short stories of the author's life. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in Borderline Personality Disorder or psychology in general--probably at least 14-16 years old, though, as there is swearing and dealings with sexuality.I only wish the author had not masked her psychiatrist's identity. He seems no stranger to Borderline Personality Disorder, and I find myself in need of consultation for it. It seems difficult to locate professionals who are very familiar with it."},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"I am a social worker who currently does DBT with individuals diagnosed with BPD. I came across this book on Amazon trying to find some personalized success stories of BPD. This book is just that! It explores the reasons for the diagnosis, the individuals \\"ourbursts\\" and typical borderline behavior, and how her therapist deals with it and helps her gain insight to her illness. Definitely worth reading for anyone who has BPD, treats BPD, or even knows someone with BPD! BPD individuals can be difficult to work with at times, but this book shows that through perseverance, anything is possible."},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"Best book on BPD; at least until my wife finishes her treatment and converts her blog into a book:)If you think you have BPD, you will be captivated by her writing and heart wrenching pain.healingfrombpd.blogspot . com"},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"This book describes every BPD I have ever worked with.

It has enabled me to have a better understanding and to see more clearly what's really going on when an episode begins. I am much more aware of using S.E.T. I read this book in three days and I know I will read it again before I go back to S.W.O.E. again. I think this book should be a must read for any partner or relative of someone with BPD."},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"I really enjoyed this book. The story is a very touching and moving one. I feel as if I had gone through the inspiring and at times heartbreaking journey with the author. I didn't think psychiatrists such as hers exist. If they really do, then anybody would be truly blessed to be their patient. The author is very lucky to have had the support system that she did, so we need to keep in mind that her story is an exception, not the norm. But nevertheless, I gained a lot of insight into this condition, and also into the 'human condition' in general. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"The author does a beautiful job taking the reader through her experiences! I cried tears of sadness, pain, joy and triumph all from this beautifully written memoir. Her book is so well written that I believe anyone, whether or not directly affected by BPD, can relate to her struggles and gain strength, courage, and inspiration in his/her own life journey."},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"I listened to this book, got it free from audible actually, & all I say is: What a draining waste of time!Look, I've been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder so I know exactly what it's like. The thing that really bothers me about the book is that she just tells you the facts about what happened to her. Wonderful. Yet, listening to it...I feel like she's not honest with herself or doesn't take the time to admit or explain how annoyingly draining it is to be so self-loathing & have it take up all your time while going through mood-swings because of thought splitting or what they call \\"black & white thinking\\". -Sigh-I'm gonna be honest with you & say I've only heard 3 chapters & I could say I've got through anxiety just listening to it. It's not such a fun experience to listen to her talk about her destructive ways. In fact, it's a bit nail biting to know & recognize similarities in behaviors. Maybe coming from a self-loathing mind myself, it was just too much energy to take in all the fussiness that she had to go through to recover. I can't leave her without any credit at all... I mean, she's brave to share her story but you learn very early on in the first chapter alone that she's not such a pleasant person either. It's purely her lack of ethics & just plain rage -against others- that leaves me at a lack of sympathy at times. But what should you take from me...I'm a complete hypocrite for criticizing her mood swings & fits of rage because I too, experience them.The only thing -majorly- different is that I try to not take it out on others who really don't deserve it. I can't empathize no matter how hard I try. I'm too kind to comprehend why she acts the way she does to others. That's something about our mental illness that we need to take into account & put ourselves in check with because others come first. At least for me, it's always been that way. Maybe that's why I'm so isolated now. Borderline is a rough disease. I'm going to give it a chance & keep reading.I'll keep you updated."},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"It's not fair to say this book started out great and lost momentum as others have. It's not a novel that builds to a climax. It's about a courageous woman's recovery from perhaps, the worst mental illnes one may have and still be able to function at the most basic level. At times, even that's not possible. If it seems to lose momentum, it is perhaps because Rachel is morphing into a normal person through it's course, and being saddened by the realization that you will eventually part ways w/ your rock and therapist doesn't grab the reader's attention like a 6-yr old masturbating in her bed out of the urge to urinate or urinating in the bed, as an adult. The latter being events that took place in the earlier stages of recovery. I must refute, however, the portrayal of her therapist as someone who refused to give up on Rachel. At $120/session, in the mid 90's, I wouldn't give up on my patient either, though he did play the most significant role in her recovery. If like me, you're married to someone who suffers from BPD, let this book be the yellow brick road that guides you through Oz. Rachel exposes the well-concealed thoughts and perceptions in your BP's mind and unmasks the face that so often, leads you to feel that it is you, and not your BP that brought the two of you to her strange and scary world. Whenever I'm hurt by my BP, I read this book that helps me to truely understand what's going on w/ my wife, and that behind the vulgar, raging facade, is a woman who truely loves her family, humanity and struggles just to get through everyday and grow as a good person."},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"\\"Get Me Out of Here\\" was a big letdown for me. Memoirs on mental illness tend to make for interesting, and gratifyingly perplexing reads, yet Reiland's account of a generally interesting disorder is rather like a whitewater rafting trip done in a stagnant bog.The length is probably the largest fault with this book. Perhaps as a psychotherapy patient, Reiland felt uninhibited in jotting down EVERY-FRIGGIN-THING in her life. Dr. Padgett (Reiland's shrink) may have encouraged such boundlessness. I as a reader found it painfully dull. If you like going to Phish concerts which go on for eternal lengths of time, this book may be up your alley. Me, I wanted to go to the garage for a pair of pruning sheers to snip out almost half of this book.I also hate to be the one to say this, but Reiland's writing is completely unoriginal and flat. Locating metaphors and, jaw dropping, emotion evoking creative language in this book is like panning for gold in Florida. Little bounty is yielded.Strangely enough, for somebody who suffers from borderline personality disorder (a disorder whose major staple is marked by unpredictable behavior), Reiland's writing quickly falls into an easily mappable, redundant pattern. Here's a hint: When Reiland goes to see Dr. Padgett, whatever she expects him to say ends up being the opposite of what he really does say. Reiland gets pissed at Padgett, curses him off, leaves the session, then, while at home, feels sorry about her outburst, calls him back to apologize (which quickly turns into another cursing orgy over the phone). Lather, Rinse, Repeat. Lather, Rinse, Repeat...I do give Reiland credit for bravery. I admire this woman for letting her story be known to the whole world. Not too many people would admit to chronically wetting the bed as full grown adults (not to mention the horrid childhood she experienced, which I'm not going to touch upon here). Reiland really does have alot of guts for allowing her demons to be known to all in order to help others suffering from BPD. For this sole reason, I bolster the rating up to two stars (the extra star is more a statement of my thoughts about Reiland herself, than it is her book, which I still see as one star).There are better memoirs in the literary world which deal with similar predicaments and tribulations that Reiland underwent. Read them instead."},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"I couldn't put this book down once I began reading it. Rachel's description of her illness, how it affected her and her family, her progress over the years...it brought to mind a member of my family. This is excellent reading and a real eye opener. God bless you, Rachel."},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"This book really draws you into it as you about this young woman's inner struggle. It's hard to believe that some people really have to go through all this.

You get a real sense for what those with BPD go through."},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"I would like to get away from the mental health angle in my review: What struck me most when I received the book (which I then devoured in one sitting), was what an extremely well-written example of autobiography it is. Reiland would deserve many more accolades simply as a writer - it seems that limiting her reach to the BPD community is a subtle form of disability discrimination in its own right, in that a hugely talented writer remains somewhat ghetto-ized by her subject matter. If she had published the exact same book and declared it &#34;fiction&#34;, it would probably have won a string of prizes by now.A deeply engaging story of triumph over adversity, and deserving of a wide readership."},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"Love this book. It provides a real-life glimpse into this disorder. She does a great job explaining the emotions involved."},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"This book is amazingly honest and well-written. The author doesn't hold back about her experience with bpd. The story takes you to dark places, but it ends on a hopeful note.Highly recommend!"},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"A very real, raw and powerful account of living with Borderline Personality Disorder. It is extremely difficult for those who do not have the experience to truly understand the overwhelming hopelessness and utter despair when caught-up in the cycle. It is books like these that offer a glimpse into the dark nights of the soul of those who suffer. The labels are one thing, living it is something completely different. My gratitude to Rachel for her honest recount and my hope is that there will be more compassion and understanding for a mental state that is yet to be fully understood moreover, properly treated. The lesson for us all, let us not judge another until we have walked in his shoes and by then... we will have touched the deepest part of our humanity."},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"A lot of past pain in my life was unearthed from this book. Which, in my mind, is a good thing. I felt her anger, and inner turmoil. I lived it and understood it. I could only read sections at a time - I felt the emotions so deeply! I would then bring my new-realized emotions to my therapists office, then start to heal. Some of the feelings were so intense, they shook me. I have a done a lot of soul searching, read many books on borderline and bipolar,and have come to a realization on what makes me who I am, and what makes me tick. I'm not saying this book was 'therapy' for me - - I have a therapist, and I journal EXTENSIVELY (just like Rachel). This is the only book I have read that takes the reader through each and every single thought and emotion she had on a daily basis. It blew my mind. She is so intense. I have notes all over my book. I really wish I could meet her!!!! I wonder if she is doing any book signings?"},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"I love this book. As someone who has been diagnosed with BPD it is so hard finding books on what the person is going through firsthand. Most books offer support for those around the person with the mental illness and do not offer a true experience as to what the BPD patient is feeling. Granted, every person with BPD is going to react differently to different situations. This book has offered me hope that yes, one day I will get better. It's hard finding the right therapist, and I wish we could all get so lucky like the author did with \\"Dr. Padgett\\", who gave so much patience, and so much opportunity, to let her regain control of her life and feel what it is like to be a normal person. A lot of therapists refuse to treat people with BPD because of how hard it is to deal with the person (I've been through 7 myself). They often give up, or aren't willing to help the patient, and I don't blame them. It is a lot of work! I would definitely make this a \\"must read\\" because this book really effected me, and I got to see how hurtful a person with BPD can be to those around them. The only thing I did not like about the book was the language. Don't get me wrong I do swear and curse.. but not as excessively as the author.**side note** I also recommend speaking with your therapist before reading the book because of reactions it may cause with some."},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"While reading this book, I realized that I had experienced so many of the same things the author experienced. After 8 years of therapy, I realized along with my diagnosis of PTSD, I also suffer from BPD. \\"Get Me Out Of Here\\" helped me face some of my own issues and has helped me open up new dialogue with my therapist so that I can heal too. I encourage anyone who suffers from BPD to read this book. I am on the road to recovery and consider this book to be a turning point in my own recovery. Thank you, Rachel Reiland, for your honesty and willingness to share your experience."},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"&quot;I'm Not Supposed to Be Here&quot; is an excellent read. A very confronting read too - since it not only validates my own experiences of the relationship with my Borderline Ex, but more frighteningly Rachel's story explains how emotional abuse, lack of parental care and the ensuing cover-up campaigns cause so much harm to a child. It is horrifying to see the effects which reach so far into adulthood.I have a son and his BP mother has sole custody. It is frightening to read parts of Rachel's story in this respect.Maybe Rachel's book should become required reading for relationship councillors, mental health professionals and those involved in child custody decisions.What I found especially useful was reading how Rachel's psychiatrist handled the acting out behavior. The firm responses from the psychiatrist in the face of intense provocation served as a valuable example in helping me protect myself during such potentially endless conversations and no-win situations.Not only is this a book about BPD, it is a story of one woman's tremendous inner strength and, above all, honesty. It is incredibly readable and difficult to put down. This book is a must read for any BP or Non."},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"I thoughly enjoyed the first-person account of recovering from Borderline Personality Disorder. Rachel Reiland is a truly talented author who happened to suffer from this form of mental illness. If you have been recently diagnoised or have a loved-one who has been diagnoised with BPD, and you want to know what it is truly like to suffer with BPD... You NEED this book! I can not say enough about how much it helped me to understand this disorder. Furthermore... it's a page turner...I could hardly put it down!"},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"This book touched me where no book has ever donw before... it changed my life and i think everyone should read it, because it applies to everyone with problems. What none of us realize is that borderline personality disorder is a much more common problem that any of us percieve it to be. Borderline Personality Disorder is just a name for a much deeper issue dealing with one's childhood that causes them to act the way they are. This is your neighbor that screams at her kids, this is your mailman who hates his job, this is you parents that you fail to understand, this is you and almost everyone around you. Everyone needs to read this book, once again, I'll repeat, it changed my life."},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"This is a very hopeful story for anyone who either knows someone who is plagued by mental illness or may be dealing with it themselves. Rachel, with the help of a very competent therapist, is able to change the distorted way she thinks about and reacts to things, and is transformed from a self destructive person who hurts herself and those closest to her as she lashes out during her emotional storms, to someone who has ups and downs that are manageable, someone who is no longer out of control. It is very encouraging to see that someone as ill as the protagonist of this story is, who is ill enough to be hospitalized three times within a year or so, and who needs heavy duty psychiatric medications to control her emotional outbursts, can be healed. That to me is the strength of this story. It shows the ability of the human brain to change. The book shows how one person was able to change her brain (and thus, her life) with motivation, a lot of support from an extremely tolerant and patient husband, a skilled psychiatrist, and time.The sessions with the therapist are very detailed and give a great insider view of what it is like to struggle with the illness of borderline personality disorder. And if one is not familiar with freudian therapeutic techniques, this story provides some useful, basic information, such as the therapist's role as a *blank screen*, which is an idea I was not familiar with and found interesting.I would have to say that I would have liked to have learned more about Rachel's life outside of the the therapist's office. Toward the end of the book, the author does talk more about her relationships with her family and friends, and her spiritual journey, and I enjoyed that part of the book a bit more than the rest of it. The first two thirds of the book is pretty focused on the relationship between her and her therapist. I would have liked to have more information about her early childhood. It was left somewhat vague as to what exactly happened there, perhaps to protect family members. I also would have liked to have heard more from the husband's point of view. And I would have liked more detail about how her relationship with her children was transformed.All, in all, although it is not a literary masterpiece, it was a book I learned a lot from, and as I said before, it is a story of a journey which can give hope to others. It makes me wish that everyone who was suffering from issues like these could find the support they need to get better."},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"Rachel Reiland's book is a heart-wrenching account of a misunderstood mental disorder. Several months ago I attempted to read it, and put it down after 50 pages, dismissing it, saying, \\"that's not me!\\" Then, a few weeks ago, I picked it up and read the additional 400 pages in 2 days and was glued, because I did identify with it. From the hysteria to the \\"tough-girl\\" attitude to cover up the pain, the endless therapy, the angry outbursts; it was too close for comfort. I had read a few reviews that insisted that the therapy sessions were too long and laborious for the readers to endure, but as a person suffering from this disorder, the therapy is laborious, mainly because of the denial and the pain we have to uncover. I started to highlight a few points and gave up because I began to identify with so much of her experience. Thankfully, I had a therapist, like hers, who was an \\"angel\\"; patient and tolerant. I strongly recommend this book to people who suffer from this frightening and frustrating illness and to the families and friends who stand by us. Although the medical profession still stigmatizes us and says we are hopeless, positive examples like Rachel's reminds us that with a lot of hard work and understanding, we can recover and lead fairly normal lives. The work never really ends, but at least we have tools to cope.A+++++!!!"},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"I just finished reading Rachel Reiland's book, Get Me Out of Here....I found the book to be very informative, emotionally packed and filled with real-life BPD drama. Rachel and her psychiatrist have a truly one in a million relationship. He is wonderful to her, helpful but won't let her play her games in therapy. Rachel comes a long way from the little girl with the rich family...having a crisis in her life which leads to hospitalization and the providence of having Dr. Padgett for a therapist. He cares alot but also knows how to work with BPD. This young woman is truly more than a survivor. She enters the black hole of her life now named Borderline personality disorder and comes out the other end in the sunshine really ready to live life to its fullest for the first time. The support from her husband and children is wonderful. Where are the other Dr. Padgetts in the world of psychiatry? I cried at the end I was so happy for her but not only that...it gives me hope for my own daughter who was just diagnosed."},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"When I first started reading this book, I could barely stand the author. As other reviewers will attest to, her behavior left little to be desired. I cringed as I read through the author's manipulative, selfish, whiney, and all out childish antics. Meanwhile I appreciated the fact that she didn't pull away from the harsh reality of her Borderline Personality Disorder. The author just doesn't focus on her own pain and suffering, but the pain and suffering she caused others as well. It would have been easy to tone down or rationalize her behavior, but we see it laid out in all its ugliness.I would recommend this book for those with BPD and/or their relatives and partners. Note that this is not a self-help or how-to book. This is merely a memoir providing a point of view from someone suffering from Borderline Personality Disorder and their thought process as they underwent therapy. It's simply providing you a window into someone you might know or a voice that you can finally relate to. You're probably not going to find answers to your own treatment per se.If this had been any other memoir I might have given it a lower rating. I found the writing style to be adequate; nothing special. It's also difficult to turn four years of therapy into a gripping page-turner. As a result the book does tend to drag on. Despite these flaws it's still a helpful and worthwhile read to those affected by BPD. For everyone else I would skip it for more entertaining fair."},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"This book is great from the beginning to the end. As I read through the book I had various emotions from sadness & tears to laughter & joy. Anyone who is living with BPD or has a family member dealing with this disorder will find this book very insightful. It is not a self-help, medical read but of one's personal struggle with BPD. I speak from someone who is dealing with it personally and could relate to many of the issues that the author dealt with. My heart goes out to everyone who is living with this disorder as it can be very difficult and overwhelming at times."},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"Diagnosed several years ago with Bipolar/PTSD, I was given the diagnosis of Borderline Personality Disorder about a year and half ago. Wanting to know anything and everything about this unknown to me illness, I bought Reiland's book. I angrily put it away as I could not and would not believe that I could have BPD and remained in denial for some time. Having been in weekly therapy for a year and half, I am thankfully making progress towards a healthier ME. I opened this book again about a month ago, and could not believe how much of what Reiland wrote resonated with me. I felt like I was learning so much about who I am now and how so much of my younger years contributed to my actions and reactions today. Every page was another light bulb going off in my mind....lighting the darkness of the past and explaining it in a way that makes SO MUCH SENSE.Reiland had a truly amazing experience with Dr Padgett as her psychiatrist who helped guide her towards a healthy sense of herself and love for herself that she never had.I am blessed to have found a well trained, caring and patient therapist whom I have given my trust to and who is continually helping me learn how to understand and nagivate my way towards recovery. It can be an extremely painful journey. Reiland's therapy was a very intensive Freudian based treatment. My therapy is more working with Dialectical Behavior (DBT) which has been very positive for me. But, after reading Reiland's book I realize that accepting and understanding the past is critical for of successfully treating BPD.Anyone who has been diagnosed wih BPD or who loves someone with BPD should definitely read this book. It's heartwarming, encouraging, enlightening and honestly, reflects so very well how difficult mental illness can be to live with, but also how much proper therapy can make a huge positive change in someone's life.Thank you thank you Ms. Reiland for sharing your story."},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"I recommend this book to therapists that I work with who are working with clients with these treatment issues, clients themselves and their families. I find that the way that this book is written provides an insight into what BPD actually feels like for the person with the disorder in a way that is understandable and not like reading a text book. My clients are able to relate to her and to obtain hope and validation from her discussion of the process of her life and her therapy. Thank you very much to the author for giving me and my clients/associates this resource."},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"As a licensed counselor, I know that I never received information like this book in grad school. This is a powerful recounting of Rachel's RECOVERY from BPD. A lot has changed since the time she recounts in this book, but I believe that this book is a rare opportunity to hear first-hand how incredibly difficult it is to experience the ups and downs of BPD. Rachel, if you read these, thank you - we therapists rarely get to hear in such articulate depth how difficult life can be for people affected by the biological, social and psychological precursors that can lead to a diagnosis of Borderline Personality Disorder. This book provides such insight and hope for so many people."},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"This book was a real eye opener. If you know someone who has Borderline personality disorder ( or yourself ) it is fascinating to see how they think and process information. It is a must read for anyone that is affected by this disorder."},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"There's something about reading a first hand account that's different. That's not to say that books written by doctors aren't worth reading, because they can be. But you get this sense of relief when you read a book written by someone else who suffers from the same problems that you do. It makes you realize that you're not alone. Others have felt the same way you do.I found Rachel's story to be honest, heartbreaking at times, but well worth reading. It really hit home, and it gave me hope to read about someone else who has suffered from this and \\"lived to tell the tale\\" so to speak."},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"I cannot put this book down. Tears flow as I read and realize that the things she is saying about her life or me. I finally found someone who actually does and feels the same way I do. There is hope!!!!"},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"Even people who have not been touched by mental illness will enjoy this fascinating, compelling story. Rachel Reiland's honest, insightful recounting of her battle with borderline personality disorder offers a vivid picture of the borderline mind and the devastation it can cause, but also testifies that recovery is possible. Those whose lives are affected by the disorder will find hope in Reiland's courageous story."},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"This book started out great, very interesting. But after about page 200, I was done. There were no new revelations just the day in day out grind of getting better. I understand healing is a long process (she was in therapy for 4 years), but I got bored reading about it. I couldn't read another time about how she lashed out at the doctor or the family and they stuck by her!! The last part of the book I just skimmed. She could have cut out about 200 pages."},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"A of mine relative has bpd. The book has given me a much better understanding of this illness. It is unfortunate that this information hasn't come to the forefront sooner. Some earlier generations swept mental disorders under the rug. I praise the author for sharing her experiences with us. I give the book a ten star rating."},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"I am a substance abuse counselor and work with a lot of people with co-occurring mental illness. This book was recommended by a client. It makes a huge impact on the reader. It gives hope to people who previously have been told they cannot be helped. I have recommended this book to several clients. It is an excellent book for professionals, clients, or anyone who wants to learn about this devastating disease."},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"I picked up this book for both my BPD significant other and for myself. The title was hopeful and uplifting--the read was anything but. It is what it claims to be, minus the HOPE that you would expect to feel after reading this. It was like being thrown down the rabbit hole into the BPD sufferers mind. It gives no hope. Let me repeat. No hope. I would have liked to have seen some hope at the beginning of each chapter, maybe about how she views things differently now, and then it would have felt safer to follow the author down the rabbit hole of mental illness. The author didn't do that though, so reading it was no different then enduring the rages of the person in your life who has BPD. I couldn't read this book in large doses for the mere fact that HOPE is not sprinkled throughout the pages at all. Misery and the pain and drain is. I wanted a detailed account of what she went through but with some safeguards and reminders that she is okay now. I didn't get that at all. I highly suggest that people suffering from BPD do not read this book until they are well on their way to recovery (or perhaps never read it) as my significant other launched into a rage after reading a few chapters and now uses the author to illustrate how her distorted views are accurate because \\"Rachel felt that way too.\\" This book is not helpful to the non-BPD unless you are a glutton for punishment, nor is it helpful for BPD's. The way the book was structured was reckless and did not take into account the reader."},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"I loved this story or diary. It was a beautiful story that contained a lot of elements that we deal on the daily bases.I loved this book, I might write in some mistakes that other wont understand, but I really hope other people will read this book. This books is for everyone, not only for people who have BPD, or writing about personality disorders like me.I read this book because I had to write abut personality disorders, for my ''Abnormal psychology'' paper. I am glad that I read this book. It helped in way. It helped me understand that no one is perfect and we all deal with problems.Rachel Reiland tough perseverance helped her and sustained her in therapy. Some people wouldn't be able to handle that much cause, but she was a strong survivor."},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"I found this book interesting, yet anti-climactic at the end. It was very hard for me to read about how she treated her children. Kudos for her honesty, but I am disturbed at her narcissistic \\"everything is all about me\\" attitude followed by outbursts of extreme anger when not everything goes her way. I would have thought she could at least get her act together in order to spare them from her outrageous behavior. But at least she acknowledged her obvious pathology and got herself help. I guess from someone who has been diagnosed with BPD and have only been able to acquire a therapist's help by going and getting a job (yes with a child) to fund it myself, I tend to find her whiney and rather ungrateful throughout the book. Most people that have circumstances far worse than hers will never be able to afford to get the help they need, let alone have their therapy funded by their abuser. It's sad. But I'm glad for her sake that she found a wonderful therapist and was able to find the help she so desperately needed."},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"For the understanding of people who dont want to believe they may have a personality disorder this is good reading for the class I did read it if you are one not wanting to believe it it will open you eyes"},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"Very good book, could not put down. Reminds me of a couple members of my family. arrived on time,excellent condition"},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"I cannot believe this book got so many good reviews. The psychiatrist that she praises so much was obviously a coN and abusive person. It hurt me to even read about what he and the hospital staff have done to her. Just like One Flight over a Coockoo's nest. The behavior of healthcare workers was completely inappropriate and abusive. Their licenses should have been taking away for treating a patient in such way."},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"After having been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder (as well as Severe Depression), I have bought and read many books on Borderline Personality Disorder including \\"Borderline Personality Disorder Demystified\\", \\"DBT - Marsha Linehan workbook\\", I hate you dont leave me\\", Stop walking on egg shells\\", \\"Lost in the mirror - an inside look at Borderline Personality Disorder\\", \\"Sometimes i act crazy\\" and others including online resources...ok, i am now only 77 pages away from finishing the 436 page book by Rachel Reiland \\"Get me out of here - my recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder\\". Unlike all the other books and resources i have read, the more i read this book, the angrier i am getting!!!! let me explain my reasons..As i started reading her book, the first few chapters i could relate too, she was hospitalised \\"because she would go for walks during the night!?\\" she threw things at the nurses and ended up in seclusion because she would punch walls etc.. i understand that, i can relate to that.. so i read on.. the more i read the more i started disliking the book to the point i would slam the book down on the bedside table cursing her for writing it!Sure she had anger issues (anger outbursts), she was anorexic, manipulative, had gender issues (wanting to be a male though she was female) and having problems with her family as a child. However i strongly believe she DIDN'T have BPD, rather she was an angry, manipulative, Nymphomaniac.. thats all!All through the book, it focuses on her and her relationship with her therapist... she was never further hospitalised, she would talk about her therapist as if he was god almighty, and then other times would hate him to the point she even put a threatening note on her therapist's car window telling him she knew his car, and where he lived and she would get him (which any normal person would have reported to police!). I found i was simply reading about her therapy sessions with no real emphasis on talking about how therapy was helping her or what they focused on during therapy, she seemed to just briefly mention what happened in the therapy sessions but more specifically focused on her missing him when he wasn't around for her, even ringing him during emergency hours with non emergencies.Towards the end of the book, she is in therapy and is trying to give herself an orgasm in front of her therapist! and he simply sits there and watches her! That is highly inappropriate! Then all of a sudden when you find yourself boring with the book's contents, it changes direction, from the last chapter of her giving herself an orgasm to suddenly the next chapter being \\"recovered\\" and normal. All during a christmas break (away from therapy).. It never discusses HOW the therapy helped her recover..Sure, she may have had some BPD traits, but i dont' beleive she actually had BPD... the characteristics of BPD are (and i have noted my views on the characteristics pertaining to her recollection at the end of each characteristic)....1. frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment. Note: Do not include suicidal or self-mutilating behaviour covered in Criterion 5. She never avoided abandonment, i dont' think... so thats a no.2. a pattern of unstable and intense interpersonal relationships characterized by alternating between extremes of idealization and devaluation, sometimes yes, with her therapist only though!!! so no.3. identity disturbance: markedly and persistently unstable self-image or sense of self, other then wanting to be a male not female, i dont' think this is relevant to her... so no.4. impulsivity in at least two areas that are potentially self-damaging (e.g., spending, sex, substance abuse, reckless driving, binge eating). Note: Do not include suicidal or self-mutilating behaviour covered in Criterion 5. Yes, only on sex though..5. recurrent suicidal behaviour, gestures, or threats, or self-mutilating behavior \\"walking at night\\" is not even parasuicidal behaviour, i don't think she even fitted this criteria either! so another no.6. affective instability due to a marked reactivity of mood (e.g., intense episodic dysphoria, irritability, or anxiety usually lasting a few hours and only rarely more than a few days) there was no mention of her mood changes (other then anger outbursts!) so no.7. chronic feelings of emptiness, she never discussed this.. so no.8. inappropriate, intense anger or difficulty controlling anger (e.g., frequent displays of temper, constant anger, recurrent physical fights) Yes, she had anger issues..9. transient, stress-related paranoid ideation or severe dissociative symptoms, she never discussed this, so i guess this a no too..So, she had 2 of the diagnosis (according to her recollection and writings in the book!) which actually requires 5 or more to be diagnosed with BPD...Ok, so is it just me? what do others who have read this book think? i am hesitant to finish the book now she has suddenly recovered and is acting normal and fine and rational.. without focusing or mentioning HOW she recovered... what aspects of her abnormal therapy helped her to recover!?It makes me wonder why they re-published it (by another publisher) and renamed it (originally called \\"I'm not supposed to be here\\").."},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"I think my problem with this book is that the author is so cruel and selfish it's difficult to care whether she recovers or not. She hates her husband, hates her kids, hates her therapist, hates life, hates herself and on and on...Her misery and self loathing seem completely justified. But she's nowhere as sick as her husband who doesn't stand up to her abuse of the entire family. He's the one who really needs therapy.I'm halfway through the book. It's been a struggle but I paid for it and I'm going to read every torturous page!"},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"First of all, I have a background and graduate education in psychology and I'm well read in the borderline personality disorder arena. I have also seen people close to me struggle with this disorder. Therefore, I am always excited to see something fresh that sheds light on this often neglected disorder whatever name you want to put to it.What is MOST valuable about this book is that it gives an INSIDE perspective on BPD. Most of what is written on the subject describes it from the OUTSIDE. This is invaluable for anyone confronting this problem, living with someone who has BPD tendencies and especially the average psychotherapist. In short, it's an extremely vulnerable and intimate account that sheds light on the type of distorted thinking, feeling and meaning making that can occur. Among other things, this must have taken incredible courage and I can't even imagine anyone would right a book like this except out of extreme compassion.This is a rather long book, but I honestly couldn't put it down. It takes the reader inside the head and heart of the BPD sufferer. It uses story like good fiction to illustrate situations and important points and in this sense it's like good fiction except it's real! If you are confused about what goes on inside the mind of someone with BPD... this is a very good starting point for understanding the overwhelming feelings of emptiness, impulsiveness, etc. It also develops the consequences of acting out, the different dilemmas that arise as fallout, etc.I can't praise this book enough, I'm so glad someone took the time to write it. If you are suffering from BPD or a loved one is.... it's a MUST own book. It will also inspire you and show you what the path forward looks like. While it's true BPD is a stubborn problem, it is also true that we have never known more about it than we do now and there really are effective therapies and medication out there. However, I think the most important ingredient is love and above all this is a story of great love and commitment from key people in the patient's life.There are other excellent BPD resources available on Amazon. If you are reading this review, I'm sure you would also want to ownSometimes I Act Crazy: Living with Borderline Personality Disorder. This is the best SINGLE book on the topic that I am aware of. Also, if you are a therapist, consider...Skills Training Manual for Treating Borderline Personality Disorder. This is a good starting point for clients, therapists and family alike.In the past BPD was considered hopeless or virtually so. Now, however, we know a lot more about the brain, treating this disorder, etc. However, not every therapist is talented at working with it. You need to find someone who is effective. Therefore, doing your homework is essential. If you are a concerned family member stuck in the middle, then you may findStop Walking on Eggshells: Taking Your Life Back When Someone You Care about Has Borderline Personality DisorderandBreaking Free from Boomerang Love: Getting Unhooked from Borderline Personality Disorder Relationships. The latter of these two focuses on intimate relationships. It's tone is a bit sarcastic at times, but you will learn a lot too.Finally, I would recommend the following:Lost in the Mirror, 2nd Edition: An Inside Look at Borderline Personality Disorder. This is another VERY GOOD and concise inside look at BPD with more structure. It is written with compassion and would definitely be something you might enjoy reading along with this book or after it. I also likeThe Narcissistic and Borderline Disorders: An Integrated Developmental Approachas one potential developmental model for therapists. In general, psychodynamic and dialectical behavioral approaches seem to work the best. I also likePsychodynamic Psychotherapy Of Borderline Patients. There are also many new books out there that you are probably aware of, but these older ones still have much to offer in terms of providing a broad perspective."},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"This book is a heartfelt accounting of the inner struggles of the author in her recovery from borderline personality disorder. While no two individuals are the same, there are many moments where anyone who suffers from the disorder, or has a loved one who suffers from the disorder, will be able to relate to, and find hope from.The book is truly insightful into borderline personality disorder, and provides true hope that recovery is possible. This book shows in the most candid manner that recovery and quality of life is out there, and while the road to recovery is tough, what is at the end is truly worth the journey.I recommend this book to anyone who is seeking to understand the borderline mind."},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"I am not a borderline as far as I know, but I do have a painful past just as Rachel and most people do. While I haven't gone to the extremes like she has, I can identify with the emotions behind her responses. I would highly advise you to read the book. See what you can draw from it about your childhood as related to your present baggage. I only wish we all could afford the therapy and treatment she received and live happily ever-after.(sarcasm, there)"},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"Earlier this year I ended a relationship with a woman who likely has BPD. Our friendship would swing between fierce affection and rage. It was clearly unhealthy and addictive. I realized I needed to pull away from her. When I did, abandonment was triggered and the abuse escalated, to the point where I had no choice but to completely \\"amputate\\" our friendship. It was like a bad dream.It felt horrible to reject her, but it felt just as bad to be the recipient of her rage and hostility - and then be forced to walk away with no closure and no apologies. I had trusted her so much. I've been struggling to sort out feelings of bitterness, betrayal and anger towards her.In the book Rachel's therapist Dr. Padgett is the person who most 'matches' me. He's helping her with her process and he listens to her and understands her and she is addictively and insatiably drawn to him. She thinks about him constantly and looks forward earnestly to every next session.But many times she verbally rips him to shreds and demonizes him. Then she flips back the other way and she's affectionate and remorseful.Either way, he doesn't take it personally and he patiently plays the role of facilitator. He's very careful about his boundaries and asserts his authority whenever he needs to. The book helped me begin to mentally assume the same posture as Dr. Padgett. It helps me not take the verbal abuse personally anymore. Helps me re-frame it, understand the world she lives in, and have hope that if my former friend seeks help, she too can find a healing journey.The book is very well written and strikes a proper balance between empathy for the source of a dysfunction yet not accepting it as an excuse. Rachel takes responsibility for her behavior and finds her way out. I'm thankful for Rachel Reiland for giving me a chance to be \\"inside the mind\\" of a BPD person for awhile."},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"I've read this book cover to cover twice. I knew that I had an illness far more serious than depression. I feared I was going to eventually lose touch with reality. It seemed like no one could feel like I did unless they were slowly losing touch with reality. After reading this book, I was both relieved and depressed. Relieved that I was not losing touch with reality and that others had almost identical symptoms, but depressed because of the expense of treatment.I had been to 3 very qualified, expensive psychiatrists from 1997 - 2007. None of them ever considered anything more than Depression as a diagnosis. After reading this book, I started researching psychiatrists that treated BPD. I ended up finding one who actually called me back and who actually spent a few minutes discussing my goals for therapy. Then, he had me come in to his office to discuss them in person to make sure that I understood how the therapy would work. None of the other doctors did this. They are probably fine doctors, but they are not skilled in handling BPD patients.Then, I was totally blown away - my doctor turned out to be the real life Dr. Padgett.Rachel Reiland's book has put me on the path to recovery. And I am completely confident that \\"Dr. Padgett\\" will stick with me to the end of the path. I earn a very modest income and my insurance does not cover any of my treatments. I see Dr. Padgett twice a week. I can only afford it because I have made the choice to spend my money on this treatment rather than frivilous items which granted, I'll miss, but they won't help me recover.I am grateful everyday that I read this book and found Dr. Padgett all at a time in my life when I was able to manage a way to afford it. If you are looking for a therapist, make sure you choose one that will work with you the way Dr. Padgett worked with Rachel and that he/she has a detailed plan for your therapy and that he/she has, not only your recovery in mind, but also, your overall life goals in mind. It is worth the investment to get your life back."},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"Okay, I did not know what to expect when purchasing this book, but I was intrigued by the synopsis. As a Board Certified Member in Expert Stress (BCETS)and a member of the American Academy of Experts in Traumatic Stress (AAETS) actively involved in treating veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan, I suggest this should be required reading for EVERYONE in and considering on entering into the mental healthcare profession. Rachel eloquently elaborates on, not only what it is like to live with BPD, but describes the epitome of professionalism in counseling -- transference, boundaries, self-disclosure, and counseling metodology. I wish that I had read this book early in my journey in counseling. It is directly applicable, not only to BPD, but as dissociative identity disorder (DID) and other DSM-IV-TR disorders resulting from trauma in which transference is an issue. A 5-star rating is an understatement."},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"For those seeking to understand the intense, chaotic, and conflicting love/hate behavior of a woman afflicted with borderline personality disorder, \\"Rachel's\\" ruthlessly revealing story is eye-opening. Admitted into a psychiatric hospital after striking her son, Rachel does not appear to be a lost cause; she is, no doubt, violent, unpredictable, and disordered, but she grasps her situation and wants to recover. A caring, insightful and loving psychiatrist chooses her and so begins her painful, frustrating journey of self-discovery and healing. But therapy is no magic elixer. Instead it tears away her facade, leaving her exposed as a frightened and traumatized child. Her behavior worsens as the psychiatrist loosens her tight reins on her emotions and cracks her protective walls. Her emotions swing wildly between her unbelievable love and her unmitigated rage toward the psychiatrist doing his best to pull her from the abyss. I don't know who was more courageous or inspiring, the psychiatrist who withstood her rages and navigated her toward mental health or Rachel, who suffered from such terrible inner turmoil, worked so hard to recover, and emerged a strong and loving woman. One of the best books I've ever read.The negative reviews are way off target. Some complain Rachel did not take responsibility for her actions or lacked maturity. She was mentally ill; she went through grueling psychotherapy, became a better mother, wife, friend and family member; what else could any reasonable person expect of her? I suspect that those who criticize her are really re-directing their anger at a BPD in their lives onto Rachel."},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"I read this book not sure what to expect. As the adult daughter of a mentally ill woman I gained a greater understanding of the thinking behind the irrational behaviour (and the emotions driving it). This has given me a great sense of peace in coming to terms with my untreated parent and being able to have a better relationship with her. I have great admiration for Rachel and only hope that anyone with a similar personality disorder who may read this book will be able to self identify, seek treatment and have the strength to persevere in overcoming their devastating and alienating behaviour.Rachel's story is a beacon of hope and a tall order to fill as we see her ability to recover required an awakening to her mental illness, an enormously difficult step to take, and then a strong committment to self examination and a thoroughly competent professional to guide her through to the other side.An emotionally difficult read and yet I could not put it down as I waited to see what twists and turns followed. Unlike a fairy tale a thoroughly wonderful and rewarding finish as many BPD sufferers can see now they too are capable of leading much more peaceful and fulfilling lives than they currently experience."},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"I recommend this book to anyone who has BPD or if they care about someone with BPD.

Some of my colleagues in psychology see Borderline Personality Disorder as a character defect that cannot be solved OR, alternatively, as some sort of deliberate behavior that the client is not only conscious of but is using for her (or his, though most BPD clients, diagnosed, are female) own means. This book provides a compassionate, human perspective.

One reviewer above seemed to expect a lot more, but this book isn't meant to cure someone of their own neuroses. It is, however, an honest and intimate look into one person's mind, and how she was able to overcome the despair caused by a terrible childhood and become a healthy and happy person. It took a lot of work, both on her part and her therapist's, and at many points along the way she almost gave up hope. I think therapists could learn a lot from this book, probably not many therapists exist who could have done it. There's nobody who won't learn something important from this book, and the author, who became a professional author after this, writes excellently about her experience."},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"Rachel is courageously and intelligently honest as she describes the inner experience and outer impact of her battle with borderline personality disorder.

Bravo, Rachel!"},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"I just finished 'I Hate You - Don't Leave Me'... I thought this would be a good followup - from the consumer's view. I was right. The book was very emotional and graphic, even disturbing at times. The patience of the folks around the author during her recovery was astounding! Her description of her feelings during both episodes and treatment was extremely helpful in developing a sense of empathy for someone suffering from this disorder. All in all, a very useful book!One caveat... I am not sure this is the first or second book for someone who has just been diagnosed with bpd - at least not without running it by a health professional first.I definitely recommend this book.All the best,Jay"},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"Although I haven't read the other reviews on this book, I suspect that most who chose to read it either know someone with BPD or are suffering from it themselves. No doubt as it is answering a pressing need they have to know more about a personal BPD experience, they might be more forgiving of some of its negative points (which aren't many, but nevertheless). As for me, I chose the book out of simple curiosity about the illness as experienced from a first person point of view.On the positive side, the author is very thorough in explaining all the phases she's gone through. We also get a very good idea of what her sessions were like. However, I would have preferred more background on Freudian theory as it relates to BPD. As a matter of fact, the book would have benefitted from more general background information on the illness. I do realize it's an autobiography, but a few of these passages would have changed the pace and style of the book a bit.Although I'm not Christian, I felt the inclusion of how she discovered her faith was really vital to the story. I would hate to think of someone going through this or any other major illness without the support of some kind of faith. This was another heartening part of the story : at one point she realizes that key people have come into her life at the right moment and been there to help her through. Support networks must be crucial for people suffering from BPD and she certainly is lucky that she has such patient people around her. (Once again, a minor criticism on this aspect : I truly doubt that anyone could be so consistently patient, forgiving and supportive as she makes her husband out to be. He does not seem to be a real, fleshed out person the way he is described throughout the book, in a way that would seem just existing to support her, without any nuanced personality of his own. I found myself wanting to hear from HIM, to know the hell he was going through.)Despite the interesting content, I must say that the book isn't very well written. (That said, I'd just finished reading a book by Flaubert, so it may have tainted my view.) The narrative is there, of course, but I just found it a bit heavy handed and lacking in further reflection on what the illness has meant to the author, rather than simply reporting the emotions she went through. Overall though, a good resource if you or someone you know is suffering from the illness."},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"How I discovered this book:A friend and I did a book swap. We each have a favorite book that show-cases our specified mental illness, sort of a way to get into each other's heads. (Mine was \\"Like Being Killed\\" by Ellen Miller, it's a love it or hate it type book.)My opinions:Congrats to \\"Rachel\\" for feeling better. Her ability to realize her behavior and wanting to change is very admirable. Seeing her intense reactions to minor incidents and extremely poisonious tongue was a reminder that she was ill and not just rude. And I'm VERY jealous she found a psychologist she could trust and value their opinion.The only complaints:I felt the book was soooo slow. I'm well aware that this isn't an action book or has a \\"set plot\\", but I kept waiting for SOMETHING. I ended the book satisfied but my only irritation is that I feel she didn't RECOVER. Dr Padgett gave her COPING SKILLS. Just my opinion/observation.Overall - Good easy read.

This is the only weak part about the book -- it is from Rachael's perspective. We never quite know how her husband dealt with it -- the fact that he did is just as amazing as her recovery.This is definitely a poweful book. Well worth the read, especially if you are still in a relationship with a person who has a borderline personality. It is also a good book to give a BP.

The only other that I've written was for Breaking Night by Liz Murray (fantastic read, highly recommend it!) But this is my second and a book that well deserves writing one out for. Reading this as a girl suffering from BPD myself, this is a book that is highly optimistic and hopeful, not only for the sufferer themselves but for the \\"victims\\" of the sufferer that \\"deal with us.\\" It brings light to darkened, internal, frightened worlds. We're not crazy, we are terrified children who never really grew up. I'm thankful for \\"Rachel\\" wherever she is for sharing her story and giving me hope! And words can't express how grateful I am for rare doctors like \\"Dr. Padgett\\" who know how to offer unconditional love, commit to a relationship, not abandon us, and never lose hope in our potential. There is so much more to borderline personality disorder than all the internet stigmas give it. If I only could, I would wish away all of the negative stereotypes that surround us. More than anything, all of our lives, we have only wanted to be accepted. As we are. As terrible as that may be sometimes, we want someone like \\"Dr. Padgett\\" to hope in us, set limits, to teach us with \\"tough love\\" and to watch us grow. It is indeed love, not hate and resentment, that instills true growth. Do we not all need loving parents (even temporary ones) that can \\"give us what we need\\" and make us a \\"whole\\" person? I haven't found my Dr. Padgett yet but I have hope now that I will. For now, I'll just rely on the one in the book. One of my favorite reads! Read it. Cherish it.

I was looking for a story that I could relate to, and this author is a young, married adult with two young children - perfect! I was beyond curious to know how others with BPD managed the demands of motherhood and family life.Unfortunately for me, I gained little insight (note: the conversations between Rachel and her therapist are not only lengthy but somewhat boring.) While I do not want to go into a long history of my own disorder, in my early 20s, I certainly spent more than my fair share of time screaming obscenities, hurling things at the wall, and lying on the floor in agony; I also had two stays in a psych ward due to serious (not merely attention-seeking) suicide attempts. My children being born did not relieve me of my illness, but it certainly changed my focus. My problems are MY problems, and I didn't want my kids growing up having to walk on eggshells around me and worry about when Mommy would be \\"sick\\" again. They are young and full of life, blank slates, and it seemed much more prudent to focus on what they are and can be, rather than what has held me back. I think Rachel's kids were exposed to too much. If home, the one place in the world that should always be your comfort, is filled with chaos, you are off to a rocky start in life. I guess Rachel is lucky to have a husband who was not only patient but responsible enough to care for the children in her absence. If I acted like she did, my husband would have left. I'm not saying it's easy, in fact it hurts like hell most of the time, but when I feel myself losing control I have to bite my tongue and remind myself to use the tools I've learned along the way to cope. There have been plenty of times I've wanted to run my car into things in a parking lot, and times I've thought that a stay in the hospital is the only remedy...but I can't do it. It would kill me. Those little faces are always watching and they need their mother.If you are looking for a story that focuses more on managing BPD than reveling in the misery of it, skip this book."},{"Title":"Get Me Out of Here: My Recovery from Borderline Personality Disorder","review":"This book is one of my favorite books that I have ever read.

It seemed as though 80% of the book consisted of descriptions of Reiland's angry, out of control screaming matches with her patient-as-a-saint psychiatrist. I felt like I was reading the same thing over and over again and it becomes rather boring.I have to say that the only thing that kept me reading is my interest in the process of Reiland's recovery from BPD and my hope that I would read of some sort of major transformation.

I was looking forward to this book finally being the academic work to convince Evangelicals to Embrace Postmodernism, as subtitle says. Furthermore I was fascinating to see how this member of the academy would substantiate some of the claims and practices of the Emerging Church movement.Raschke's explanation of the philosophical foundations of western thought and therefore Evangelicalism was insightful. His references to some key philosophers in Europe and America and the relation of their thought to eachother was superb. However, in the end of the day, His argument did not convince that Evangelicals should embrace postmodernism for two primary reasons. First, His reductionsitic outlook of Evangelical Christianity in western culture is an inaccurate portrait of the Evangelical Church. He tends to lump all evenagelicals in the same right wing, condemning, propositional focussd camp. But this is not the case in reality. Second, his attempt to use Luther and the other major Reformers of the Prostestant Reformation does not do justice to the context those reformers were in. As one who has studied Luther extensively, I simply do not see all his points about the Refomers view of Scripture and therefore the conclusions he draws seem to be a stretch. He fails to use the reformers to substantiate his case.This book is interesting but I encourage you to read it critically, just as Raschke has read modern culture and Evangelicalism."},{"Title":"Next Reformation, The: Why Evangelicals Must Embrace Postmodernity","review":"If you are a Christian interested in philosophy (as this reviewer is), and if you have become convinced (as this reviewer has) that 21st century evangelical Christianity is thoroughly Hellenized, then you should find this book interesting.This is a mostly \\"academic\\" work (i.e., it is not \\"light\\" reading), but even if you have not read much philosophy you can wade through it if you keep a philosophical dictionary close by.Strengths:(1) Raschke has a Ph.D. from Harvard University, and his analysis of the history of Western Philosophy (and its impact upon Christian thought) is very well-argued. This reviewer has been disillusioned with many recent Christian writers who seek to criticize \\"Postmodernism\\" without really understanding it (i.e., they have read none of the primary texts - and react with a fundamentalist zeal - full of fire, but without knowledge). This is easily understandable - since reading Jacques Derrida is almost as relaxing as a root canal. But the \\"Christian bookstore\\" definition that \\"postmodernism = relativism,\\" is simply un-scholarly. Raschke has read Derrida, Foucault, Levinas, et. al. (where was Lyotard?), and does not fall into to the \\"simplification\\" error of many recent popular Christian writers.(2) Raschke recognizes that the modernistic quest for \\"certainty,\\" is a Western idea with philosophical roots in the foundationalist thought of Descarte. For an easier to read analysis of this issue read Lesslie Newbigin's, Proper Confidence: Faith, Doubt, and Certainty in Christian Discipleship, (this is a great little book, http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802808565/sr=1-1/qid=1145588003/ref=sr_1_1/002-4823991-7848833?%5Fencoding=UTF8&s;=books). Raschke pummels this idea relentlessly using Derrida as the hammer (and Derrida is a great hammer!). Christianity is not about \\"certainty,\\" (the perpetual quest of Western Philosophy), it is much more existential - it's about faith.Weaknesses:(1) Raschke disparages \\"propositional truth.\\" He analyses and quotes the theologian Cornelius Van Til extensively, while neglecting the greater 20th century Philosopher Gordon H. Clark. Raschke scathingly critiques Francis Schaeffer, while embracing the irrationalism of Kierkegaard (Kierkegaard is an interesting writer, but he wasn't a Philosopher - and he never claimed to be - he repeatedly said \\"I'm a writer\\"). In this reviewer's opinion, to criticize \\"propositional truth,\\" is to beat one's head against a stone wall (i.e., it is an unrewarding and painful activity which makes the \\"criticizer\\" look foolish). Contrary to some recent hyperbole, propositional truth is not at risk at all - and \\"propositional truth\\" is not \\"hard to understand.\\" Propositional truth will be standing long after its critics have returned to dust and ashes. Not only are propositions NOT hard to understand, the Holy Bible (the Word of God) is written in propositions; predications. When Raschke embraces irrationalism, he slips, he slides - he looses ground (grounding, credibility). Raschke is a very intelligent man, so the reader must understand that this is not accidental - his sustained attack on foundationalism (and his method of attack) traps him in irrationalism.(2) Raschke embraces Charismatic foolishness. This is the hardest to swallow. In the next to last chapter of the book, this Harvard Ph.D. documents how (emotionally weakened by a failed marriage) he experienced some charismatic phenomena in a Dallas, Texas meeting, and is forevermore changed into what Brian Maclaren calls \\"a new kind of Christian.\\" For the orthodox thinking Christian who has experienced Christ as the \\"wisdom of God\\" - this leap into irrationality/foolishness is astounding. Wake up man - you are better than this!Conclusion:This is a very interesting book. It is generally well written, and if I could delete about 20 pages (out of 215) I would give it 5 stars. As it is, I will give it only 3. I can only recommend it for thinking Christians who are attracted to Postmodernism (as this reviwer is). It is educational and well written, and may serve as a warning of the foolishness that can follow when one embraces irrationalism and calls it \\"Christian.\\""},{"Title":"Next Reformation, The: Why Evangelicals Must Embrace Postmodernity","review":"In this important book Carl Raschke aims to do the following: 1) demonstrate that many of the authors who have been captured under the broad umbrella of postmodernism have all too often been dismissed unfairly and that the church would do well to give them a fair hearing. The most substantive argument in this regard is probably the debate over the correspondence theory of truth; 2) disabuse the church of the merits of the Enlightenment project and of modernism. One of the most important moves here is Raschke's argument that \\"The God of the philosophers is logical. The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob is relational;\\" And, 3) to call the church to adopt a primarily relational rather than a logical view of faith, which, If I am understanding Raschke correctly, does not mean \\"anything goes,\\" but that we must develop a greater appreciation for the limits of rationality and the merits of faith.On balance, these strike me as credible and important arguments. One reason I say this is because, by demonstrating how Christianity flourished in the US, not because of its pristine logic, but because of an emphasis on affective conversions, i.e., conversion to a relationship rather than to a set of doctrines, Raschke allows us to provide a more coherent view of the recent history of the church.When we look at some of the more hostile reviews of this book we can get a sense of what Raschke is up against: a group of intelligent, well-meaning people who, nonetheless, seem intent on dismissing anything they perceive as postmodern in a single, potted gesture. The typical move goes something like this: \\"Postmodernists\\" like Derrida, Barthes, Lyotard, Kristeva, and _____(fill in the blank because anyone remotely associated with critical theory will usually do) believe authorial intent is a blind alley and that all we have is the text. So there; \\"postmodernists\\" must be wrong, and we do not have to engage anything they say at a serious level. It seems to me the problem with such critiques, apart from being alarmingly misinformed, is that by failing to engage serious arguments at a substantive level they run the risk of making Christians look incurious, provincial, and unnecessarily doctrinaire.The great 20th century rhetorician Kenneth Burke once commented on the striking similarity between Jesus' statements about refraining from judgment and the need for objective distance in academic work. Paul Ricoeur makes a similar point when he stresses that the starting point for any valid critique will nearly always be a disciplined attempt to appraise a text as kerygma (sincere testimony). Put more simply, this means we are obligated to do our best to listen fairly and reflectively before engaging in critique. This does not mean we have to swallow any hoo-ha that comes along. Only that we have an obligation to do our homework and check our own hearts to see how our own sinful impulses and biases may have intervened before we take an ad hominem sledgehammer to the thoughtful work of any scholar, but especially a Christian one. Some will no doubt claim that neither I nor Dr. Raschke have heeded this advice. In my estimation that would be an unfair assessment of Raschke's work, especially when such an argument represents an exclusive line of attack. That being said, at some later date when I have more time, I hope to expand this review since I do have some specific criticisms of his handling of a few specific issues, especially his critique of Francis Schaeffer whose importance, I believe, he underestimates.Beyond that, I will say only this in my own defense. In recent years it has been my privilege to spend many hours struggling through the works of authors like Derrida, Barthes, Nietzsche, and Foucault... and to spend considerable time as well in discussions about many of the ideas Raschke touches upon in this and others of his works (the nature of rationality, the status of the Enlightenment project, the mediation of language, the impact of globalism, etc.). Quite often these discussions have included friends - Christian and otherwise - who have contrary views. I have found that when people play by the rules and give ideas a fair hearing we often discover common ground in unexpected places... even when we continue to disagree strongly. But when a Christian Pharisee steps in and writes off either the postmodern or the rationalist Samaritans as a hopeless lot, discussions fly apart and people begin to nurse corrosive resentments. I have been the Pharisee more times than I care to admit - once upon a time as a rationalist, and now - on occasion - as someone who has found some Christian solace even in the writings of post-structuralist authors I once condemned. The closest parallel I can think of right now to the sort of appropriation I have in mind here would be Bruce Benson's marvelous book Pious Nietzsche where he uncovers an extraordinary link between Nietzsche and Paul. And before anyone dismisses any such research as a priori heretical, consider that the church has a long history of citing Socrates (a pre-Christian, homosexual philosopher who claimed to receive instruction from a \\"daemon\\"-spirit) and Aristotle (another pre-Christian who believed women are biologically inferior.) Finally, if in any of this I sound hypocritical, I must beg early forgiveness while at the same time asking critics to attend faithfully to what authors they deem \\"postmodern\\" have to say before tossing them onto the scrap heap and encouraging others to do the same. We do not have to agree with one another, but it seems to me we have an obligation to be fair. If we do not read these authors, our children likely will, and we had best know what we are talking about."},{"Title":"Next Reformation, The: Why Evangelicals Must Embrace Postmodernity","review":"Carl Raschke's book attempts to accomplish three main purposes. First, he seeks to set the record straight for evangelicals by offering an accurate portrayal of postmodern thinking and countering the misrepresentations of postmodernism he finds in the writings of those critical of the new philosophy.Raschke argues that postmodernism does not necessarily entail a denial of absolute and objective truth. Rather, postmodern philosophers merely question human ability to distinguish between truth and falsehood.What postmodernism denies is the correspondence theory of truth - a view that perceives truth as something \\"out there.\\" Instead, postmodern thinkers call attention to the \\"finite boundaries of human knowledge and meaning,\\" a move which sets God free to communicate truth to us in his own way.At its very core, postmodernism is a theology of language. God's word to us is not logical or propositional. It is vocative. It is the language of relationship. \\"We are not reading a thing, but a Person.\\"In focusing upon the revelation of God to human beings in finite language, postmodernism endeavors to \\"go beyond the identification of God with Being; it has positioned itself to transcend the metaphysical, or rationalist conception of God.\\"Turning the TablesRaschke's second purpose in writing The Next Reformation is to turn the tables on the critics who believe postmodern theology is misguided. He seeks to accomplish this task by exposing an \\"unholy alliance\\" between evangelical Christianity and Enlightenment thinking that has existed since the seventeenth century.According to Raschke, evangelicals mistakenly embraced Cartesian rationalism and moved away from the insights of the Reformers, especially sola fide and sola scriptura, and therefore went back toward the kind of rationalism that the Reformers had rightly sought to expunge from Catholic doctrine just one hundred years earlier.Raschke believes that today's evangelicalism is steeped in modernism, an idolatrous system of thought that puts a premium on the ability of the individual to use reason to discover truth. Therefore, fundamentalism and liberalism wind up being two sides of the same coin. Both movements seek to ground faith in reason, a disastrous idea that \\"empties faith of its content\\" and transforms it into moral imperatives and propositions.Raschke believes the mystery of God cannot be explained in propositional argument and empirical confirmation. \\"Language from the Creator's vantage point is not propositional at all. It is intersubjective. It is relational!\\"Arguing for a personal God, Raschke challenges the \\"unholy alliance\\" made with Enlightenment philosophy. \\"The God of the philosophers is logical. The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob is relational.\\"One may ask how evangelicalism has been so successful if it has been improperly aligned with modernism. Raschke argues that conservative Christianity has succeeded in America because of its emphasis on preaching and conversion, not on its reasoning from absolute, biblical principles.Returning to the spirit of the Reformation will lead to an embrace of postmodernism. A new reformation will bring about radical humility in our thought, not just in our lives, which means that metaphysical disputation must give way to the cross, gospel, and grace.Postmodernism as OpportunityRaschke's third purpose is to call evangelicals to see the postmodern turn in Western thought as an opportunity for true Christianity to flourish once again.Embracing postmodernism means we must reject the correspondence theory of truth because \\"it cannot under any circumstances count on the temporal exactitude of correspondence between an assertion and its verification.\\"Our attempts to find a firm foundation other than faith are futile. \\"Theology ends where faith begins.\\" Only faith is prior to presuppositions. To look for ultimate security in anything other than our faith in the Lord (including ontological or scientific foundations) is to pursue an idol.Raschke calls evangelicals to abandon the idea of Christianity as a philosophy and to embrace its identity as a \\"relationship\\" - one that connects us to the everlasting God whose limitlessness exposes more and more our own limitations."},{"Title":"Next Reformation, The: Why Evangelicals Must Embrace Postmodernity","review":"Reflecting on how things were done in past can be a useful exercise, but as the trite saying goes, hindsight is 20/20. Does gaining a more enlightened perspective based on hindsight mean that what was done in the past was all wrong, and somehow we will get it right this time, because we now we know better? Raschke's thesis on the un-holy alliance of Evangelical theology with Cartesian rationalism and British evidentialism seems to suggest that. His arguments defending that assertion provides interesting read, but the subtitle (Why Evangelicals must embrace Postmodernity) is what caught my eye. What I had hoped to gain was a clearly stated, cogent argument, to support that statement. Instead, what the reader gets is Raschke's personal and fascinating journey of a theologian and philosopher who discovers the power of the Holy Spirit as expressed through the gifts of the Holy Spirit. Interwoven in this personnel narrative are provocative statements about oppressive Evangelical church counsels imposing things such as inerrancy and fundamental tenants of faith on believers. I found many of Raschke's hindsight statements helpful, as they do provide some explanation for why Evangelicals are the way they are. But the philosopher him in is still tugging at him as evidenced by his attempts to frame Postmodernity as a harmless philosophy, even suggesting that Derrida's theory of language is not so harmful when it comes to Biblical Hermeneutics. His definition of Postmodernity is as vague as readers on the topic have come to expect. That is because, as he says, Postmodernity is simply popular culture. And I thoroughly agree with him that Evangelicals should mix with popular culture in their mission to be a light to the world. If you are a patient and mature reader, Raschke provides many good insights that make the book worth reading."},{"Title":"Next Reformation, The: Why Evangelicals Must Embrace Postmodernity","review":"There are really three parts to Raschke's new book. The first is a history of philosophical and religious postmodernism, the second part is a critique of the politicization and legalization of Evangelical Christianity, and the third part is what a Christian faith stripped of our politics and self comforting legalisms (idolatries) might look like. You can read any of the three parts as a self standing work. Anyone curious about what postmodernism is apart from the usual cliches will find the first part very informative. Those who like me, enjoy a little bomb throwing, will enjoy the second part. And those who are actually interested in the nuts and bolts of a postmodern ministry will appreciate the third part. Underlying all of this though, is a truly threatening proposition for the vast majority of Evangelicals who seek salvation through Big Box cathedrals, who feel comfort in the herd mentality of the new political/moral laws, and who prefer to seek salvation through crazy rationalistic formulations of literary theories. Knowledge collapsed into salvation will always be Gnosticsim, as Rashcke says, one of the greatest heresies of all time and one that has overtaken American Evangelicalism. Basically Raschke beckons us to worship God by way the Spirit and not the letter (or knowledge) of the law, for as Paul said, the Spirit gives life but the written code (of reason) kills. But faith alone as Martin Luther said, and Raschke is fond of repeating, makes us uneasy. We need our hard and fast idols. And America (conservative as well as liberal) is all about the idolatry of the written codes, the idols of reason, and salvation through obedience to (many) laws. Evangelicalism is not about the freedom of the New Tesatment writers because Evangeliscals are afraid that freedom leads directly to gay marriages, gun laws and teenage abortions. So once again we have \\"a fence built around the law\\" -- the ancient call to protect God from Man by legalisms. \\"On both the left and right, Protestantism - with its denominational, ministerial, and ecumenical councils, its political action committees, its preoccupation with palaces proffered as church buildings, its elaborate financial schemes and fund-raising...It has buttressed these worldly ambitions with regal rationalism that aggrandizes the institution of the church and its claims at the expense of broken souls crying out for grace and forgiveness.\\" Raschke is pointing us back to the God who cares not about the widow's penny (much less the golden calf of materialism), but about a broken and contrite heart. God cares about our relationship to him above all else. \\"Proofs, \\"reasons,\\" and \\"the rule of law\\" are not the basis for a relationship. They do not make for \\"Good News.\\" Jesus broke rules, he didn't make up more rules. And look what happened to him. In one of the greates insights of the book, Raschke points out that Hitler had a lot more in common with Hegel than Nietzsche.As a friend of mine emailed me after reading this book, echoing my own sentiments, \\"I no longer feel like I have to write this book, Raschke did it for me.\\""},{"Title":"Next Reformation, The: Why Evangelicals Must Embrace Postmodernity","review":"Finally, an exposition of postmodernity and emergence that connects the present cultural revolution of the West to its historical roots. With a style and level of scholarship not unlike Alasdair MacIntyre's \\"After Virtue,\\" Raschke presents postmodernity in Western secular and Christian cultures with poise, grace, and thoughtfulness. The work is accompanied by a host of practical conclusions (both direct and implied) for those seeking to understand themselves and world today and respond in an informed manner. For all who have found McLaren difficult to take seriously, Raschke will be a refreshing, deep, and profoundly complex read that simultaneously manages to maintain a humble yet direct tone throughout every chapter."},{"Title":"Next Reformation, The: Why Evangelicals Must Embrace Postmodernity","review":"Raschke is undertaking a monumental task. He is attempting to critique the Evangelicals for theological errors arising from their adoption of modern, reson based theology, which reduces faith to something common. And while critique we must, we should also define who they are and what they believe. Raschke never did. So I remain puzzled as to whom and what he critiques. Does he have a problem with Evangelical greats like Charles Spurgeon or with more recent ones like Billy Graham?Worse, Raschke falsely equats Evangelicals with Catholics when he says that Christianity for Evangelicals is more about morals than about relational love to God. How can Evangelical Christianity be about morals when Evangelicals along with all other denominations had rejected the Ten Commandments.Evangelicals like any other denomination sure have their problems. One could accuse them of many things: unconditional support for Israel despite continued aggression; excessive involvement with politics (Roe vs. Wade), etc... I would have liked to see how Evangelical theology results in their actions: how their faith shows in their works...?I enjoyed the book because it gave a comprehensive account of Western philosophy from Aristotle to Kierkegaard and Derrida. But in this post-modern age Mr. Raschke's, convoluted exegesis of their writings, ought to have been replaced by a more accessible idiom. C.S. Luis wrote about ethereal and spiritual notions but he used clear and accessible language.Raschke's discussion in favor of the \\"infallibility\\" of scripture vice \\"inerrancy\\" confused me. I was hoping for an example. Perhaps Raschke could have given the example of Matthew 2:15, where Matthew states that scripture was \\"fulfilled\\" when God called Jesus out of Egypt. According to inerrancy theory Hosea had Jesus specifically in mind. According to infallibility theory Matthew simply found Hosea's words applicable to Matthew's time.Perhaps Raschke is a great theologian but he does not know his bible. In Chapter 6, he is talking about the \\"Priesthood of all Worshippers\\". To justify his opinion he uses secondary sources instead of going straight to Ex 19:5 and I Pet 2:9. Since all believers are priests unto God, Catholic notion of priests and mediators must be rejected.I also enjoyed the book because it brought me back to fundamental Christian faith in which God is not an object of philosophical study but a person who seeks a relationship with his creation, or better yet - God seeks a relationship with me and I must respond. Thank you Mr. Raschke!After reading this book, I am now better prepared to show off my ecumenical erudition to my less enlightened friends... I can say to them that the difference between modernism and post-modernism is that modernism is about reason and post-modernism is about the limitation of it. The modernist would have you believe that God can be studied and understood, while the post-modernist would be more cautious as to our ability to do that.After all, how can we study God when we failed to study monkeys, until we went in their midst? And like Woody Allan once commented (in paraphrase), \\"If there is an exclusive club that would accept me, I don't want to be its member\\". If God can be understood by reason he is not worthy of my worship. My God is bigger than anything I can imagine, for if HE can be imagined then he is a small God.Raschke drives home the relational God we must uncover from the \\"... Egypt of metaphysics and Babylon of modernism...\\" (Pg 215). But Raschke did not elucidate specific failures of Evangelicals whom he set out to critique.He could have mentioned false doctrines prevalent among Evangelicals, which ultimately make them unworthy to be called Christians. These doctrines are: Immortality of the Soul, Iternally burning hell, Seven years of tribulation, Jewish remnant, Rejection of the Ten Commandments and more.These false doctrines come form rejecting the Ten Commandments and specifically the Saturday Sabbath. And no amount of Pentecostal emotionalism or post-modern adjustments to modern rationality, would suffice to acknowledge the relational God of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and Jesus... For further reading I recommendThe Glory of Joshua."},{"Title":"Next Reformation, The: Why Evangelicals Must Embrace Postmodernity","review":"No doubt, over the next half century there will be no shortage of ink spilled in reconciling postmodern philosophy with modern theology and religion. Raschke's book is an excellent starting place for anyone looking to get in on this conversation.Raschke writes assuming that the reader will have little or no experience with postmodern philosophy, or philosophy at all. While the issues and ideas might not be easily picked up by the philosophy beginner, they will at least be covered. As my undergrad philosophy professor used to say, \\"Clear as mud, but it covers the ground.\\"Those more advanced in philosophical thought will probably find this to be the book's biggest fault as well. Philosophical conversations that took thousands of pages and hundreds of years to come by are covered in a page or two.I give this book three stars because it does not do a great job of bridging the gap that I mentioned above. The beginner will probably be too confused by Raschke's somewhat convoluted academic style of writing. The more experienced philosopher will gain some interesting ideas to think about in terms of postmodernism's value in theology. Personally, I was somewhat amused that a Derrida scholar could also be a big fan of German Reformation thought and Pentecostal emotionalism. I could probably bump this review up a star for that fact alone."},{"Title":"Next Reformation, The: Why Evangelicals Must Embrace Postmodernity","review":"\\"The Next Reformation\\" is not armchair theology/philosophy, though it is among Dr. Carl Raschke's more accessible texts. Carl is a world-class professional postmodern philosopher who happens to love God and the church; he has done today's North American church a great service in writing.Could it be that history will reveal Derrida and the postmodernists as providing a service not unlike the service provided by Luther and the protestant reformers? I think Raschke would answer, \\"Damn right!\\"Carl evangelizes evangelicals with God's invitation to faith/relationship offered through the prophets of postmodernity. I was almost expecting an altar-call, inviting evangelical Christians to personally accept and live into an existential conversion to a life of faith transcending objective truth, inerrancy, and worldviews. I highly recommend this text."},{"Title":"Next Reformation, The: Why Evangelicals Must Embrace Postmodernity","review":"The reviewer below who cited logical errors in Raschke's thinking is dead-on, and he identifies a common larger fallacy in postmodern thinking - namely, inconsistent logic. It's a favorite tool of the modern scholar to use straw men and ad hominems, because in so doing, they subtly trick their listeners into thinking they've got the \\"other guy\\"'s number, then they go ahead and tear apart the argument.Personally, I'd be wary of anyone who wants to marry Christianity and postmodernism, because the two worldviews are fundamentally opposed to one another. This book is slick, and Raschke's a talented writer, but he's wrong. A better (or at least complimentary) read on postmodernism is Groothuis's \\"Truth Decay\\", because he accurately represents both thought-systems."},{"Title":"Next Reformation, The: Why Evangelicals Must Embrace Postmodernity","review":"I'm beginning my final semester in the M.A.-Philosophy of Religion program at Denver Seminary, and my first response to this book when I began reading it was, \\"Can this really have been published under the auspices of Baker Academic Press?\\"The book is fraught with straw man fallacies, wherein Raschke misrepresents a position and then responds to his caricature instead of the view from which he derived it.Fallacies ad hominem are everywhere. He attacks so many different people, many of whom he accuses of being \\"polemical,\\" rather than addressing their arguments and ideas.Worse still is the lack of adequate citation--Raschke has missed three footnotes in the first chapter alone, so not only is the authorship poor, but the editing needs help as well.Finally, and this must be said: McLaren, Raschke, et. al. must learn that in attacking those who have argued against incorporating postmodern philosophy into Christian thought that arguments about what has happened in history do not win the day when pitted against logical arguments from sound premises. One cannot merely market the ideologies and occurrences within history as \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\" and then, using labels like \\"modern\\" and \\"postmodern,\\" argue against their opponents simply because they are propounding an ideology that was popular last century.This is equivalent to arguing with a Ford designer who has just expounded on all of the technical aspects of a new Ford design that no one ought to buy a Ford because of the Pinto scandal and the Explorer tire fiasco. NOT ALL FORDS ARE BAD CARS. Similarly, not all thinkers with \\"modernist\\" tendencies are bereft of anything good to say. Thus we cannot reject a writer or teacher merely because he or she has thought and written according to values from within the modern tradition.Furthermore, back to the Ford analogy, if some Fords have been found to have flaws and we decide not to drive Fords any longer, WE ARE NOT JUSTIFIED IN ASSUMING THAT HONDAS ARE THE BEST THING ON THE MARKET. By ruling out \\"modernism,\\" \\"modernity,\\" and things of that nature, a postmodern thinker has not in any way indicated that his or her solution to the shortcomings of the past century is the best one to be had. Anyone who does careful research will discover that postmodernity is the [...] child of modernity! The development of postmodern thought was the logical but unintended consequence of modern culture's rise. The seeds of postmodernism were found in modern thought and culture. Consequently, by criticizing modern thought and culture, postmodernists often refute themselves by undercutting the logical and cultural bases for the assumptions from which they argue. In Philosophy we call statements of this ilk, \\"self-referentially incoherent.\\"Raschke has thoughtlessly committed all of these missteps, and Baker has wasted time, money and paper publishing one man's (egregiously misleading) soapbox, and doing so under the guise of \\"academic\\" publication.Other consumers would be wise to avoid this sort of writing in the future for several reasons. First, buying it encourages it (I'm guilty on this score). Second, propagating this sort of poor scholarship is giving a bad name to Christian academics and Christians in secular academics (who aren't usually the wannabes that Raschke so thoughtlessly brands them, cf. Dallas Willard, Alvin Plantinga, and Mortimer Adler, to name a few). Third, it allows Baker and other publishing houses to fall into disrepute with the academic community, such that if they were to publish something of some academic rigor it may be disregarded on the grounds that \\"most\\" or even \\"some\\" of what comes out of these publishing houses is not of high academic quality. Finally, in giving an audience to poorly-reasoned thought processes like Raschke's we wantonly entertain falsehood and spin, to the degree that even if the writer's conclusions are correct, were we to offer his or her justifications in discussions within the secular sphere (discussions that we ought to be having as per the Great Commission), we would only succeed in shooting our credibility with or confusing our neighbors who are not of Christian persuasion. Since I do not believe that anyone with anything to share maintains this goal, writing such as Raschke's ought to be banned, not legalistically, but consumeristically.[...]"},{"Title":"Next Reformation, The: Why Evangelicals Must Embrace Postmodernity","review":"I've been reading several of the tomes on the Emerging Church and the need to become \\"postmodern\\".

Their's is an elite brotherhood more worthy of familial loyalty than any God-ordained fraternity could hope for. That I, an evangelical evidential apologist (God forgive me), am his brother in Christ is evidently of less concern to Dr. Raschke than impressing his fellow ivy leaguers. No doubt he accomplished his goal with The Next Reformation; post-modernist academia is surely impressed. Or are they? Most likely they are snickering behind his back, just as they do to all Christians. How quaint. A philosopher of the new school, who actually believes in Jesus. I thought only those pathetically passe modernist dimwits were Christians. But here we have a postmodernist smart guy professing faith. Fools apparently come in ever increasing forms.Dr. Rashke has it so wrong. Pre-modernists and Modernists are not the enemy. Classical apologists are not the enemy. Satan, the father of lies, is the enemy. Truth is good. Falsehood is bad. They are both real and objectively discernable. I stand by this irrespective of Dr. Rashke's condemnation.Though technically well written and referenced, the author cannot seem to escape the gravity of his own monotonic condescension. As a rhetorical style, incessant snippiness does tend to undermine an author's message. On the other hand, in the post modern world there really is no \\"message\\" as such, so no harm done. If there is a Next Reformation coming, it will arise from a more insightful pursuit of objective truth, not its denial or destruction."},{"Title":"Next Reformation, The: Why Evangelicals Must Embrace Postmodernity","review":"Forward: of course what I have to say about the author's intention could be made even if Raschke had never existed since PM asserts the death of the author and the text's meaning(s) - we are free to play with his meanings (which are fictions) and make up our own intentions (deconstructively) and so it is important to keep in mind that any review here is false, and true at the same time, because really, since a propositional notion of truth and meaning is false, as he says, there is no propositional content for any reader of this book to embrace, and hence we cannot hold beliefs (and the SAME beliefs) about this book.Theists, while decrying the 'rationalism' of philosophers, either contemporary or historical, use those philosophers' ideas when it serves their own purposes. This is what Raschke does. Basically the whole point is that Postmodern attacks on reason and rationality provide evidence (!!) that knowledge is impossible, so that faith only is what is needed. The only problem is that once you let in irrationalism and nihilism it will infect everything - it is very hard to contain. Indeed, giving an argument that only faith, not reason, is required shows the contradiction in the position. It is an old position and nothing really new - only the names have changed.There is no relation between the Reformers and PMs that could not have been found between PMs and the Romantics, counter-Enlightenment figures. They all share the emphasis on irrationality and that Raschke picks the Reformers (his interpretations are questionable at best), show the serendipity of his position - he could have chosen Kierkegaard, Rousseau, Blake or any others, making his title \\"The Next Romanticism\\" or \\"The Next Theistic Existentialism.\\" It's arbitrary at best. The reformers were part of older traditions which they used for their own end, like this book. Specifically, the Reformation was the reaffirmation of Augustine's view of salavation, and rejection of his view of the church, so why not go back to Augustine instead? Because he's too rational. It is fallacious to think Philip Melanchthon would believe that language has only private meaning, if any meaning at all. He used the philosophical tools available to defend a more rational faith - he was called the 'mind of the reformation.' Raschke's selective use of ideas and figures calls into question the whole enterprise. There is much he does not tell you - it's what he does NOT say that is important.One could make similar arguments using any philosopher and any tradition because traditions span time. While decrying and declaiming others' uses of philosophies he does not agree with, and decrying using modernism itself, he embraces postmodernism and uses the philosophies he likes; he thus makes the same mistake he chides others for - uncritical use of a philosophy in theism. 50 years from now we will wonder how theism so bought into a worldly philosophy. If as an analytic theist I think PM is misguided, this is a reasonable stance; he does not deal with this other than name-calling (or as one reviewer called it \\"bomb-throwing\\"). And how can he decry evangelicalism's use of philosophy while reducing theism to irrationalist PM philosophy requiring faith, not reason? Pretty silly really. Again, it's just an old argument using irrationalist PM philosophy to motivate irrationalist, subjectivist fideism. One could just as well use Berkeley, Locke or whomever to motivate evidentialism. In 1982 Smith in \\"Beyond the Postmodern Mind\\" says those who wish to defend religion have used the discourse of Postmodernity to declaim modernity and Enlightenment rationalism. 1982!! Like I said, nothing new.Once you reject that the object of a belief is a proposition, all you have is subjective experiences relative to minds (solipsism) and nothing outside of them. If there are no propositions then obviously two people cannot believe the same thing since there is nothing they share (like a proposition) in a believing-event. This the cash value of the retreat into PM irrationalism.As an academic philosopher, I have heard other profs use Postmodernism to motivate fideism and irrationalism. The students rightly objected that it ended in subjectivism and relativism. Again, once you let in irrationalism it's hard to contain.In reading many of the contemporary PMs, even they themselves claim PM's time has passed. Indeed, we live in a postmodern world (postmodernITY, post-industrial, late capitalist and so on), though PostmodernISM is dying a slow death. It is like anything - it rises, then fades. PM is now in a critical reappraisal of itself phase, questioning its own foundations. This is the natural course of all philosophies and one reason philosophy keeps moving ahead without getting stuck. Unfortunately this book is evidence of an uncritical acceptance of a fading way of thought - once again, an Evangelical is about 10 years behind the times. In contemporary academia PM is mostly kept alive in liberal Lit departments, and the Marxist critique of PM is in full swing. The problem with this book is that it conflates Postmodernity and Postmdernism - a simple mistake.One major objection is the tone of the work. Name-calling and insults to other Christians (\\"wall-flowers\\"), who might not believe everything you have to say is immature at best. Evangelicals will never reach the world if their testimony to others does not rise above petty name-calling and bickering between themselves."},{"Title":"Next Reformation, The: Why Evangelicals Must Embrace Postmodernity","review":".I would like to praise and commend Dr. Raschke PhD. on his recent book entitled, The Next Reformation.At first glance I thought the book was a fraud, but then I got to thinking. Of course I know, along with any thinking person, that someone with Raschke's credentials could never seriously be promoting a confusing French salon, anti-rational, hippy-styled, New Age , postmillennial charismatic, circular faith-in-faith message. Since it was published as an Baker Academic series I knew the confusion had to be all mine - but what was I missing?Suddenly the light came on. Eureka! This is, of course, a satire of purest brilliance - right? Yes of course - what else. Applying postmodern literary theory to my reading I found all that was required for the book to make sense was the proper personal recontextualization of what the author only appeared to be saying.The struggle I was having with the book was nothing more than trying to apply the old notion that the author had an intend. Once I realized the author was \\"dead\\" in the metaphorical sense I jumped right in and became the author myself. It was like going to a 3-D movie and waiting half way through to put on the special glasses.In it he has exposed the witless farce of postmodernism, what the social commentator and humorist Gene Shepard use to call, \\"Creeping Meatballism,\\" in a way that no critique could by pretending to be writing in its support. This is a great example of classic Anglo-Saxon humorous satire that exposes by extending an issue into the absurd, which Raschke does with great skill and subtlety.It was pure genius how he seemed to capture the contradiction and schizophrenic drift of substance and style not to mention the sophomoric, arbitrary misuse of sources. Stringing together such persons as Tertullian (who was a follower of Montanus which might be the real starting point of all this anterior to Augustine.) to Luther (who didn't object to the Book of Revelations because he wasn't interested in eschatology, as the author suggests, as much as his questioning its authorship and Christology which was a big un-pomo concern of his) and then, as the punch line, introducing Aquarian Conspirator Margaret Ferguson (how she slips into a book about why Evangelical Christians should do anything is beyond me) as proto-pomos I thought nothing short of confused - until I got the joke.Anyone thinking they might have postmodernist leanings need only read this book to be sent careening back into the arms of common sense if only to catch one's breath. This book demonstrates a fresh and most original form of Christian apologetics in a post-Christian era. How better to jump-start the still viable parts of postmodernist gray matter than to cause it to dialogue with itself? Such a ploy might be considered deceptive, mean-spirited or even cruel if it were not so badly needed.As a tool for evangelism the book transcends mere messages about hell and hopeless perdition by causing the reader to actually experience it as did the movie Memento cause us to experience short-term memory loss along with the protagonist.Finally, something else Dr. Raschke cleverly exposes is how contemporary philosophy has become the Wizard's Apprentice of the going scientistic theory of the day. Whereas contemporaries of Einstein attempted to apply relativism to social morals, Raschke has convincingly demonstrated how postmodernists have paralleled quantum theory in literary critique by writing his own book simultaneously from ten different dimensions rather than following a single train of thought toward any discernable conclusion.Heisenburg's Uncertainty Principal is handled as well in that any attempt to measure anything the author says seems to necessarily alter it. Further, the reader can try to imagine what larger point he's trying to make or try to comprehend what he's actually saying, but never at the same time.In the Next Reformation Raschke appears just a bit self-serving on more than one occasion but if my analysis is correct this is only an attempt to parody the postmodernist goal of the \\"death of authorship\\" with the \\"death of readership\\" by making authorship the sole object of writing. What Raschke is really telling us is that, through all the abstract convoluted metaphor, and the difficult, ultimately meaningless self-referential technical jargon, most postmodern writing is really about, \\"READ ME.\\" Of course he could have just told us that but what he did was make us feel it. Philosophy as theatre.The claims made by the author that postmodernism is the only serious intellectual method used these days or that it is sweeping the Evangelical seminaries is of course purposely exaggerated in order to challenge and even goad those academics to take a harder look at its roots with a rigor that has been lacking.Having some contact with Christian institutions of higher learning the message I'm getting is that there are a growing number of academics who have already devoting the time to critically review the implications and are taking up the warning. Others still brush it off as a trend that will go the way of the Shaker movement, and for the same reasons.I think I finally get it (although I once thought that about Wittgenstein in younger days) and I'm quite sure many others do as well, like the first contributors below that wrote that he actually enjoys the indiscriminate throwing of emotive pseudo-intellectual bombs into crowded class rooms like some anarchist. This can be nothing more than dry witty humor I'm sure.I leave you with my favorite quote from Rorty: \\"The only valid view a philosopher should have regarding views is to have no view at all.\\" With this in mind I'd like to say that it is my view, if I had a view (nothing written here should be construed as expressing a view which I can't \\"litterally\\" have) that Raschke has composed the most eloquent requiem for postmodernism to date."},{"Title":"A Chemist's Guide to Density Functional Theory, 2nd Edition","review":"Computational and Theoretical chemists concerned with the applications of canonical quantum chemistry (molecular orbital) methods to chemically interesting problems know too well how (computationally) demanding is going beyond the Hartree-Fock (HF) approximation by employing the so called post-HF methods. Hence, very often they must resort on using Density Functional Theory (DFT). Here, however, they need to confront themselves with the terminology invented by their physics collegues: Kohn-Sham orbitals, Fermi hole, local and non-local spin-density functionals, generalized gradient approximation, pseudopotentials, and so forth. Any terminology is associated to a certain model of thought, which requires lot of efforts to be fully comprehended.The book of Koch and Holthausen represents a praiseworthy attempt of presenting the basic concepts of DFT to research chemists. This 300-pages book is organized in two parts and it contains 13 chapters. Part A is concerned with the definition of the (DFT) model, while Part B discusses the performance of the model in dealing with molecular structures, vibrational frequencies, thermochemical, electrical and magnetic properties, H-bonds, and chemical reactivity. A rich bibliography is appended at the end of the book.

Surprisingly, these chemists spend entire chapters on just about every piece of DFT. They even give many examples, using the Hydrogen molecule as an example quite a few times.This book is fairly recent, published in 2001. It talks about many DFT codes used today and important functionals such as B3LYP.

It's a typical Victorian melodrama, with coincidences abounding everywhere, and florid speeches and unusual (for our time) actions by the main characters.

I especially liked the one scene on the ice, as one of the characters struggles to maintain his control. As is often the case, much of the problems could be avoided if the characters talked to each other, but that wouldn't be much of a story.The Frozen Deep is an enjoyable read, and worthy addition to your free Kindle library.If you liked Mr. Collins' other work, give the Frozen Deep a try."},{"Title":"The Frozen Deep","review":"This short novel was so interesting to me because it was orginally a play written by Wilkie Collins and Charles Dickens and was performed all over England, even in front of Queen Victoria. Apparently it was performed to rave reviews and even caused tears in the auience. It was based on stories of Arctic expeditions which was so popular at the time.Okay, I didn't cry but it was quite a captivating story of Victorian England. The plot involves a lover's triangle. Clara has someone become the love interest of a rather intense sailor named Richard. He assumes they are to be married and leaves on a long trip. Clara has never promised herself to Richard and during his absence falls in love with Frank. When Richard returns and finds his love betrothed to another, he becomes rather crazy and vows revenge on Frank.As fate would have (or a good plot twist), Richard and Frank are paired up on a sailing expedition to the Arctic. In what has to be the epitome of a Victorian romance, the fate of Frank hangs in the balance as he is stranded on the ice with only Richard to save him.Again, if you love Victorian English literature, this is truly a delight.

The story takes place in the year 1827 in the Lancaster County town of Sunrise. Jane Foster is in a truly unhappy marriage with Hiram Foster. She takes care of his family store while he travels around the country ordering supplies. The love has gone out of their marriage rapidly, as he only wanted someone to oversee the family business while he could continue his philandering ways. When he fails to return home and the business is going downhill, Jane writes to her Aunt in Philadelphia for help. That help arrives in the form of a lawyer named Daniel Colton.Jane considers herself to be plain. When she first meets handsome Daniel, tempers flare and her stubborn ways nearly send him away. Still, he sees a strong, intelligent woman, and becomes enchanted with the beauty of her soul. When Hiram Foster is found dead and Jane is accused of murdering him, Daniel takes on her defense with a vengeance. He has come to love this plain Jane and she him; and he is determined to use all that he can to save her from the gallows.Sunrise is a richly woven tale about a small town in the early 1800's. The mood of the town and its people is deftly captured by Delia Parr. The heroine is strong, a catalyst for the action, and aptly shows why beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Daniel is strong and faithful, a counterpoint to Jane's weak and unfaithful husband. The secondary characters add strength to the story and show Jane's heart to its best advantage. All in all, this is a heartwarming story which will have you on the edge of your seat as its tale enfolds."},{"Title":"Sunrise","review":"In 1831 Sunrise, Pennsylvania, Jane Foster is stunned by her vile spouse's affair with her sister-in-law.

Her Philadelphia aunt sends cynical big shot lawyer Daniel Colton to initially help Jane with her finances, but now he acts as her defense attorney on a murder charge. To his shock, Daniel falls in love with the pure and innocent plain Jane, but to save her life he may have to sacrifice her scruples.Delia Parr, nominee of a Reviewers Choice award, continues to demonstrate her ability to provide readers with an interesting Americana romance. SUNRISE is an exciting historical legal romance that brings to life nineteenth century Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. Hiram is a classic rat while Jane first appears to be a doormat, but eventully proves her moral strength. Daniel is an intelligent, cynical hunk who will leave readers' hearts aflutter. Ms. Parr's novel is on a par with some of the sub-genre's best works.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Sunrise","review":"Sunrise is a story of sacrifice and loss--of dignity and seemingly of grace. But it is also a story of redemption and rewards, of greater good. I read the review that called this story boring and was stunned. This book was anything but boring to me! Different tastes, I suppose. I was fascinated by the depth of character and the resilience of Jane. And inspired by the sadness and misery in her life becoming happiness and joy. It's a wonderful story of hope and belief in change and things getting better. It offers brighter tomorrows and better todays. I loved that."},{"Title":"Sunrise","review":"Delia Parr is a good author of interesting, CLEAN, early America romances. This book start on a good note but went downhill very quickly. The reason-the heroine, supposedly from lack of self esteem from being plain, let's everyone walk over her, abuse her, and treat her badly. About halfway in when were at the point that she's being put on trial for her horrible husband's murder, but won't speak up for herself, because she doesn't want to hurt her brother by letting him know of his wife's affair with her dead husband-I just quit in disgust!I know that this book is set in early America-but I have no sympathy for a heroine that's not willing to stick up for herself. I don't think that's a good message to send to women either.Delia Parr does write better than this-I'd recommend another of her books.3 stars for a good try...."},{"Title":"Sunrise","review":"This was my first and very likely my last book by Delia Parr. ... it is interesting to note that there are only two reviews for this book, so what does that say for it????? Why would poor Jane even consider marrying the man she did?? Couldn't she see his character since she had so many good qualities??? This was such a boring book, I cannot even continue. Sorry, folks. I'm sure no one will ever see this."},{"Title":"The tree of enlightenment: An introduction to the major traditions of Buddhism","review":"The Tree of Enlightenment is a very ambitious work in that in the space of less than 400 pages attempts to summarize and serve as guide to 2,500 years of Buddhist practices, writings, philosophies, symbolisms, etc. This work is a remarkable accomplishment in that a beginning reader can, in fact, learn a substantial amount about Buddhism(s) and its development, and the many cultures that it penetrated, without having one's head reel from an overload of minute facts. The clear and logical organization, that goes from introducing the fundamentals, to some elaboration in considering the Mahayana tradition, to a concise but credible introduction to Vajrayana (commonly know as Tibetan Buddhism), and finally, a succinct discussion of the foundation of all Buddhist philosophical discourse--the Abidharma. The language in the book is easily accessible and the book may be downloaded for free, or acquired for no cost from the Buddha Educational Foundation. Its one downfall is being rather poorly written and therefore this reader would recommend the significantly better written A Concise History of Buddhism by Andrew Skilton's; if the pocketbook allows that."},{"Title":"The tree of enlightenment: An introduction to the major traditions of Buddhism","review":"This is a good basic explanation of Buddhism, but is not, as noted above, very well written.

I imagine that for those who practice these faiths, there is nothing new in this book, and indeed at first it might seem as just another compendium of religions and their beliefs.But the book is more than that. Although it correctly marks the differences between Catholic and protestant churches (after all this is yet another volume of his history of the catholic church), it also stresses the common points in a true and enlightning ecumenical effort, showing the common bonds of christian churches, calling all of them (and rightly so) \\"Our brothers in Christ\\". To me, it was revealing and comfortable to learn through those wise pages, the common bond I have, as catholic, with the up to then almost ignored religions. A perfect end to a very good history of the church."},{"Title":"Lady In Waiting: Developing Your Love Relationships","review":"Our ladies group used this book for book study. we found it to be very biblical and easy to understand. It is espeically helpful for younger single ladies. I will highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Lady In Waiting: Developing Your Love Relationships","review":"In the preface, the authors declare this book applies to women at any state in life. I was excited to hear this, as I know God is not calling me to married life. However, the overall emphasis IS on the period of a woman's life when she is waiting for a husband. The book tends to generalize many topics, which is sad. I was pleased with the way they carried the biblical theme of Ruth throughout the entire book, but otherwise any metaphorical examples where sparse and underdeveloped. I did not care for the writing style which was used, as it was often dry, and failed to provide vivid word images in critical places. While I have described some of the drawbacks, this book DOES present several good points. I feel it can open a person's eyes to many truths regarding relationships. BUT I believe it should motivate a person to move on to reading the books with specific advice from relationship/marriage specialists such as Dobson and Smalley. Overall, it was a good book, but it often failed to deal with the gritty realities in a provoking way."},{"Title":"Lady In Waiting: Developing Your Love Relationships","review":"Lady in Waiting answers prayers and just makes sence.

I give you this garentee- that if you follow this book, you will find YOUR LOVE- Mr Right!"},{"Title":"Lady In Waiting: Developing Your Love Relationships","review":"I highly reccomend this book to all Christian women"},{"Title":"Lady In Waiting: Developing Your Love Relationships","review":"It has been asked before why a male would read such a book as LADY IN WAITING. My answer to the question is that I am sincerely interested in how the female mind works and what women expect out of a relationship. Of course, I'm often curious as to how correct books like this are concerning what men are really like (or should be like). I've read several books like this and I must say that so far LADY IN WAITING is the best.To begin with the book has a Biblical core, it's written with the Book of Ruth as it's foundation. Many books like this don't have such an indebth Biblical basis. Granted there are a few things one could argue about (I think Ruth's uncovering Boaz's feet wasn't an act of purity, but was actually quite radical and scandlous), but overall the authors are right on the money.Secondly, the book gives a positive view of men and is usually correct about the role of a man in life.Finally, this book doesn't offer false hope. Many books similar to LADY IN WAITING promise that if a women follows such and such steps, she will eventually catch her man. LADY IN WAITING offers no such promises. It is implicit in reminding the reader that only in God can a women be completely made whole, not in a husband and clearly illustrates that not all women will are meant to be married. An enjoyable and informative read, one that females will probably get even more out of than a young bachelor like myself."},{"Title":"Lady In Waiting: Developing Your Love Relationships","review":"I first read this book when my husband and I were still in a dating relationship, before our marriage. The teachings in this book helped me to keep my focus on the most important relationship in my life--my relationship with Jesus. We women can have a tendency to allow our fellowship with the Lord to lapse when we meet a special man and the Lord begins to take second place in our lives. This book was a powerful reminder to me that even AFTER you meet Mr. Right, it's my relationship with my Lord that must still take precedence. This book helped me to keep my mind, heart, AND body pure for my husband-to-be. Now that I've been married five years, the lessons learned from Debby and Jackie are still applicable today. I have a wonderful husband (a real Boaz!) but even a great marriage has growing pains. When I find myself in times of discouragement or dissatisfaction in my marital relationship, I remember that it's not my husband's job to fulfill me, it's the Lord's job. It never fails that when I do a spiritual checkup, I discover that it's really my relationship with Jesus that needs the tune up and when I start giving Jesus my devotion once again, my discouragement always disappears, confirming what Debby and Jackie are teaching with this book--only Jesus can make us whole. If more women realized this principle, there might be fewer divorces among God's people."},{"Title":"Lady In Waiting: Developing Your Love Relationships","review":"For any woman searching for Mr. Right this book is a must. This book encourages the reader to give up their search for the man of their dreams and begin looking to God to fill the void in their lives. It isn't until we as women realize that only God can fill our deepest longing that we are truly able to find happiness when God brings &quot;His Best&quot; into our lives. Will you trust God to provide for you the joy that only He can give? The authors of the book set great boundaries for starting a relationship and going through the stages until marriage. Letting him pursue you is a big encouragement in this book. The loving advice given in this book will truly change the way you look at dating relationships. Instead of frantically searching for &quot;the man&quot; to marry, allow yourself to wait on God. He will prove faithful! Will you trust your creator and lover of your soul to provide for this desire of your heart? If it is God's will for you to marry, He has someone very special in mind. Don't settle for second best. God wants you to find joy and fulfillment in your relationships. This book tells you how!"},{"Title":"Lady In Waiting: Developing Your Love Relationships","review":"I found this book while exploring the Amazon for books on Christian dating. I've already read Joshua Harris' books (I Kissed Dating Goodbye, Boy Meets Girl), When God Writes Your Love Story (Eric &amp; Leslie Ludy), I Gave Dating a Chance, Getting Ready for the Guy/Girl Thing, etc. And all of these are very good books, but most are not on &quot;my level.&quot; The first 4 seemed to be written for those at the &quot;marrying age&quot;, and being 16 I do not feel I am qualified to be at that stage in life. The last one (I believe) is written for the pre-teen; the girl/boy who hasn't the slightest clue how to even speak to a member of the opposite gender.But Lady in Waiting is different. Debbie &amp; Jackie address the female crowd of singles; those who are not in a dating relationship. Many times reading even a Christian book on dating can get you down. I used to think &amp; pray, &quot;I agree with everything they're saying. When's it my turn, Lord? Why am I not in a relationship with a guy now? Where is Mr. Right?&quot; But Lady in Waiting has been teaching me about Ruth. How she used her free time as a widow for God's glory; not wallowing in her own self pity.I have a new resolve to become the lady God wants me to be. After all, if I want God to send me a man after His own heart who loves me as I am, I need to become someone worthy of such devotion.So, if you're sick of waiting, read Lady in Waiting."},{"Title":"Lady In Waiting: Developing Your Love Relationships","review":"&quot;Lady in Waiting,&quot; a remarkable book with powerful insights will touch every woman's heart. Debby Jones and Jackie Kendall created a masterpiece that focuses on putting God first in one's life. &quot;Lady in Waiting,&quot; designed for any age, accurately examines problems and concerns women in today's society face. Every woman rushes to get things done as quickly as possible. With &quot;Lady in Waiting&quot; one learns how to slow down, wait for God to answer prayers, and in return, be rewarded with a sense of pride. Patience, the most difficult quality to develop and apply in the fast-pace world of today, seems to be the primary focus of Jones and Kendall's book as well as lives. The authors reveal that when women have patience when dealing with challenges in life; they get more accomplished. It captivates women moving them to their inner cores. The strong Christian values and beliefs are evident throughout the book as the women praise and glorify God. The authors wrote &quot;Lady in Waiting&quot; from a second person point of view. The point of view, containing many rhetorical questions, makes women stop and realize their priorities in life. Many spiritual books have been written which also agree that patience, the key to life's happpiness, must be found in every relationship. &quot;Lady in Waiting&quot; stands out from other similar novels, however, due to the authors' decision to direct the book primarily to women. Although men and women are completely different in expressing emotion, every woman faces the same emotional drama in life. &quot;Lady in Waiting&quot; has influenced a variety of people including pastors, youth leaders, single and married women, high school and college women, and career women. The amazing impact of this magnificent book will last forever in a woman's heart. As Jones and Kendall honestly and accurately evaluate the struggles women face in the 90's; they soothe the soul with God's miraculous word. The Bible-the women's only source of data-displays biblical truths. Although the women only use one key source, the Bible, and many quote, thoughts, stories, and inserts of other women; the book helps develop the reader into an independent, secure woman of God. The authors answer all of women's typical questions and concerns about issues such as, reckless abondonment, diligence, faith, virtue, devotion, purity, security, contentment, conviction, and most importantly, patience. The authors style of simplicity and the profound literary tactic of emotionally involving the reader, are incredible. The wonderfully written passages of elegance leave no room for argument, as they accurately secure women in the awesome power of God. The authors creatively wrote the book clearly in order to influence all women. Personally, I agree with Jones and Kendall about the importance of remebering God is the only one who can give us total security. Women depend on husbands and fathers as their strong-hold in life, but the only one who is always there for us to be our true strength is God. I have strong beliefs and morals in life as I walk with God daily. The influence of the authors values persuade me to stay true to myself and not waver in my beliefs, but influence others as I have been influenced. &quot;Lady in Waiting&quot; is definitely the best book I have ever read. The authors' extraordinary book actually had the strength to emotionally move me and make me feel replenished after reading this delightful book. I feel I have learned more about the wonders of God and His plan for me in developing my love relationships. I highly recommend this wonderous book to all women who want to find God's perspective on life."},{"Title":"Lady In Waiting: Developing Your Love Relationships","review":"I was introduced to Lady in Waiting a few years back and I was intrigued by the idea of \\"reckless abandoning to Jesus\\" because it focused on ways a woman can become better and more appealing based on how she relates to God. However, under careful reading I noticed that the book is very legalistic in how women are to approach their relationship to God. The book falsely conveys Ruth as being rewarded and approved by God only for performing ideal tasks and behaviors. Lady in Waiting promotes a guilt-driven works oriented standard to live up to in order to gain God's acceptance and maybe His reward (i.e. a husband) if He chooses to. The book is just not biblical based because many of the scriptures taken from Ruth(the book from the Bible)are wrong, twisted or out of context to fit the authors own ideas and objectives. It also seems like the authors neglect to reveal how through relationships good or bad, God is still able to move. Also that even if we fulfill this formula by becoming... (Lady of Purity, Faith) we may still not be liked, desired, or acceptable to people even if we are them \\"perfectly\\". We can not make ourselves holy only God can that is the purpose of having a relationship with Him through Jesus Christ. Also they try to subtly endorse the notion that Jesus can replace a woman's natural desire to be with a man. This may work briefly, but in the long run if it was truly the case, go back to Genesis and see that God Himself when He was with Adam saw it's not good for man to be alone and that's why He created a helpmeet. God never promotes the idea of Him being our partner until someone comes along to \\"take His place\\". I think that idea is diluted and pathetic. We are to worship God in truth and spirit. Lastly, the book weakly carries out its points and overly spiritualize concepts to the point of confusion."},{"Title":"Lady In Waiting: Developing Your Love Relationships","review":"This book has made an absolutely amazing impact on my life. As a Christian single woman facing the pressures of society, I began to buy into the notion that finding a husband would make my life complete.

It is a wonderful book for single women in general. It focuses on the single woman who is preparing herself for marriage. But, more than anything, it teaches the single woman to become completely whole in who she is. The best thing about the book is that it is practical. It is not some superspiritual book that negates the fact that a woman's desire for a mate is realistic and that it was what I really liked about it. I don't think Debby and Jackie left a stone unturned in this book. This book dealt with every thing from Faith to Purity. It is truly dynamic. It is so real. It even addressed the issue of not taking the &quot;mental journey&quot; when you as a single woman meet a potential candidate for marriage. It also contains a good blend of testimonies of how the Lord blessed other single women as they put the principles in the book to work.

Nevertheless, I remember feeling unnecessarily guilt-tripped by this book, especially by the opening salvo of contrasting the heartbroken, lonely single woman with the content \\"lady in waiting,\\" as if anyone who's ever had a crying jag after yet another friend's wedding is somehow spiritually inferior.I'm exaggerating, but not much.The authors do a noble job of trying to steer women away from desperate, anxious, \\"where is he?\\" behavior, but in doing so they put way too much emphasis on the believer herself and not enough on the Cross.How can I say that about a book that proposes to help you love God more than the idea of being married?Yes, our ultimate fulfillment is in Christ and he should always be our first priority, married or unmarried, but that's a goal we never fully reach this side of heaven. It ultimately produces pride in the married person and guilt in the single person to suggest that ONLY after you've satisfied yourself fully with Christ will God see fit to bring you a mate.Sorry ... that's not Biblical nor is it possible. Better advice is to continually look to the Cross for mercy in all our shortcomings while having confidence in a gracious God who supplies all our needs despite our sinfulness."},{"Title":"Lady In Waiting: Developing Your Love Relationships","review":"This book is awesome!

I also recommend this book for bible studies and open discussions."},{"Title":"Lady In Waiting: Developing Your Love Relationships","review":"This book gives a whole new perspective on being single, waiting for the right man, and have the right relationships with guys. I was impressed by the way the authors developed each point with Scripture that was plentiful but not cumbersome. My two favorite chapters were two and four. Chapter 2, the Lady of Diligence, completely changed my views on being single. After reading that chapter, for the first time in my life, I honestly wanted to be single instead of dating because I realized that right now is my chance to do a lot of work for God. Chapter 4, the Lady of Virtue, taught me that God has a lot to do in me before I get into a love relationship, once again encouraging me to remain single for now.One very neat thing about the book is that it is written by women for women. I guarantee that any woman reading this book will find at least two sentences that perfectly illustrate her life. The ideas in the book are very poignant.I have always made guys a priority in my life. This book gave me a whole new outlook on my relationships.

My favorite chapter so far is &quot;Lady of Reckles Abandonment&quot;. I must confess that for a couple of days I was stuck on the section titled The Secret of the Alabaster Box. I never knew that the purpose of this box was to be broken at the feet of one's future husband.I now realize that in order for me to truly enjoy my singleness I have to store everything in my Alabaster Box and then break it at my future husband's feet (my Lord). During this part of the lesson, our teacher brought in jewelry boxes and each student received one. I have my concerns, financial situation, dreams, desires, addictions, problems, spiritual failures, everything that I have I have written down separately on paper and stored in my Alabaster Box to my Lord.I have learnt that when I do this I have to leave it with the Lord and not try to help Him because He does not need my help.

And it hasn't always been easy, especially when it comes to my \\"need\\" for a husband and a family. Before I read this book, God brought me through some very deep personal revelation, and I got a good look at what was in my heart. He showed me that even if I got everything I'd ever wanted or thought would be \\"it\\", that I still would be wanting something more: I would be wanting HIM.My personal journey is a unique one in that I have always had a searching heart after God (or maybe it's more that He has sought ME out). From a very young age I sought to really KNOW GOD PERSONALLY, with \\"reckless abandon.\\" He's captivated me entirely, and I've come to know Him in such a personal way I didn't know was possible!The first couple chapters of this book have re-affirmed what God has been teaching me all my life: That He wants ALL OF ME, that He LOVES ME PERFECTLY, and that I can only be COMPLETE IN HIM.I hope that one day what I've learned will be a blessing to my future children and their children as well. I want my future children, especially my future daughters, to be blessed through me, through the decisions I make today.

How many times have you looked at the articles in Cosmo - &quot;how to hunt down a man and trap him.&quot; Anyone who has tried that methodology knows that it just doesn't work. It leads to heartache and pain. Men like to do the hunting!This book offers a refreshing alternative to the mixed up dating scene. It reveals to women where their true power lies - in their femininity and in God's love for them. The book does an excellent job of outlining a &quot;plan of attack&quot; for women who want a God centered marriage. More importantly, it provides a path for women to follow to find completeness and happiness in their lives, with or without a man.Stop buying Cosmo and buy this book instead!"},{"Title":"Lady In Waiting: Developing Your Love Relationships","review":"This book has an incredible way of making you feel good about yourself as a single lady.

I avoided it like the plaige because I was scared that God would convict me. After I became even more broken to God I began to read this book. It was a very slow process but as I read each chapter God revealed so much to me and changed my heart. I regret that I didn't read this book earlier because it may have prevented me some pain. Lady in Waiting helped me evaluate my walk with God and renew my relationship with Him. It also helped me evaluate my standards and realize the importance of guarding your heart. I also really valued the chapter that talked about moving on in life and not planning my future around 'Mr. Right', but giving every part of my life to Christ, EVEN my dating and love life! The verse that is the emphasis of the book is, Psalm 27:14. This verse has helped me so much, I made a bunch of posters with this verse on it and have posted them around my room to encourage me to &quot;. . . be strong and take heart and wait for the Lord.&quot;"},{"Title":"Lady In Waiting: Developing Your Love Relationships","review":"Oh my gosh...

After grappling with the concept of revelation, she launches into an extensive analysis of authority based on the work of philosopher Richard T DeGeorge.

It covers material selection, design, and construction methods of which many are still used today. In general, this is a fine reference text for 1970s era deck construction and for that reason I would recommend it. However, I am not sure if a deck built to print using this handbook would be safe by today's standards. The chapter on finish systems may be a little outdated and more recent guide to finish systems should be consulted (or go to you local hardware store). In addition, the baluster spacing and deck rail design probably would not meet the required building code in your area so check your local requirements. This is not a criticism of the writers nor a criticism the text, it is simply an observation that designs and materials are continually improved and that there have been four decades worth since publication.

It is short (140 pages of large print). It lacks detail. It is simply a rehashing of some basic facts of the War in South Carolina. It appears more like a college term paper written by someone who read &quot;The Road to Guilford Courthouse&quot; than a well researched book from a College Professor. I read &quot;The Road to Guilford Courthouse&quot; only a few weeks before reading &quot;Partisans and Redcoats&quot;. Believe me, &quot;The Road&quot; is much, much better (only lacks maps..but otherwise very good). For someone in middle/elementary school or possibly high school Edgars work might prove satisfying. Perhaps someone with a limited interest in history might find it useful too. That is the only reason I gave it 2 stars. Get &quot;The Road&quot; instead."},{"Title":"Partisans and Redcoats: The Southern Conflict That Turned the Tide of the American Revolution","review":"This book attempts to cover the part of the American Revolution in South Carolina (and by extension the South in general) that general history books overlook or at least partially ignore. This portion of the war (the partisan war that occurred between Loyalist and Rebel forces in the state) is often overlooked because what battles were fought between these forces were generally small. Those that were larger (King's Mountain and the Cowpens, primarily) are often treated as if they were isolated incidents, related only to one another and the battles of Camden and Guilford Court House. By contrast, Edgar weaves the account of the war in South Carolina into the overall history of the Revolution, and recounts various smaller fights in the state that he believes changed the course of the war. Chiefly, he beleives that the Partisan victory referred to as Huck's Defeat was crucial in turning the tide of public opinion in the Backcountry part of the state, which in turn was crucial in preventing the British from pacifying the whole region. He therefore ascribes a considerable importance to this minor battle, in which several hudred partisans ambushed about 115 Tories, killing or capturing most of them, including their commander, Captain Christian Huck.This is interesting, and the author does a good job of depicting the war in the South in 1780. The civil nature of the conflict (brother against brother, etc.) is highlighted, and also the atrocities and violence of the war and its practitioners. The author doesn't spend much time on the conventional war in the state: King's Mountain and Guilford Courthouse are only briefly discussed, and the Cowpens isn't even really discussed at all, except in its consequences. This narrowing of the focus of the book leads to a very brief volume (less than 200 pages; less than 150 of text). This is in a way good: Mr. Edgar is a college instructor, and his writing style is much more suitable for a weighty tome than something someone would actually read.All in all, though, this is a worthwhile book, and I would certainly recommend it to those interested in the American Revolution, or to partisan or irregular warfare in general."},{"Title":"Partisans and Redcoats: The Southern Conflict That Turned the Tide of the American Revolution","review":"&quot;Partisans and Redcoats: The Southern Conflict That Turned the Tide of the American Revolution,&quot; by Walter Edgar, is a fascinating history of a crucial chapter in United States history. Edgar tells the story of the Revolutionary War in South Carolina.Edgar paints an interesting portrait of the people and culture of that region before and during the war. The book recounts the key battles and personalities that shaped the southern campaign. I was particularly fascinated by Edgar's analysis of the British failure &quot;to win the hearts and minds of the people of South Carolina.&quot; Edgar offers tantalizing glimpses at the roles played by women and African-Americans in the ongoing struggle. And the book is full of down-to-earth details, such as how uncooked meat caused illness among the revolutionary troops.Edgar tells a good story. He writes in a clear, engaging style. The book is also packed full of useful supplemental elements: a chronology spanning 1756 to 1783; a glossary of terms, places, and battles; biographical sketches of significant figures; extensive endnotes with bibliographic references; maps; historic illustrations; and an index. This relatively short, but substantial book is an excellent choice for those with an interest in 18th century American history."},{"Title":"Partisans and Redcoats: The Southern Conflict That Turned the Tide of the American Revolution","review":"Few South Carolinians understand the importance of their state in the Revolutionary War. Walter Edgar, a history professor at the University of South Carolina, has attempted to place the war, and South Carolina's role in it, in context and make it accessible to the present day, but with mixed results.This book is strongest in its non military sections, as Edgar is not a military historian. The description of the South Carolina backcountry, and the growth in immigrants who did not pass through Charleston, in the mid 1700's, specifically the Scotch Irish coming southward down the Catawba valley, is particularly well done. Yet significant military engagements in the new state, such as Kings Mountain, Cowpens and Ninety Six are barely covered. Instead, minor insurgent engagements, like Huck's defeat are covered in much greater detail.King George III was quoted to call the war in its later half, \\"that damned Presbyterian War\\", echoing English conflicts in Scotland that had only been recently settled during the King's grandfather's reign. And Edgar does a fine job of showing some similarities between English conflicts with Scotland and the British Army's conflict with backcountry Carolina settlers.Yet this book has its weaknesses, mostly from a lack of direction. It would have been better to have written a history of the effect of the war from a social perspective, with the material here, rather than a hybrid military history. A book such as the Road to Guilford Courthouse would be much better for a military history. This is a short and at times uneven book, which does not go into as much depth as needed to explain the strain between the South Carolina backcountry and the Coastal establishment near Charleston. It is a decent overview of the conflict in the South Carolina backcountry, but there are better sources of the social and military conflict."},{"Title":"Partisans and Redcoats: The Southern Conflict That Turned the Tide of the American Revolution","review":"~Partisans and Redcoats: The Southern Conflict That Turned the Tide of the American Revolution~ is a succinct and readable narrative history of the American War for Independence with a focus on the Carolinas and the Southern theater. The cast of characters includes patriots like Martha Bratton, Horatio Gates, Joseph Kershaw, and Francis Marion. \\"The American Revolution was won in the South by determined backcountry patriots,\\" notes Edgar. \\"Some, such as Andrew Pickens and Thomas Sumter, became American folk heroes.\\" I really like Edgar's book, because it is short and sweet. The body of the text is just one-hundred and forty-five pages. What makes this succinct book so remarkable is that Edgar tells the story and puts you in the shoes of the backcountry frontiersmen. The backdrop he paints of colonial South Carolina prior to the war shows how fragile civilization and civil society was on the frontier. He astutely explains the rigors of frontier life in the Carolina backcountry. He captures the essence of the tempestuous and rugged individualism of the Scotch-Irish settlers which were predominant in the region. Edgar tells of the sectarian animosities and strife that ensued. In one case, the tale of feuding Ulster Scot Presbyterians and Anglicans was rather humorous.** Law and order was hard to come by on the frontier, and criminal gangs of thieves and extortionists were rampant. Blood feuds and social strife ensued as a general rule. This gave rise to vigilante and posse groups like the Regulators who were eventually deputized by the state assembly. Eventually, the forces of ordered liberty quelled the forces of anarchy. The vigilante groups after some abuses were obliged to check one another at the behest of the State legislature. Former elements of such groups like the Regulators and Moderators provided foot soldiers, scouts, and frontiersmen to field the Continental Army and the State Militia during the war.British policy was coldly deliberate in its policy of total war. Though total war was typically only felt in areas of entrenched, stubborn resistance: the South Carolina backcountry was such a place. \\"In a Civil War, there is no admitting of neutral characteristics, and... those who are not clearly with us must so far be considered against us,\\" noted British Commander Lord Cornwallis. Edgar catches the drama in his narrative history of families being torn apart and communities being torn asunder amidst reprisals and counter-reprisals. Partisans and Redcoats captures the sacrifices of patriots, the costliness of war, and the devastation it wrings out on civil society. Not surprisingly, the heat of the war gave rise to lawlessness, and Edgar tells some tales of home invasions and plunder. The peasant rabble of the South Carolina backcountry, so deplored by the Tory gentry actually gave the British one heck of a fight. The partisans were greatly underestimated and dismissed as boorish incompetents incapable of waging civilised war. Through, the two-pronged efforts of regular militia and guerilla insurgents, the South Carolinian patriots walloped the British. Their contribution played no small role in the final victory of the American cause. For this reason, battles like Cowpens, King's Mountain and Guilford Courthouse deserve as much consideration as Saratoga, Monmouth, and Yorktown. George Washington's northern armies played cat and mouse games with the British, and seemed destined to lose, but managed to stay afloat. The southern campaign tied down British troops, ate at their morale, depleted their manpower, and paved the way for the climatic victories in Yorktown. The southern contribution in my opinion is sometimes downplayed, ignored, and marginalized. Nonetheless, studying the war for independence in perspective makes one realize that the fraternal bonds of the various regions from New England to Georgia was vitally requisite to the overall success of the cause. The combined efforts of patriots in the thirteen States worked to break the yolk of Tory tyranny. The underdog Continental Army and a ragtag colonial militia defeated of one of the greatest powers of the eighteenth-century-the British Empire.All things considered, Walter Edgar's book is a real treat. It is easy to read, straightforward, and it packs a punch despite its brevity. Edgar's manuscript captures the fierceness of the conflict in the Carolina backcountry and the breadth of sacrifices made on all sides. The War for American Independence was a hard fought contest. The odds were greatly against the rabble rebel armies of America taking on the might of the British Empire. Providence ordained otherwise and defied those odds. During the American War for Independence, many were content to sit on sidelines whether it was the coastal city slickers from Charleston to Boston had little resolve to fight British even if they had secessionist sympathies. Yet many clergy rallied behind the cause. The conflict was in fact dubbed a \\"Presbyterian Parson's Rebellion\\" by Tories in England and loyalists here at home. The predominantly Scotch-Irish population of the Carolina backcountry didn't like dishonored covenants between the governors and the governed, and frankly they didn't much care for the English either. They were hearty frontiersmen who hacked it out of the wilderness, bearing their children along the way. Their tempestuous antagonism against the English played no small part in the fervor that brought the cause for American Independence to fruition. In the end, their love of liberty and their hatred of tyranny compelled them to break the yolk of Tory tyranny.* * * * * * * * * * ***Here is an excerpt, which I found particularly funny about Presbyterian-Anglican relations in the backcountry of South Carolina in the mid-eighteenth century. It is told from the perspective a missionary of English pedigree who was sent to one of the token Anglican parishes in the Carolina backcountry. I found this story rather amusing... Anyway, jump ahead to page nine if you want to get to the gist of the story. FYI The quotations are the words of Rev. Woodmason, an Anglican clergyman.[p. 5]The Scots-Irish were proud of their heritage. They were, first of all, Scots. They knew their nation's tortured history and its mistreatment by the English. They were fervent Presbyterians whose forebears had been persecuted for their beliefs. They were family men and women and tended to stick close by their kinfolks....[p. 7]\\"The People,\\" wrote Reverend Woodmason, \\"all new Settlers, extremely poor-Live in Logg Cabbins like Hogs-and their Living and Behavior as rude or more so than the savages.\\"...[p. 9-10]It would not be unfair to say that the backcountry was close to being a state of nature. There were settlements, but the only social organization was the church. Woodmason was an Anglican missionary to the backcountry settlements, but there were only two Anglican congregations beyond Parish End. There were several Quaker meetings... but most were Baptists or Presbyterians....Sectarian animosities were fierce. Scotch-Irish Presbyterians were fervently devoted to their churches and just as fervently antagonistic to those who did not share their particular beliefs. They were the bane of Woodmason's existence and harassed him and any who attended his services. In one location, \\"[a] Presbyterian fellow carried off the Key to the Meeting House\\" so that services could not be held indoors. At Hanging Rock Creek, Woodmason was roughed up by \\"lawless Ruffians\\" who been hired by \\"debauch'd licentious fellows, and Scots Presbyterians.\\" When the Anglican missionary persisted in holding a service, \\"a Gang of Presbyterians\\" interrupted it by \\"hallooing and whooping... like Indians.\\" In the High Hills of the Santee, some Presbyterians \\"hir'd a Band of Rude fellows to come to Service who brought with them fifty-seven dogs (for I counted them) which in Time of Service they set to fighting, and I was obliged to stop.\\" A little later, Woodmason took a dog to the home of the area's leaders and informed him \\"fifty-seven Presbyterians came that Day to Service, and that I had converted one of them, and brought Him home.\\" He was fortunate to have been able to live to tell such a story."},{"Title":"Partisans and Redcoats: The Southern Conflict That Turned the Tide of the American Revolution","review":"Walter Edgar's \\"Partisans and Recoats\\" purports to tell the story of the Revolutionary War in the southern colonies, and to some extent it does, but concentrates primarily on the fighting in the backcountry of South Carolina in the years 1780-1781 between the bitterly divided loyalist and patriot partisans who turned the backwoods of the colony into a bloody war zone.The book gives a brief history of the violence that threatened the stability of the colony in the years just after the French and Indian War. From the conflicts between outlaws, Regulators, and Moderators, grew the resentment and animoisty between the backwoods Scots-Irish frontiersmen and the more established Anglican Tidewater population. These political and religious differences soon carried over into the war of the rebellion as loyalists and patriots spent many years of the war butchering each other after the British invaded in 1780. Edgar goes on to emphasize his belief that, more than any other event in the war in South Carolina, that the rebel victory at Huck's Defeat was the true turning point in the war that helped to raise the patriot cause, leading to the Battle of King's Mountain and ultimate victory.This is a short book and one that seems to eschew details of the truly momentous events during the war in the South. It gives short shrift to the Battle of King's Mountain, where major Patrick Ferguson's Tories were crushed by the Over Mountain Men in a defeat that, in my opinion, was the real decisive and psychological victory that helped turn the tide against the British in the South by depriving them of the loyalist support Cornwallis desperately needed to bolster his efforts to subjugate the Carolinas. It barely even mentions Cowpens and Guilford Courthouse. This book is interesting for its attention to the little known events that shook the Carolina backcountry during the bloodiest years of the war, but leaves out too much detail and seems to provide little more than introductory material on a complex subject."},{"Title":"Partisans and Redcoats: The Southern Conflict That Turned the Tide of the American Revolution","review":"There are lots to like about this book. As the back cover says, it \\"captures the heat, the fury, and the intense human drama\\" of the Southern conflict. But I don't trust what the author presents as \\"facts.\\"That is, some of his research relies on books that relied on dubious 19th century writers. Which means that Lt. Colonel Banastre Tarleton is painted as pure evil, from the first page we meet him. Example: a couple of his men attacked some women at a plantation. Edgar writes, \\"Although several of the dragoons involved were disciplined, their commander was not.\\" This gives the wrong impression of Tarleton's actions, or inactions, regarding this matter. Surely Edgar knows that Tarleton, when told of what had happened, sent a surgeon and 12 men to guard the women, and recommended hanging for these men. All in all, I'm left with the impression that the book sacrifices detail to paint a picture that isn't entirely accurate. Simply put, I'm unable to trust what I read."},{"Title":"Partisans and Redcoats: The Southern Conflict That Turned the Tide of the American Revolution","review":"The work was entertaining and an easy read, but his account was very biased. Most historians' aims are at a more objective view of thier topic, however Edgar fails miserbly. It is obvious that he wrote the book in a hurry to make money following the movie The Patriot. There were a number of errors and it is almost impossible to check his sources. He only cites paragraphs and will have three or four sources for each, forcing the reader to assume that he is offering an accurate account. Edgar also, places too much importance on Huck's Defeat. While the battle did aid in raising the morale of the Patriots, it was not the essential link that led to the possibility of a battle at King's Mountain. The subsequent victories were just as important, if not more so, to solidify the patriot's confidence.Edgar's account of the Waxhaw Massacre was truly embarassing. His version could have been written in the early to mid-1800s. If you want to read a more accurate account. One that is not as biased as Edgar's version. Read &quot;The Road to Guilford Courthouse: The American Revolution in the Carolinas&quot; by John Buchanan."},{"Title":"Partisans and Redcoats: The Southern Conflict That Turned the Tide of the American Revolution","review":"This book was a big disappointment. One suspects that the author hastily threw this book together in a misguided attempt to latch onto the coattails of Mel Gibson's _The Patriot_. Edgar has made little use of the wealth of primary sources available on the subject, his analysis is stale, he offers no interpretive insights, and his prose is sloppy. In short, this book is a shallow, overly simplistic rehash of better work by better historians. Anyone interested in the Revolution in the South will find John Buchanan's _The Road to Guilford Courthouse_, David Ramsay's _History of the American Revolution_, the Revolutionary War romances of William Gilmore Simms, the work of Don Higginbotham, the books by Kenneth Roberts and Lawrence Babits on the battle of Cowpens, and Gregory Massey's _John Laurens and the American Revolution_ all much more rewarding. The best I can say about _Partisans and Redcoats_ is that it is far shorter that Edgar's _History of South Carolina_ and therefore he has less space for politically correct claptrap."},{"Title":"Partisans and Redcoats: The Southern Conflict That Turned the Tide of the American Revolution","review":"This book is well written, researched, fast moving and wonderful.

However, those lesser engagements are often the best way of depicting the harsh and divisive nature of the war. In the Carolinas, for example, the war took on many aspects of a civil war within a war, as Loyalist militias, stiffened by British soldiers, took on Rebel militias in a brutal, back-country partisan conflict.This book attempts to describe that slice of the war by highlighting one engagement within it. That small battle, prosaically named \\"Huck's Defeat\\" (after Captain Christian Huck, the Loyalist officer who lost his life in the fight), was the first Rebel victory in the aftermath of the fall of the city of Charleston, and it is the opinion of the author that the importance small militia engagements like this one are overlooked. Huck's Defeat, and several subsequent victories by partisans and militia units, convinced most locals to side with the Rebel forces and oppose the English. This, in turn, kept South Carolina in the war, and ultimately led to the Rebel victories of King's Mountain and the Cowpens. The rest, as they say, is history: the British were forced to leave the state, marching down a path that led to Lord Cornwallis's surrender at Yorktown.While making a good point - that these lesser back-country battles were important and are often neglected - Edgar overstates his case. \\"Huck's Defeat\\" was a very small battle indeed: 115 Loyalist and British soldiers vs. ca. 250 Rebels, and lasting no more than an hour. The loyalists were massacred, but unless the Revolutionary cause in South Carolina truly hinged on this one engagement (i.e. defeat would have meant the end of resistance in the colony), then it was simply one particularly bloody skirmish among many."},{"Title":"Partisans and Redcoats: The Southern Conflict That Turned the Tide of the American Revolution","review":"I started to read this book with high hopes, but regrettably had to give it up. Although this book was written by a full professor at the Univ. of SC, it is nothing but a disappointment. In fact, given that an academic wrote it, I was very surprised to find the prose simplistic to the point that I had to check to see if it was written for younger readers, say 5th grade. It wasn't. Edgar using short, vague, imprecise sentences which generalize far too much and read like a juvenile comic book. He offers no interpretive angles and rashes the secondary sources of many other historians. I do not see one notation in the sources in which he used the Nathanael Greene papers, or other primary sources. Seems like he wrote the book on a whim or to indulge a hobby, and it must be an embarrassment to the U of SC. The cover illustration is absurd-it appears to be a painting of a reenactment, not an actual event. The publisher included an engraving of what purports to be Banastre tarleton but most certainly is not. In short, I recommend avoiding this romantic, sentimental and unsatisfying book. I recommend instead books by Pancake, Merrill and Lumpkin on the same topic."},{"Title":"Partisans and Redcoats: The Southern Conflict That Turned the Tide of the American Revolution","review":"Hmmm...plenty of others have already reviewed this book and hashed over its merits. So I will only say that I consider it an average book in all ways and so give it an average rating of 3 stars."},{"Title":"Partisans and Redcoats: The Southern Conflict That Turned the Tide of the American Revolution","review":"I thought this a nice read on the American Revolution in South Carolina. Edgar turns his pride of his home state into a discourse on how the events in South Carolina resulted in victory of the Continentals in the American Revolution. He also relates the events of the first civil war in South Carolina between the Regulators and the Moderators. He backs up his claim on the fighting in South Carolina with the statistics on the casualties incurred in the fighting there. I certainly agree South Carolina can take pride in the battles fought and won and why they were important to the infant United States.This is a short book and I thought Edgar could have provided more meat to back up his claims. His use of examples as the melting of the wicked witch in the Wizard of Oz, I thought was a bad example in a historical record. All told a good and quick read."},{"Title":"Partisans and Redcoats: The Southern Conflict That Turned the Tide of the American Revolution","review":"Edgar , Dr. Walter B. ,Partisans and Redcoats:The Southern Conflict That Turned The Tide of The American Revolution ,William Morrow and Co. ,23 OCT 2001 This book was written by Dr. Walter Edgar about the American Revolution in the South Carolina. Dr. Walter Edgar is a history professor at the University of South Carolina where he is also over the Southern Studies department. He is highly regarded as a Southern historian and is widely acknowledged as the authority on his home state's (South Carolina) history. South Carolina : A History is another book that Dr. Edgar wrote due to protest that the preceding books on the history of South Carolina that were widely used as textbooks in the secondary schools of South Carolina were too conservative and politically incorrect. A good job is done with this book ,but many things could be better about it. For many people and students of the American Revolution, this is a theater of war that is often downplayed and ignored .Most schoolchildren in America only know the version of history taught about the Revolution that centered on the New England and the Middle Colonies. That version of the history of the Revolution is due to the fact that \\"winners write history\\" and since 1865 the South has never been given much credit for helping secure America's independence by helping to win the American Revolution ,but Dr. Edgar does an excellent job in disproving that theory in his book . Dr. Edgar also differs from many other historians by stating that the battle of \\"Huck's Defeat\\" on 12 July 1780 in what is now York County was the turning point of the Revolution in the South, not King's Mountain as many schoolchildren are taught. Dr. Edgar does a good job in proving his theory that \\"Huck's Defeat\\" was the turning point of the Revolution in the South .Huck's Defeat was a small battle that was a Patriot victory ,but no strategic physical gains were made by the Patriots in their victory .This battle was between 115 Tories and just a little more Patriots .It was a victory in which the Patriots decimated the Tories .The reason that Dr. Edgar believes that this battle was the turning point of the Revolution in the South is that fact that this little known battle lifted the spirits ,raised the morale , and gave a ray of hope to the Patriots in the backcountry when their spirits were at their lowest ebb and many were about to give up .After Huck's Defeat the fortunes of the Patriot cause in the backcountry grew better despite several setbacks. Another part of the American Revolution in the South Carolina backcountry that Dr. Edgar portrays well in this book is the fratricidal nature of war that happened there .He cites many examples of how many family members often fought against each other with little or no remorse .At the battle of Stallion's {pages 90-91},Captain Love who is a patriot fights against Tories that are holed up in his sister's house and his sister is killed in the ensuing battle by a stray bullet fired by his men. After the Battle of King's Mountain, a Patriot captain saw his wounded Tory brother-in-law dying on the ground and his brother-in-law pleaded for help, but the only reply that he received from him was \\"look to your friends for help\\" {page 120}.These are just a few examples of how things were in South Carolina's \\"civil war\\". There are many things that are lacking in this book ,but Dr. Edgar's theses and facts are solid and well based .A major fault that I find in this book is that it is too short and does not go into enough detail about the socio-economic and cultural backgrounds of the South Carolina backcountry .Dr. Edgar also gives the false impression and could mislead many readers of his book that the Scots Irish were unanimously for the Patriot cause in the South Carolina backcountry .The Scots Irish were the vanguard of the Patriot forces in the backcountry ,but many of them stayed out the fighting or were Tories .One must remember that the notorious Cunningham brothers who were Tories were also Scots Irish and received most of their support from the predominantly Scots Irish Ninety Six district .This book seems to be written for high school students and people who are not too familiar with this theater of the Revolution ,but I might be a little biased in my judgment because I read the late Dr. Henry Lumpkin's book (From Savannah to Yorktown : The American Revolution in the South ) and never missed his television show on Saturdays (And Then There Were Thirteen) when I was nine (9) instead of reading Judy Blume and watching the Smurfs . Davis Jones Beam III (Jody)"},{"Title":"Partisans and Redcoats: The Southern Conflict That Turned the Tide of the American Revolution","review":"That is how Walter Edgar describes the fighting that took place in the S.C. back-country after the fall of Charleston and the apparent collapse of the Patriot cause. It was neighbor against neighbor, Father against son, and even brother and or sister against brother. Each side waged a no-holds barred program of genocide on the other side. Let loose by Cornwallis, Bannister Tarleton created havoc in the upper state and enabled loyalist to temporarly gain the upper hand. Even Andrew Pickens and Thomas Sumter thought that the Patriot cause was lost. But Edgar points out that Sir Henry Clinton made the fatal mistake of demanding that former Patriots that had laid down their weapons take an oath of allegiance to the King, and men of honor, such as Pickens and Sumter, spurred on by the slaughter of a Virginia regiment, by Tarleton at the Waxaws, breathed new life into the Patriots (Whigs). Edgar calls the Battle of Hucks Defeat the \\"turning point\\" of the war in the South, which led to the eventual routing of Patrick Ferguson's forces at King's Mountain. This is a great history book that reads like a novel. After reading it, you too will see that the United States owes a lot of gratitude to the back-country residents of South Carolina."},{"Title":"Partisans and Redcoats: The Southern Conflict That Turned the Tide of the American Revolution","review":"This book is well written, researched, fast moving and wonderful. Each chapter will have you sitting on the edge of your seat and you will find this book very hard to put down. The important role that South Carolina played in the American Revolution is clearly detailed and these true stories will make you laugh and cry. Partisans and Redcoats is one that all ages will enjoy. Dr. Edgar is not only a wonderful historian but also a gifted writer. This reviewer feels this book should be on the approved reading list for all American History teachers and student-reading lists. Adults and young adults of all ages will enjoy the insightful message found on each line and chapter of this text. Partisans and Redcoats is written in story form and reads more like a novel rather than dry text. The roles of many known and unknown people who played important roles during the Revolution are fun to read about and their stories will have you spell bound. Partisans and Redcoats gives a clear perceptive of the true Civil War that took place during this American conflict. You will learn that families were against family members; neighbors against neighbors and all walks of life made the winning of this war a reality.This reader highly recommends this book and is positive you will enjoy it also."},{"Title":"Partisans and Redcoats: The Southern Conflict That Turned the Tide of the American Revolution","review":"First off, as a Southerner, I'm proud to have this book even available. 98% of the revolutionary war period is covered entirely up North when nearly a third of all the battles and skirmishes occurred in SC alone. Hmmm, curious?Granted I would agree with some of the reviews in that this book does not touch Guilford Courthouse, but no other book about the Revolution touches that book. This is a great introduction to the Southern campaign and what was arguably the first Civil War of our country and the amazing guerrilla warfare tactics employed. If you are a heavy history or military buff, then this book may not do it for you, but I'll tell you one thing. After I read this book, I delved into the Southern campaign and all I can tell you is the history is sparse and the heroes unknown. So this book inspired me.How many know Francis Marion, Elijah Clarke, William 'Bloody Bill' Cunningham, William Campbell, etc. You don't, America does not teach about these men, just as they don't teach our Constitution or forefathers anymore."},{"Title":"Partisans and Redcoats: The Southern Conflict That Turned the Tide of the American Revolution","review":"I loved this action-packed, highly readable tale of South Carolina's backcountry. The Revolution in SC pitted family against family and neighbor against neighbor, yet the men and women who supported the Partisans' cause risked everything to fight for the freedom that they so cherished. This is a timely lesson for all of us -- freedom does not come easily."},{"Title":"Partisans and Redcoats: The Southern Conflict That Turned the Tide of the American Revolution","review":"When one thinks of the Revolutionary War or the Civil War for that matter Charleston immediately comes to mind. Some believe the world revolves around Charleston, that statement was as true in 1776 as it was in 1861.However the backcountry of South Carolina and it's story in the Revolutionary War was every bit as important and compelling.Walter Edgar once again takes a diverse, complicated story and makes it easy to understand, and he does it in a way to take this book from an academic read to on par with the finest of novels.A gripping account of the blood letting on both sides and the inter relationships of the differing groups that settled this state.We can talk all we want about Lexington and Concord and the battles up north, but if one wants a true taste of America's first Civil War, and the conflict of neighbor vs neighbor and brother vs brother this is the story that must be told.The causes, divisiveness and conflict between a common people are just as true today. When we look at conflicts such as Sudan, or Bosnia we realize we still have a lot to learn. Because of the lessons learned during the Revolutionary War and the later Civil War we here in the US finally learned this lesson.Partisans and Redcoats puts that conflict and it's outcome right square in our face. From it we must learn."},{"Title":"Partisans and Redcoats: The Southern Conflict That Turned the Tide of the American Revolution","review":"On the one had this book is written in an engaging manner and got me interested in a topic I knew little about. The book gives a good background on the Revolutionary war in South Carolina.However after describing the beginnings of partisan warfare the book kind of tapers off. It does not really go into Kings Mountain, Guilford courthouse, or why the British tried to move north into Virginia. In fact the book does not really cover events outside of South Carolina. Maybe that was the scope of the book. But if that was the case, the scope was too small. Upon finishing the book I had a dissatisfied feeling. It was almost like missing the end of a movie. I was interested in the story and wanted to see it all the way to the end. Instead it stopped three quarters of the way through."},{"Title":"Partisans and Redcoats: The Southern Conflict That Turned the Tide of the American Revolution","review":"This small book illuminates the partisan action - neighbor vs. neighbor - in South Carolina, an important phase of the Revolutionary war left in darkness by most history books. The individuals leading militia efforts, and the lives led by ordinary citizens during this period are especially interesting."},{"Title":"Partisans and Redcoats: The Southern Conflict That Turned the Tide of the American Revolution","review":"This was the last in a series of books I read on the Revolution. It is disappointing in that it is a very broad summary of events in the South. In fact, it reads like a college paper overviewing several works without any real flavor of its own.If you want to read an excellent account of the war in the Southern Theater, get &quot;The Road to Guilford Courthouse.&quot; It is much better written and researched, and is in fact, one of the sources quoted by Edgar."},{"Title":"Partisans and Redcoats: The Southern Conflict That Turned the Tide of the American Revolution","review":"I would have loved more detail and depth. I think the author knows some rich kind of stories that can't be shown in time lines etc but he doesn't bring them forth here. It's those tales that make history a living breathing reality. I saw him speaking live from Cowpens on a C-Span Booknotes program and was intrigued enough to purchase a copy. I felt he has enthusiasm for the subject but perhaps didn't grapple successfully enough with the format of presenting it in both a factual and off-the-cuff manner. At any rate, it was enlightening for me as a person who had always thought of the American Revolution mostly being about the New England colonies to learn otherwise. Speaking as one of the uniniated on the subject, I felt it was a fairly good doorway to the next level."},{"Title":"Partisans and Redcoats: The Southern Conflict That Turned the Tide of the American Revolution","review":"There are longer and more detailed works about the American Revolution in the Carolina backcountry, notably John Buchanan, The Road to Guilford Courthouse (1997); but Edgar's well-written book will probably satisfy all but the most avid Revolutionary War buffs. (Buchanan himself called this book \\"lively and accurate.\\") Edgar is lucid, succinct, and judicious in his judgments even when his occasional attempts to draw relevance from the 1990s seems a bit strained.Edgar has two major themes, both sound in my view: first, that the British (and specifically Sir Henry Clinton) inadvertently revitalized the Revolution in the backcountry by issuing the provocative proclamation of June 3, 1780, and by permitting \\"atrocities\\" (xv) that led to \\"the most brutal warfare ever fought in what is now the United States.\\" (140) Edgar's second theme is that the turning point for the Patriot victory came earlier than is usually credited, at Huck's Defeat on July 12, 1780, rather than at the Battle of Kings Mountain in October."},{"Title":"Partisans and Redcoats: The Southern Conflict That Turned the Tide of the American Revolution","review":"Edgar is a good writer and the book is an easy read, but trying to explain the complex motives, personalities, and actions involved in the Carolina war is too much for such a small volume. If you want a basic understanding of that part of the Revolutionary War, read Buchanan's \\"The Road to Guilford Courthouse\\" instead. Or if you have time, read Edgar for a quick overview, then Buchanan for more depth."},{"Title":"Partisans and Redcoats: The Southern Conflict That Turned the Tide of the American Revolution","review":"Walter Edgar's \\"Partisans and Redcoats: The Southern Conflict That Turned the Tide of the American Revolution\\" is a short, readable history of the many small-scale Revolutionary battles in South Carolina. It is well-written and well-researched, but one of the biggest flaws is that it is too cursory of a treatment of the subject.During the Revolutionary War, South Carolina was the key to the British southern strategy and was the site of countless small engagements, many between Whig and Tory militias. Edgar sets the stage well, briefly describing the 1760s, the Regulator movement in South Carolina, and the demographics of many of the colonists. Then the book focuses on the summer and fall of 1780, a period when South Carolina, which looked like it would be safely secured by the British, was embroiled in fighting. During this time, the revolutionaries inflicted many defeats on the British and eventually drove Cornwallis north.One of the books weaknesses is that it abruptly ends: Edgar barely covers the final battles in late 1780 and 1781. And although he paints a good picture of the colonial settlements in the South Carolina backcountry, he never really discusses the weapons, tactics, and other means of war. Without this detail, it's difficult for the reader to really envision these small-scale raids and engagements.This book gives a nice, quick history of one small but often overlooked theater in the Revolutionary War. Although it could be beefed up a bit with more details, it is very readable for the general reader. Additionally, Edgar included a glossary, chronology, and biographical information at the end of the book, which add to its utility as a reference and general overview. Although not a comprehensive history of the South Carolina campaign, Edgar's \\"Partisans and Redcoats\\" is a good place to start."},{"Title":"Partisans and Redcoats: The Southern Conflict That Turned the Tide of the American Revolution","review":"As a native of Charleston, South Carolina, I have found that most people only associate our great state with the Civil War. They neglect to realize the large role that South Carolina played in the Revolutionary War. This book brilliantly illuminates the state's involvement during the Revolution.It is engaging and well written and keeps the reader entertained from cover to cover. I highly recommend it to anyone without reservation. It is definitely worth the read!"},{"Title":"Partisans and Redcoats: The Southern Conflict That Turned the Tide of the American Revolution","review":"I always look forward to reading Dr. Edgar's books, and this book only further establishes him as a preeminent Southern historian. In many history books, South Carolina's role in the American Revolution is reduced to one or two key battles. Thankfully, Dr. Edgar bucks this trend and explores not only the big battles like Kings Mountain but the smaller skirmishes as well, which were essential to the Partisans' success. I especially enjoyed learning about the strong women behind the scenes who played an integral role in the Revolution. This is a thoroughly engrossing and fascinating book, and I highly recommend it. This book serves as an important reminder that the cost of freedom is very dear."},{"Title":"Partisans and Redcoats: The Southern Conflict That Turned the Tide of the American Revolution","review":"I found this book to be quite enjoyable. It looks at the American Revolution from a different perspective than most books I have come across, examining the war from a distinctly southern viewpoint. I found two themes to be of particular note in this work. First, the author describes how the many people not inclined to support the Revolution were driven to by the actions of the British troops sent to crack down on the revolt in the early part of the war. Secondly, the sheer brutality of war in the 1700s was brought to life (often using contemporary accounts). Much of the fighting was hand-to-hand and atrocities were committed with regularity on both sides on levels hard for the modern reader to comprehend. It was a very interesting book and well worth reading."},{"Title":"Partisans and Redcoats: The Southern Conflict That Turned the Tide of the American Revolution","review":"I have recommended this book to several friends in the 2-3 years since I first read it. I am a bit surprised by the negatives that have been raised, because I find these \\"weaknesses\\" to be strengths.The lack of details on battles was fine for me. Thinking of war as an extension of politics, the author did a fine job of explaining some of the political factors that caused the insurgency to grow. I found myself comparing his insights to my own time in Iraq (no, not direct comparisons, just musings) and assessing how actions and perceptions of actions affect the population's support and direct participation in military conflict.The short length seems shorter because it reads very well, even for those of us whose Revolutionary knowledge is based in New England. I appreciated the short length because the author did not weigh down the book with details that would detract from the story he was telling. I was able to cruise through this book and gain insight on areas that I might like to delve into more.I believe I have enough background knowledge from this book that more detailed books will be easier and more enjoyable to read."},{"Title":"Partisans and Redcoats: The Southern Conflict That Turned the Tide of the American Revolution","review":"I bought this book thinking that it was an overview history of the entire Southern theatre. But it centers mostly on the South Carolina backcountry, and the people and problems of that particular region. Rather than being disappointed, I was very pleased, as I had ancestors who lived in the area, and it helped me have more insight into what they lived through. The author writes about individuals and minor skirmishes, and the politics of the area and different church congregations of the period, in much more detail than anything else I've read. Yes, he does seem especially fascinated with Huck's Defeat, but in a sense it seems to have been the skirmish that gave the Patriots the confidence to think they had a chance to win. He is clearly biased on the side of the Patriot cause, but so am I. If you want a general history of the Revolution in the South, this is not the book for you. If you want to know more about South Carolina, and the backcountry area, this is a book you would enjoy reading."},{"Title":"Partisans and Redcoats: The Southern Conflict That Turned the Tide of the American Revolution","review":"A well delivered outstanding account of history that deserves more attention. The book was on time and exactly as described."},{"Title":"Partisans and Redcoats: The Southern Conflict That Turned the Tide of the American Revolution","review":"\\"Partisans And Redcoats\\" by Walter Edgar focuses on the original Civil War - the battles between patriots and tories in South Carolina during the American Revolutionary War.The book is an easy read and the narrative flows smoothly.Among the strong points:1. Smooth narrative.2. Good introduction to the type of life found in the South Carolina backcountry (defined as the rest of South Carolina as you go 40-60 miles west of Charleston). Enjoyed learning more about the people of the Waxhaws (close to where I live).3. Introductions to several characters on both sides not normally mentioned in the American Revolutionary War (Francis Marion, Thomas Sumter, etc.).4. Brief description of engagements that were not well-known but played a large part in the American victory in South Carolina (Blackstocks, Musgrove's Mill, etc.).5. Interesting thesis as to why the British failed to win in South Carolina (General Clinton revoking paroles - either swear allegiance to the crown or be hanged, destruction of several homes in the backcountry, mistreatment of women and children, open hostility to the Presbyterian Church, massacre of American soldiers at the Waxhaws). Indeed, if the British army had not acted as it did, the war may have ended differently.I would have liked to have seen more maps and more detail of the several battles in South Carolina. More maps and detail of battles would have caused me to give the book a 4-star rating.A good introduction to the war in South Carolina. For a more in-depth study, read titles such as \\"From Savannah To Yorktown\\" and other books."},{"Title":"Partisans and Redcoats: The Southern Conflict That Turned the Tide of the American Revolution","review":"This book was an excellent introduction to a small facet of the American revolution. It does fall short in a standard American way when it comes to history - it is myopic, with no apparent understanding of why Britain lost the war - but it was entertaining.Be a little aloof when reading it, though - the author is bombastic and does not hold back on espousing his personal views, sometimes unfortunately mixing them with cold facts."},{"Title":"Partisans and Redcoats: The Southern Conflict That Turned the Tide of the American Revolution","review":"This is a nice and short little book. A fast read, as much as it seems to have been written: in a hurry (it ends quite abruptly too). The social environment is well described, from the personal accounts of many protagonists on both sides, to the battles and skirmishes that took place along the broad map of South Carolina. It was as crude as all civil wars: Fathers against sons in some cases. A very visual account, and fast paced.If only it were a little more organized, geographical and chronological-wise. The action takes place as soon in the piedmont as in the low-country, and we move from one family or protagonist to another at lightening speed. Easy to get a little confused. But it does convey the general picture well. Yes, you can get the general idea of what the Revolution meant for South Carolina in this little book. What a tough people the Scots-Irish are. God bless them and the South."},{"Title":"Partisans and Redcoats: The Southern Conflict That Turned the Tide of the American Revolution","review":"This book is well written, researched, fast moving and wonderful.

This page-turner examines the story behind the story we all know from school, looking at how men, women and children of all races and walks of life fought together for their -- and our -- freedom. While the men whose names we all know played an important role in the revolution (and they are included in the book), it is interesting to read how the civilians of South Carolina, with their sharp minds and strong wills, turned the tide and helped win what was a most uncivil war. In the context of recent events, this book is a strong reminder that freedom does not come without a price, and it is nice to finally learn about the people who made sacrafices and paid the ultimate price but are tradionally excluded from history books."},{"Title":"Partisans and Redcoats: The Southern Conflict That Turned the Tide of the American Revolution","review":"I found this book to be both enjoyable and informative, however it was also brief and at times confusing.This book covers the battles between the backcountry forces and the British and allies from the fall of Charlestown until the battle of cowpens.I would recomend this, however it seems both a bit short and the authors writing style confused me about the timeline a bit, however the timeline in the back and the maps of the battles made it all make sense!"},{"Title":"Forts of the West","review":"This book names the forts, presidios, and posts west of the Mississippi River to 1898, and not only does the author give the location but he gives some historical facts.

Do not expect any other information OF IMPORTANCE here. No history of important engagements near or involving each fort is given, which I find incredibly negligent.Examples: NO mention is made of the Fetterman Massacre in the entry on Fort Phil Kearny, or the Wagon Box Fight for that matter.NO mention is made of the Hayfield Fight in the entry on Fort C.F. Smith.NO mention is made of the two huge attacks on Julesberg, CO by a thousand Cheyennes in which the town was burned to the ground just outside Fort Sedgwick. I could go on.Don't expect ANY information on important engagements the various forts may have been a part of. However if you are really curious as to whether the fort was turned over to the Dept. of the Interior on its abandonment, then this book is for you. That fact is always listed. This book has exactly 4 photographs and 5 drawings.Though out of print, I recommend Herbert M. Hart's western fort series: \\"Pioneer Forts of the West\\", \\"Forts of the Far West\\", and \\"Old Forts of the Northwest\\". These books have hundreds of B&W; photos, detailed histories of engagements the forts partook in, as well as opening and closing dates, and a diagram of almost every fort discussed. You could just pick up the whole series (used) for less than the price of this book."},{"Title":"Forts of the West","review":"In the introduction to this book, Frazer refers to his compilation of military forts as \\"brief biographies.\\" Based on that description, the book is an excellent reference tool in identifying by name, location, length of service, and summary purpose all the known forts located west of the Mississippi River up to 1898.The book is arranged by state, with forts listed therein alphabetically. Although Frazer warns that locations are only approximate, they are still given with enough detail to place them fairly accurately on a topo map. When forts changed locations even by just a few miles (Ft. Hall, ID, for example), both forts are described. This is basically a listing, and most of the forts are detailed only briefly; when important events occurred, however, they are mentioned (Ft. Cobb, OK, for example, being attacked by Indians on October 23, 1862). Even forts that were unnamed or in existence for only a few months are included.I have used this book often, either for quick identification or as a stepping stone to more detailed investigations. The bibliography is one of the most thorough I've seen on the subject (36 pages long). The index is also very comprehensive, containing all the names and places mentioned in the text. As a reference tool for identifying forts and gleaming a brief account of their \\"biographies,\\" Frazer's book is superb."},{"Title":"Forts of the West","review":"As one commentator wrote, this book does not give the history of the military of the west, but that was not its design. If you are looking for information on forts to act as a source to further your investigation, this is a good book to help you locate the forts, camps, et cetera, of the army in the west.For over all history, nothing beatsFrontier Regulars: The United States Army and the Indian, 1866-1891andFrontiersmen in Blue: The United States Army and the Indian, 1848-1865.

There are excellent pictures throughout the book. Some of the bulbs have had changes in the latin names, and the author makes note of that. This book is botanically correct.Another thing that I loved is the way Mathew included with each bulb &quot;Associations.&quot; That is British for &quot;Combinations,&quot; or what plants combine well with the bulbs. Some of the pictures showing these combinations were great. This is the type of thing that is very helpful to gardeners. You do have to keep in mind that he is writing for England, and a few of the plants mentioned (like heaths and heathers) do not do well in many American gardens. Keeping that in mind, the combinations were excellent.At the end of each species description, the author lists the place of origin. This is also very helpful because then the gardener can use some common sense about where the plant likes to grow.There are more species listed than anyone would find readily available in the trade, so the book is very complete, and perhaps too technical for some people.

(possibly his third) Yet, there is nothing to indicate he was only starting out. Right away he grabs our attention with the funeral of King Henry V. Henry V's brothers Bedford and Gloucester help us to see the virtues and strengths of the deceased king. The Bishop of Winchester is well drawn as a comical villain who plots and plans, but never succeeds in doing any real damage. (Not until the next play anyway.) Talbot is memorable as the selfless hero of the play. York is memorable as the hero who defeats Joan of Arc. King Henry VI himself is interesting. First we see him as a helpless infant. By the third act, we see that he has both strengths and weaknesses. He makes the mistake of dividing the command between the rivals Somerset and York. But also, we see that he does not tolerate treason or neglect of duty. There are also many memorable scenes. The garden scene that foreshadows the War of the Roses is well drawn. The scene where York comforts his dying uncle is tragic beauty. Bedford's death in 3.2 has almost a divine tone. The death of Talbot and his son is very lamentable. York's sudden rise to power is captivating. Perhaps Shakespeare's greatest achievement in this play is that he simultaneously shows us England's war with France and the dissension with England itself."},{"Title":"King Henry VI;","review":"This is not quite as good as 1 or 2, but it is still excellent! Shakespeare grabs us with the dispute between Henry VI and York. While it seems to end peacefully it does not, and the war goes on! York's death in 1.4 is another landmark in Shakespeare's writing. The scene (2.5) where Henry finds true terror is horror, sorrow, and yet beauty and yet another moving part of the play. (The son that hath killed his father and the father that hath killed his son.) The war pauses in disaster for Henry and some comic relief is offered. But the horror starts all over again when Edward IV and Warwick have a falling out. The war starts over again, and the King of France gets involved! The scene where King Henry VI is reinstated is a scene of beauty and hope. While all of this is happening, Shakespeare carefully prepares the monstrously satanic character of Richard III. From here, the play just gets more and more bloody. A final moment of horror is offered when the eventual Richard III proudly compares himself to the one who betrayed Christ.

This book presents a mono-causal reason at the tactical level of war for why the Confederacy lost which is overly simplistic. Analysis of conflicts and their resolutions can rarely by tied to one cause - causes are normally woven together and to analyze one thread without the others creates an artificiality which negates any sincere analysis. This book conducts a sterile study of war at the tactical level without the influence of strategy, operational plans, politics, or economics which gives questionable results.In the beginning of the book, the authors clearly state their thesis which is the only time that it is clear. They begin to present data in several different tables that are skewed. In presenting a case that the Confederacy suffered more casualties because they attacked more often, the authors include the 29,396 southern soldiers who surrendered at Vickburg (these soldiers were entrenched and never attacked). There is sufficient evidence to support their case without skewing figures - this only lessens their credibility.After the first section, the thesis of the book seems to wander. Facts are presented but analysis is missing. Various issues of the war are well presented while others are biased and fail to present all of the evidence - some of the evidence does not support the thesis and some negates it. The combination of the rifle and fieldworks are proclaimed to be practically invincible. This becomes the primary thesis for most of the second section and the authors are more interested in proving this new thesis than supporting their original one. The South is accused of failing to learn from its attacks on entrenched positions while Gen Grant proceeded to charge them through the end of the war. Their logic is questionable, and they fail to ask if there were other reasons for these attacks. Did political pressure drive these attacks? What was the strategic objectives of both sides? None of these questions were addressed which all influenced the generals' decisions.Some of the topics presented in the book are never woven back into the theme of the book. In discussing artillery, the authors were more interested in proving that the rifle was the sole cause of the Confederate losses rather than showing how the devastation caused by smoothbore artillery against attacking infantry supported their original thesis. Cavalry was discussed but only in terms of its ineffectiveness as shock troops against the rifle. The book did not discuss the effective uses of the cavalry (reconnaissance or raids) and it did not develop how the change in roles for the cavalry supported their original thesis.The most glaring problem with this book is in the last chapter. This is where the true (hidden) thesis is presented - the Celtic heritage being the reason the South lost the war. The evidence presented is circumstantial and weak. The second to last chapter presented an excellent argument for why the Civil War generals' preferred to attack - they were young officers during the Mexican War where offensive action was decisive.The original thesis does present a factor in why the south lost - they lost in attrition warfare. With a smaller population, the South had less men available and the cost of attrition warfare was greater. They did sacrifice too many men in charges but was there a valid alternative? The authors did not explore other options but locked themselves into hidden agendas which diverted them from fully exploring, supporting, and developing their original thesis."},{"Title":"Attack and Die: Civil War Military Tactics and the Southern Heritage","review":"I would like to give this 2.5 stars, but 3 is too much.As a tactical discussion this is probably preferable to Paddy Griffith's work favoring vigorous frontal assault and discounting the new firepower. However, Attack and Die has some glaring omissions that hurt it, and it also makes some assertions that don't help. There are too many technological phases and differing terrain, strategic, and logistical situations in the American Civil War to support the simple tactical absolutes that authors too often apply.The authors' thesis is two fold: Southern armies were too aggressive; and that this was the result of Celtic heritage. On the first point it is true that the improvements in the rifle and percussion firing systems greatly improved the odds for the force on the tactical defensive. As the war progressed, earthworks further increased lethality of rifles while shielding the defender and concealing his numbers. However, this completely misses the strategic fact that it's rather hard for two opposing armies to simultaneously and indefinitely remain on the defensive since it results in stalemate. Unfortunately, as Joe Johnston proved both at Vicksburg (by failing to support Pemberton) and before Atlanta, if one cannot find an opportunity to repel the invader, the enemy can pin one's force and subdue it through siege operations. So remaining on the defensive can result in an even more demoralizing defeat without ever yielding an opportunity for victory. Preserving one's force is irrelevant if it cannot be fed or equipped because of destruction of one's territory, industry and logistical hubs. Lee, Davis, and even Bragg understood that. \\"Use it or lose it\\" applies.As for blaming the tactical offensive of Southern armies on Celtic roots, it fails on several levels. First, one wonders what that means for Grant's armies who lost far more men in offensives...and in the end captured three separate CSA field armies for their trouble, and broke the siege of Chattanooga. Second the ethnic theory illustrates a huge flaw in the authors' (and many others') approach to comparing North and South, a simplistic New England vs. Old South view. Both North and South were heterogeneous, the North far more so. New England was far different than the Old Northwest, or the western states of the time. The differences can be seen clearly in census data for churches.The discussion of ancient Celts, the *strategic* reasons for their defeats, the quality of their weapons and battles is very flawed and Telamon in particularly was erroneously interpreted.Ignoring the speculative ethnic theory, what is missing in the discussion is the recognition of initiative and that when defending one's territory one must either compel the invading army to attack so that it can be defeated, or find a way to gain sufficient advantage to attack and defeat it. This was the impetus behind Lee's actions to repeatedly repel Union armies in Virginia. While the cost was high, it was probably necessary to prevent the immobilization and eventual defeat of his army. When Lee could no longer do this in 1864 he was forced to settle into a prolonged but eventually fatal siege defense.Another important factor the authors neglected is that armies on the strategic offensive in hostile territory are at a considerable disadvantage in terms of intelligence, communications, and supply. Most of the decisive defeats North and South occurred as much for these strategic considerations as for tactical ones. Often forcing one major battle was sufficient to deplete the enemy's supplies or manpower sufficiently to end the offensive campaign even if victorious tactically.The authors are careful to point out the general adoption of major entrenchments as a standard practice by 1864, and how this greatly changed Civil War fighting. They also illustrate how these (along with further entrenchments in the rear) became nearly impregnable to assault. Upton and other commanders had partial successes of using heavy assault columns to overwhelm sections, but the inherent resulting disorganization prevented capture of parallels to the rear. Local successes had become too difficult to exploit with large armies.The best aspect of the book is the continual referencing of Mexican War actions and how these shaped the tactical thinking of the ACW commanders. Also useful is the lengthy discussions of period tactical manuals for the various arms.The artillery discussion is generally correct, but the authors conspicuously fail to note the *wartime* transition from inaccurate and short ranged 6 pounder smoothbores and 12 pounder howitzers to the more accurate and longer ranged Napoleons and rifled pieces.I was shocked at the lack of attention paid to Nathan Bedford Forrest's superb tactical skills. In fact the authors go so far as to suggest he added nothing! Perhaps they should have studied Brice's Cross Roads---a very relevant action that they entirely neglected to mention. Forrest understood initiative, momentum and concentration. Initiative and momentum are not things the authors seem to appreciate. With regard to weaponry, Forrest, like Mosby preferred two pistols for his men. This was an acknowledgement of the melee style of combat that frequently occurred in the thicketed country he operated in. He also at times effectively advanced his cannon in a more Napoleonic support because rifle range was not a factor in the dense growth. But perhaps Forrest's effective closer fighting style is in fact why they ignored his contributions.Another irritating oversight was ignoring the decisive battle of the Vicksburg campaign, Champion Hill, and instead focusing on assaults vs. the entrenchments around the city. Champion Hill was an example of fixing an army in position and then hammering at a wing until it broke. The whole Vicksburg campaign up until the siege is one of continuous motion (initiative and momentum) never allowing the defenders to face the attacker with parity. Furthermore, after Champion Hill, at the Big Black River Grant's forces easily overran the entrenchments and forced Pemberton's army back into the city's works. Other lesser-known examples are Piedmont, Droop Mountain, Cloyd's Mountain.Where Johnston failed is in giving up all the ground before Atlanta without once finding a point to effectively turn the Federal position or destroy a section of the army when it was most vulnerable. This is something the authors overlooked: the vulnerability of armies on the move to momentum based attacks. The defensive tactical advantage existed when positions were fixed and the defenders forces could support one another. When an army was moving it could be struck without such advantages as interior lines and defensive entrenchments. It also had less sense of where the enemy was and how strong while moving. Some famous examples of striking armies on the move include Brice's Crossroads, Mansfield, New Market, and Olustee. Each of these were Confederate victories seizing the tactical offensive from the enemy and effectively halting a Federal campaign.Grant and Lee understood the initiative at both strategic and tactical levels. The authors (as well as McClellan and Joe Johnston) apparently do/did not. The tactical offensive could be extremely costly and against entrenched defenders it was nearly suicidal unless there were special considerations. However, it could also achieve the strategic objective and produce outsized results in various other situations. I can't recommend this work to most readers as I think it will lead them to an erroneous view of offensive operations because its conclusions are too broad and absolute."},{"Title":"Attack and Die: Civil War Military Tactics and the Southern Heritage","review":"Attack and Die : Civil War Military Tactics and the Southern Heritage by Grady McWhiney and Perry D. Jamieson is a good compliment to other more complete histories of the Civil War. In and of itself the book is too focused on its central thesis - that the South lost due to the compulsion of its generals to be on the offensive and the resulting high casualty rate. While these tactics certainly had a dramatic effect on the outcome, the authors fail to put them in to the proper context of other causes.The strength of the book is in its description of the reasons for the Confederate strategy, and the failure of almost all Civil War generals to come to grips with the effect that the introduction of the rifle had on the upcoming battles. The authors trace the introduction of the rifle and the displacement of the musket as well as how the tactics that were used being generally premised on the musket. What was missing was any refrence to General Longstreet's plan for the strategic offense combined with tactical defense. This is exactly what Longstreet suggested to Lee before the second day of Gettysburg.The most interesting part of the book is the last two chapters. The second to last discusses how the Mexican War experiences of the generals predisposed the participants to take the offensive, since that is how the Mexican War was won. The increased accuracy and killing power of the rifle made those tactics obsolete.The last chapter is the most interesting, although the authors may have taken their conclusions too far. Their conclusion is that given the Celtic roots of the Confederate Generals that they were culturally programmed to take the offensive. While the cultural antecedents of the generals cannot be dismissed as a factor, the Celtic battles that the authors discuss took place generations before the Civil War.This is a worthwhile read for someone who already has a good Civil War background."},{"Title":"Attack and Die: Civil War Military Tactics and the Southern Heritage","review":"McWhiney and Jamieson use Attack and Die: Civil War Military Tactics and the Southern Heritage to effectively stage a war between the American Englishman of the North and the American Celts of the South. The authors engulf themselves in the heritage and culture of the South and its ties to its Celtic ancestry. Their viewpoints on how and why the Confederacy lost so many men are saturated throughout the book. Their exposition on Civil War tactics and how they were altered or rendered ineffective by technology allows the reader to examine the challenges faced by the Confederate commanders and soldiers in a war being fought solely with spirit and ambition.McWhiney's thesis is much more of a stretch. He examines the disastrous Southern military tactics which cost the Confederacy its independence and argues that the reason the South stuck to these tactics for so long had to do with the Celtic ancestry and folkways of Southerners and of Southern culture. He contends that &quot;the Confederates bled themselves nearly to death in the first three years of the war making costly attacks more often than did the Federals. Offensive tactics, which had been used so successfully by Americans in the Mexican War, were much less effective in the 1860's because an improved weapon, the rifle, had vastly increased the strength of defenders. The Confederates could have offset their numerical disadvantage by remaining on the defensive and forcing the Federals to attack; one man in a trench armed with a rifle was equal to several outside it. But Southerners, imprisoned in a culture that rejected careful calculation and patience, often refused to learn from their mistakes. They continued to fight, despite mounting casualties, with the same courageous dash and reckless abandon that had characterized their Celtic ancestors for two thousand years. The Confederates favored offensive warfare because the Celtic charge was and integral part of their heritage....There was no glory to be gained from fighting out of a hole in the ground.&quot;"},{"Title":"Attack and Die: Civil War Military Tactics and the Southern Heritage","review":"The focus of this book is boldly stated on page xv: \\"How and why the Confederates lost so many men is the burden of this book. We contend that the Confederates bled themselves nearly to death in the first three years of the war by making costly attacks more often than did the Federals.\\"One theme of the book is that warfare had been changed by the outset of the Civil War, with the development of rifled guns. Masses of troops firing at one another at close range made some sense with the inaccurate muskets of the Revolutionary War or the Napoleonic Wars. However, such formations made much less sense as rifles increased accuracy and range.Among specific arguments that the book makes is that the romance of the bayonet was pretty much done; evidence suggests that rather few casualties came from bayonet thrusts? Why not? It was difficult for attacking soldiers to get close enough to defenders because of the rifle fire and the use of defensive positioning. Fieldworks thwarted many massed charges; soldiers on the defensive were ordinarily better placed for victory than those who attacked. Just so, the value of cavalry with sabers bared, charging. The bulk of cavalry combat came with troopers fighting as infantry did, not fighting from atop their horses.Doctrine lagged behind facts-on-the-ground. Only a few officers began to redefine how to carry out an offensive against entrenchments (e.g., Emory Upton). And, according to the authors, Confederates appeared less willing to give up the tactical offensive. Why? Here comes the rather bizarre part of the book. The authors content that southerners were more Celtic and Northern troops more English. And, the contention goes, Celtic warriors fought on the offensive (there is even an effort to tie the Rebel yell to Celtic warriors). At this point, the argument, to me, falls to pieces.Nonetheless, up to that point, the analysis makes some sense. Other books have explored this thesis, too, but--until the end--this book compares well."},{"Title":"Attack and Die: Civil War Military Tactics and the Southern Heritage","review":"McWhiney and Jamieson argue that the South lost the Civil War because it lost too many men through frontal assaults, and that the frontal assaults were actuated by the South's aggression-prone Celtic culture.I thought the book established effectively that the defender had the advantage in the Civil War and discussed cogently the role of current tactical thought and Mexican War experience in encouraging offensive tactics despite the changes wrought by the rifled musket.The authors claim that when Confederate soldiers attacked they suffered more casualties than Federals did when they attacked, but do not seem to give an explanation. If this is true, and the problematic nature of exact numbers and losses in the Civil War should be acknowledged, I suspect it has to do with artillery fuses.A major claim, that Confederate troops attacked more often than Federals did, is never, in my view, substantiated. The evidence offered, which includes accounts of Grant's attacks in 1864, actually supports the idea that neither side really learned the dangers of the tactical offensive.I am, in particular, not convinced by any aspect of the \\"Celtic\\" theory. The evidence of a Southern preference for the offensive seems shaky, and the evidence for Southern cultural aggressiveness comes mostly from anecdotal and/or unfriendly sources. A newspaper editor ranting about war to the knife, or similar sources, shouldn't be taken as representing a culture as a whole.Nor am I convinced that the South was \\"Celtic\\", and the argument put forward by the authors is circular -- the South fought aggressively and that proves they were Celtic because Celts are aggressive. Actually, a quick look at the surnames of Northern and Southern generals and politicians doesn't give me any sense that the North, with its Sheridan and Grant, was any less Celtic in ancestry than the South with its Davis and Stuart. Irish immigrants were more common in Northern than Southern armies, though both sides had their Irish Brigades.The idea that the Celts were aggressive convinces me least of all. To support this claim, the authors mix primary sources and literary references, often from unfriendly and not necessarily expert authors (Caesar) and skip wildly from one cultural and historical setting to the next, giving a deep analysis of none and appearing to choose evidence tendentiously. Bannockburn, for example, appears, but Scots defensive schiltron formations do not.The authors use overgeneralized and stereotypical \\"racial\\" arguments -- Romans, Englishmen and Yankees were \\"practical, materialistic, tenacious, machine-like\\", and Celts and Confederates were \\"emotional, foolhardy, romantic, undisciplined\\". Substitute \\"white\\" and \\"black\\" for those ethnicities and it becomes clear that this argument is oversimplified at best. The idea that the American Civil War represented \\"a continuation of the centuries-old conflict between Celts and Englishmen...\\" not only strikes me as specious, but underemphasizes slavery as a cause to a degree with which I am uncomfortable.The idea that there's some meaningful tactical or cultural link between Pickett's Charge, say, and Vercingetorix, or for that matter Bonnie Prince Charlie, beggars my belief -- the popularity of Scott's novels notwithstanding. The book descends to its silliest level when it attempts to draw a serious parallel between a Union soldier's quite possibly wild claim of having found Union skulls in a Confederate camp and the beheading activities of the medieval Irish literary/mythological hero Cu Chulainn.I can't recommend this as serious scholarship."},{"Title":"Attack and Die: Civil War Military Tactics and the Southern Heritage","review":"Probably better suited for more serious students of the Civil War, \\"Attack and Die\\" by Grady McWhiney and Perry D. Jamieson, provides an excellent expose' about how the Confederates \\"bled themselves nearly to death...\\" by attacking with greater frequency than their Northern counterparts. The book also presents a very compelling argument about how the use of outdated offensive tactics, learned during the Mexican War, and antiquated in the face of major technological improvements to muskets and cannon, had a devastating effect on the South.Another interesting, and controversial, aspect of the book is the authors' conclusion that the tendency for offensive warfare was deeply rooted in Southern culture, and Celtic heritage. While the authors lacked sufficient evidence to be convincing on this point, they were far more convincing about how the advent of the rifle made bayonet attacks obsolete, the offensive use of cavalry ineffective, and entrenchments and fieldworks highly prized by Northern commanders.Although, as the authors point out that there were good reasons for the South to adopt a defensive strategy, they elected to pursue the offensive to the detriment of their cause. Certainly, it is difficult to argue with the fact that the South lost 175,000 men during the first 27 months of the war due to their propensity for offensive action, or how they lost 97,000 men vs. 77,000 men for the North during the first twelve major battles of the war, or how Pickett's famous charge resulted in the loss of 62% of his command at Gettysburg.It's no wonder that these tactics prompted D.H. Hill to respond with, \\"it was not war, it was murder,\\" in reference to the losses the Confederates took after repeated attacks against heavily entrenched Union troops on Malvern Hill on July 1, 1862.This book is an insightful and worthy addition to the study of Civil War strategy and tactics."},{"Title":"Attack and Die: Civil War Military Tactics and the Southern Heritage","review":"As many other reviewers have pointed out, the &quot;Celtic&quot; premise is ridiculously overblown. The Army of Northern Virginia can not be compared to the Scots at Culloden in 1745.Also, as other reviewers have pointed out, the book ignores many &quot;big picture&quot; issues that played into the outcome of the war. Better alternative reading would be &quot;Two Great Rebel Armies&quot; by McMurry or &quot;Why the South Lost&quot; by Hattaway and company."},{"Title":"Attack and Die: Civil War Military Tactics and the Southern Heritage","review":"The authors make an excellent argument that Confederate tactical aggression in the face of changing technology caused an attrition rate higher than their adversaries (exactly what one does not want when fighting a defensive war), an argument that is backed up with statistics and logic. Unfortunately they then make bizarre and totally unsupported conclusions from that...conclusion.The body of the book is a bit dry and heavy on numbers and charts, which actually makes it good as a tabletop reference. They have an obvious pro-Confederate bias, shown most clearly in the use of Manassas and Sharpsburg instead of Bull Run and Antietam (although they also use the Union name Fair Oaks instead of the more common Seven Pines). They also say \\"yankee\\" and if I recall correctly use one or more of the pro-South euphemisms (Southern Independence, Northern Aggression, etc.); slavery is not mentioned, but I don't think it should be, as this is an examination of battlefield tactics used IN the war, not a study of the political causes OF the war. It frequently refers to the experiences of the men on both sides during the Mexican-American War, and how this last struggle fought with smoothbore muskets taught them the exact WRONG lessons for a war fought with rifled muskets. So overall the data is good, and I can recommend it to students and anyone with a solid background in the conflict. Novices would find it obtuse and boring, and experts probably won't discover anything new, but those of us in the middle could put it to good use.The ending makes absolutely no sense whatsoever as it veers into ethnic theories, the so-called \\"Celtic thesis\\". This is completely unsupported by facts in evidence (or facts generally); there is literally ONE mention of this element before the conclusion, a single line in the Acknowledgements. Now, I once did this, trying to force a conclusion at the end without leading up to it; of course, I was in 8th grade at the time and it was the first serious research paper I ever wrote, at a monstrous 5 pages. To see this done by a pair of PhDs in a major scholarly work is shocking. Also, the stats tables so useful in the main body are absent from the conclusion; perhaps because a demographic study would implode the whole theory. Pennsylvania had a larger concentration of Welsh and Scots-Irish than most of the South, yet McWhiney and Jamieson don't make jaw-dropping statements about their inherited aggression and barbarity. In the eyes of themselves and their would-be allies across the sea, the Virginia planters were Englishmen in all but geography; the North took in the majority of the Irish, and Southerner and Englishman alike sneered at the Celtic mob.To sum up: there is a wealth of useful information here, but take the concluding chapter with an entire bowl of salt."},{"Title":"Attack and Die: Civil War Military Tactics and the Southern Heritage","review":"I'd write much more if I had the space (and I might eventually write the authors in any event), but I see three errors in the authors' assertion that the South was uselessly aggressive early in the war and could have won through a more defensive strategy:1. It is based on the enemy being obliging enough to attack frontally. In the First Manassas campaign, however, the Union commander elected to turn the flank rather than attack the Confederate entrenchments, and nearly won the battle as a result.If the Union commanders had all followed this example, all the Southern armies' defensive positions wouldn't have done them any good; they would have been outflanked all the way to surrender.2. It assumes that a Revolutionary War-type strategy, wherein the defender almost always has space and time to manuever, and isn't concerned with defending big cities filled with military industry or large areas of cropland necessary to feed the army, would have worked with a South that was dependent on these industries and crops for survival and, because of Napoleonic innovations in the art of pursuing and overtaking an enemy army, would not have had as much space and time to manuever. It is worth noting that not one war has been one solely by means of attrition since the Revolution (not counting Vietnam, where attrition won only because the American armies were handicapped by political considerations).3. It makes the mistake of emphasizing war solely as mathematical equation rather than human endeavor. If success in war depended solely on bringing the numbers of the enemy's armies down to zero, no war would be won, since there has not been such a war of total destruction since ancient times. Victory, rather, is dependent on the psychological element---that is, what a nation thinks of it's chances for winning versus the situation. Regardless of Lee's \\"unacceptable\\" rate of casualties, he came very close to winning through the psychology of victory---that is, by driving the Northern peoples' morale down to the breaking point through battles lost. Nor would Southern armies standing permanently on the defense have satisfied their own people, particularly as large areas of land were lost to the enemy through manuvering (assuming #1 above).This is how wars are fought and won: with hearts and minds, not calculators; and through attack, not defense."},{"Title":"Attack and Die: Civil War Military Tactics and the Southern Heritage","review":"McWhiney and Jamieson offer their perspective on the South's stratagems during the Civil War with emphasis on two main points: the efficacy of the rifled musket and the lessons (oft times the &quot;wrong&quot; ones) learned during the Mexican War. The role of infantry, artillery and cavalry are outlined, with, as a nice touch, a summarizing/concluding paragraph at the end of each chapter. The final chapter, which logics the South's &quot;Celtic&quot; war-like traditions, I found a bit of a stretch."},{"Title":"Attack and Die: Civil War Military Tactics and the Southern Heritage","review":"The authors in this book point out that if the South had focused on defending itself instead of attacking Union troops during battles (not even counting the two failed invasions of the North by Lee) they might have had a chance. Yet the authors also show that the South had no choice - their generals took from West Point (and the Mexican War) all the wrong lessons - that tactical offensive would always win the day. Before rifled weapons, when the musket was the main weapon of the ground forces, men COULD get close enough to use the bayonet and use it well. I have seen studies that showed many battles during the Pre-Rifle period (American Revolution, War of 1812) was decided by the bayonet - those killed were mostly killed by the bayonet. Muskets were too ineffective.Rifles changed all that. It changed everything but American generals, mostly those of the South, refused to change their ways. But then why didn't the people say something to make them change their ways? The authors suggest that this also had to do with the culture of the South - that they were Celtic in their ways and thoughts. So the people approved of the tactics, even when it meant defeat!While that part of the book seems weak, most of it I can agree with. This book DOES list a ton of facts and I suggest it only for those who already know a lot about the American Civil War."},{"Title":"Attack and Die: Civil War Military Tactics and the Southern Heritage","review":"Attempts to explain why the South lost the Civil War have been a crowded cottage industry since the war ended. Northern industrial might, excessive Southern democracy, poor political leadership, faulty economic support, have all had their advocates and periods of popularity. Attack and Die is a fresh appraoch to the question. The analysis of McWhiney and Jamieson combines a shrewd analysis of southern culture, changes in military technology between 1846 and 1861, with an impressive array of statistics to explain the Southern defeat as springing from their dependence on outmoded tactics that worked in the Mexican War but did not work fifteen years later. The reason: the change in that fifteen years from the musket to the rifle as the basic infantry weapon. Studies like this demonstrate that there is still a vast amount of material to be collected, analysed, and theorized upon about our Civil War."},{"Title":"Attack and Die: Civil War Military Tactics and the Southern Heritage","review":"In Attack and Die the authors attempt to explain the reason for the southern preference for the attack over defense and inject into the discussion the relevance of Celtic heritage as part of the penchant for aggression. It appears the problem many reviewers have is describing the heritage as \\"Celtic.\\" It proves too much of a stretch in the attempt to find a cultural continuum all the way back to the era of Julius Caesar and his Gallic foes described in his commentaries.Instead of Celtic it may have been better to label the cultural influence as Scots-Irish. This is the culture described in detail by David Hackett Fischer in part four of his outstanding history Albion's Seed. Also, Jim Webb's Born Fighting is an excellent popular history on the Scots-Irish. These are the people who came to America from Ulster and low country Scotland and moved into the colonial frontier. The rank-and-file of the Confederate army was largely a product of this culture.Southern aggression may have had some cultural origins but it resulted from political expedience as well. The back-pedaling Joe Johnston would have been a favorite with Czar Alexander I, but with Jeff Davis as his boss he ranks low in the pantheon of southern generals. Oddly, for all their attempt to demonstrate southern aggressiveness, the authors conclude that \\"no other Civil War general--not even Lee--was more aggressive than Grant.\\"There is much in Attack and Die to entertain and inform, if you don't get too caught up in the whole Celtic debate."},{"Title":"Attack and Die: Civil War Military Tactics and the Southern Heritage","review":"The thrust of this book can be found in its portrayal of the brave men who clashed over hill and dale, river and stream, and hallowed ground with bayonets, rifles, and artillary pieces of all descriptions, all deadly to humans, especially those enfused with a Celtic Culture whose dictum was 'attack and die.' This war of 10,000 battles killed north of 600,000 soldiers and men, And in 'Attack and Die' you see just exactly who, where, how, and why.They'd line up, shoulder to shoulder and attack at the same pace while screaming remarkably like the Celts who attacked the Romans, oh those many years ago. Courage was at a premium and devil may care, the mood. The book cites attack after attack, under all different circumstances, with an over hang of an over riding sense of error, that is that the newer rifiles were accurate at much greater range than they had been in the Mexica war just 15 years before. Even at this the north's advantage in men and material could have been somewhat nullified had the southern leaders changed their tactics. But old habits die hard, and Lee, even without Jane Fonda on network television, could have fought a guerilla war resulting in two countries with fewer casualties.The confederates were brave men, with great spirit, a culture of honor, and what did they get?

Set in a boys' boarding school in New England the story unfolds in the home of a teacher (master), middle-aged Bill Reynolds, who revels in his residents' athletic prowess. Laura, his 24-year old bride, gradually realizes that he is not the same, vulnerable man whom she met and fell in love with in Italy. He seems to prefer the masculine company of the guys to spendingquality time with her. Her only friend, Lilly, is also a former actress, but this gal revels in the lascivious attention of the junior jocks.Tom, one of the boys in this house, is just 17, sensitive by nature and lonely in the extreme, totally out of place with the butch fellows who sport crew cuts. To further emphasize Tom's not fitting in, tho he is a tennis star in his own right, he prefers poetry and playing women's roles in amateur theatricals. When he is \\"seen\\" at a beach in the buff with another master, rumors abound that he is gay; he is suddenly the butt of nasty thoughts, snide remarks and social ostracism.As the wife of a master Laura is merely expected to offer tea and sympathy to the resident boys in her home--to set a genteel tone in the parlor. But something about Tom arouses more than her sympathy; escalating to fascination and ultimately desire--on both sides. In orderto counter the ugly rumors about his being homosexual---based on the flimsiest of proof--Tom rashly makes a date with a trampy girl, hoping to get a reputation as a regular guy. The scheme backfires to the boy's mortification. Equally eager to establish his manhood Laura takes matters into her own hands, but how far will she go to soothe his ego? Either way his reputation is shattered and he faces expulsion, at least from the House, if the not the school itself. As a dramatic stroke of genius it is the climax of literary irony that the very youth who is scorned for being gay, has a secret affair with the wife of his tormentor.

This book is DANGEROUS! Most people's ancestral spirits may be generally kindly disposed towards them, but a few weeks on &quot;the Coleman diet&quot; would turn even the sweetest spirit into one very angry, very vindictive ghost.Coleman is either patently ignorant of most Western historical accounts of necromancy (which generally involve a lot of blood and/or food and alcohol offerings) and the vast bulk of Voodoo/Santeria/Umbanda/Candomble wisdom which has been gathered over generations and is readily available in most large metropolitan areas of the Western Hemisphere and elsewhere, or else he is deliberately imposing his own sanctimonious pseudo-Deist outlook on what is LITERALLY a deadly serious matter.I have no doubt that people have achieved remarkable success with Coleman's methods, but I also have little doubt that they were either self-deluded or else misled by &quot;the trickster spirits&quot; of whom Coleman (sensibly) warns his readers.Coleman repeatedly hammers home the message: get a teacher! I would agree, adding but one caveat: make certain that your tutor in necromancy doesn't follow Coleman's other advice."},{"Title":"Communing with the Spirits: The Magical Practice of Necromancy Simply and Lucidly Explained, with Full Instructions for the Practice of That Ancie","review":"This is an extremely interesting and carefully designed treatment of some methods of working with spirits, meant for use by mature and sensible people with considerable previous experience in magic. I particularly value the author's insistence on the slow, gradual development of one's own skills. Someone who is impulsive and impatient by nature probably ought not to attempt the program of work that Coleman describes.Just what these spirits may be, will always be controversial. Are they parts of the necromancer him(her)self, something like Jung's semi-autonomous complexes? Are they parts (archetypes) of something like Jung's collective unconsciousness? Are they the souls or spirits of other human beings, either living or dead? Are they other-than-human incorporeal beings, of one or several kinds? Are they denizens of the Other Places, who occasionally enter the confines of Our World? Do a few of them occasionally come from High Reality, beyond the parameters of time and space? Are they just apparitions, as will often appear in a psychomanteum constructed and used along Raymond Moody's lines? Are they, perhaps, something beyond any of these possibilities? -- Indeed, are some of them one thing, others another, yet others a third thing, and so on? I see no way to answer these questions with absolute certainty.Whatever the spirits may be that one encounters by Coleman's methods, they seem to be very skillful in adapting to (or exploiting) the expectations of those who encounter them, presenting themselves just as the necromancer hopes (or fears). Some of them clearly want to be summoned, for their own unknown purposes (which will not be the same as the necromancer's purposes), and will make themselves extremely appealing to achieve their aims.This means that deep self-knowledge, grave dispassion, and a good measure of caution are needed for this work.The first edition was published in a quite limited number of copies, but there is now a revised edition with additional material, which I have not yet seen."},{"Title":"Communing with the Spirits: The Magical Practice of Necromancy Simply and Lucidly Explained, with Full Instructions for the Practice of That Ancie","review":"One of the best books that i've read on Necromancy.

Easy to follow with a lot of information to help dwelve into the more intracate processes of Frontpage. I wish the later programs had this kind of simplicity to them. Web design is becoming so complicated for how simple this program and book show it to be. Which if you are just learning and need an inexpensive web design program I recommend it highly. Just as I recommend this book."},{"Title":"Lindum Colonia","review":"This book is a plagiate of Mika Waltari's book \\"The Roman\\" (original titel \\"Ihmiskunnan viholiset\\", published 1964 in Finland and translation in English published in 1966.SHAME ON SLATER!"},{"Title":"Lindum Colonia","review":"Colin Slater \\"writes\\" an excact copy of an another author's book and goes even further telling about 18 months of research work in England, which was needed for the book.
