Oakley and Rebecca H. Sinos incorporate copious illustrations of Athenian vases in their analysis, supplementing evidence drawn from contemporary Greek literature. The weddings rendered on the vases evolve through time, from formal scenes of the wedding procession on black-figure vases to later red-figure scenes offering more intimate views of the bride as she prepares her adornments. In these later scenes, the authors point out, Greek women appear as more than just passive objects of men's manipulations; they possess their own powerful and divinely sanctioned means of seduction.\\" \\"The evidence of wedding scenes on vases of both eras is valuable for several reasons. Some vases depict aspects of the wedding that are not clearly portrayed in literature, thus supplying a better understanding of each stage of the ceremony. Vases also offer insight into Athenian attitudes toward the wedding, suggesting a perspective different from that provided by Greek literature. The book includes scenes that represent real life, scenes that are clearly mythological, and also some tableaux that blur the distinction between mortals and gods or heroes, suggesting the idealized state in which mortals appeared when engaged in rituals with divine prototypes.\\" \\"The Wedding in Ancient Athens is as enjoyable as it is informative. Oakley and Sinos thoroughly explore Athenian wedding iconography and interpret it so that the ceremony can be appreciated by a modern audience.\\"--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

The fault, argues this ingenious even liberating book, lies not in ourselves, but in product design that ignores the needs of users and the principles of cognitive psychology. The problems range from ambiguous and hidden controls to arbitrary relationships between controls and functions, coupled with a lack of feedback or other assistance and unreasonable demands on memorization. The Design of Everyday Things shows that good, usable design is possible. The rules are simple: make things visible, exploit natural relationships that couple function and control, and make intelligent use of constraints. The goal: guide the user effortlessly to the right action on the right control at the right time. In this entertaining and insightful analysis, cognitive scientist Don Norman hails excellence of design as the most important key to regaining the competitive edge in influencing consumer behavior. Now fully expanded and updated, with a new introduction by the author, The Design of Everyday Things is a powerful primer on how and why some products satisfy customers while others only frustrate them.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qBfRDQAAQBAJ&dq=The+Psychology+Of+Everyday+Things&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The web of government","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The married life of Anne of Austria: Queen of France, mother of Louis XIV","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=a79PAAAAcAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Snowbird","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3SCdtgEACAAJ&dq=The+Snowbird&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Techniques and Resources in Teaching Reading (Teaching Techniques in English as a Second Language)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Back In Your Arms: Love Changes Everything\\\\Love Lessons\\\\A Taste Of Romance (Arabesque)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Breaking News: God Has A Plan - An Anchorwoman's Journey Through Faith","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"A Taste of Astrology: A Cookbook with 240 Heavenly Recipes and Menus for Each Astrological Sign","description":"For all twelve signs of the zodiac, there are 240 recipes and menus.

Thiscomprehensive reference guide makes it easy to look up the mostfrequently needed information--not just about the Python languageitself, but also the most frequently used parts of the standard libraryand the most important third-party extensions. Ask any Python aficionado and you'll hear that Python programmers haveit all: an elegant object-oriented language with readable andmaintainable syntax, that allows for easy integration with componentsin C, C++, Java, or C#, and an enormous collection of precoded standardlibrary and third-party extension modules. Moreover, Python is easy tolearn, yet powerful enough to take on the most ambitious programmingchallenges. But what Python programmers used to lack is a concise andclear reference resource, with the appropriate measure of guidance inhow best to use Python's great power. Python in aNutshell fills this need. Python in a Nutshell, Second Edition covers morethan the language itself; it also deals with the mostfrequently used parts of the standard library, and the most popular andimportant third party extensions. Revised and expanded forPython 2.5, this book now contains the gory details of Python's newsubprocess module and breaking news about Microsoft's newIronPython project.

Claiming Sylvia Plath is a critical and comprehensive reception study of what has been written about Plath from 1960 to 2010. Academic and popular interest in her seems incessant, verging on a public obsession. The story of Sylvia Plath is not only the story of a writer and her texts, but also of the readers who have tried to make sense of her life and work. A religious tone and a rhetoric of accountability dominate among the devoted. Questing for the real or true Sylvia, they share a sense of posessiveness towards outsiders or those who deviate from what they see as a correct approach to the poet. In order to offer a new and more nuanced perspective on Plath s public image, the reception has been organized into interpretive communities composed of critics, feminists, biographers, psychologists, and friends. Pertinent questions are raised about how the poet functions as an excemplary figure, and how  and by whom  she is used to further theories, politics, careers, and a number of other causes. Ethical issues and rhetorical strategies consequently loom high in Claiming Sylvia Plath. The book may be employed both as a guide to the massive body of Plath literature and as a history of a changing critical doxa. Why Sylvia Plath has been serviceable to so many and open to colonization is another way of asking why she keeps on fascinating all kinds of readers worldwide. Claiming Sylvia Plath suggests a host of possible answers. It includes an extensive Plath bibliography.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ar4wBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Man Who Did Not Die: The Story of Elijah","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Olympics 2004?: Ask Yia Yia and Pa Pou","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Playful Patchwork Projects","description":"Every one of these 22 colorful, cheerful patchwork patterns is sure to bring out big, sunny smiles.

Bana Alabed, Twitter, October 12, 2016 When seven-year-old Bana Alabed took to Twitter to describe the horrors she and her family were experiencing in war-torn Syria, her heartrending messages touched the world and gave a voice to millions of innocent children. Bana s happy childhood was abruptly upended by civil war when she was only three years old. Over the next four years, she knew nothing but bombing, destruction, and fear. Her harrowing ordeal culminated in a brutal siege where she, her parents, and two younger brothers were trapped in Aleppo, with little access to food, water, medicine, or other necessities. Facing death as bombs relentlessly fell around them one of which completely destroyed their home Bana and her family embarked on a perilous escape to Turkey. In Bana s own words, and featuring short, affecting chapters by her mother, Fatemah, Dear World is not just a gripping account of a family endangered by war; it offers a uniquely intimate, child s perspective on one of the biggest humanitarian crises in history. Bana has lost her best friend, her school, her home, and her homeland.

In this book, Margaret Kelleher uses the Maamtransa case, notorious for its failure to interpretive and translation services to monoglot Irish speakers, as a starting point for an investigation into broader sociolinguistic issues. Uncovering archival materials not previously consulted, this book illuminates a story that has proven to be a much messier social narrative than previously recognized. Kelleher show that, although the wrongful execution of monolingual Irishmen have historically been the best-known feature of the case, the complex significance of language use in an isolated region mirrors the dynamics that continue to influence the fates of monolingual and bilingual people today.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GdQ9uwEACAAJ&dq=Maamtrasna+the+Murders&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"There Is a Cure for Arthritis","description":"This book was written with the sole aim of bringing the good news of successful biological treatments to millions of arthritis sufferers, and freeing them from their hopelessness and desperation.

These stories complete the oeuvre of a major detective novelist. Here Bruce's gift for entertaining dialogue is at its peak, and so is his extraordinary gift for mystery: he teases, tangles and contrives with cunning. Even the slightest of the stories is deft and telling, skillfully narrated, with economy and point. The best are worthy additions to the canon, elegant, clever and satisfying. All but one story in this collection were written for the London Evening Standard, where they appeared between 1950 and 1956. This collection contains twenty-eight stories, only two of which have been previously collected: ten feature Sergeant Beef, eight feature Sergeant Grebe and ten have no series character. They add to our knowledge of Sergeant Beef, one of the most colorful of fictional detectives (and one whose full-length cases are too few in number); they introduce an unexpected second detective, the astute and resourceful policeman, Sergeant Grebe; and they offer a last chance to encounter anew their author's characteristic wit and ingenuity. Few writers so adroitly avoid the formulaic quality of crime writing by the variety and vitality of their characters.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NBIKAAAACAAJ&dq=Murder+In+Miniature:+THE+SHORT+STORIES+OF+LEO+BRUCE+(Carolus+Deene+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Madrid: A Cultural and Literary Companion (Cities of the Imagination)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_i2BzQEACAAJ&dq=Madrid:+A+Cultural+and+Literary+Companion+(Cities+of+the+Imagination)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Why So High?

The authors reveal the full scale of the planetary emergency we face - but also how we can stabilize Earth's life-support system. The necessary change is within our power, if we act now. In 2009, scientists identified nine planetary boundaries that keep Earth stable, ranging from biodiversity to ozone. Beyond these boundaries lurk tipping points. In order to stop short of these tipping points, the 2020s must see the fastest economic transition in history. This book demonstrates how societies are reaching positive tipping points that make this transition possible: groups such as Extinction Rebellion and the schoolchildren led by Greta Thunberg demand political action; countries are committing to eliminating greenhouse gas emissions; and one tipping point has even already passed - the price of clean energy has dropped below that of fossil fuels.

If a \\"hen frigate\\" was any ship carrying a captain's wife, then a \\"she captain\\" is a bold woman distinguished for courageous enterprise in the history of the sea. \\"She captains,\\" who infamously possessed the \\"bodies of women and the souls of men,\\" thrilled and terrorized their shipmates, doing \\"deeds beyond the valor of women.\\" Some were \\"bold and crafty pirates with broadsword in hand.\\" Others were sirens, too, like the Valkyria Princess Alfhild, whom the mariners made rover-captain for her beauty. Like their male counterparts, these astonishing women were drawn to the ocean's beauty -- and its danger. In her inimitable, yarn-spinning style, award-winning historian Joan Druett tells us what life was like for the women who dared to captain ships of their own, don pirates' garb, and perform heroic and hellacious deeds on the high seas. We meet Irish raider Grace \\"Grania\\" O'Malley -- sometimes called \\"the bald Grania\\" because she cut her hair short like a boy's -- who commanded three galleys and two hundred fighting men. Female pirates Anne Bonny and Mary Read were wanted by the law. Armed to the teeth with cutlasses and pistols, they inspired awe and admiration as they swaggered about in fancy hats and expensive finery, killing many a man who cowered cravenly before them. Lovelorn Susan \\"Put on a jolly sailor's dress/And daubed her hands with tar/To cross the raging sea/On board a man of war\\" to be near her William. Others disguised themselves for economic reasons. In 1835, Ann Jane Thornton signed on as a ship's steward to earn the fair wage of nine dollars per month. When it was discovered that she was a woman, the captain testified that Jane was a capital sailor, but the crew had been suspicious of her from the start, \\"because she would not drink her grog like a regular seaman.\\" In 1838, twenty-two-year-old Grace Darling led the charge to rescue nine castaways from the wreck of the Forfarshire (the Titanic of its day). \\"I'll save the crew!\\" she cried, her courageous pledge immortalized in a torrent of books, songs, and poems. Though \\"she captains\\" had been sailing for hundreds of years by the turn of the twentieth century, Scotswoman Betsey Miller made headlines by weathering \\"storms of the deep when many commanders of the other sex have been driven to pieces on the rocks.\\" From the warrior queens of the sixth century B.C. to the women shipowners influential in opening the Northwest Passage, Druett has assembled a real-life cast of characters whose boldness and bravado will capture popular imagination. Following the arc of maritime history from the female perspective, She Captains' intrepid crew sails forth into a sea of adventure.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PG6TuUhoq88C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Thai-English dictionary","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The War Between the State: Northern California vs. Southern California","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"STUDIES IN BIBLICAL AND SEMITIC SYMBOLISM.","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QATXAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ayurvedic Healing for Women","description":"Ayurveda, the oldest continually practiced medical system in the world, has always had a special branch of medicine just for women and offers unique understanding of female anatomy--one that encompasses not only the physical and energetic body, but the emotions, the mind, and the spirit.

Citizen Hughes is the New York Times bestselling expos  of Hughes s hidden life, and a stunning revelation of his  megalomaniac empire in the emperor s own words  (Newsweek). At the height of his wealth, power, and invisibility, the world s richest and most secretive man kept what amounted to a diary. The billionaire commanded his empire by correspondence, scrawling thousands of handwritten memos to unseen henchmen. It was the only time Howard Hughes risked writing down his orders, plans, thoughts, fears, and desires. Hughes claimed the papers were so sensitive  the very most confidential, almost sacred information as to my innermost activities  that not even his most trusted aides or executives were allowed to keep the messages he sent them. But in the early-morning hours of June 5, 1974, unknown burglars staged a daring break-in at Hughes s supposedly impregnable headquarters and escaped with all the confidential files. Despite a top-secret FBI investigation and a million-dollar CIA buyback bid, none of the stolen secret papers were ever found until investigative reporter Michael Drosnin cracked the case. In Citizen Hughes, Drosnin reveals the true story of the great Hughes heist and of the real Howard Hughes. Based on nearly ten thousand never-before-published documents, more than three thousand in Hughes s own handwriting, Citizen Hughes is far more than a biography, or even an unwilling autobiography. It is a startling record of the secret history of our times.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9RqPrIZNyrgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Mummers' Dance","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Sister Slam and the Poetic Motormouth Roadtrip","description":"\\"I was smitten, bitten by a love bug or something I didn't even care that I'd just been hit.

The lives and performances of these representative singers become sites for conversations between the rural and urban, local and national, folk and elite, and traditional and modern. In Song King: Connecting People, Places, and Past in Contemporary China, Levi S. Gibbs examines the life and performances of  Folksong King of Western China  Wang Xiangrong (b. 1952) and explores how itinerant performers come to serve as representative symbols straddling different groups, connecting diverse audiences, and shifting between amorphous, place-based local, regional, and national identities. Moving from place to place, these border walkers embody connections between a range of localities, presenting audiences with traditional, modern, rural, and urban identities among which to continually reposition themselves in an evolving world. Born in a small mountain village near the intersection of the Great Wall and the Yellow River in a border region with a rich history of migration, Wang Xiangrong was exposed to a wide range of songs as a child. The songs of Wang s youth prepared him to create a repertoire of region-representing pieces and mediate between regions, nations, and multinational corporations in national and international performances. During the course of a career that included meeting Deng Xiaoping in 1980 and running with the Olympic torch in 2008, Wang s life, songs, and performances have come to highlight various facets of social identity in contemporary China. Drawing on extensive fieldwork with Wang and other professional folksingers from northern Shaanxi province at weddings, Chinese New Year galas, business openings, and Christmas concerts, Song King argues that songs act as public conversations people can join in on. As song kings and queens fuse personal and collective narratives in performances of iconic songs, they provide audiences with compelling models for socializing personal experience, negotiating a sense of self and group in an ever-changing world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=k3RQDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Instant Christmas Pageant: The Not So Silent Night","description":"Make your Christmas program easy with this flexible, fully prepared pageant that lets kids of any size cast simply pantomime parts.

Relying on contemporary newspapers, political handouts, broadsides, and public petitions, Sowell describes and analyzes the economic, social, and political history of the capital's artisan class, a middling social sector with very significant social and political strengths. Latin American labor history has heretofore focused almost exclusively on twentieth-century industrial or agrarian laborers. This is the first study in English of nineteenth-century Latin American artisans and one of the few treatments that spans the whole of nineteenth-century Colombian history. The rise and subsequent decline of artisan class political activity coincided with Colombia's integration into the world market. Initially petitioning for tariff protection, Bogota's craftsmen in time mobilized to address numerous issues, including industrial education, internal trade order, credit, and better health and educational facilities. The artisan class was a sizeable share of the urban electorate and, at the beginning of this period, was essentially cohesive. Sowell traces the transformation of Colombia's economy and the (mainly negative) effects its evolution had on bogotano artisans. By the end of the nineteenth century, the fragmentation of the artisan class had destroyed their broad mobilizations. No longer leaders of the Colombian labor movement, the artisans were replaced by laborers associated with industrial production, transportation systems, and the production of coffee. The study of artisan-based labor activity illuminates the foundations of contemporary Latin American societies. Sowell's examination of the political expression of artisan class interests and the social and political variables that affected those interests sheds light on the subsequent industrial development in Colombia as well as on the \\"modern\\" period of Latin American history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_F20MdgTpqwC&dq=The+Early+Colombian+Labor+Movement:+Artisans+and+Politics+in+Bogota,+1832-1919&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The daily management of records and information (Local government records technical publication series)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Manners and customs of the Bible,","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Athena and Kain: The True Meaning of Greek Myth","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Nora (Sunfire)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Epistle to the Hebrews","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Field Notes: A Geography of Mourning","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"McNally's Dare","description":"If anyone can connect a dead waiter in a pool, a deceased duchess, and a possibly phony heir, it s the Palm Beach PI in this New York Times bestseller.

The author has no desire to tear down anything good that may be found in any system of medicine. But this is an age of keen investigation of idol breaking and truth finding. He who is afraid to investigate for fear that some cherished belief will be swept away, is not a true scientist. Age cannot sanctify an error. It is with the kindest of feelings towards the science of Homoeopathy, and its many brave and noble defenders, that its underlying principle, similia similibus curantur has been questioned, and idem the same to the same, or the law of Supplying Deficiencies pushed to the front as the Natural Law of Cure. It is not claimed that all the matter in the book is original. It is absolutely necessary in preparing a text-book on Biochemistry, to use, in the main, the therapeutics and materia medica of Schuessler and the translator, Dr. M. Docetti Walker, of Dundee, Scotland. Some additions have been made, founded on experience. Hundreds of eminent physicians throughout the land have given time and experience that go to enrich the pages of the work. But the writer does claim originality in the biochemic pathology and the modus operandi of its therapeutics, and holds that his theories in regard to the manner and mode of operation, by which the inorganic cell-salts of human blood unite with organic matter to form certain material for carrying on life's processes, have never before been clearly set forth.

It is hoped the progressive physician will investigate, without prejudice, and thereby assist humanity to a true understanding of the cause and cure of disease. -The Author (originally published in 1894)","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=e7XonQEACAAJ&dq=The+biochemic+system+of+medicine:+Comprising+the+theory,+pathological+action,+therapeutical+application,+materia+medica,+and+repertory+of+Schuessler%27s+Twelve+tissue+remedies&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"SELECTED POEMS OF GABRIELA MISTRAL","description":"The first Nobel Prize in literature to be awarded to a Latin American writer went to the Chilean poet Gabriela Mistral. Famous and beloved during her lifetime all over Latin America and in Europe, Mistral has never been known in North America as she deserves to be. The reputation of her more flamboyant and accessible friend and countryman Pablo Neruda has overshadowed hers, and she has been officially sentimentalized into a \\"poetess\\" of children and motherhood. Translations, and even selections of her work in Spanish, have tended to underplay the darkness, the strangeness, and the raging intensity of her poems of grief and pain, the yearning power of her evocations of the Chilean landscape, the stark music of her Round Dances, the visionary splendor of her Hymns of America. During her lifetime Mistral published four books: Desolation, Tenderness, Clearcut, and Winepress. These are included in the \\"Complete\\" Nobel edition published in Madrid; the Poem of Chile, her last book, was printed years after her death. Le Guin includes poems from all five books in this volume, with particular emphasis on the later work. The intelligence and passion of Le Guin's selection and translation will finally allow people in the North to hear the originality, power, purity, and intransigence of this great American voice. Le Guin has published five volumes of her own poetry, an English version of Lao Tzu's Tao Te Ching, and a volume of mutual translation with the Argentine poet Diana Bellessi, The Twins, the Dream/Las Gemalas, El Sue?o. Strongly drawn to Mistral's work as soon as she discovered it, Le Guin has been working on this translation for five years.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wfz9RAbgrZwC&dq=SELECTED+POEMS+OF+GABRIELA+MISTRAL&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Implementing Multiage Education: A Practical Guide","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Management and Encyclopedic Dictionaries, The Blackwell Encyclopedic Dictionary of Organizational Behavior","description":"The Blackwell Encyclopedic Dictionary of Organizational Behavior provides clear, concise and informative definitions and explanations of key concepts and issues.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6j9TxwEACAAJ&dq=The+Blackwell+Encyclopedia+of+Management+and+Encyclopedic+Dictionaries,+The+Blackwell+Encyclopedic+Dictionary+of+Organizational+Behavior&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Connecting to Learn: Educational and Assistive Technology for People With Disabilities","description":"For anyone who has been overwhelmed when selecting an educational or assistive technology or who has experienced frustration in trying to come up with the best instructional plan for a person with a disability, this book was written for you.

This invaluable resource demonstrates how to improve purchasing operations through supplier scheduling and the integration of purchasing with other initiatives such as Manufacturing Resource Planning (MRP II), Just-in-Time (JIT), and Total Quality Management (TQM). Along with new material on emerging technologies, vendor managed inventory, and supply chain management, seasoned consultant John E. Schorr offers a solid framework for bettering purchasing systems through a rigorous evaluation of current business structures. Comprehensive and completely up-to-date, Purchasing in the 21st Century, Second Edition provides invaluable insight and advice on: * Implementing accurate supplier scheduling * Using MRP II/JIT/TQM to dramatically increase performance of on-time deliveries, to decrease lead times, reduce lot sizes, and achieve an overall cost reduction of purchased materials * Employing synchronized deliveries in conjunction with a Kanban system * Selecting the best performance measurements for suppliers. Filled with helpful examples and case studies of such leading companies as Steelcase and Corning Glass, this is must reading for anyone involved in creating, implementing, and improving purchasing operations. In order to outperform the competition today, companies must be like finely tuned machines, composed of quality parts that work together both seamlessly and in unison. Until recently, and for most organizations, this wasn't the case when it came to two crucial components: buyers and suppliers. However, with growing attempts to improve operations across the board, this once adversarial relationship is evolving into a more cohesive partnership. In this comprehensive resource, now revised and expanded, author John E. Schorr takes an in-depth look at this important change in perspective, explores techniques currently being implemented to improve performance, and focuses on what's around the corner for Purchasing in the 21st Century. In the past, buyers and suppliers operated with different sets of numbers, different priorities, and different agendas, resulting in ongoing conflicts, poor service levels, and, perhaps, most obviously, a concerted disadvantage in the marketplace. Realizing that purchasing can be key to seeing significant improvements in operations and competitive capabilities, companies have begun to leverage the role of purchasing to achieve improvements in supplier quality, product delivery, and new product development. Purchasing in the 21st Century, Second Edition offers practical information on improving purchasing operations. With complete coverage of the tools and techniques needed, the book illustrates how to implement supplier scheduling, as well as carry out purchasing in Manufacturing Resource Planning (MRP II), Just-in-Time (JIT), and Total Quality Management (TQM) environments. It also provides essential details on supply chain management and vendor managed inventory, two new concepts being used in purchasing departments around the country. Perhaps, most significantly, Purchasing in the 21st Century, Second Edition helps you create a sound purchasing operation with a solid framework that includes a rigorous evaluation of current systems. You'll learn to coordinate with your suppliers' production schedules, ensure supplier quality assurance, reduce freight costs, and effectively use electronic data interchange and the Internet. To illustrate how others have altered and refined their purchasing approach, you'll find detailed case studies of such prominent companies as Steelcase and Corning Glass. Purchasing in the 21st Century, Second Edition gives purchasing executives and their counterparts across the company state-of-the-art guidelines for creating and effectively managing their purchasing operation. A timely examination, this is essential reading for anyone involved in the purchasing process.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HLDYgILiMo8C&dq=Purchasing+in+the+21st+Century:+A+Guide+to+State-of-the-Art+Techniques+and+Strategies,+2nd+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Damages","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Generation Games: Genetic Engineering and the Future for Our Lives","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Exploring the Gospel of Luke (John Phillips Commentary Series) (The John Phillips Commentary Series)","description":"Another new release of the highly sought-after classic commentary series from one of the most respected and articulate expositors of the twentieth century. \\"John Phillips writes with enthusiasm and clarity, ...cutting through the confusion and heretical dangers associated with Bible interpretation.\\" -Moody Magazine","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Q-SfZ7QnAHYC&dq=Exploring+the+Gospel+of+Luke+(John+Phillips+Commentary+Series)+(The+John+Phillips+Commentary+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Familiar Medicine: Everyday Health Knowledge and Practice in Today's Vietnam","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Health of Nations: Society and Law beyond the State","description":"This book explores the social and legal implications of globalisation in terms of the general theory of society and law.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fZ5aPHAVWVYC&dq=The+Health+of+Nations:+Society+and+Law+beyond+the+State&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sherlock Holmes of Baker Street,: The life of the world's first consulting detective","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OqnfjgEACAAJ&dq=Sherlock+Holmes+of+Baker+Street,:+The+life+of+the+world%27s+first+consulting+detective&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Warrior's Prize","description":"Daughter of a slave   wedded to the warrior!

In the summer, she stalks muskrats in the creek and contemplates wave mechanics; in the fall, she watches a monarch butterfly migration and dreams of Arctic caribou. She tries to con a coot; she collects pond water and examines it under a microscope. She unties a snake skin, witnesses a flood, and plays King of the Meadow with a field of grasshoppers.

According to the new radical orthodoxy, the United States was founded as a racist nation and everything that has happened throughout our history must be viewed through the lens of the systemic oppression of black people. Rejecting this false narrative, a collection of the most prominent and respected black scholars and thinkers has come together to correct the record and tell the true story of black Americans in all its complexity, diversity of experience, and poignancy. Collectively, they paint a vivid picture of black people living the grand American experience, however bumpy the road may be along the way. But rather than a people apart, blacks are woven into the united whole that makes this nation unique in history. Featuring Essays by: John Sibley Butler Jason D.

Anri Morimoto finds that Edwards's theology, once regarded as disarrayed, precarious, and dangerously unorthodox, is in fact consistent and integral to his general ontology and natural philosophy. By presenting Edwards's vision of salvation as a dynamic process of sharing God's excellence and holiness, Morimoto presents a new paradigm that is radically inclusive, yet theologically responsible. By discussing Edwards in relation to Roman Catholic traditions, Morimoto places him in the context of a broader Christian tradition rather than that of New England Puritanism. Morimoto argues that this view of salvation was not new to the Protestant tradition& in fact, this view was present in Luther, Calvin, and much of the Reformed tradition& but Edwards accented it more clearly and emphatically than anyone else. Morimoto concludes that one does not have to surrender or compromise one's theology to promote ecumenical harmony. This study will be of interest to scholars, teachers and students of theology and religion, church leaders and lay persons of all denominations, evangelical or liberal, and especially those interested in Edwards, Puritanism, and early American intellectual history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=p3drMm-3rdsC&dq=Jonathan+Edwards+and+the+Catholic+Vision+of+Salvation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mrs. Coverlet's Magicians (Weekly Reader Children's Book Club)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qTxSAQAAMAAJ&dq=Mrs.+Coverlet%27s+Magicians+(Weekly+Reader+Children%27s+Book+Club)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hollywood Album: Lives of Hollywood Stars from the Pages of the New York Times","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Second Latin book","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Investigation","description":"The manner in which criminal investigators are trained is neither uniform nor consistent, ranging from sophisticated training protocols in some departments to on-the-job experience alongside senior investigators in others.

Many Christians think that anger should not be expressed and that such feelings are sinful. This book (now in it's third printing - 2014) explores the emotion of anger and how anger - which is a part of the human experience - is a force God can use for His purposes. Co-authors Lynette Hoy and Ted Griffin present a fresh approach to managing anger, identifying the problem, power and process of anger (from annoyance to bitterness or rage); biblical examples of \\"good anger\\" and how faith, assertiveness, problem-solving and forgiveness impact anger and can be used by God for his purposes. Chronic anger can be costly - physically, emotionally and relationally. Most people can use their anger in appropriate ways in some situations, and yet can be ineffectual or harmful in other situations. Applying principles from the What's Good About Anger? book and workbooks can reduce your levels of anger, and help you learn effective coping behaviors to stop escalation and to resolve conflicts. Logging anger, triggering situations and applying new skills will help you more effectively control unhealthy anger responses. Ebook available!

In intellectual discourse, journals, popular magazines, and radio and talk shows, the debate between those who are \\"progressivists\\" and those who are \\"declinists\\" is as spirited as it was in the late seventeenth century. In History of the Idea of Progress, Robert Nisbet traces the idea of progress from its origins in Greek, Roman, and medieval civilizations to modern times. It is a masterful frame of reference for understanding the present world. Nisbet asserts there are two fundamental building blocks necessary to Western doctrines of human advancement: the idea of growth, and the idea of necessity. He sees Christianity as a key element in both secular and spiritual evolution, for it conveys all the ingredients of the modern idea of progress: the advancement of the human race in time, a single time frame for all the peoples and epochs of the past and present, the conception of time as linear, and the envisagement of the future as having a Utopian end. In his new introduction, Nisbet shows why the idea of progress remains of critical importance to studies of social evolution and natural history. He provides a contemporary basis for many disciplines, including sociology, economics, philosophy, religion, politics, and science.

By the time police inspectors Jean-Louis St-Cyr and Hermann Kohler arrive from Paris, she has been dead four days, and the flies have begun to feast. As Kohler combs the area, finding a picnic basket, two bottles of Champagne, and a collection of poisonous mushrooms, St-Cyr turns the body on its back.

In the early 1900s, northern mill owners seeking cheaper labor and fewer regulations found the South's doors wide open. Children then comprised over 22 percent of the southern textile labor force, compared to 6 percent in New England. Shelley Sallee explains how northern and southern Progressives, who formed a transregional alliance to nudge the South toward minimal child welfare standards, had to mold their strategies around the racial and societal preoccupations of a crucial ally--white middle-class southerners. Southern whites of the \\"better sort\\" often regarded white mill workers as something of a race unto themselves--degenerate and just above blacks in station. To enlist white middle-class support, says Sallee, reformers had to address concerns about social chaos fueled by northern interference, the empowerment of \\"white trash,\\" or the alliance of poor whites and blacks. The answer was to couch reform in terms of white racial uplift--and to persuade the white middle class that to demean white children through factory work was to undermine \\"whiteness\\" generally. The lingering effect of this \\"whites-only\\" strategy was to reinforce the idea of whiteness as essential to American identity and the politics of reform. Sallee's work is a compelling contribution to, and the only book-length treatment of, the study of child labor reform, racism, and political compromise in the Progressive-era South.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=99N8FrXKciEC&dq=The+Whiteness+of+Child+Labor+Reform+in+the+New+South&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Staying Fat for Sarah Byrnes - Student Packet by Novel Units, Inc.","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Enchantments of Flesh and Spirit","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Witch Hunt: A True Story of Social Hysteria and Abused Justice","description":"THE WORST CRIME OF ALL. . .

It is written by and for researchers who are primarily analysts or physicists, not algebraists or geometers. Not that we have eschewed the algebraic and geo metric developments. But we wanted to present them in a concrete way and to show how the subject interacted with physics, geometry, and mechanics. These interactions are, of course, manifold; we have discussed many of them here-in particular, Riemannian geometry, elementary particle physics, sym metries of differential equations, completely integrable Hamiltonian systems, and spontaneous symmetry breaking. Much ofthe material we have treated is standard and widely available; but we have tried to steer a course between the descriptive approach such as found in Gilmore and Wybourne, and the abstract mathematical approach of Helgason or Jacobson. Gilmore and Wybourne address themselves to the physics community whereas Helgason and Jacobson address themselves to the mathematical community. This book is an attempt to synthesize the two points of view and address both audiences simultaneously. We wanted to present the subject in a way which is at once intuitive, geometric, applications oriented, mathematically rigorous, and accessible to students and researchers without an extensive background in physics, algebra, or geometry.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RVzhBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Oresteia","description":"He who learns must suffer.

How will the gods judge Orestes, their estranged son, who must avenge his father's death by murdering his mother?

Sprague and the Politics of Change","description":"In chronicling the life of Oregon governor and newspaper editor Charles A. Sprague, Floyd McKay guides readers through the politics and journalism of twentieth-century Oregon. Newspaperman Charles Sprague, a progressive Republican, had lived in Oregon for only thirteen years when he became the surprise victor of the 1938 gubernatorial race. Although a capable governor, Sprague gained greater prominence during his forty-year tenure as editor and publisher of The Oregon Statesman in Salem. It was to Sprague's daily front-page column, It Seems To Me, that Oregon politicians looked for advice, and the column was required reading for other editors as they shaped a moderate Republican image for postwar Oregon. McKay examines the influence of Sprague's involvement in the Progressive politics of Theodore Roosevelt, his return to Republican orthodoxy, and his later emergence as a spokesman for liberal positions on race and justice, an evolution shaped by his governorship and service at the United Nations. Sprague's decisions - and later atonements - concerning ultra-patriotism in World War I and internment of Japanese Americans in World War II reveal an editor and governor torn by issues of his day.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Q9Z5AAAAMAAJ&dq=Editor+for+Oregon,+An:+Charles+A.+Sprague+and+the+Politics+of+Change&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wwiii","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Complete History of Grand Prix Motor Racing","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mmt8swEACAAJ&dq=The+Complete+History+of+Grand+Prix+Motor+Racing&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Boeing 737 - 300 to 800 (Airliner Color History)","description":"Backstage at Boeing facilities, readers are treated to an inside look at the changes made to each variant and their technical specs.

What happened to the people who made the forlorn long-abandoned statues of Easter Island? What happened to the architects of the crumbling Maya pyramids? Will we go the same way, our skyscrapers one day standing derelict and overgrown like the temples at Angkor Wat? Bringing together new evidence from a startling range of sources and piecing together the myriad influences, from climate to culture, that make societies self-destruct, Jared Diamond's Collapse also shows how - unlike our ancestors - we can benefit from our knowledge of the past and learn to be survivors.

Throughout the boycott--at Holt Street Baptist Church meetings led by a young minister named Martin Luther King, Jr.--and throughout the struggle for justice, Georgia served up her mouth-watering fried chicken, her spicy collard greens, and her sweet potato pie, eventually selling them to raise money to help the cause.

This is particularly true of academics who enter from having spent time in a profession including many in the newer disciplines. In addition, institutions of higher education which do not have a tradition of research are increasingly competing for research funding. The Nature of Research looks at this background and discusses what is wrong with academic research and discusses what is wrong with academic research today, what needs to change for it to survive, how to allow new kinds of research to flourish, directions for future action and how academic research can teach us to live in today's complex and uncertain society. The aim of the book, then, is to provide a stimulus to thinking about the nature and role of research with a view to considering what might be appropriate in the next century. Since research is so central to university life, looking at research will tell us much about what the university of the future might be like.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2M6FAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Buddhism Observed; Travellers, Exiles and Tibetan Dharma in Kathmandu (Anthropology of Asia S.)","description":"How do contemporary Westerners and Tibetans understand not only what it means to be 'Buddhist', but what it means to be hailed as one from 'the West' or from 'Tibet'?

In this unnerving collection drawn from her personal crime files, \\"America's best true-crime writer\\" (Kirkus Reviews) Ann Rule brilliantly dissects the convoluted love affairs that all too often end in violence. Expertly analyzing a shocking, headline-making case, Rule unmasks the deadly motives inside a seemingly idyllic marriage: a beautiful young wife, a rising star in America's top-ranked computer corporation, and a prosperous husband, the scion of a family building business. With an adorable son and a gorgeous home, the couple seemed to have it all. But a furtive evil permeated their days and nights, dragging them into a murky world of drugs, sordid sex, and con operations. In this realm, one of them would prove to be a virtual innocent, the other a manipulator with no conscience. Sudden, violent death brought their charade of a fairy-tale romance to a tragic end -- with a brutal crime that might never have come to light were it not for the stubborn detectives and prosecutors whose fight for justice spanned an entire decade. Empty Promises recounts several other cases where the search for love brought only lies and betrayal -- a cautionary primer, perhaps, for those who trust too much too soon. Powerful because they strike so close to home, the cases in Empty Promises will leave readers shaken by the realities of love gone terribly -- and fatally -- wrong.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zyz7TTif_4UC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Selected short stories of Thomas Hardy;","description":"When Farmer Oak smiled, the corners of his mouth spread till they were within an unimportant distance of his ears, his eyes were reduced to chinks, and diverging wrinkles appeared round them, extending upon his countenance like the rays in a rudimentary sketch of the rising sun.

The focal point of this action was Jesus--his ministry, death and resurrection. But there were challenges, setbacks and conflicts, as well as bursts of understanding, expansion and growth. While the main lines of this story display a remarkable unity, a closer examination also reveals a living diversity of cultures, perspectives and practices. InThe Emergence of the Church Arthur G. Patzia explores the story, weighs the issues and traces the contours of the early church's expansion and growth, life and practices, leadership and worship.

Laing shows how the straitjacket of conformity imposed on us all leads to intense feelings of alienation and a tragic waste of human potential.

We are bemused and crazed creatures,  Laing suggests.

But just as Dorothy, Toto, and their traveling companions discover a darker reality upon entering the green gates of the imaginary Emerald City. those who look more closely at Seattle's landscape will find that it reveals a history marked by environmental degradation and urban inequality. This book explores the role of nature in the development of the city of Seattle from the earliest days of its settlement to the present. Combining environmental history, urban history, and human geography, Matthew Klingle shows how attempts to reshape nature in and around Seattle have often ended not only in ecological disaster but also in social inequality. The price of Seattle's centuries of growth and progress has been high. Its wildlife, especially the famous Pacific salmon, and its poorest residents have paid the highest price. Klingle proposes a bold new way of understanding the interdependence between nature and culture, and he argues for what he calls an 'ethic of place.' Using Seattle as a compelling case study, he offers important insights for every city seeking to live in harmony with its natural landscape\\"--Provided by publisher.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xDX4750sv2gC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Paul, Apostle of God's Glory in Christ (Pauline Theology)","description":"Thomas R.

Kaminsky, the veteran author of more than forty novels and the creator of such wonderful characters as Abe Lieberman, Toby Peters, and Inpsector Rostnikov, has created a new PI: Lew Fonesca, a world-weary guy who got in a car and just started driving after his wife died and wound up in front of a Dairy Queen in Sarasota, Florida. He now makes his way amid bail jumpers and lost wives, people who want to be found and those who will do anything to stay under their rock. He spends his days solving cases both big and small and trying to get by, while attempting to figure out how to make the rest of his life make sense. Retribution not only picks up where the first novel in the series, Vengeance, left off, but raises the bar big-time. Lew has solved his share of cases, and most of them-to his pride-have wound up having happy endings; in Vengeance, he saved a young runaway who has had a childhood nobody should ever have, and she finally seems to be turning her life around. But when she becomes involved with a reclusive best selling author and several valuable manuscripts disappear, Lew knows that young Melanie is in way over her head. And if he doesn't act fast, not only could a few reputations get tarnished--the bodies might start piling up.

With Christ as norm, the author examines Marxism, logical positivism, existentialism and other secular interpretations of history, and distinguishes between their valid and false concepts. Then, after searching exposition of the Christian theology of history in which God's presence is continuous, he concludes with a section explaining how the Christian, in a sense, not only \\"experiences\\" history, but \\"makes\\" it.

Coetzee's latest novel, The Schooldays of Jesus, is now available from Viking. Late Essays: 2006-2016 will be available January 2018. In the fall of 1869 Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoevsky, lately a resident of Germany, is summoned back to St. Petersburg by the sudden death of his stepson, Pavel. Half crazed with grief, stricken by epileptic seizures, and erotically obsessed with his stepson's landlady, Dostoevsky is nevertheless intent on unraveling the enigma of Pavel's life. Was the boy a suicide or a murder victim? Did he love his stepfather or despise him? Was he a disciple of the revolutionary Nechaev, who even now is somewhere in St. Petersburg pursuing a dream of apocalyptic violence? As he follows his stepson's ghost and becomes enmeshed in the same demonic conspiracies that claimed the boy Dostoevsky emerges as a figure of unfathomable contradictions: naive and calculating, compassionate and cruel, pious and unspeakably perverse.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EVBpDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The story of \\"Mormonism\\"","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Of Dikes and Windmills","description":"Relates the struggle of the people of Holland since 500 B.C. to reclaim land from the sea using windmills and dikes.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Rj1CuQAACAAJ&dq=Of+Dikes+and+Windmills&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"This Train Is Bound for Glory: the Story of America's Chapel Cars","description":"This remarkable story of the chapel cars that traveled the American West from 1890 to 1940 reveals previously untapped sources to complete the history of all thirteen cars.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0SdSAQAAIAAJ&dq=This+Train+Is+Bound+for+Glory:+the+Story+of+America%27s+Chapel+Cars&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sex, Death and God in L.A.","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Best of the Magazine Markets for Writers 2006","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Langenscheidt Standard Dictionary Spanish: Spanish-English, English-Spanish (Standard (Langenscheidt)) (Spanish and Spanish Edition)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Convent of Hell","description":"A convent in Spain.

In 2007, chef Grant Achatz seemingly had it made. He had been named one of the best new chefs in America by Food & Wine in 2002, received the James Beard Foundation Rising Star Chef of the Year Award in 2003, and in 2005 he and Nick Kokonas opened the conceptually radical restaurant Alinea, which was named Best Restaurant in America by Gourmet magazine. Then, positioned firmly in the world's culinary spotlight, Achatz was diagnosed with stage IV squamous cell carcinoma-tongue cancer. The prognosis was grim, and doctors agreed the only course of action was to remove the cancerous tissue, which included his entire tongue. Desperate to preserve his quality of life, Grant undertook an alternative treatment of aggressive chemotherapy and radiation. But the choice came at a cost. Skin peeled from the inside of Grant's mouth and throat, he rapidly lost weight, and most alarmingly, he lost his sense of taste. Tapping into the discipline, passion, and focus of being a chef, Grant rarely missed a day of work. He trained his chefs to mimic his palate and learned how to cook with his other senses. As Kokonas was able to attest: The food was never better. Five months later, Grant was declared cancer-free, and just a few months following, he received the James Beard Foundation Outstanding Chef in America Award. Life, on the Line tells the story of a culinary trailblazer's love affair with cooking, but it is also a book about survival, about nurturing creativity, and about profound friendship. Already much- anticipated by followers of progressive cuisine, Grant and Nick's gripping narrative is filled with stories from the world's most renowned kitchens-The French Laundry, Charlie Trotter's, el Bulli- and sure to expand the audience that made Alinea the number-one selling restaurant cookbook in America last year.

And the issue will not go away. More recently, the terms of the debate have shifted, and the issue has taken on new urgency with the theological proposal known as the openness of God. This view maintains that God's knowledge, while perfect, is limited regarding the future inasmuch as the future is \\"open\\" and not settled. Divine Foreknowledge: Four Views provides a venue for well-known proponents of four distinct views of divine foreknowledge to present their cases: Gregory A. Boyd of Bethel College presents the open-theism view, David Hunt of Whittier College weighs in on the simple-foreknowledge view, William Lane Craig of Talbot School of Theology takes the middle-knowledge view, and Paul Helm of Regent College, Vancouver, presents the Augustinian-Calvinist view. All four respond to each of the other essayists, noting points of agreement and disagreement. Editors James K. Beilby and Paul R. Eddy introduce the contemporary debate and also offer a conclusion that helps you evaluate the relative strengths and weaknesses of each view. The result is a unique opportunity to grapple with the issues and arguments and frame your own understanding of this important debate.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uEwjCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Elves and Fairies Stickers (Dover Stickers)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The case of the crying swallow: A Perry Mason novelette and other stories (A Nightingale mystery in large print)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oZpstQAACAAJ&dq=The+case+of+the+crying+swallow:+A+Perry+Mason+novelette+and+other+stories+(A+Nightingale+mystery+in+large+print)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Return to a Place Lit by a Glass of Milk: Poems","description":"Poems search for the spiritual essence of everyday emotional and physical experiences","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VEBbAAAAMAAJ&dq=Return+to+a+Place+Lit+by+a+Glass+of+Milk:+Poems&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bird Walk Through the Bible","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Secret Stones","description":"\\"A tour thousand year old mystery lurks in the hills of Georgia.

This textbook offers an introduction to the use of probability models for analyzing risks and economic decisions. It takes a learn-by-doing approach, teaching the student to use spreadsheets to represent and simulate uncertainty and to analyze the effect of such uncertainty on an economic decision. Students in applied business and economics can more easily grasp difficult analytical methods with Excel spreadsheets. The book covers the basic ideas of probability, how to simulate random variables, and how to compute conditional probabilities via Monte Carlo simulation. The first four chapters use a large collection of probability distributions to simulate a range of problems involving worker efficiency, market entry, oil exploration, repeated investment, and subjective belief elicitation. The book then covers correlation and multivariate normal random variables; conditional expectation; optimization of decision variables, with discussions of the strategic value of information, decision trees, game theory, and adverse selection; risk sharing and finance; dynamic models of growth; dynamic models of arrivals; and model risk. New material in this second edition includes two new chapters on additional dynamic models and model risk; new sections in every chapter; many new end-of-chapter exercises; and coverage of such topics as simulation model workflow, models of probabilistic electoral forecasting, and real options. The book comes equipped with Simtools, an open-source, free software used througout the book, which allows students to conduct Monte Carlo simulations seamlessly in Excel.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aVTADwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Salt Mines","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Vp1TgGD2LhoC&dq=Salt+Mines&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A practical treatise of powers","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TI4GxQEACAAJ&dq=A+practical+treatise+of+powers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"International Cooperation in Space: The Example of the European Space Agency (Frontiers of Space)","description":"With the end of the Cold War, the main question regarding the space race is whether it will become a co-operative venture.

Robert A. Heinlein wrote of it: \\"This is the best anti-Utopia, the strongest satire on trends in our present culture, I have seen since '1984' appeared. I enjoyed its humor, its half-buried allusions. The puns, the almost-not-quite-quotations, the thinly-veiled references to our 'real' world -- all of these delighted me. It belongs up at the top, along with 'Brave New World' and '1984'.\\" Dr. Freda Caron, blond and beautiful, had waited in vain for her fiance to disembark from Project Abie's recently returned starship. But Paul had unaccountably requested an extended tour of duty on \\"The Planet of Flowers\\" and, in his stead, he had sent an assistant, Hal Polino, with a verbal message and an exquisitely iridescent yellow tulip that not only had a plastic memory--but could talk! Freda soon realized she must unlock the secrets of the flower planet, and its strange hold on Paul, through Hal. Hal's lack of methodology and unscientific irreverence constantly confuse Freda, and they battle one another, the ultra-rational world-of-tomorrow they inhabit, and, ultimately, the strange, sentient, unearthly flower planet Freda journeys to explore. The climax of this shocking and oddly beautiful novel is bizarre and delightful. Another admirer of John Boyd's debut novel was Arthur C. Clarke, who wrote: \\"A fascinating novel that kept me amused and interested to the end. The future society it describes is one of the most convincing I've ever encountered.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AXUCusBElDUC&dq=The+pollinators+of+Eden&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"My Own Private Sky","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Software by Numbers: Low-Risk, High-Return Development","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Scottish Emigration to North America, 1607-1785","description":"Before 1650, only a few hundred Scots had trickled into the American colonies, but by the early 1770s the number had risen to 10,000 per year.

This philosophy argues for a socially and artistically grounded concept of music and music education, challenging the field's traditional \\"absolutist\\" foundations. Praxial Music Education is both a critical companion to Music Matters, and an independent text on contemporary issues in music education. Among the themes discussed are multicultural music education, the nature of musical understanding, early childhood music education, the nature and teaching of music listening, music curriculum development, and musical creativity. Praxial music education is a living theory. This unique collection will not only enrich discussions that already use Music Matters as their core, but will globalize current discussions and applications of the praxial philosophy and emphasize the positive and practical values of collaborative efforts in music education.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=T7Og8KV3LpAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"FLATLAND A ROMANCE OF MANY DIMENSIONS","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Every Marriage Is a Fixer-Upper: A Do-It-Yourselfer's Guide to Bringing Out the Best in Your Relationship","description":"In this funny and sharp romantic comedy, a woman with a knack for turning her boyfriends  lives around starts a professional service to help wrangle men, only to be unexpectedly matched with an old flame.

Veteran journalist Pete Hamill never covered just politics. Or just sports. Or just the entertainment business, the mob, foreign affairs, social issues, the art world, or New York City. He has in fact written about all these subjects, and many more, in his years as a contributor to such national magazines as Esquire, Vanity Fair, and New York, and as a columnist at the New York Post, the New York Daily News, the Village Voice, and other newspapers. Seasoned by more than thirty years as a New York newspaperman, Hamill wrote on an extraordinarily wide variety of topics in powerful language that is personal, tough-minded, clearheaded, always provocative. Piecework is a rich and varied collection of Hamill's best writing, on such diverse subjects as what television and crack have in common, why winning isn't everything, stickball, Nicaragua, Donald Trump, why American immigration policy toward Mexico is all wrong, Brooklyn's Seventh Avenue, and Frank Sinatra, not to mention Octavio Paz, what it's like to realize you're middle-aged, Northern Ireland, New York City then and now, how Mike Tyson spent his time in prison, and much more. This collection proves him once again to be among the last of a dying breed: the old-school generalist, who writes about anything and everything, guided only by passionate and boundless curiosity. Piecework is Hamill at his very best.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GL8dFT7C1cwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Macaulay's essays on Addison and Milton (Standard English classics)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=b3kAAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Matchbook five-minute thrillers","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XIMmAQAACAAJ&dq=Matchbook+five-minute+thrillers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Atlas of Hair and Nails","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Spring: American Soul","description":"In From Vision to Folly in the American Soul Thomas Singer collates his investigations into soul both in its personal and collective manifestations.

Driver brought theater into discussion with religion and modern theology. It has been a rich ongoing dialogue, but one that now demands a bold new engagement. In Theater and Integrity, Larry D. Bouchard argues that while the  antitheatrical prejudice  regards theater as epitomizing the absence of integrity, theater s ways of being realized in ensembles, texts, and performances allow us to reenvision integrity s emergence and ephemeral presence. This book follows such questions across theatrical, philosophical, and theological studies of moral, personal, bodily, and kenotic patterns of integrity. It locates ambiguities in our discourse about integrity, and it delves into conceptions of identity, morality, selfhood, and otherness. Its explorations ask if integrity is less a quality we might possess than a contingent gift that may appear, disappear, and perhaps reappear. Not only does he chart anew the ethical and religious dimensions of integrity, but he also reads closely across the history of theater, from Greek and Shakespearean drama to the likes of Seamus Heaney, T. S. Eliot, Caryl Churchill, Wole Soyinka, Tony Kushner, and Suzan-Lori Parks. His is an approach of juxtaposition and reflection, starting from the perennial observation that theater both criticizes and acknowledges dimensions of drama and theatricality in life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Mbvi3uQX7WYC&dq=The+Venus+Hottentot+(Callaloo+Poetry+Series,+Number+9)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dark Wager","description":"When Lucien Bryland wagers that he will repay Lady Clara Harkham's coquetry by marrying her and exiling her to the country while he returns to London, he does not count on her defiance and on her irresistibility.

For Muslims concerned for this freedom, one of the major difficulties is the 'punishment for apostasy' - death for those who desert Islam. This book argues that the law of apostasy and its punishment by death in Islamic law are untenable in the modern period. The law of apostasy conflicts with a variety of foundation texts of Islam and with the current ethos of human rights, in particular the freedom to choose one's religion. In examining the significant challenges the punishment of apostasy faces in the modern period inside and outside Muslim communities - exploring in particular how the issue is dealt with in a multi-religious Muslim majority country, Malaysia - the authors discuss arguments by prominent Muslims today for an absolute freedom of religion and for discarding the death penalty for apostasy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sjQKAQAAMAAJ&dq=Freedom+of+Religion,+Apostasy+and+Islam+(Liturgy,+Worship+and+Society+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Christianity and Plurality: Classic and Contemporary Readings","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Rand McNally 2002 Road Atlas: United States, Canada, Mexico (Rand Mcnally Road Atlas: United States, Canada, Mexico (Paper))","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Thirteenth Hour","description":"Fans of Road Dahl and Neil Gaiman will love this inventive middle grade fantasy about a girl who uses a family heirloom to travel to fantastical worlds that may be more dangerous than they appear.

In simple terms, the Golden Age was the birth of the superhero proper out of the pulp novel characters of the early 1930s, and was primarily associated with the DC Comics Group. Superman, Batman, Green Lantern, and Wonder Woman are the most famous creations of this period. In the early 1960s, Marvel Comics launched a completely new line of heroes, the primary figures of the Silver Age: the Fantastic Four, Spider-Man, the Incredible Hulk, the X-Men, the Avengers, Iron Man, and Daredevil. In this book, Geoff Klock presents a study of the Third Movement of superhero comic books. He avoids, at all costs, the temptation to refer to this movement as \\"Postmodern,\\" \\"Deconstructionist,\\" or something equally tedious. Analyzing the works of Frank Miller, Alan Moore, Warren Ellis, and Grant Morrison among others, and taking his cue from Harold Bloom, Klock unearths the birth of self-consciousness in the superhero narrative and guides us through an intricate world of traditions, influences, nostalgia and innovations - a world where comic books do indeed become literature.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PNSEVjZ7dyMC&dq=Wildcats:+Serial+Boxes+-+Volume+3&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I Hate Georgia (I Hate series)","description":"Bet you never knew there were so many reasons to hate GEORGIA!

His concept of  themata,  induced from case studies with special attention to the work of Einstein, has become one of the chief tools for understanding scientific progress. It is now one of the main approaches in the study of the initiation and acceptance of individual scientific insights. Three principal consequences of this perspective extend beyond the study of the history of science itself. It provides philosophers of science with the kind of raw material on which some of the best work in their field is based. It helps intellectual historians to redefine the place of modern science in contemporary culture by identifying influences on the scientific imagination. And it prompts educators to reexamine the conventional concepts of education in science. In this new edition, Holton has masterfully reshaped the contents and widened the coverage. Significant new material has been added, including a penetrating account of the advent of quantum physics in the United States, and a broad consideration of the integrity of science, as exemplified in the work of Niels Bohr. In addition, a revised introduction and a new postscript provide an updated perspective on the role of themata. The result of this thoroughgoing revision is an indispensable volume for scholars and students of scientific thought and intellectual history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vAv5YmGWosoC&dq=Thematic+Origins+of+Scientific+Thought:+Kepler+to+Einstein&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Prime Time: The Lobels' Guide to Great Grilled Meats (Complete Idiots Guide)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Blood Stain","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Catching Fire: The Story of Firefighting","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Now Let's Talk About Music","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Lettres de Mon Moulin","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Cache River","description":"This is a product of the Critical Trends Assessment Program (CTAP) and the Ecosystems Program of the Illinois Dept. of Natural Resources (DNR).

Within fourteen months he published Common Sense, the most influential pamphlet of the American Revolution, and began a career that would see him hailed and reviled in the American nation he helped create. Collected in this volume are Paine's most influential texts. In Common Sense, he sets forth an inspiring vision of an independent America as an asylum for freedom and an example of popular self-government in a world oppressed by despotism and hereditary privilege. The American Crisis, begun during  the times that try men s souls  in 1776, is a masterpiece of popular pamphleteering in which Paine vividly reports current developments, taunts and ridicules British adversaries, and enjoins his readers to remember the immense stakes of their struggle. They are joined in this invaluable reader by a selection of Paine s other American pamphlets and his letters to George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and others.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VadNEAAAQBAJ&dq=Common+sense+and+The+crisis&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Night Spider","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Life Principles from the Women of the Bible-Book One (Following God Character Builders)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The family at Tammerton (An Inspector Finch gothic)","description":"Murder by the sea ...

Published in the latter part of her career, these stories reveal Highsmith's mastery of the short story form. Moving between locales as various as France, Mexico, Zurich, and New York, Highsmith transforms the mundane features of everyday life into an eerie backdrop for her penetrating stories of violence, secrecy, and madness. In 'The Stuff of Madness', Christopher Waggoner, increasingly dismayed by his wife's habit of preserving dead pets in their garden, enacts a devious revenge by adding a bizarre new exhibit to their collection; in the title story, a eminent economist's brush with death endows his once-familiar desires with tragic consequences; and in 'A Shot from Nowhere', a young painter who witnesses a gruesome death on a vacant Mexican Street becomes trapped in an unimaginable nightmare.

It investigates how their writing argues for or against the different positions outlined during the purge and how it reflects or distorts the competing theories about literature to emerge from the trials. These writers were themselves involved in the trials to varying degrees: C line was accused of treason, though eventually condemned on a lesser charge; Eluard, one of the leading Resistance poets and a Communist, published in the clandestine Resistance press and devoted a number of his poems to condemning collaborators; Sartre s theory of committed literature reiterates the theme of the writer s responsibility as presented during the trials; as for Blanchot, if his work never directly comments upon the purge, its arguments for the autonomy of literature are both a response to Sartre and a commentary on what Blanchot called the  trial of art.  In their reactions to the purge, these writers mobilized a number of discourses, ranging from the historical, economic, and literary to the sexual, medical, and corporeal. To understand their views on the trials, it is useful to read their texts as allegories of the purge. At one point or another they all speak about the purge through a series of metaphoric substitutions maintained through an extended narrative whether this narrative is a critical essay, a novel, or a collection of poems. The texts also give the reader a code for reading them allegorically, and this code is the purge archive, whose records, debates, and arguments reshaped the way writers understood their craft.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=J2DJrfMup6oC&dq=Allegories+of+the+Purge:+How+Literature+Responded+to+the+Postwar+Trials+of+Writers+and+Intellectuals+in+France&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"This Is How I Speak: The Diary of a Young Woman","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XwF8udUYAP0C&dq=This+Is+How+I+Speak:+The+Diary+of+a+Young+Woman&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Ship That Never Was","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Hawaii's Best Local Desserts","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=l60NAAAACAAJ&dq=Hawaii%27s+Best+Local+Desserts&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"adam or Ape","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Mahalia","description":"Here is \\"the real book\\" of the incredible Mahalia Jackson, as pledged to her by her close friend, Laurraine Goreau, before her death.

Informed by his extraordinary access, he writes candidly about the workings of the Mossad, the prime ministers he served under, and the other major players on the international stage: Yasir Arafat, Saddam Hussein, Hafiz al-Assad, Mu'amar Gadhafi, Bill Clinton, George H. W. Bush, and George W. Bush. From the vantage point of a chief in charge of a large organization, he frankly describes the difficulty of running an intelligence agency in a time when heads of state are immersed, as never before, in using intelligence to protect their nations while, at the same time, acting to protect themselves politically. Most important, he writes fiercely and without hesitation about how the world might achieve peace in the face of the growing threat from Islamic terrorist organizations. In this gripping inside look, Halevy opens his private dossier on events past and present: the assassination attempt by the Mossad on the life of Khaled Mashal, now the leader of Khammas; the negotiations surrounding the Israeli-Jordan Peace Accord and its importance for the stability of the region; figures in the CIA, like Jim Angleton and George Tenet, with whom he worked (Halevy even shares his feelings about Tenet's abrupt resignation). He tells the truth about what the Mossad really knew before 9/11. He writes candidly about assessing the threat of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in the region and beyond, and what this spells for the future of international stability and survival. He touches on the increasing visibility of the CIA in the Middle East and openly shares his misgivings about both the report of the 9/11 Commission and the Middle East road map to peace that was pressed on all sides of the conflict by the U.S. government. He looks at the terrorist attacks in Madrid and London and their far-reaching effects, and states the unthinkable: We have yet to see the worst of what the radical Islamic terrorists are capable of. Sure to be one of the year's most talked-about books, this fierce and intelligent account of will be a must-read for those looking to hear from a man who wielded his influence, in the shadows, to save the Middle East and the world from a never-ending cycle of violence and destruction.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DHnwcb9pr3UC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Official Rules of Chess","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"XML and Java: Developing Web Applications","description":"CD-ROM contains: Ready-to-run sample programs along with trial versions of WebSphere and DB2.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Qu17E2bsfLUC&dq=XML+and+Java:+Developing+Web+Applications&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fatal Diagnosis","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Enchanted vagabonds,","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Jp1EzG_aWPkC&dq=Enchanted+vagabonds,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Shakespeare for the Modern Reader: a user-friendly introduction","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Aromatherapy and the use of scents in psychotherapy.

In the course of sixty years Thomas J. Watson Sr. and his son, Thomas J. Watson Jr., together built the international colossus that is IBM. This is their story: a riveting and revealing account of two men who loved each other--and fought each other--with a terrible fierceness. But along with the story of a father and son, this is IBM's story too. It chronicles the management insights that shaped its course and its unique corporate culture, the style that made Thomas Watson Sr. one of America's most charismatic bosses, and the daring decisions by Thomas Watson Jr. that transformed IBM into the world's largest computing company. One of the greatest business-success stories of all time, Father, Son & Co. is a moving lesson for fathers who dream for their children, as well as a testament to American ingenuity and values, told in a disarmingly frank and eloquent voice. Promising to remain an important business reference as we move into the next century, FATHER, SON & CO. takes a look at the management insight that helped to shape IBM's course and unique corporate culture. It looks at Watson, Sr., one of America's most charismatic bosses, and Watson, Jr., who spurred IBM into the computer age. Ten years after its original publication, FATHER, SON & CO. remains a uniquely honest book. Watson's willingness to write about the loving but ferociously combative relationship he had with his father and the turbulent battles behind some of IBM's most far-reaching decisions gives readers rare insights into the realities of leadership. -->","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=AVYTAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ultimate Spider-Man: v. 7","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"TURNING POINT: ORIBE AND THE ARTS OF SIXTEENTH-CENTURY JAPAN","description":"Japan's brief but dramatic Momoyama period (1573-1615) witnessed the struggles of a handful of ambitious warlords for control of the long-splintered country and finally the emergence of a united Japan. This was also an era of dynamic cultural development in which the feudal lords sponsored lavish, innovative arts to proclaim their newly acquired power. One such art was a ceramic ware known as Oribe, whose mysterious sudden appearance and rise in popularity are explored in this book. Ceramics are closely connected to the tea ceremony and central to Japanese culture. In this context Oribe wares represented a unique and major development, since they were the easiest Japanese ceramics to carry extensive multicolor decoration. Boldly painted with geometric and naturalistic designs, they display sensuous glazes, especially in a distinctive vitreous green, as well as a whole repertoire of playful new shapes. Their genesis has tradtionally been ascribed to Furuta Oribe (1543/44-1615), a warrior and the foremost tea master of his time, who appears to have played a crucial role in redefining the aesthetics of Japan. Over seventy engaging vessels of Oribe ware, along with striking examples of other types of wares produced in the same milieu, make up the heart of this catalogue. -- Metropolitan Museum of Art website.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=q50bU2oPj98C&dq=TURNING+POINT:+ORIBE+AND+THE+ARTS+OF+SIXTEENTH-CENTURY+JAPAN&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Ninth Configuration","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Speech of the Birds (Islamic Texts Society)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Second World War Vol. 3 - Under Siege (The 2nd World War)","description":"Architectures of survival is an original and innovative work of history that investigates the relationship between air war and urbanism in modern Britain.

Airpower created a permanent threat to cities and civilians, and this book considers how architects, planners and government officials reframed bombing as an ongoing urban problem, rather than one contingent to a particular conflict. It draws on archival material from local and national government, architectural and town planning journals and cultural texts, to demonstrate how cities were recast as targets, and planning for defence and planning for development became increasingly entangled.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YXK5DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Real Love: The Drawings for Sean","description":"REAL LOVE","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mJ0ouQAACAAJ&dq=Real+Love:+The+Drawings+for+Sean&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Trip To The Beach - Living On Island Time In The Caribbean","description":"The authors describe how they abandoned the headaches of running a successful Vermont-based gourmet food business to open up a restaurant on the Caribbean island of Anguilla and the challenges, joys, setbacks, and unexpected surprises they faced.

Readers are treated to fascinating explorations of communication at the boundaries between discourses and selves. The essays address important theoretical issues, and do so often by treating significant social issues. Most welcome is the constructive tone that is for the most part maintained throughout the volume, demonstrating an effort to understand, engage, and critically assess different discourses and selves (and others) at once, without valorizing one over the other. An essential theme running through this volume is the idea that our efforts to engage, as well as other's efforts to engage us, have been seriously impaired because of problems which are fundamentally communicative in nature. More specifically, there is general agreement among the contributors that the voice of other has not been sufficiently heard, and this on account of how discourses of the human sciences, as well as other dominant discourses (e.g. law) have structured our interaction with other. Each of the essays helps to clarify the nature of the communicative failing and to develop an appropriate corrective action.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=twIyJZrqI6QC&dq=Transgressing+Discourses:+Communication+and+the+Voice+of+Other+(S+U+N+Y+Series+in+Human+Communication+Processes)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Molto's Dream","description":"Molto, a cat who longs to see the world from above, goes up in a hot air balloon but finds the experience empty without friends to share it with.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DSZWKAAACAAJ&dq=Molto%27s+Dream&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Heart of the Rose","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rO5EAQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Daughter Father Canoe Coming of age in the sub-arctic and other stories of Snowdrift River and Nonacho Lake","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=k7R4AAAACAAJ&dq=Daughter+Father+Canoe+Coming+of+age+in+the+sub-arctic+and+other+stories+of+Snowdrift+River+and+Nonacho+Lake&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Plowshares and Pruning Hooks: Rethinking the Language of Biblical Prophecy and Apocalyptic","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Randy Bachman: Takin' Care of Business","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Congo Activity Book: Jungle Journeys","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Walt Disney and the Quest for Community (Design & the Built Environment)","description":"During the final months of his life, Walt Disney was consumed with the world-wide problems of cities. His development concept at the time of his death on December 15th, 1966 would be his team s conceptual response to the ills of the inner cities and the sprawl of the megalopolis: the Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow or, as it became known, EPCOT. This beautifully written, instantly engrossing volume focuses on the original concept of EPCOT, which was conceived by Disney as an experimental community of about 20,000 people on the Disney World property in central Florida. With its radial plan, 50-acre town center enclosed by a dome, themed international shopping area, greenbelt, high-density apartments, satellite communities, monorail and underground roads, the original EPCOT plan is reminiscent of post-war Stockholm and the British New Towns, as well as today's transit-oriented development theory. Unfortunately, Disney himself did not live long enough to witness the realization of his model city. However, EPCOT's evolution into projects such as the EPCOT Center and the town of Celebration displays a remarkable commitment by the Disney organization to the original EPCOT philosophy, one which continues to have relevance in the fields of planning and development.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QfufCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Remembering: A study in experimental and social psychology (The Cambridge psychological library)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"String Too Short To Be Saved","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"When marriage was in fashion: The story of the Asfahl dress","description":"Story of the C.R.

In addition to covering the build-up to the invasion, including the elaborate and lavish campaigns to deceive Germans as to where and when the invasion would take place, Caddick-Adams gives a full and detailed account of the German preparations: the formidable Atlantikwall and Field Marshal Erwin Rommel's plans to make Europe impregnable-plans not completed by June 6. Sand and Steel reveals precisely what lay in wait for the Allies. But the heart of the book is Caddick-Adams' narratives of the five beaches where the terrible drama played out--Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno, and Sword, and the attempt by American, British, and Canadian soldiers to gain a foothold in Europe. The Allied invasion of Europe involved mind-boggling logistics, including orchestrating the largest flotilla of ships ever assembled. Its strategic and psychological demands stretched the Allies to their limits, testing the strengths of the bonds of Anglo-American leadership. Drawing on first-hand battlefield research, personal testimony and interviews, and a commanding grasp of all the archives and literature, Caddick-Adams's gripping book, published on the 75th anniversary of the events, does Operations Overlord and Neptune full justice.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zhqTDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Marriage: From Surviving To Thriving: Practical Advice on Making Your Marriage Strong","description":"Drawing from his own personal experience with his wife of 50 years, as well as showing what the Bible says about marriage, Swindoll shares very practical and inspiring ways to building a marriage that survives the tests of time.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1CnrugAACAAJ&dq=Marriage:+From+Surviving+To+Thriving:+Practical+Advice+on+Making+Your+Marriage+Strong&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Worn Path","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Renewable City: A comprehensive guide to an urban revolution","description":"Describes urban sustainability trends and the move to renewable energy sources in city planning.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AXJPAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Renewable+City:+A+comprehensive+guide+to+an+urban+revolution&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Devil's Wager","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"An Uncommon Friendship: From Opposite Sides of the Holocaust","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"1560 Geneva Bible","description":"Beautifully bound and designed to last a lifetime, a reproduction of a sixteenth-century Bible, originally produced by fellow English Puritans in the Protestant city of Geneva, will be cherished by Bible collectors and anyone interested in the history of the English Bible.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2DwA0f6cXgoC&dq=1560+Geneva+Bible&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The future is now;: George Allen, pro football's most controversial coach","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9ahHAgAACAAJ&dq=The+future+is+now%3B:+George+Allen,+pro+football%27s+most+controversial+coach&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The New Sound of Indo-European (Trends in Linguistics.

As a young man he traveled extensively and wrote several books that drew on his travels, including Russia in Central Asia (1889), Persia and the Persian Question (1892), and Problems of the Far East (1894). Persia and the Persian Question, presented here, is two-volume work, based on a six-month stay in Iran that Curzon began in late 1899 as a correspondent for the London newspaper, the Times. The author's intent, as he states in the preface, is to produce \\"the standard work in the English language\\" on the subject. After two introductory chapters, chapters 3-12 document Curzon's visits to and observations concerning different parts of the country, including the journey from Ashkabad (present-day Ashgabat, Turkmenistan) into Iran and stays in Kuchan, Meshed, Khorasan, Seistan, Tehran, and elsewhere. Volume one concludes with individual chapters devoted to the shah and the royal family; the government; institutions and reforms; the northwest and northwestern provinces; the army; and railroads. Volume two begins with another seven chapters (19-25) recounting journeys to different parts of the country, including Isfahan, Shiraz, Bushir (present-day Bushehr), and the eastern, southeastern, and southwestern provinces. The remaining chapters (26-30) deal with the navy; the Persian Gulf; revenue, resources and manufactures; commerce and trade; and British and Russian policy in Persia. For Curzon, the essence of \\"the Persian question\\" is the rivalry between the Russian and British empires for influence in Persia, which he discusses in detail in the final chapter. This chapter also deals with Persia's \\"two Asiatic neighbours,\\" Afghanistan and the Ottoman Empire, both of which \\"held large tracts of territory that were once included within the Persian dominions.\\" Curzon ends on a hopeful note regarding the future development of the country, but he cautions patience and warns that \\"colossal schemes for the swift regeneration of Persia ... will only end in fiasco.\\" He also warns against a dominant role for foreign concessions: \\"Persian capital must be interested in the exploitation of Persian resources, for a monopoly of the finance by foreigners excites jealousy, and suggests the idea of usurpation.\\" The book includes illustrations and maps.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gM0oAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Realities Behind Diplomacy: Background Influences on British External Policy 1865-1980","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=w7wxSQAACAAJ&dq=The+Realities+Behind+Diplomacy:+Background+Influences+on+British+External+Policy+1865-1980&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Champagne-Ardennes & Burgundy (Passport's Regional Guides of France Series)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Under God's Wings: Miraculous True Stories of Christian Faith and Hope","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Encyclopedia of computer science and engineering","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Practical TV and Video Systems Repair","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Tottel's miscellany (1557-1587)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=56N257Qt71MC&dq=Tottel%27s+miscellany+(1557-1587)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Read On Rita","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Alice Crimmins case","description":"The true story of Alice Crimmins, an American woman who was charged with killing her two children who were discovered missing on July 14, 1965.

Readers are treated to fascinating explorations of communication at the boundaries between discourses and selves. The essays address important theoretical issues, and do so often by treating significant social issues. Most welcome is the constructive tone that is for the most part maintained throughout the volume, demonstrating an effort to understand, engage, and critically assess different discourses and selves (and others) at once, without valorizing one over the other. An essential theme running through this volume is the idea that our efforts to engage, as well as other's efforts to engage us, have been seriously impaired because of problems which are fundamentally communicative in nature. More specifically, there is general agreement among the contributors that the voice of other has not been sufficiently heard, and this on account of how discourses of the human sciences, as well as other dominant discourses (e.g. law) have structured our interaction with other. Each of the essays helps to clarify the nature of the communicative failing and to develop an appropriate corrective action.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=twIyJZrqI6QC&dq=Transgressing+Discourses:+Communication+and+the+Voice+of+Other+(Suny+Series+in+Human+Communication+Processes)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Baptist history: From the foundation of the Christian church to the close of the eighteenth century,","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-3wuAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Walking Towards Walden: A Pilgrimage in Search of Place","description":"Walking Towards Walden is an exploration of the sense of place, what it means, how it developed, and why it matters.

Before this he had worked in other concentration camps, and afterwards he was at the Inspectorate in Berlin. He thus knew more, both at first-hand and as an administrator, about Nazi Germany's greatest crime than did any save two or three other men. Taken prisoner by the British, he was handed over to the Poles, tried, sentenced to death, and taken back to Auschwitz and there hanged. During the period between his trial and his execution, he was ordered to write his autobiography. This is it. Hoess repeatedly says he was glad to write the book. He enjoyed the work. And finally the most careful checking has shown that he took great pains to tell the truth. Here we have, painted by his own hand, a vivid and unforgettable self-portrait of one of the great monsters of all time. To this are added portraits of some of his more spectacular fellow-criminals.

In the New Testament it is quoted twenty-seven times literally and thirty-eight times substantially.

The \\"Five Books of Moses,\\" of which Genesis is the first, have always been credited to Moses, but that he was the author seems doubtful in the face of the many stories of creation found in the legends and hieroglyphs of ancient Egypt, Chaldea, and other nations that are almost identical with those of Genesis. It would thus seem that Moses edited the legends of the ages and compiled them into an allegorical history of creation. The truths in this book will be revealed to the reader through his own spiritual unfoldment. Spiritual things are spiritually discerned. The spiritual revelations that you seem to get from books and teachers already existed as submerged experiences in your own soul. The essential truths have been worked out in this or previous incarnations, and when you were reminded of the buried idea it blazed forth as a light from without.

In this timely volume, Sam Staley provides a detailed, in-depth analysis of the consequences of current drug policies, focusing on the relationship between public policy and urban economic development and on how the drug economy has become thoroughly entwined in the urban economy. The black market in illegal drugs undermines essential institutions necessary for promoting long-term economic growth, including respect for civil liberties, private property, and nonviolent conflict resolution. Staley argues that America's cities can be revitalized only through a major restructuring of the urban economy that does not rely on drug trafficking as a primary source of employment and income-the inadvertent outcome of current prohibitionist policy. Thus comprehensive decriminalization of the major drugs (marijuana, cocaine, and heroin) is an important first step toward addressing the economic and social needs of depressed inner cities. Staley demonstrates how decriminalization would refocus public policy on the human dimension of drug abuse and addiction, acknowledge that the cities face severe development problems that promote underground economic activity, and reconstitute drug policy on principles consistent with limited government as embodied in the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights. Designed to cross disciplinary boundaries, Staley's provocative analysis will be essential reading for urban policymakers, sociologists, economists, criminologists, and drug-treatment specialists.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uCsxDwAAQBAJ&dq=Drug+Policy+and+the+Decline+of+American+Cities&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Oxford Companion to Australian History","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Uncle Arthur's Bedtime Stories, Vol. 2","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Matthew, Mark, Luke & You: Unraveling the Gospels","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Fun with magic : how to make magic equipment; how to perform many tricks, including some of the best tricks of professional magicians and how to give successful magic shows,","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Battle of Yorktown","description":"In early 1781, after his victories in the Southern Colonies, Lord Cornwallis marched his army north into Virginia. He believed the Americans could be decisively defeated in Virginia and the war brought to an end. George Washington believed Cornwallis's move was a strategic blunder, and he moved vigorously to exploit it. Feinting against General Clinton and the British stronghold of New York, Washington marched his army quickly south. With the assistance of Rochambeau's infantry and a key French naval victory at the Battle off the Capes in September, Washington trapped Cornwallis on the tip of a narrow Virginia peninsula at a place called Yorktown. And so it began. Operating on the belief that Clinton would arrive with reinforcements, Cornwallis confidently remained within Yorktown's inadequate defenses. Determined that nothing short of outright surrender would suffice, his opponent labored day and night to achieve that end. Washington's brilliance was on display as he skillfully constricted Cornwallis's position by digging entrenchments, erecting redoubts and artillery batteries, and launching well-timed attacks to capture key enemy positions. The nearly flawless Allied campaign sealed Cornwallis's fate. Trapped inside crumbling defenses, he surrendered on October 19, 1781, effectively ending the war in North America.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SOS5ZxFDRSIC&dq=The+Battle+of+Yorktown&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"America's First Dynasty: The Adamses 1735-1918","description":"Richard Brookhiser has won a wide and loyal following for his stylish, pointed, and elegant biographies of George Washington and Alexander Hamilton. In America's First Dynasty, Brookhiser tells the story of America's longest and still greatest dynasty -- the Adamses, the only family in our history to play a leading role in American affairs for nearly two centuries. From John, the self-made, tough-minded lawyer who rose to the highest office in the government he helped create; to John Quincy, the child prodigy who grew up amid foreign royalty, followed his father to the White House, and later reinvented himself as a champion of liberty in Congress; to politician and writer Charles Francis, the only well-balanced Adams; to Henry, brilliant scholar and journalist -- the Adamses achieved longer-lasting greatness than any other American family. Brookhiser's canvass starts in colonial America, when John Adams had to teach himself the law and ride on horseback for miles to find clients. It does not end until after the Titanic sinks -- Henry had booked a room but changed his plans -- and World War I begins, with Henry near the action in France. The story of this single family offers a short course in the nation's history, because for nearly two hundred years Adams history was American history. The Adamses were accompanied by an impressive cast of characters, from George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, to Andrew Jackson and Ulysses Grant, to Teddy Roosevelt. America's First Dynasty offers telling portraits of the great men of our past, and many of the women around them. John and Abigail's great love affair was destined to be repeated by their offspring and offspring's offspring. As with any family, there was a darker side to the Adams story: many of its members were abject failures. Alcoholism was a familiar specter, and suicide was not unknown. Only one of the four great Adamses was a kind man and father; the others set standards so impossibly high that few of their children could meet them. Yet despite more than a century of difference from John to Henry, certain Adams traits remained the same. In the story of our first and still-greatest family, we can all see something of our own struggles with family, fate, and history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nD4DjnAJ96cC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kiss This: Punk In The Present Tense","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EFzTHAAACAAJ&dq=Kiss+This:+Punk+In+The+Present+Tense&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Touched By Fire: Doctors Without Borders in a Third World Crisis","description":"When the rapes and massacres, the plagues, the famines, the floods, or the droughts erupt in far-off places, the world stands still. MSF does not. They are the \\"smoke jumpers\\" among international aid organizations. While others are often stymied or delayed by bureaucratic red tape, the men and women of Doctors Without Borders (Medecins Sans Frontieres or MSF) move in. They provide food and clean water. They dig latrines. They set up first-aid stations and field hospitals. They treat all-comers according to need. Often they are the last to remain in situations abandoned by others as too dangerous. The risks they take are moral and ethical as well as mortal. They are acutely aware that giving aid is controversial. Does it really do any good to save a child from murder one day when it will probably starve in the weeks ahead? Is it appropriate to bring expensive western medicine into a country that, in the long run, can't afford it? Should relief be given to civilians who are being starved on purpose, as part of a cynical political game, by a local warlord? Elliot Leyton and Greg Locke saw something of the implications of these and other questions when they travelled to Rwanda in the fall of 1996. There they found themselves plunged into a humanitarian crisis of epic proportions. Hundreds of thousands of people were on the move. Armed militias and hostile armies lurked in the background. Mass starvation, plague, and an eruption into civil or criminal violence were immediate possibilities. The two Canadians, one an internationally recognized expert on the psychology of killing, the other an experienced photo-journalist, had a rare opportunity to observe MSF in action at a timewhen the stress was enormous and its resources were stretched to the limit. They watched and listened, to the perpetrators of violence and their victims, to the survivors and those who gave them assistance, and, above all, to the people of MSF who dedicate themselves to saving lives because, in the words of one MSFer: \\"The world can afford a humanitarian ideal.\\" The result of Leyton and Locke's research is an extraordinary written and visual record of small miracles performed in the midst of catastrophe.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=u9ftAAAAMAAJ&dq=Touched+By+Fire:+Doctors+Without+Borders+in+a+Third+World+Crisis&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I'll Go and Do More: Annie Dodge Wauneka, Navajo Leader and Activist (American Indian Lives)","description":"She conducted a weekly radio show in Navajo and drove thousands of miles across back roads to visit hospitals and remote hogans; she button-holed members of Congress to make sure they understood the issues surrounding Indian health care; and she worked to improve educational opportunities and reduce alcoholism on the reservation.\\" \\"Her efforts earned her not only the respect of Navajos but also national recognition as a vital force in the field of Indian health care.

Examines 414 psychoactive plants and related substances ? Explores how using psychoactive plants in a culturally sanctioned context can produce important insights into the nature of reality ? Contains 797 color photographs and 645 black-and-white illustrations In the traditions of every culture, plants have been highly valued for their nourishing, healing, and transformative properties.

There s an art to being at peace with God, your neighbor, your world, and yourself. Oh what a great friend, follower, and citizen you are if you are at peace just being you. Start there, and you can go anywhere.  from the foreword by Charlie Peacock It s Not What You Do. It s Who You Are. In today s achievement-oriented culture, it can feel impossible to separate who we are from what we accomplish. We introduce ourselves by announcing what we do for a living. Endless  to do  lists drive us away from self-discovery and true contentment. We hope that our successes will cause our busyness to feel worthwhile, yet despite our accomplishments, we long for something more. Featuring original essays and stories from a diverse list of contributors including Jonathan Foreman (Switchfoot), Sara Groves, Matthew Odmark (Jars of Clay), Gloria Gaither, Don and Lori Chaffer (Waterdeep), Tammy Trent, and Linford Detweiler (Over the Rhine), The Art of Being explores what it really means to  be  who we are. Here you will find an encouraging, challenging companion on your journey toward discovering your true identityand toward finding a satisfaction that lasts. Life Is Not a Resum  Higher bank balances, stylish clothes, and popularity among our peers may look impressive on the surface, but these things don t satisfy our craving for contentment. True satisfaction is found when our spirit is fed with a sense of purpose.

On every page, Ellison reveals his idiosyncratic and often contrarian brilliance, his insistence on refuting both black and white stereotypes of what an African American writer should say or be.

Dr. Neufeld has dubbed this phenomenon peer orientation, which refers to the tendency of children and youth to look to their peers for direction: for a sense of right and wrong, for values, identity and codes of behaviour. But peer orientation undermines family cohesion, poisons the school atmosphere, and fosters an aggressively hostile and sexualized youth culture. It provides a powerful explanation for schoolyard bullying and youth violence; its effects are painfully evident in the context of teenage gangs and criminal activity, in tragedies such as in Littleton, Colorado; Tabor, Alberta and Victoria, B.C. It is an escalating trend that has never been adequately described or contested until Hold On to Your Kids. Once understood, it becomes self-evident -- as do the solutions. Hold On to Your Kids will restore parenting to its natural intuitive basis and the parent-child relationship to its rightful preeminence. The concepts, principles and practical advice contained in Hold On to Your Kids will empower parents to satisfy their children s inborn need to find direction by turning towards a source of authority, contact and warmth. Something has changed. One can sense it, one can feel it, just not find the words for it. Children are not quite the same as we remember being. They seem less likely to take their cues from adults, less inclined to please those in charge, less afraid of getting into trouble. Parenting, too, seems to have changed. Our parents seemed more confident, more certain of themselves and had more impact on us, for better or for worse. For many, parenting does not feel natural. Adults through the ages have complained about children being less respectful of their elders and more difficult to manage than preceding generations, but could it be that this time it is for real? -- from Hold On to Your Kids","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2Qr98PzAKTkC&dq=Hold+on+to+Your+Kids:+Why+Parents+Need+to+Matter+More+Than+Peers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"James M.

This book clarifies that, in the often nebulous field of natural medicine, the biological bases of ozone therapy are totally in line with classical biochemistry, physiological and pharmacological knowledge. Ozone is an oxidizing molecule, a sort of super active oxygen, which, by reacting with blood components generates a number of chemical messengers responsible for activating crucial biological functions such as oxygen delivery, immune activation, release of hormones and induction of antioxidant enzymes, which is an exceptional property for correcting the chronic oxidative stress present in atherosclerosis, diabetes and cancer. Moreover, by inducing nitric oxide synthase, ozone therapy may mobilize endogenous stem cells, which will promote regeneration of ischemic tissues. The description of these phenomena offers the first comprehensive picture for understanding how ozone works and why. When properly used as a real drug within therapeutic range, ozone therapy does not only does not procure adverse effects but yields a feeling of wellness. Half the book describes the value of ozone treatment in several diseases, particularly cutanious infection and vascular diseases where ozone really behaves as a  wonder drug . The book has been written for clinical researchers, physicians and ozone therapists, but also for the layman or the patient interested in this therapy.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=clTevkIgTVUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Get Well with the Hay Diet: Food Combining & Good Health","description":"The Hay diet, devised by an American surgeon named William Hay, involves separating carbohydrate meals from protein meals, enabling the body to digest food more easily.

Meinke writes of a world where our control over our lives seldom exists across a border, and often extends no further than our fingertips. Attempts to bridge two cultures, two lives are sometimes successful, as when an actor finds love in the arms of a tough-talking barmaid, but more usually lead to disillusionment, as when a hard-drinking salesman's career is shattered after he is drunk under the table one night by a Polish engineer, or when an English father struggles to find common ground with his American son. Riveting, almost terrifying, the stories in The Piano Tuner tell of decent men and women caught in events that they could never have predicted, would never have chosen.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Hu3G1MCt6CkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The third part of the Institutes of the laws of England: Concerning high treason, and other pleas of the crown, and criminal causes","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Performing with Microsoft Office 2003: Introductory Course (The Performing)","description":"Takes students to a higher level of learning through applied and project-based activities that go beyond the mechanics of the software.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9LdLJwAACAAJ&dq=Performing+with+Microsoft+Office+2003:+Introductory+Course+(The+Performing)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Showdown: USA vs. Militia","description":"USA vs. MILITIA THE NEW AMERICAN CIVIL WAR HAS BEGUN... It's brother against brother, citizen against citizen, soldier against soldier in a war for the soul of America All across the nation, well-equipped militias are training for war. They know the hated Federals will be attacking, hell-bent on taking away their guns and their freedom. On the other side, the government knows the militias will be ready to fight to the death for their independence, their land and their family values. At the next Ruby Ridge, both sides are bringing an army. Leading the federal forces is General Douglas Freeman, the hard-nosed, flamboyant soldier who commanded American forces during WW III. When war breaks out, Freeman's B-52s bomb militia positions in the Cascade Mountains of Washington State. Militia and government forces square off in a massive tank battle in the Alvord Desert of southeastern Oregon. The oil fields of Bakersfield, key railroad links in Wyoming, and Fort Bragg, North Carolina, are all targets of militia sabotage. Freeman launches the 82nd Airborne in a headlong attack on militia forces gathered near Mount St. Helens. At the mouth of the Columbia River on the Washington-Oregon border, the two armies fight a climactic battle for the four-mile-long Astoria bridge. SHOWDOWN is the heart-pounding scenario of a war that could be coming . . . a war in which both sides possess the most advanced and terrifying weapons in the history of combat. . . .","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DRYOEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I'll Hold You In Heaven: Healing and Hope for the Parent Who has Lost a Child through Miscarriage, Stillbirth, Abortion or Early Infant Death","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Write-Brain Workbook: 366 Exercises to Liberate Your Writing","description":"Never face a blank page again! &break;&break;With unique daily prompts and stimulating pages, you'll be able to easily incorporate writing into your life, and you'll never have to face another wordless day.

Too bad. Because medicine isn't an industry, it's practically witchcraft. Despite the growth of big pharma, HMOs, and hospital chains, medicine remains the isolated work of individual doctors and the system is going broke fast. So why is Andy Kessler the man who told you outrageous stories of Wall Street analysts gone bad in Wall Street Meat and tales from inside a hedge fund in Running Money poking around medicine for the next big wave of technology? It's because he smells change coming. Heart attacks, strokes, and cancer are a huge chunk of medical spending, yet there's surprisingly little effort to detect disease before it's life threatening. How lame is that especially since the technology exists today to create computer-generated maps of your heart and colon? Because it's too expensive for now. But Silicon Valley has turned computing, telecom, finance, music, and media upside down by taking expensive new technologies and making them ridiculously cheap. So why not the $1.8 trillion health care business, where the easiest way to save money is to stop folks from getting sick in the first place? Join Kessler's bizarre search for the next big breakthrough as he tries to keep from passing out while following cardiologists around, cracks jokes while reading mammograms, and watches twitching mice get injected with radioactive probes. Looking for a breakthrough, Kessler even selflessly pokes, scans, and prods himself. CT scans of your heart will identify problems before you have a heart attack or stroke; a nanochip will search your blood for cancer cells--five years before they grow uncontrollably and kill you; and baby boomers can breathe a little easier because it's all starting to happen now. Your doctor can't be certain what's going on inside your body, but technology will. Embedding the knowledge of doctors in silicon will bring a breakout technology to health care, and we will soon see an end of medicine as we know it.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qLXZodyeCgsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jakarta (Indonesian Trilogy)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Windwalker","description":"From the award-winning author of SEASON OF THE WITCH comes a highly original story of murder, redemption, eternal love and destiny, WINDWALKER will keep you on the edge of your seat.

In order to finance the trip, he swindles money out of his brother Jacob and their mother. But the past has a funny way of coming back to bite you, as David discovers, when years later he and Jacob cross paths again. One of George Eliot s few novellas, \\"Brother Jacob\\" is an intriguing morality tale. And compared to her novels, it strikes a much darker comic tone. A delicious curio of Victorian literature. George Eliot, pseudonym of Mary Ann Evans (18191890), was an English novelist, journalist and poet. She took a realist approach to storytelling, finding the drama and beauty in the day-to-day existence of England s rural working classes. Her most famous novels include \\"Middlemarch\\", \\"The Mill on the Floss\\" and \\"Adam Bede\\". Eliot s personal life was the subject of some controversy. For over two decades, she lived together with George Henry Lewes, a married man he was estranged from his wife but never officially divorced. Their relationship offended Victorian sensibilities, but failed to dent Eliot s popularity with readers.

How important is it for each partner to have a biological tie to their child? How will they become parents: will they pursue surrogacy, or will they adopt? Will both partners legally be able to adopt their child? Will they have to hide their relationship to speed up the adoption process? Will one partner be the primary breadwinner? And how will their lives change, now that the presence of a child has made their relationship visible to the rest of the world? In Gay Dads: Transitions to Adoptive Fatherhood, Abbie E. Goldberg examines the ways in which gay fathers approach and negotiate parenthood when they adopt. Drawing on empirical data from her in-depth interviews with 70 gay men, Goldberg analyzes how gay dads interact with competing ideals of fatherhood and masculinity, alternately pioneering and accommodating heteronormative  parenthood culture.  The first study of gay men's transitions to fatherhood, this work will appeal to a wide range of readers, from those in the social sciences to social work to legal studies, as well as to gay-adoptive parent families themselves.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dPwTCgAAQBAJ&dq=Busting+the+Mob:+The+United+States+v.+Cosa+Nostra&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Land Revised Edition (Overtures to Biblical Theology)","description":"The land was one of the most vibrant symbols for the people of ancient Israel.

In this collection of twenty essays, leading scholars in a broad range of disciplines confront the claims made by Martin Bernal in Black Athena: The Afroasiatic Roots of Classical Civilization. In that work, Bernal proposed a radical reinterpretation of the roots of classical civilization, contending that ancient Greek culture derived from Egypt and Phoenicia and that European scholars have been biased against the notion of Egyptian and Phoenician influence on Western civilization. The contributors to this volume argue that Bernal's claims are exaggerated and in many cases unjustified. Topics covered include race and physical anthropology; the question of an Egyptian invasion of Greece; the origins of Greek language, philosophy, and science; and racism and anti-Semitism in classical scholarship. In the conclusion to the volume, the editors propose an entirely new scholarly framework for understanding the relationship between the cultures of the ancient Near East and Greece and the origins of Western civilization.

But this book begins with Dorothy and her legacy as an archetypal touchstone in cinema for the child journeying far from home. In There's No Place Like Home, distinguished film scholar Stephanie Hemelryk Donald offers a fresh interpretation of the migrant child as a recurring figure in world cinema. Displaced or placeless children, and the idea of childhood itself, are vehicles to examine migration and cosmopolitanism in films such as Le Ballon Rouge, Little Moth and Le Havre. Surveying fictional and documentary film from the post-war years until today, the author shows how the child is a guide to themes of place, self and being in world cinema.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RgSWDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Unrequited Love: On Stalking and Being Stalked a Tale of Destructive Passion","description":"Stalking has moved from being a novel area for study to become a core area of concern for mental health professionals, lawyers and other members of the criminal justice system.

The first such study to draw on community-based fieldwork in both countries, the book also shows how ethnographic and historical approaches can be combined to reconstruct patterns of seasonal and repeat migration.\\" \\"Samuel Martinez pays close attention to the economic maneuvers Haitians adopt on both sides of the border as they use Dominican money to meet their present needs and to assure future subsistence at home in Haiti. The emigrants who adapt best, he finds, are those who maintain close ties to their home areas. Yet, in addition to showing how rural Haitians survive under severe poverty and oppression, Martinez reveals the risks they incur by crossing the border as cane workers: divided families, increased short-term deprivation and economic insecurity, and, all too often, early death. He further notes that labor circulation is not part of an unchanging cycle in rural Haiti but a source of income that is vulnerable to the downturns in the global economy.\\" \\"Acknowledging various theoretical perspectives, the author compares the Haitian migrations with similar population displacements worldwide. As he shows, the Haitian workers exemplify an important, if seldom studied, category of migrants - those who neither move to the cities nor emigrate to countries of the North but circulate between rural areas of the Third World. Thus, this book serves to broaden our understanding of this \\"lower tier\\" of the world's migrants.\\"--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

This means that its engagement with the global economy cannot just be understood at the national level, but requires analysis of the differences in participation in the global economy across China s regions. This book responds to this challenge by looking at the development of China s regions in this era of globalization. It traces the evolution of regional policy in China and its implications in a global context. Detailed chapters examine the global trajectory of what is now becoming known as the Greater Bay Area in southern China, the globalization of the inland mega-city of Chongqing, and the role of China s regions in the globally-focused belt and road initiative launched by the Chinese government in late 2013. The book will be of interest to practitioners and scholars engaging with contemporary China s political economy and international relations.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7-1gDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Dance (Piano / Vocal / Chords)","description":"(Piano/Vocal/Guitar Songbook). 61 songs to get your audience dancing, including: All She Wants to Do Is Dance * Blue Tango * Bristol Stomp * The Chicken Dance * The Dance * Dancing in the Dark * Dancing Queen * Hands Up (Give Me Your Heart) * Harlem Shuffle * Le Freak * Let's Twist Again * Macarena * Shadow Dancing * Soul Bossa Nova * Tighten Up * and many more.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HxFKAgAACAAJ&dq=The+Dance+(Piano+/+Vocal+/+Chords)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Handbook of Professional Tour Management","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"After the Plague: Stories","description":"Few authors in America write with such sheer love of story, language, and imagination as T.C.

Jung repeatedly underlined the importance of the psychology of parents and teachers in a child's development and he emphasized that an unsatisfactory psychological relationship between parents may be an important cause of disorders in childhood. He maintained that all real education of children needs teachers who not only know how to learn but who can also develop their own personalities. Jung devotes a large part of the book to expounding his views on these important subjects. There is also an outline of the theory of child development, a delightful snapshot from the life of a girl called Anna and her parents, and a stimulating discussion of marriage as a psychological relationship. Finally there is a chapter on child development and individuation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8mTfBQAAQBAJ&dq=The+development+of+personality+(The+collected+works+of+C.G.+Jung)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Enterprise Java for SAP","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aHPqnQEACAAJ&dq=Enterprise+Java+for+SAP&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Field Guide to the Wild Orchids of Thailand","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EBPbAAAAMAAJ&dq=A+Field+Guide+to+the+Wild+Orchids+of+Thailand&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Scourge Of The Swastika : A Short History Of Nazi War Crimes","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Romancero gitano (Spanish Edition)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Constructive Living (Kolowalu Books)","description":"Constructive Living is a Western approach to mental health education based in large part on adaptations of two Japanese psychotherapies, Morita therapy and Naikan therapy.

Although it is not known exactly how many Confederates migrated to South America -- estimates range from eight thousand to forty thousand -- their departure was fueled by bitterness over a lost cause and a distaste for an oppressive victor. Encouraged by Emperor Dom Pedro, most of these exiles settled in Brazil. Although at the time of the Civil War the exodus was widely known and discussed as an indicator of the resentment against the northern invaders and the strict measures imposed by the federal government after the peace at Appomattox, The Lost Colony of the Confederacy is the first book to focus on this mass migration. Eugene C. Harter vividly describes the lives of these last Confederates who founded their own city and were called Os Confederados by the Brazilians. They retained much of their Southernness and lent an American flavor to Brazilian culture. The cultural province they established still exists as testimony to the hardiness of Southern ways. First published in 1985, this work details the background of the exodus and describes the life of the twentieth-century descendants, who have a strong link both to Southern history and to modern Brazil. The fires have cooled, but it is useful to understand the intense feelings that sparked the migration to Brazil and other areas of the globe. Southern ways have melded into Brazilian, and both are linked by the unbreakable bonds of history, as shown in this revealing account.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WRt_siIW22sC&dq=The+Lost+Colony+of+the+Confederacy+(Williams-Ford+Texas+A&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nurses say NBC's 'ER' contributes to nursing shortage.(Nursing News): An article from: Dermatology Nursing","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Brain Powered, Book 1","description":"The symbiotic mechanoids aboard the United Nations ship Novis Noah battle the evil scientists who want to bring the alien artifact known as Orphan to the surface, even though doing so may drain the remaining power from an already ravaged Earth.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xOitV4iIsIoC&dq=Brain+Powered,+Book+1&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Help!

Richard Overy has given us a powerful reminder of the horror of war and the threat posed by dictators with dreams of empire.   The Wall Street Journal A thought-provoking and original reassessment of World War II, from Britain s leading military historian A New York Times bestseller Richard Overy sets out in Blood and Ruins to recast the way in which we view the Second World War and its origins and aftermath. As one of Britain s most decorated and respected World War II historians, he argues that this was the  last imperial war,  with almost a century-long lead-up of global imperial expansion, which reached its peak in the territorial ambitions of Italy, Germany and Japan in the 1930s and early 1940s, before descending into the largest and costliest war in human history and the end, after 1945, of all territorial empires. Overy also argues for a more global perspective on the war, one that looks broader than the typical focus on military conflict between the Allied and Axis states. Above all, Overy explains the bitter cost for those involved in fighting, and the exceptional level of crime and atrocity that marked the war and its protracted aftermath which extended far beyond 1945. Blood and Ruins is a masterpiece, a new and definitive look at the ultimate struggle over the future of the global order, which will compel us to view the war in novel and unfamiliar ways. Thought-provoking, original and challenging, Blood and Ruins sets out to understand the war anew.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=p-E2EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Oliviatown","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Contemporary drummer + one","description":"An incredible audio/book/charts package which features an all-star band including Dave, Chick Corea, Michael Brecker, John Patitucci, and Steve Lukather.

But, since at least the nineteenth century, we have seen the murderer as different from the ordinary citizen a special individual, like an artist or a genius, who exists apart from the moral majority, a sovereign self who obeys only the destructive urge, sometimes even commanding cult followings. In contemporary culture, we continue to believe that there is something different and exceptional about killers, but is the murderer such a distinctive type? Are they degenerate beasts or supermen as they have been depicted on the page and the screen? Or are murderers something else entirely? In The Subject of Murder, Lisa Downing explores the ways in which the figure of the murderer has been made to signify a specific kind of social subject in Western modernity. Drawing on the work of Foucault in her studies of the lives and crimes of killers in Europe and the United States, Downing interrogates the meanings of media and texts produced about and by murderers. Upending the usual treatment of murderers as isolated figures or exceptional individuals, Downing argues that they are ordinary people, reflections of our society at the intersections of gender, agency, desire, and violence.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=E9YUf7Kga0QC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Children's Culture Reader","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Blizzard Pass (Gunsmoke Western)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Duo Tone Gift Bible for Girls - Walmart","description":"Honest, poignant, and sometimes humorous, Beloved: 365 Devotions for Young Women uses the inspiring stories of girls and women in the Bible such as Ruth, Esther, Mary, and Abigail and ample journaling space to help you build confidence and express yourself day after day.
