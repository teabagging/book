This is a very funny novel, very inventive and will stretch your imagination. One caveat would be if you know you don't like the British sense of humor, this book probably won't work for you.Though it made me laugh a lot and shake my head at its ingeniousness, it gets 4 stars because of some basic problems in that there is virtually no character development and the plot is razor thin.

The book has many interesting twists and turns along with large amounts of dry humor mixed in. The word play and puns quickly catch the readers' attention and hold it there throughout the book. And although the book is occasionally confusing, the wit and energy quickly ensnares the reader all over again. I would recommend this book to anyone who needs refreshment from the clich&eacute;d books they have come to know.

Able to hitchhike aboard passing interstellar crafts, Ford, a writer for \\"the most remarkable book ever to come out of the great publishing corporations of Ursa Minor (6)--The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy--saves his friend Arthur from its destruction and into the clutches of a Vogon Constructor Fleet, or rather, into the clutches of the insidiously inane personalities of the Vogon aliens. Whether a gift or a curse, Arthur is soon able to understand Vogon speech (and particularly awful poetry, including the wrenched poem beginning with \\"O freddled gruntbuggly...\\" [60]) due to \\"probably the oddest thing in the Universe\\" (55)--the Babel Fish. Considering the Vogon's ill-temperament towards hitchhikers, the unlikely duo are soon jettisoned into the expansive vacuum of space, which \\"...is big. Really big. You just won't believe how vastly hugely mindboggingly big it is\\" (70).With the probability of 2276,709 to 1 against being rescued by a passing craft, the two are normalized within the confines of the stolen starship, The Heart of Gold, which had been stolen by the Zaphod Beeblebox, the President of the Galaxy. The ship with the Infinite Improbability Drive is crewed by the widely eccentric president, his Section ZZ 9 Plural Z Alpha-native tag-along Trillian (Tricia McMillan), and the paranoid android himself, Marvin. Unbeknownst to even himself, Zaphod is out to find Magrathea, the industry specialist of \\"custom-made luxury planet building\\" (102).Their initial welcoming consisting of guided missiles, the ship turns on its Improbability Drive and is randomly shifted to the surface of the same planet a whale had recently descended upon in an amazing free-fall of self-discovery and splattered blubber, the occurrence their landing on the same planet 8,267,128 to 1 against. The seemingly abandoned surface and derelict innards of the planet factory's office give rise, after an unfortunate bout of gassing, to the wondrous facilities of the factory in full swing. Just who are benefactors of the colossal project, what are their objectives, and how in good name of fjord engineer Slartibartfast will the quartet escape to The Restaurant at the End of the Universe?------------The tumultuous cavalcade of silliness is typically unrelenting; something which can't be said for the remaining four books, in my memory serves me correctly. Arthur should be described as a protagonist if he wasn't also the whipping boy for the more free-willed, free-wheeling Zaphod and Ford. Arthur plays the silent role, more in the novel for comic relief at the expense of the monkey-like humans and their pathetic planet than for his sheer diligence, social prowess or keen insight. It's Arthur's role as lost boy amid the galaxy with a couple of crazies that's the most entertaining bit in the premise. Sadly, like mentioned above, Arthur seems to be left out or seems to have taken a passive, backseat role. Some resulting sections of \\"coincidences\\" are simply too random to be funny and borders more on absurd than witty. This absurdity over wittiness is more prevalent in the sequel: The Restaurant at the End of the Universe."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I LOVE IT!!!!

There is a lot of interesting history and other behind the scenes type information about the book, but when it comes to the section with the book itself, they use huge borders around the text, leaving the readable area about the size of a trade paperback. That makes it very distracting and awkward to read. Also, I had somehow gotten the impression that all three books were included in this edition, much like the Ultimate HHGG. However, it is just HHGG and not the two sequels. I'm not factoring that into my review as I went back and read the description and didn't see anything mentioning it containing all three, but I wanted to point it out in case anyone else mistakenly had the same assumption I did. I'll probably keep this just for the extra information about the author and franchise, but I'm going to be purchasing a copy of the Ultimate HHGG as well."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Book itself is great, theres no complains about it.

Arthur Dent is a typical male human being from England who wakes up to a typical sunny morning to find out;that his house is going to be demolished to build a bypass through. Arthur's wacky friend Ford Precept has much more concerning news and that the Earth will be destroyed very soon. As a alien race of creatures known as Vogon's destroy Earth, of course Arthur and Precept escape by boarding their craft and are now in for a wild adventure.Ford who has been stuck on Earth for 15 years has come out saying he's from the planet Beatleguise who has in his possession,\\"DONT PANIC\\", 'The Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy'. A book of incredible knowledge of the darkness of space. Along the way they come along another pair of humanoids, Trillion the female human, and the President Of The Galaxy, Zophod Beeblebrox and the very depressed Marvin the Robot. The ship called \\"The Heart Of Gold\\" has been stolen by Zophon himself and he's positive he knows of the unknown wives-tale that is the planet \\"Magrathea\\".Zaniness ensues and the most unpredictable science fiction book I've read in a long time has tickled my brain. Some of his writing reminds me of another one of my favorite authors, Kurt Vonnegut. The ideas of 'What if?' and the ultimate question;Why are we here, what is life?, is always intriguing and makes you think outside your box.Whatever you think this book is about,it's not,whatever you think can't happen will and what does a sperm whale, a pot of petunias,dolphins and mice have to do about it? Everything or nothing?.I found myself out loud laughing to this book, so silly and understandable?, it's hard to explain. Maybe the point is that the universe is much to vast for our understanding. Maybe we aren't supposed to, read it and you'll have a blast waiting to find out.\\"THGTTG\\" is part 1 of a 5 part series.This book is wonderfully written for young teens to aged adults, because we're never too old to take a ride through the universe."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I loved this book! It's hilarious -- I was laughing out loud almost through the entire thing, and I thought it showed some pretty insightful observations about life, people, and the world in general.It starts off with Arthur, a man from Earth who is trying to save his house from being torn down to build a new bypass on the land. He's friends with Ford Prefect, a man from Betelgeuse 5 who is a researcher for The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and who has been stranded on Earth for fifteen years. In the beginning of the novel, Earth is destroyed to make room for a sort of intergalactic bypass. However, Ford saves his friend Arthur, transporting them onto a nearby spaceship. Crazy adventures ensue.At first glance, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy may seem ridiculous and random for it's own sake. However, Adams has crafted a novel that speaks about how it is to live life. Sometimes, weird stuff happens and you just have to go with it. Like Arthur, we will find ourselves in strange situations, completely out of our element, and we will need to figure out a way to get through it. And maybe, just maybe, we take ourselves too seriously sometimes.As for the narration -- well, it was narrated by Stephen Fry, so I think that's enough to tell you that it's amazing. He brings such personality to the characters that it's hardly like reading a book at all. Rather, it's more like being a bystander in events taking place.I highly recommend this book. It's funny, insightful, and a true classic."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I have read this book several times in different languages, I have seen the movie and now I have heard Stephen Fry read it!

Just like everyone else in the Universe, or at least that's what he thinks. But space is closer to him than he ever could imagine. His best friend, Ford Prefect isn't from Guildford as he usually claims. In fact he is from a small planet somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse. And just seconds before the Earth is being destroyed, Ford manages to save himself and Arthur by hitch-hiking. This is the beginning of a whole new life for Arthur, and for help he has got an electronic book, a book that tells you about everything that is worth knowing about in the Universe. The book is called The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.The main characters are Arthur, who is a dark-haired human dressed in a dressing gown throughout the whole story, and Ford, a tall humanoid alien who works as a roving researcher for the reference book \\"the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\". But the story is also about Zaphod Beeblebrox, Trillian and Marvin, a depressed robot.The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is the best book I have ever read. It is both entertaining and deep.

This book is about a man named Arthur dent and his friend ford prefect. In the beginning of the story Mr. Prosser wants to knock down Arthur's house. They want to knock it down to make a bypass. Arthur doesn't want them to knock it down so he sits in a mud pile in front of his house so that the bulldozers wont knock it down. Later his friend ford tricks Mr. Prosser to sit in the mud pile while they get a drink. Mr. Prosser then gets in the mud pile and sits there while ford and Arthur leave to get a drink. When they go to the bar ford tell Arthur that he is an alien and that the earth is going to be demolished. Then ford tells Arthur to drink 3 pints of alcohol before the trip to leave earth. While Arthur is drinking he hears his house get knocked down and run to try and save it but is too late. Then they left and an earth was destroyed. Then they get off the planet as hitchhikers. They where on a ship that belonged to the Vogon. The Vogon are evil so they kicked all the people that came on the ship out. They where thrown in space and they held there breath for 29 seconds and bearly escaped dying. The where aboard a ship called the Heart of Gold? On this ship ford and Arthur met a robot named Marvin. Marvin tells them to follow him to go to the captain of the ship Zaphod Beeblebrox who is also the president of the galaxy. Marvin later tells them that Zaphod has stolen this aircraft. Zaphod is an old friend of ford and once met Arthur at a party. At the party Zaphod takes the girl who Arthur had liked. The girls' name is Trillian and later Zaphod tells her that he is a real alien and takes her with him back to space. Later Arthur goes to sleep and the rest of them found the planet Magrathea. They where looking for this planet because this planet belonged to the rich people who made planets. The next day they where going to land on the planet when a recording said that they should leave the planet. Later it spoke again and it said that it would be firing missile at them. Just second before the missile was going to hit them Arthur bushed the improbability drive and saved them. Then they went to land and they got out and started looking. They found a cave and went through. Zaphod told Arthur and Marvin to stay out and secure the land. Later a man named slartibartfast told him to come and they went into his aircar. Then slartibartfast began to tell him the story about a man named lunkwill and his friend majikthise who went and asked the computer a question. They asked the computer what is the answer to life, the universe, and everything. The computer told him that he would have to think a while to answer the question. Then they asked the computer how long and he responded by saying 7.5 million years. So they left and 7.5 million years later he told then that the answer was the number 42. Then the two men asked him what do you mean. And then the computer told him the answer is 42. The computer also told him you asked me the wrong question. They asked to tell them what question they asked him to answer but he told them that he will not be able to but I know how you van find out. The computer told them I will tell you what to build and you build it. The computer told them that the answer will come from the rats on planet earth and it would take 10 million years to build it.

Douglas Adams is an exceptionally talented writer. Throughout the book, he approaches details far from the main flow of information and in the last sentence of the chapter makes it all fit together. It is extremely hard to describe his style except that of what some would call slapstick comedy. This type of comedy is completely zany and just throws around plot elements, introducing new items very liberally and taking others away rapidly.The plot and content are excellent. The charcters are very developed and interesting. Because most of the book does not take place on the Earth, Adams pokes a lot of fun at the Earth and its not-so-brilliant residents, humans. The book is constantly refering to The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (an actual book in the story) giving the reader more information and continuing to reveal the plot in Adams's unique style.I really enjoyed this book. I was often laughing out loud and recieving interesting looks from the other kids in study hall. This book is unequivocally humorous with a very extensive plot and developed characters.

The Guide entertained me with its humorous, gut wrenching absurdity while educating me with its witty dialogue and sardonic social satire. The election of the nihilistic puppethead president Zaphod Beeblebrox pokes fun at the very hypocrisy that is politics.A great, quick read that will leave an indelible impression - and leave your sides hurting from laughing so much.\\"Does it really, cosmically speaking, matter if I don't get up and go to work?\\""},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is amazing.

The main character in the book is Arthur Dent. He is miraculously rescued from Earth just moments before it is destroyed to make way for an interstellar bypass. He and his friend, Ford Prefect, a researcher for The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy who has been stranded on Earth for the past fifteen years, are rescued by the starship Heart of Gold. Their rescue was caused by the revolutionary propulsion system on the ship called the Infinite Improbability Drive, which makes the improbable probable. The occupants of the ship are Zaphod Beeblebrox, President of the Imperial Galactic, Trillian, a woman originally from Earth, and Marvin, an extremely intelligent and depressed robot. On his journey through space, Arthur discovers many amazing things, such as the answer to life, the universe, and everything is forty-two, and that the Earth was manufactured as a computer to discover what the actual question to the answer is. Douglas Adams' use of situational irony in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy makes the book a hilarious and entertaining read.The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is completely full of situational irony that enhances the novel's over all effect on the reader. In the beginning of the book, a alien warship comes to destroy the planet Earth to make room for an interstellar bypass. Similarly, on Earth, the main character, Arthur Dent, has been trying for days to stop a wrecking crew from destroying his house to make room for a interstate highway. The alien ship says that a notice has been posted 300 light-years away at their home planet, and that the inhabitants of earth have had thirty years to see the notice. The alien invaders promptly destroy the earth seconds before it completes its function. To find the question to the ultimate answer, forty-two. Arthur and Ford are rescued by the heart of gold, a ship that has just been invented it is so advanced that it makes interstellar bypasses no longer need by the universe.All these events are situational irony. The fact that the alien wrecking crew posted a notice 300 light-years away from earth and expected the humans to read it and lodge a complaint against the rest of the galaxy is very ironic. Also in this book, the earth is a giant supercomputer that has been working for billions of years to find the question to the ultimate answer. Five minutes before it has completed its task, it is destroyed by the alien demolition crew. Many other ironic situations exist in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, everything from extremely depressed robots, a universe contained in a piece of sponge cake, and how mice have secretly been controlling humans since the beginning of time.It is because of all these ironic situations in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy that make this a very entertaining book. Douglas Adams' use of situational irony definitely enhances the overall meaning of the book."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"If you only read one book in the rest of your pitiful earthling life, make it this one!! Here is an example of the valuable philosphical and historical education this book will endow you with:There isn't a God. Not any more. There used to be. He was very insistent that he exists exclusively on the idea of faith without proof. He went on to design amazing and incredibly improbable creations, including the mind-boggling Babelfish, worn inside the ear of galactic hitchhikers. The fish, which parastically feeds off of sound waves entering your brain and excretes energy waves straight into your mind, allows the host to accurately understand sound transmissions in any language. Later, a scientist pointed out that this direct affront to the idea of probability and evolution offered direct and undisputable proof that there, was, in fact a God. \\"I hadn't thought of that,\\" said God, and immediately disappeared from existence after having proven himself wrong.Thus, you are on your own now. Thus, you need Douglas Adams' cunning wit and sarcastic advice to guide you through the rest of your own silly existence!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"this is the best book ever. it is very funny.

Led by his friend Ford Perfect, Arthur Dent travels the galaxy, meeting many people and creatures along the way. The book is dripping with situational humor like the Earth being destroyed 5 seconds before the secret of life is to be found, as well as the often unintended sarcastic remarks from Ford Perfect, who is sent through the galaxy to revise the electronic book Hitchikers Guide to the Galaxy. Although somewhat confusing at times, the creative imagination and description helps the reader actually envision intergalactic travel. Arthur and Ford are led through much of their adventure by The Intergalactic President Zaphod Beetlebrox on the spaceship \\"Heart of Gold&quot;. Zaphod is a creature with two heads and three arms, he was later described to have gained the third arm to improve his ski-boxing. This is another example of Adams' imagination and creativity. A humorous portion of the book comes when a computer says the calculated meaning of life is 42, which offers no more of an answer than anyone else's theory of the meaning of life. Along with humor, Adams uses satire to mock things like society and government. He states the Zaphod's duties as president are to take the attention away from the governments actual power. Zaphod achieves these goals by spending the first two years of his ten year term in trouble with the law. If satirical and sarcastic humor mixed with sci-fi entertainment sound appealing, The Hitchikers Guide to the Galaxy has exactly what you're looking for."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"To put it simply, this book moved me.

Remember Arthur and Ford being thrown out of the Vogon ship and worring about asphyxiation?

This is why our astronauts even bother to wear SPACESUITS in stead of just oxygen masks."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Douglas Adams's 1979 adaptation of his popular BBC radio drama spawned a cult following that persisted through four sequels, a TV series, and a movie and continues to thrive eight years after his death. The sometimes witty, often satirical, and always humorous quasi-science-fiction/fantasy story about a young man traveling the galaxy on an involuntary quest for the meaning of existence has managed to survive and remain startlingly current through an entire generation of changes in technology and literary trends.Arthur Dent doesn't have a lot on his mind other than surviving his hangover when he wakes up one morning to find that his house is about to be bulldozed to make way for a bypass. His objections are met with sympathetic indifference by the crew chief until he lies down in the mud in front of the offending bulldozer. What he doesn't realize is that the earth itself has been slated for destruction by the evil Vogons as part of the development of a hyperspatial express route. Moments before the earth disintegrates, Arthur and his secretly alien friend Ford Prefect escape by hitching a ride on one of the Vogon ships, and their journey begins.As Arthur and Ford and the improbable gang of galactic characters they join up with travel from system to system in search of the mythical planet Magrathea and the Question to the Ultimate Answer, they are guided by The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, an e-book that offers such insightful wisdom as \\"Don't panic\\" and contains articles on subjects such as the importance of towels as well as helpful information about various planets and species. Along the way, Adams hilariously lambasts everything from religion to art to politics to human nature.The story, while mildly entertaining, is not what makes the book work. Rather, Adam's sardonic narration and ultra-dry humor are what make it worth reading. Virtually every page contains at least one description or parodic exposition that makes you want to either laugh out loud or groan.Since the book doesn't have a message or even much of a plot, it might be hard for some to find a reason to read it. But those who enjoy British humor (think Monty Python) or want to see how the destruction of the earth can be so funny may well enjoy it. The good news is, if you really like it, there are four sequels, so you could potentially be laughing for a long time."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I've always thought of Monty Python as the Thinking Man's SNL. I now think of Douglas Adams as the seriously Thinking Man's Monty Python. The subjects it tackles are those of time and space. The jokes it makes are humorous, drawing snickers and belly laughs from the readers. The points it makes can even be thought provoking at times. The story is this. Arthur Dent is saved at the last minute from the destruction of the world by his friend Ford Prefect. Ford is not actually from the planet earth. He is an alien from a planet in Betelguese who is writing a revised edition of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. For technical reasons he has been stranded on earth for 15 years. They hitch a ride on a spaceship and their adventure takes off from there. I won't tell you the whole thing, I'd ruin some of the greatest jokes. I'll just tell you to read it. If you're interested in &quot;Destruction of the World&quot; stories, do yourself a favor and don't read &quot;Left Behind&quot;.

No other author has succeeded in writing a book that is so thoroughly detached from reality, and yet full of astoundingly cynical observations of human life. He systematically demolishes people who read too much into life, everybody from Jesus to Freud. The main thing you notice about the book however, is the style of writing, not the humour. This is an author who would be just as comfortable writing the biography of a physicist as writing a sci-fi novel about an alien and a neurotic broadcaster.

The Earth is facing destruction. Before the Earth is destroyed, Arthur, along with his alien friend Ford Prefect, hitchhikes through space, using advice from the Hitchhiker's Guide. Arthur is thrust into situations where he loses limbs. At other times, he is suddenly thrown out into space with only 30 seconds to live. This book makes you reconsider the roles of animals, and their level of intellect and control over us. I thought this book was very good. This book is only one book in a series of five. If you watch the movie, be careful not to get too tied up with the story line, since the movie is based on all five books put together. If you cannot handle thinking outside the box, and do not like very random out of the blue conversations and situations, then do not read this book. If you can handle crazy, unrealistic, yet amazing ideas this book is for you.

Mr. Adams caught the true essence of good story telling, which made it a very quick and enjoyable read. I would love to hear copies of the radio show some day.My favorite mental picture from TH2G2 is that bureaucracy is just as screwed up in the whole of the universe as it is on planet Earth. I thoroughly enjoyed the description of Arthur Dent protesting the demolition of his house while Mr. Possner, the local bureaucrat, stood and thought, \\"Obviously somebody had been appallingly incompetent, and he hoped to God it wasn't him.\\" To then read about supposed higher life forms making the same errors, having the same inferiority complexes, and looking for the same easy exits out of the day-to-day hum-drum of earning a living is classic.Enjoy. Good story telling can be fun, which is what this book provides."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy is without a doubt one of the greatest books ever produced. It should be required reading for all high school students as an example of British literature. Maybe I exaggerate but after 30 years it doesn't feel the least bit dated. I am dead serious when I say that Douglas Adams's Hitchhikers quadrilogy is to sci-fi humor what Tolkien is to fantasy.I can remember reading this book as a teenager and wishing I had my own Hitchhikers Guide. In a certain sense Douglas Adams was a visionary in that the Hitchhikers Guide is essentially a laptop and Wikipedia. Slap the words \`Don't Panic' on the case and you have a terrestrial version. The one complaint I've heard about the series is that there is no real plot which probably stems from the fact that it was originally written as a series of radio programs. It plays out like a literary version of Monty Python in that that overall plot is much less important than the individual setups for jokes. In literature humor is perhaps that hardest genre to pull off but Douglas Adams nails it. Hitchhikers is the kind of series that's so good it feels like the author made a demonic pact to briefly give him the talent to produce a book of near perfect quality. It would lend weight to my theory in that Mr. Adams was never able to recapture the magic that was the Hitchhikers Guide and after his two Dirk Gentry books seemed to just give up on producing novels. Alright, I don't actually think Douglas Adams made a deal with the Devil.Douglas Adams managed to pull me into the book so thoroughly that when the super-computer Deep Thought was preparing to deliver the answer to life, the universe and everything I half expected him to actually do it. For me the Hitchhikers Guide is about as close as a book has come to a mystical experience. This may well be my all time favorite book and I can give it nothing less than a perfect score."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The book is written from the point of view of Arthur Dent, an Earthling who doesn't know much about the Galaxy. Arthur and Ford Prefect are beamed up from Earth into a Vogon ship. Unfortunately, the Vogons don't like guests, and throw them out of the ship. Fortunately, Arthur and Ford land into another ship, the Heart of Gold, which is piloted by Zaphod Beeblebrox (who also stole this ship from the planet Damogran), Trillian (who plays perfect foil to Zaphod) and Marvin the Paranoid Android (my favorite character). The five of them travel to the planet Magrathea, which they are curious to explore as its denizens create designer planets. There, Arthur learns about the Answer (to Life, the Universe and Everything), and finds out why the Earth was created, and other bits of fact like how human beings are only the third-most intelligent beings on the Earth.

This book is a satirical look at the way that governments work. The entire story is overflowing with British comedy. Most people in American society today do not understand the paticulars of that kind of humor. For some reason they do not find it funny. Hitchhiker's Guide is true to its British creator. The concept of the book was even funny, since it came to Adams while he was lying drunk in a field. Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is intended to be a sci-fi, what with the aliens on Earth (well before it is destroyed in order to put in a pointless hyperspatial express route). The main characters are Arthur Dent, Ford Prefect, Zaphod Beeblebrox, and Trillian. Some of these &quot;people&quot; are very odd. Such as Zaphod, who is portrayed as completely insane. Ford is a dry character, put in for comic relief. Arthur is the stereotypical human, who is completely clueless in the ways of space. Trillian is also human, but she actually has a working brain. Adams manipulates words and characters to fit into his perfect little universe. He twists logic so that it is beyond recogntion. But that's what works for him. Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a woderfully satiric story that is worthy of the short time it takes to read the 143 pages of the book.

Invariably those books never live up to my expectations. Although I did like the Monty Python British type humor, the story wasn't that great or well written. Sorry, but I've read better (and funnier). The story ends abruptly without tying up loose ends, so I wouldn't consider this a complete story by itself.

I personally blame this book for my switch to dating obnoxious metalhead morons in high school and my 13yr aversion to an otherwise fascinating genre, science fiction.

I thought it was engaging, hilarious, profound, etc. That's how I remembered it. I decided to give it a shot again, so I bought this nice, trim, hardcover edition from Amazon. I was sad to find that it just has not stood the test of time -- which is ironic for a book that plays fairly fast and loose with the concept of time. The humor may have worked back in a day when just about anything Python-esque was considered cutting edge. But unlike, say, Monte Python's Life of Brian -- which HAS stood the test of time and then some -- the Hitchhiker's Guide is, today, about as engaging, funny and/or profound as Jabberwocky. As with that lackluster Terry Gilliam flick, The Guide develops a compelling premise for cultural satire and philosophizing but, alas, bogs down in its over-reliance on a now-dated notion of what constitutes drollery. I know this evaluation amounts to sacrilege for HHGG's true believers, but the truth of my judgment can be demonstrated empirically.On the other hand, kudos to Adams for anticipating the iPad."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I don't need to tell you that this book is amazing so I will leave it at that (if you don't agree, you probably take life too seriously).What you need to know is that this version, for the Kindle, does not honor the content.

There was no thought put into the cover design (the image that Amazon posts for it on the Amazon.com is NOT the same that is delivered inline with the text, only the cover art) and the table of contents is a travesty.

Offbeat and improbable are key descriptors of this work. This is escapist fiction, but it inserts a bit of pop-philosophical content of the physics variety from time to time. The author has a distinctive ironic style that you'll either enjoy be annoyed by. This is a funny book, using the characters, common modern man and the elites to humorous effects.

Though funny on the outside it has a continuous undercurrent of satire and irony running alongside.The kind of book you could read over and over again without getting a wee bit bored.Arthur, a very normal guy has known Ford Prefect (one of the most ingenious but irritating characters ever created)for six years.One day Ford comes and tells Arthur that they are to leave the earth as soon as possible beacuse by a curious quirk of fate the earth is going to be demolished to make way for a hyperspace bypass.Arthur doesn't disbelieve him though and they hitch a ride on the Vogon ship as they watch the earth vapourize.This is followed by a series of wonderful adventures(?)that could only be devised by Douglas Adams.They get themselves into all kinds of situations and surprisingly get out of them . One feels though that the Author is a touch cynical about everything around him and implements his cynicism in his characters.The c! haracters are probably not very well defined with the exception of Arthur Dent who I guess everyone identifies with.Everyone else in the book is very wacky and all of them would be very good case studies for aspiring psychologists. All in all an excellent read and should not be missed by anyone."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I didn't enjoy the book a whole lot. I guess it was a guys book.

With our digital watches and all."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"When I was in high school, there were two types of people, the ones who were cool, and the ones who thought that the ones who were cool were were not that cool at all. I was caught in between. I, on the other hand, had first hand accounts of how the other one lived, died, and copulated with the other. It seemed as if I had an omnipotent position in the poitics of teen angst. Soon, I was to learn, that I myself was a pawn in the chess match we call puberty. In that confused state, I was introduced to the most informative, amusing, piece of literature, that any intelligent life form of any age could have been privy too stumble upon. The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy is the first and only reason I began to read. It was the first book that I became involved with, that I began to understand. Life, the universe and everything, meant more than words. Douglas Adams is a shaman, not in a religious manner, but in an intelligent, an understanding, and in the most human of emotions kind of way. Douglas Adams to me is a sort of father, in that he showed me the way to understanding, in a world that refuses to accept science and the understanding of truth. He to me is the messiah that so many ignorantly accept."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I will never get back the precious time I wasted reading this stupid book for my upcoming book club meeting.This was a &#34;best seller&#34;?

Out of the many books I have read and owned, this is definitely one of the greatest. The great characters, the hilarious storytelling and dialogue, the comical, strange situations, and Douglas Adams' unique talent make this a good read from start to finish. If you like comedy, science fiction, or any good book whatsoever, you will like this.P.S.- What's P.S. stand for anyway?"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Though I'd heard of this book for years I'd never read it until recently. I'd definitely characterize this book as Monty Python-like in its humor and approach. And, if you think about it, the original release of the book parallels those early Monty Python movies like the 'Life of Brian'. And, this book basically is about the meaning of life. I for one enjoy British humor and found this book to be a fun romp thru space. The author has a keen imagination and uses it well. The fun part about this book is that it is a fantasy and as such the author is given free reign to conjure up all sorts of silly and outlandish plots and schemes. However, I found that he wrapped the story with just enough \\"scientific\\" data that it bordered on the nearly, almost but not quite believeable. The improbability drive is one just such example. You can tell the author has fun making this journey up and you end up having fun being pulled along by some of the witty antics. At times I found myself laughing out loud about some of the dialog and insights given by the characters. Even the thought that mice rule the Earth does get one to thinking about \\"what ifs\\". I don't know that I'll continue on in the \\"trilogy\\" but I'm glad I read this one. It's a fun, light hearted read that is worth it."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy was just about the hippest book for a lot of us in the early 80's. The cult following begat a franchise of video games, radio programs and a TV series, all of which deal with this dry witted tale of Earthman Arthur Dent and his journey through the galaxy.I'm not sure if the book has aged as well as its most loyal fans would claim it has. Much of the humor that seemed edgy 20 years ago now seems outdated in a Weird Al sort of way. Nonetheless, any book that opens with the destruction of Earth can't be all bad.Following our famous cast of characters through the bizarre events that they mostly seem to have no control over is always a pleasure, even when it's a bit of a corny one. The dialogue is steeped in Adams' very British humor and has always seemed like the best thing about the series. The conversations between such oddball characters as Ford Prefect and galactic president/scoundrel Zaphod Beeblebrox are worth any lapses into the preposterous."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"interesteing read and concept though this novel has no real beginning, middle or end, a bit like outerspace. if your into over the top humor in sci fi form, pick it up and have fun."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"It is the best book ever and anyone who hasn't read it is a loony"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Book was misrepresented to attract buyers.Book was advertised as 1st edition and it was NOT.Also the image that was chosen for an item was absolutely misrepresentation (I'm talking about an autograph).Seller did not respond to my emails after the purchase.As I was looking at a book it had a price tag of $2.00 from used book store.It tells me that this person did not make an innocent mistake.I think everyone needs to be aware of this and think twice before dialing with this seller."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"First of all, let's get this straight. This isn't science fiction. It's social satire. And I'm afraid the satire has dated rather badly. Since Margaret Thatcher was ousted, putting the boot into the class gaffes of the newly trendy seems pointless. I no longer find it funny to joke about how seriously one takes going out to lunch (which, in the roaring eighties, WAS kinda funny, especially at the hands of skilled actors like those who did the radio shows). Adams writes very droll modern dialogue, but putting it in a book kinda takes away the punch. Adams was once script editor for Dr. Who, and I think HHGTTG harkens back to his luvvie days at the Beeb.For social satire that plays with the conventions of science fiction, get Harry Harrison's &quot;Star Smashers of the Galaxy Rangers&quot;. The aliens have much funnier names, too."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Sorry, but I don't get all the fuss. The book is episodic. The writing is sophomoric. And I get the impression that Adams was either one sick dude or doing heavy drugs. A summer read, only for the bored. Doesn't deserve the following it has. If you want comedic sci-fi, try Connie Willis."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book is hard to judge because it is not a book that makes you think, it is more of a leisure book that is fun to read. Adams is a good writer in that he moves fast and makes you anxious for what comes next, but there are not many themes and there is not much character development."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy book written by Douglas Adams is a book that I could not really recommend as a book focused around education specifically, however I can highly recommend it as a way to stay up late reading and apologizing to your roommate after he wakes up unexpectedly in the middle of the night from unexplainable laughter. The Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy is a book which incorporates some of the most brilliantly put together random event while all somehow making sense together in sequence. The theme of the entire book is put together from douglas's amusing imagination where some of the most hilarious scenarios scientifically fit together while integrating our current history and politics. While the book is extremely out there it is also put together in a way we can relate to it. All in all I would recommend this as a great fast read that you can continue on in the rest of the series if you desire."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"While the book seems to be wildly popular, I did not like it.I loved the beginning (about chapter 1-3), which were funny and witty. Yet during the travels through space I didn't consider very funny. While there was somewhat of a plot it seemed to be mostly pointless. However, there was a great twist in chapter 28 (or was it 29?); the book has only 35 chapters.Overall: good beginning and good end, but a waste of my time in the middle."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"As this outlandish story begins, earthling Arthur Dent, lying in front of a bulldozer about to demolish his house to make room for a byway, doesn't realize that finding a new home is the least of his worries. After convincing him to leave his post to share a drink, his unintentionally conspicuously-named alien (unbeknownst to Dent) friend of five years, Ford Prefect, plies him with drinks and then shares the big news - the earth is about to be demolished to make way for...an intergalactic byway. Fortunately, Prefect is able to save them both from demolition, after which they become space travel companions. Defying what appear to be insurmountable odds, the two are able to survive certain death and spend time with former acquaintances. During their journey they learn what Prefect has been missing during the 15 years he was stranded on earth, as well as the meaning of life and how the earth was first formed. A central part of the plot is the existence and content of the guide that Prefect was working on when he got stuck on earth, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. It contains helpful information on a variety of topics for galaxy travelers like this, (p 76) \\"Space...is big. Really big. You just won't believe how vastly hugely mind-bogglingly big it is.\\" This short novel provides a sometimes silly, frequently funny look at alien-human interaction but is probably better for fans of space-related science fiction than average readers. Similar: Stranger in a Strange Land by Robert Heinlein and Planet of the Apes by Pierre Boulle. Also good: The War of the Worlds by H.G. Wells."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Before you read this review, you should know that I am not a fan of science fiction. The only other book I've read that any reasonable person might claim is science fiction would be Sirens of Titan by Kurt Vonnegut. Any fan of sci fi will tell you that Vonnegut isn't actually a science fiction writer. He's a satirist.I decided to read the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy because of its popularity. For the uninitiated (and I'm barely initiated) the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy was originally a radio show on BBC. The first novel (which I am reviewing here) was based on portions of the radio show (although Adams mixed the order of things up when he set down to write the novels). Other novels followed until there were four (the trilogy of four). Some years later a fifth book was added to the series. There has also been a movie, record albums, a TV show and so. It gets confusing because the novels, TV shows, and movies of the same name, mix and jumble the order and content of the original radio show. To further complicate things, the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy title is often used to describe the entire series of novels not just this one.Like I said, Sci Fi is not my thing, but this novel isn't serious science fiction, it's inspired lunacy (I didn't make that up - I read it somewhere, but it's true. The novel has a \`Monty Python like quality'. I especially enjoyed many of the little diversions from the main plot (like the tale of the warrior-like planet that attacks the earth but fails to take scale into consideration and are inadvertently swallowed by a small dog).It's something of a mystery to me though why this novel is such a sensation. Sure, it's amusing, but in an inconsequential way. I liked it, found it quite funny , but I have to wonder if it deserves such high praise and loyalty. I can't say this light hearted romp deserves much more than 3 stars.Personally, I prefer Vonnegut's Sirens of Titan."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I thought this book was a really good book.The only reasons why I started reading the series is because I saw the movie.

The story itself is an A..but if don't get this if you already have it...nothing is special about it at all."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"My initial reaction to The Hitchhiker&#8217;s Guide to the Galaxy was that Douglas Adams tries to mask the book&#8217;s sheer stupidity and lack of plot with big words and other nonsense that seem to be attempts at humor. The novel was completely devoid of plot, making the reader ready to put it down after only a few chapters. It was also rather confusing at some points and the reader is led to believe many occurrences of improbable events that are explained as intentional because of the &#8220;improbability drive&#8221; in the main characters&#8217; space ship.The Hitchhiker&#8217;s Guide to the Galaxy severely lacks plot. The story focuses on the travels of four unlikely comrades and their morose robot, Marvin. The entire plot of the story can be summarized in a few sentences: The two characters from Earth get a ride on a spaceship, seconds before the Earth is destroyed, only to be kicked off of the ship into open space. Conveniently, they are picked up by a stolen ship powered by an &#8220;improbability drive&#8221;, hence the convenience of the Earthlings&#8217; pickup.... The book is pointless and has really no theme, symbolism, or any of the elements of literature that are to be expected in a novel.There is also surprisingly frequent use of common grammatical errors such as missing commas, misplaced modifiers, and sentence fragments. The grammar in the book makes it hard to respect the author much for his writing ability. There also seems to be large words used where they are unnecessary that just seem to be attempts to make the book seem better and the author smarter.One thing I liked about the book was the author&#8217;s use of the character Marvin, the eternally depressed robot programmed only to make lives miserable. Although Marvin was rather annoying, he accurately represents and criticizes people who act very much like him. Marvin was so depressing in fact that he saved the heroes lives by talking to another machine, making it feel compelled to kill itself. Obviously, Marvin is an exaggeration of people who only see the bad side of things, but he still brought forth thoughts of how people could be like that.Overall, The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy was a rather poor piece of literature that seemed to be more of a waste of time than an enjoyable novel. Douglas Adams shadows some aspects of the real world, but the poor writing, lack of plot, and undeveloped characters made the book less interesting and made it harder to notice a theme or relation to my life."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I do not understand why people love this book. Or why they think it's funny. It's just so boring. There's no plot, there's no character development, and the characters are one-dimensional anyway.The entire story can be summed up in one sentence: The Earth is destroyed, and Arthur is saved by Ford Prefect, who is an alien researching Earth.Woo, what an exciting plot. Honestly, I'd rather be on the Earth when it was destroyed than go on this boring adventure.However, it's obviously a cult classic, and I guess it's just one of those books that everyone must read at least once in their lifetime. And finally I've been able to understand a lot of sayings and jokes that I've been hearing for all these years and not knowing where they came from. :)"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"\\"The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy\\"By Douglas AdamsPublished by Pocket BooksCopyrighted 1979?Confusion?\\"A towel, it says, is the most massively useful thingan intersteller hitchhicker can have\\" If you thoughtthat was confusing, then this book will be justthat..... confusing.I'm not much of a reader in the first place, but Iread this book about half way through and I didn'tunderstand it that much.

I like books that lay down the groundrules and live by them, that it the true mark of a good book."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Even though this book was very funny, there wasn't much point to it. The book moves very quickly and doesn't leave much room for character and plot development. There are four main characters and none of them have well-developed personalities.

Its only redeeming quality is that, while I found it to be boring, uninteresting, and at best marginally funny on occasion, it was a very fast read, so at least I didn't waste a lot of time on it, or just give it up entirely. Right up until the end, I didn't care about the characters or what happened to them. I can think of at least two dozen books written in the 20th century that were better written, with better plots, characterization, and, for some, even humor. If you think a book is &quot;good&quot; because it's trendy and popular, by all means, this is THE book for you; but if you're interested in quality literature -- something of more substance, meaning, and purpose than you'll find on the magazine rack at your local convenience store -- &quot;Hitchhiker's&quot; is something to avoid."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I suppose this book is written for a different type of reader than I am.

Adams has gone into writing this book with no story, no caracters and no plot. This is the only reason why Douglas Adams is the finest writer ever. He has what most other sci-fi writters don't, and that is the abillity to keep a reader interested without having to introduce a multitude of caracters or having to fil the book with scientific babble ( Arthur.c.Clark, David Brin).

It has anything you may even dream about finding in a comedy book. It has missiles, sperm whales, potted plants, people with two heads, and these all just happen to be on the same page. When reading this you are nearly guaranteed nonstop laughter. Well I can't say nonstop, because you have to breathe at some point. This may sound an overstatement but I do not believe that it is. My parents banned me from reading this book after dark because I kept them up at night.Now some of the humor may seem a bit childish but we all have to be a little childish at times lest we go crazy, and act really childish all the time. This book is nearly unbearably clean humor, in a good way. It proves that toilet humor is most definitely outdone by nonsensical humor.I don't believe that you can just take the word of some random stranger and go read a book so what I would recommend you do is go to your local library, find this book, get some help if you need it, check it out, drive home and read. Don't buy this book because, you know, not every book is for everyone. This is how to read books and find out what you like. And if you like this book, tell someone. They will be happy to hear it."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I would rate this as one of the funniest books I have ever read. It to me was clearly way up there along with Wodehouse. The comedy of Douglas Adams is difficult to categorise as satire or pun. It has satire and puns, however i think his books do more. Douglas Adams makes you laugh using parts of brain whose existance you may not even have been aware of previously. Reading this book was to me like getting hooked on to some strange device which would trigger those areas of brain responsible for laughing which the other books and movies have missed. The ridiculousness of some of the ideas in this book and (most of the) series is unbelievable. The humour can be a bit nerdy and I guess hard to understand. However all in all it is a must read."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"When I was in elementary school, this was a common series read by the male nerds and geeks in my school. After reading it, I can now see how much it shaped their speech patterns and writing styles. I found myself smiling as clouds of nostalgia unexpectedly overtook me while reading the series. I was also surprised to find phrases original to this series that have worked their way into the American culture. For example, in order to understand people who speak other languages, the characters in this series simply put a &quot;Babelfish&quot; in their ear. In real life, Babel Fish is a language translation program available on the internet. Since the book it appears in was published in 1979, there's no question of which came first.THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXYWe find out that the earth was actually created as an organic supercomputer with the sole purpose of determining the answer to life, the universe and everything. Arthur Dent finds himself whisked away from the earth only moments before the earth is destroyed to make way for a intergalactic bypass highway. Unfortunately, this is right before the earth was to have computed the answer to the question. He and Ford (an alien that has been marooned on earth) hitch a ride on the unsuspecting spacecraft that has just caused the destruction of the earth. They continue their hitchhiking journey throughout the galaxy to a ship called the Heart of Gold (which is actually a stolen vehicle). There, they meet with a series of unlikely coincidences thanks to the ship's Infinite Improbability Drive.The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy ends as the Heart of Gold heads for a bite to eat at the Restaurant at the End of the Universe.This series is bizarre comic sarcasm at its best. A smile automatically paints itself on your face as you begin to read. The series reads like a highly improbable dream sequence. I sort of wonder if the author had any conclusion in mind when he wrote it or if he just let the story write itself (not unlike a dream)."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"At any given point during reading, I've been either 1) wondering how the author would clear-up the complicated situation he had created in the preceding chapter, or 2) laughing out loud on some seemingly logical, mostly innocuous, but totally nonsense sentences. Dull moments were rare, and fickle as human brains are, even in those moments I found myself cooking up some nonsensical variation on Adams' play-of-words. My only regret is re. the depressed robot Marvin. Though it was initially delightful to imagine a sentient, melancholy machine, in my view Marvin's level of conversation never reached those of the other main characters (Arthur, Ford, Zaphod, Trillian). Marvin kept on wearing the same depressed mold over and over and remained annoying, whereas the other characters remained maddeningly annoying!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Sporting the words \\"Dont Panic\\" in large friendly letters the cover to the hitchikers guide conceals such important information as how to see the wonders of the universe for less than 30 altarian dollars a day, how to mix a Jynnin Tonnyx,and which alcoholic games are the most popular the hitchikers Guide to the Galaxy Is an elaborate Textbook reference to anything and everything conceiveable...and quite abit that is beyond our comprehension.

As for Douglas 'hating' his own books and characters...well, forgive me if I'm a mite dubious. Throughout the books he shows a genuine love for his creations, especially the oft-confused Englishman Arthur Dent and the delightfully odd Ford Prefect. To call these books anything less than a masterpiece of wit is not only an insult to the text, but an insult to one of the greatest comic minds of the 20th century. So he hated his works?? Interesting, since he wrote little else. If he were to denounce Hitchhiker he would basically be dismissing himself as an author.But all retaliatory remarks aside, this book (and all the sequels) is an absolute triumph of the ludicrous over reason, a battle that I wage daily.

The Hitchhiker's Guide is a witty and hilarious trip that begins with the Earth's untimely destruction for an interstelar bypass. Fortunately, our hero, Arthur Dent, narrowly escapes with his friend, who unbenounced to him, if from a planet near Betelgeuse. Adams' humor ranges from situational to a play on words to social commentary to downright silly. Sometimes, he gets them all going at once.

After being picked up, they have a very wild journey through time and space. I would suggest to the readers that if you do not understand what Ford Prefect is saying, or any other alien, that you continue reading because it will either explain its self or it is not important. I read this book and the following 4 books in a volume called \\"The Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.\\" I would recommend that you either be prepared to have all 5 books or buy the volume with all 5 books, since each one leads into the next.

I came to this book and thought, how is it possible to do science fiction at the same time as satire? And, as I found out through reading, it was quite simple. The first thing that sticks out in my mind as amusing was that Adams completely threw out the rule book on grammar in book-writing, and just went with whatever fit him. It was such a bizzare break from the norm that it felt quite good, and was also, as a result of making up rules, quite amusing.Furthermore, the work he did with the characters was quite good. Sure, they were still shallow enough to see the pits by the end of the book, but considering it left enough to be desired to buy the next book at the same time as giving enough to fit in the original, that's forgivable. And really, they were all extremes, except for the humans, weren't they? That made it all the more funny, to me.If you don't trust me, which is entirely possible, trust the other 400+ people that have already posted reviews. Surely that many people unanimously can't be that wrong about a judgement.............. or maybe they can, in the wrong Universe...RIP DNA :-("},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I read this book several months ago to fulfill an independent reading requirement for my high school English class. Being the type of person who doesn't really read much, this was something that I was not too excited about doing. I ended up taking a trip down to the library and basically grabbing a book at random. That book was The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. What really amazed me was the fact that I actually enjoyed reading this book. Since then I have even gone on to read the rest of the &quot;Trilogy&quot;. I think that what really got me hooked on this book was the author's, unique writing style. The best way to describe this is to take a look at the first page of the book.&quot;This planet has - or rather had - a problem, which was this: most of the people living on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time. Many solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these were largely concerned with the movements of small green pieces of paper, which is odd because on the whole it wasn't the small green pieces of paper that were unhappy. And so the problem remained; lots of the people were mean, and most of them were miserable, even the ones with the digital watches. Many were increasingly of the opinion that they'd all made a big mistake in coming down from the trees in the first place. And some said that even the trees had been a bad move, and that no one should ever have left the ocean. And then, one Thursday, nearly 2000 years after one man had been nailed to a tree for saying how great it would be to be nice to people for a change, a girl sitting on her own in a small cafe in Rickmansworth suddenly realized what it was that had been going wrong all this time, and she finally knew how the world could be made a good and happy place. This time it was right, it would work, and no one would have to get nailed to anything. Sadly, however, before she could get to a phone to tell anyone about it, a terrible, stupid catastrophe occurred, and the idea was lost forever. This is not her story. But it is the story of that terrible, stupid catastrophe and some of its consequences.&quot; (1)While it is obvious that the author is trying to be comical, if one is to dig a little deeper it can also be seen that Douglas Adams manages to introduce many of our society's different social problems such as technology, economics, evolution and religion. It is typical for his writing to criticize everything in a skeptical and humorous way. But at the same time he never presents any concrete solutions to the problems he deals with. He leaves it up to the reader to decide whether or not it is something they are concerned with. I think that this is important as it allows for each reader to use their imagination and see the story from their own perspective.His humorous style lies in his objectivity. He doesn't come right out and say, &quot;money doesn't cause happiness&quot;, and instead he says that people are always concerned about the movement of small green pieces of paper. Douglas Adams just suggests as to what is going on and leaves it up to the reader to figure things out for themselves. He also uses the example of digital watches in order to criticize technology, which is something that we are very proud of. But if you think about it, you become aware that he isn't actually criticizing digital watches, he is criticizing the whole technology, which is in his opinion not the great thing that we think it is.Another reason I liked these books so much is that you can read the books over and over again, and each time you manage to find something that you did not notice before. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is so full of jokes. He always manages to find a twisted and unexpected solution to the problem at hand and really keeps the reader baffled as to what will happen next. He looks at things in an original and very interesting manner. For example, he makes fun of the fact that the human race thinks that they are the most intelligent beings on earth, and explains that this isn't quite right. He says that the most intelligent beings are the mice, then the dolphins, and humans are only the third most intelligent beings. The mice are in fact responsible for the construction of the Earth, in order to find the question to the answer of the Meaning of Life, Universe and Everything. Humans used them as laboratory experiments but they actually just used us, not as we thought that we used them. Now to someone not familiar with the book this seems rather strange and doesn't make much sense, but somehow all of it manages to fit together.Overall, I think that this book really helped to open my eyes as to just how creative and interesting a good book can be. It may not be a classic in the true sense of the word, but it was something that I truly enjoyed and that is not something I can claim about many books."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I actually don't read books very often but I read this one seven times now and I still can't help laughing out loud every time I read it again. Also, a very good Dutch translation is available."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Ever a fan of the late great Douglas Adams, I would like to add along with my fellow reviewers who gave this novel 5 stars that it is one of the more imaginative stories ever thought out, and indeed one of the oddest. It is quite hilarious and Mr. Adams was one of the few science fiction writers who could insert some real-life humor into his work. While you read about Arthur Dent whizzing around space in a most improbable ship, his experiences and feelings are instantly recognizable.Perhaps some people don't get it. It's on many schools' summer reading lists and kids might be expecting Homer or Shakespeare instead of some good laughs. But the laughs certainly aren't at the expense of your intellect. These aren't stupid jokes. Perhaps that's why not everybody gets them."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I must admit I am one of the many Hitchiker Nuts out there. I have read the book, re read and then re re read it over and over. In fact I have read it so many times that I am currently in the process of getting my 3rd copy of it! As for the book itself..it is bizzare, strange and altogether confusing. My advice when reading it for the first time is to remember what Adams says at the start of it where he talks about where he came up with the idea of for it...being drunk in a field. Just kind of look at the book through that approach and maybe it will make sense. If not read it again, keep reading it til you get it and then move onto the next one and so on. And of course...dont forget to ask WHAT THE ULTIMATE QUESTION IN FACT IS!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I found this book to be very entertaining. Douglas Adams did a brilliant job carrying the reader along with his absurd style of writing. In fact, at times the book gets so absurd that it's hard to follow. But I still recommend it as a great read.Basically the book is about two friends that live on earth. Arthur Denton and Ford Perfect. Ford Perfect (who is actually an alien) reveals to Arthur that the world is going to end. Not long after their conversation, a Vogon spaceship appears and announces that earth will be destroyed shortly because it is in the way of a new intergalactic highway bypass that is being built through our galaxy. Ford and Arthur manage to board the ship before the earth is demolished, and they are quickly discovered.The Vogon ship ejects them into space and they get picked up by another ship called the \\"Heart of Gold\\" which houses the Infinite Improbability Drive. They travel to the planet Magrathea to figure out what to do about their non-existent planet earth. And they learn that earth was really a giant organic computer that was working on finding the meaning of life. But 5 minutes before the program was done the Vogons destroyed it. Ah, the irony!But I don't want to give anymore away so I'll leave you with that. This book is great for all ages and hard to put down the whole way through."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"No matter how many times I read The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and I've read it quite a few times already, it never fails to thrill me and induce bouts of almost uncontrollably hearty laughter. With this novel, Douglas Adams gave life to a phenomenon that will long outlive his tragically short life, delighting millions of readers for untold years to come. I'm not sure if science fiction had ever seen anything like this before 1979. This is science fiction made to laugh at itself while honoring its rich tradition, but it is much more than that. Adams' peculiarly dead-on humor also draws deeply from the well of sociology, philosophy, and of course science. Whenever Adams encountered a sacred cow of any sort, he milked it dry before moving on. Beneath the surface of utter hilarity, Adams actually used his sarcasm and wit to make some rather poignant statements about this silly thing called life and the manner in which we are going about living it. This is one reason the book is so well-suited for multiple readings-a high level of enjoyment is guaranteed each time around, and there are always new insights to be gained from Adams' underlying, oftentimes subtle, ideas and approach.Arthur Dent is your normal human being, and so he naturally is more concerned about his house being knocked down than facing the fact that the world is about to end. His friend Ford Prefect, he comes to learn, is actually a researcher from a planet somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse, but before he can even begin to comprehend this fact, he finds himself zipped up into the confines of the Vogon space cruiser that has just destroyed the planet Earth. Things become even trickier for him when he discovers the great usefulness of sticking a Babel fish into his ear and then meets the singular President of the Galaxy Zaphod Beeblebrox and his shipmate Trillian, both of whom Arthur actually met months before at a party. Such impossible coincidences are explained by the fact that Beeblebrox's ship is powered by the new Infinite Improbability Drive. Dent grows more and more confused during his travels on board the Heart of Gold, and the story eventually culminates with an amazing visit to an astronomically improbable world.Much of the humor here is impossible to describe; this novel must be read to be appreciated. It seems like every single line holds a joke of some kind within it. The characters are also terrific: the unfortunate Arthur Dent, who basically has no idea what is going on; Ford Prefect, Arthur's remarkable friend from Betelgeuse; Zaphod Beeblebrox, with his two heads, three arms, and cavalier attitude; Trillian the lovely Earth girl who basically flies the Heart of Gold; Slartibartfast the planet builder and fjord-make extraordinaire; and my favorite character of all, Marvin the eternally depressed robot. Life-\\"loathe it or ignore it, you can't like it\\" is the Paranoid Android's philosophy. One brilliant thing that Adams does is to step away from the action every so often to present interesting facts about the universe as recorded in the Hitchhiker's Guide; here we learn about Vogon poetry, the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal, Trans Galactic Gargle Blasters, and other fascinating tidbits about life in the crazy universe Adams created. He even gives the reader the ultimate answer to the question of Life, the Universe, and Everything in these pages.This novel is just an amazingly hilarious read that will leave you yearning for more; to our great fortune, Adams indeed left us more in the form of four subsequent books in the Hitchhiker's \\"trilogy.\\" If you don't like science fiction, it doesn't matter; read this book just for the laughs. The most amazing thing about Adams' humor is the fact that everyone seems to \\"get\\" it. Adams broke all the rules in writing a novel quite unlike any that had come before it, and he succeeded in spades. This may well be the funniest novel ever written."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Since there are many reviews of the book itself, I thought someone should review the audio versions independently. There are two versions of this title in audio format, the dramatized edition, which is abridged, and the version read by the author, which is unabridged; I have both! I you are a fan of the dramatized versions of books please be sure before you buy which version you are getting. I enjoyed both the dramatized version and the version read by Douglas Adams himself as each has its own pros and cons.The Dramatized version, done by the BBC (or at least the version that I have is), is very well done, as are all of the BBC dramatizations. The cast does a fantastic job as does the special effects team on the sounds. Be aware that dramatized versions are typically abridged, which is not a big problem generaly but some people don't care for it. This version was originally released as a multiple part radio program so if you are familiar with that format you have a good idea of this version. The only drawbacks are the it is in an outmoded format (cassette) and that it is abridged.The unabridged spoken version is read by the author, Douglas Adams, and is very good. This is a special treat since he has passed on. I enjoy the ability to hear the author's concept of how the story should read in his own voice. This version has a permanent home on my iPod so that anytime I need a little boost, I can queue it up. It is easy to listen to and quite enjoyable but if you are used to the dramatized versions of audio books you may find that it takes 5 or 10 minutes to get used to the single voice. It is worth it though!I would recommend either audio version to anyone that commutes or has at least thirty minutes of free time at a stretch. Both versions are well done and are enjoyable to listen to. For anyone who has not experienced audio books before, I would recommend a good tile like this to start off with."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"With the passing of Douglas Adams on Friday 5/11/2001, I picked up this book after quite a number of years and gave it a good ol' read....and you know what... this novel will forever be poignant, witty and downright entertaining. I laughed all over again. I mean, I really laughed. I'm going to miss Douglas.Douglas wasn't just at the forefront of comedy-sci-fi....he basically created the genre. My only regret, along with quite a number of fans, is that we shall never again relish in the adventures of Arthur Dent and the gang. No more Vogon poetry. No more Pan Galactic Gargleblasters. No more Babel fish. No more tongue-twisting names. Therein lies the real shame.New readers to Douglas Adams, take heart! Each of the novels that make up this series are all fantastic tales! If you own a copy of Hitchhiker's, you hold in your hands a classic! Cherish it always and read it as it was intended.... as a truly light-hearted romp through the cosmos.Take a look at some of the reviews listed here. Over four hundred people can't be wrong. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is without a doubt one of the greatest books of all time by a quirky and innovative author. (We'll just have to forgive him for wearing a digital watch.)Thank-you Douglas for the fun and adventures. You were one of a kind. May we one day meet at the Restaurant at the End of the Universe. The first round's one me. I'll bring the towel.A classic. A gem. You must own this novel."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I'm probably treading on thin ice here, talking about a revered piece of pop culture. When I was in college, Douglas Adams had a cult following that knew all the jokes and could quote them to each other.I find myself in a middle ground. I was first exposed to Hitchhiker's Guide when it ran as a BBC radio serial (I heard it on NPR, I think). It got a some laughs out of me, and I enjoyed it, but it didn't inspire in me the kind of devotion that it did in other geeks.Having read the first book, I have to say the radio series is my favorite presentation of this material. Playing as a serial, the gags were front and center, the serial format left the listener with the impression that there was a lot more to come and ensured that Adams didn't overstay his welcome. Read as a novel, the book seems a little pointless. Adams wouldn't know a narrative arc if it hit him.That said, a lot of the jokes are still funny. Adams was a vocal atheist, and at his best he has the satiric touch of a Voltaire. Evenhanded, he enjoys skewering atheists in his book: Oolon Coluphid, the atheist writer that Adams posits as \\"the author of philosophical blockbusters,\\" seems quite pretentious and silly, at least in his choice of book titles.Occasionally, there is a true insight that is nicely played for a joke. My favorite revolves around the babelfish, a fish that is used a universal translator. When a babelfish is placed in one's hear, one can hear and understand the words spoken by another, regardless of the original language spoken. The end of Adams digression on the babelfish ends with the acidly ironic observation that the babelfish is responsible for more wars than any other species in the universe.(John Durham Peters, author of Speaking into the Air: A History of the Idea of Communication, makes the point that we often hold an implicitly utopian view of communication, believing that differences between people will automatically be resolved with better communication, whereas sometimes the truth is the opposite: the better two groups of people understand each other, the less they like each other.)I place Adams in the same category as Kurt Vonnegut. They're both writers that have a special appeal to the young, to high school and college age readers. They both write satirical, absurdist fiction which skewer traditional beliefs and middle class norms. Adams tends to be more detached, more bemused, less pointed, passionate, and angry than Vonnegut. In some ways, that makes him easier to take. On the other hand, I don't think he's as compelling, for the same reason."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"In The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Douglas Adams uses humor and sarcasm against a backdrop of science fiction to create a comic masterpiece. The main character in the book is Arthur Dent. He is miraculously rescued from Earth just moments before it is destroyed to make way for an interstellar bypass. His rescuer is Ford Prefect, a researcher for The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy who has been stranded on Earth for the past fifteen years. Unfortunately, the only ship available to escape on belongs to the Vogons who throw out the two hitchhikers when they discover them on the ship only after reciting horrible poetry to them. This should have been the end of these two adventurers, but by an amazingly improbable event, they are rescued by the starship Heart of Gold. This event was caused by the revolutionary propulsion system on the ship called the Infinite Improbability Drive, which makes the improbable probable. The occupants of the ship are Zaphod Beeblebrox, President of the Imperial Galactic Government who had recently stolen the Heart of Gold, Trillian, a woman originally from Earth and Zaphod's companion, and Marvin, an extremely intelligent and depressed robot. The party travels to the long lost planet of Magrathea where planets were once manufactured for the extremely wealthy. Zaphod believes that inside they will find countless riches, but are surprised to discover that it is still inhabited. Inside, Arthur discoveries many amazing things, such as the answer to life, the universe, and everything is forty-two, and the planet earth was manufactured as a computer to discover what the actual question to the answer is. The characters in the book are well developed. Arthur is the clueless one who is struggling to understand the events which have happened to him. Ford is the accomplished hitchhiker who answers Arthur's questions with responses which are so insane that they more often than not cause more confusion. Zaphod is a two-headed creature in search of adventure and Trillian is an intelligent and capable woman from earth. Through these characters, we learn to take ourselves a little less seriously. Although this book is full of humor, it also contains other aspects. It satirizes such subjects as capitalism, government, large corporations, organized religion, and militarism. The writing is full of irony and biting sarcasm as well. Adams' atheistic worldview is also displayed through his writing. I believe that Douglas Adams managed to write an excellent book which contains many strengths with very few weaknesses. This book is extremely funny and can be enjoyed as long as the reader is not expecting a serious sci-fi epic. The only possible weakness in the book is that the plot can become confusing at times. This, however, helps the reader relate to what Arthur is experiencing and eventually everything becomes clear if the reader pays attention. Overall, this is a fantastic book which is highly entertaining while still making some intelligent comments on life, the universe, and everything."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"It is fitting that this audio adaptation of Douglas Adams' The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy was voiced by actor Stephen Fry. Fry was a close friend of the late Mr. Adams, and he also narrates the new H2G2 movie as the voice of the Book. Fry does a great job of making this classic novel come alive, drawing the listener into the story. This audiobook makes a great tribute to Douglas Adams and the world and characters he created in the H2G2 universe."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"\\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\" is a thoroughly strange book, that at the same time is oddly charming. It starts in a really weird way, with the demolition of Earth (yes, our planet) in order to build a interestellar highway. Only one man survives the end of our world: an Englishman, Arthur Dent. Arthur is saved from sure death by one of his friends, Ford Prefect, that also happened to be an alien doing some research for \\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\" (an electronic book that \\"tells you everything you need to know about anything\\", and that specially highlights the need for a towel).Ford got a lift for them with a Vogon spaceship, where they would soon be subjected to a danger worse than death: Vogon poetry. Anyway, as nothing bad last forever, there were soon ejected into space to suffer certain and painful death, only to be rescued again just in time to begin their adventures.Both Ford and Arthur are interesting characters, but I found Arthur's whining particularly funny. For example, and in his own words to Ford: \\"you are talking about a positive mental attitude and you haven't even had your planet demolished today. I woke up this morning and thought I'd have a nice relaxed day, do a bit of reading, brush the dog... It is now just after four in the afternoon and I am already being thrown out of an alien spaceship six light-years from the smoking remains of the Earth!\\".There are other characters and things you will find interesting, like an eternally depressed robot (life, \\"loathe it or ignore it, you can't like it\\"), Zaphod Beeblebrox, and the Babel fish (capable of translating any language in the galaxy if you put them in your ear). There are also some scenes that appear out of the blue, but that are quite enchanting. For instance \\"Arthur blinked at the screens and felt he was missing something important. Suddenly he realized what it was. - Is there any tea on this spaceship?-he said\\".On the whole, I highly recommend this book. Its premise is extremely original, and you will have lots of fun reading it. If you can, buy it know, and be ready to meet the mice * :)Belen Alcat (* = you will understand that phrase only after reading this book!!!)"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Setting the ultimate questions of life, physics, and digital watches against a backdrop of science fiction, Douglas Adams successfully creates an amusing and thought-provoking story that is considered a must-read by millions. Arthur Dent, the fortunate Earthling who has been miraculously rescued from the destruction of Earth with the help from some friendly Dentrassi cooks, acts as the readers alter ego due to his complete lack of knowledge concerning the universe. Arthur asks the same questions that we would ask, should we be in his position. The majority of the answers about the universe obviously come from Ford Prefect's copy of &quot;The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy&quot;. Within this manuel, Douglas Adam's provides the reader with a brilliantly shaped world which lives within his imagination. The most clever aspect, however, is the fact that Adams has a rational explanation for each of the entries in the guide. For instance, he explains for a page and a half why putting a Babel fish in one's ear allows the brain to understand every language in the universe. In addition to his wonderful imagination, Douglas Adams must also be praised for his humorous treatment of the major questions of life. When asked the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything, Deep Thought(the second greatest computer in the Universe of Time and Space), comes up with the very simple and unexpected answer of &quot;forty-two&quot;. Adams plays off of the reader's inquisitive nature by building up the suspense and finally showing them that in order to know answers, you must understand the questions. This is an amazing journey through philosophical experimentation that the reader will never forget."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The thing that is most improbable about this book is that its critical mass can be contained within 216 slim pages, albeit sandwiched between slightly denser covers, without blasting itself to smithereens of funny matter and dispersing these all over the galaxy.It all begins with Arthur Dent wallowing in the mud to prevent the destruction of his house, while galactic bureaucratic wheels are cranking out much bigger misguided projects.By coincidence, his pal Ford Prefect just happens to be a researcher for the extremely useful book \\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\", and having been stranded on earth for fifteen years, is anxious to hitch a ride on the next passing saucer.Meanwhile, in a galaxy far, far away, Zaphod Beeblebrox, totally powerless figure-head President of the Imperial Galactic Government, is wending his merry way to what will be the most unforgettable launching of a unique spaceship.Discarding and disregarding his prepared speech, he pauses to acknowledge Trillian, a hot chick that he picked up at a party on another planet, thereby irritating the heck out of the attending party hacks, who are obviously unaware of the uncontrollable misbehavior of Presidents when it comes to hot chicks.Arthur and Ford Prefect manage to hitch a ride shortly before ground zero, and after enduring some Vogon poetry (third worst in the Universe), they get chucked out of an airlock with only a lungful of air to fly on.Thanks to Trillian, and Zaphod's amazing technicolor Infinite Improbability Drive, our heroes are rescued from certain doom - or are they? A fugitive, a hot chick and a manic depressive robot do not usually make for happy endings, even with a little improbability thrown in.The adventure continues as they learn the simple answer to the great question of Life, The Universe, and Everything, only to realize that they don't know the question.Going now to fix me a Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster, and start the second of the increasingly inaccurately named Hitchhiker's Trilogy. I've already got my massively useful towel packed, and my fish in my ear. Join me?Amanda Richards, March 5, 2005"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I would have never picked this book for myself. Science fiction? Space travel? Um, no. Time warps, charming aliens with two heads, and improbability spaceships are not my usual reading. Yet I loved this book. The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, by Douglas Adams, is one of the most fantastic, funny, and inconceiveably creative books I've ever read. From the moment Zaphod, a unique character with two heads, steals the most famous spaceship in the galaxy, things happen quickly and with seemingly little connection to any event. That's the beauty of this book though: all events, no matter how random, are tied together in a humorous, deliciously complex way. Every character has its own distinct personality that draws you into the book even more. From Marvin The melancholy Marsian to beautiful and brilliant earthwoman Trillian, this book has everything. Which just goes to explain why it's one of the most sought-after collector's books. If you want to read a deep, romantic, drama this is not the book for you. However, if you're in the mood for a good laugh pick up this book. Even if you don't normally like science fiction, you'll get a kick out of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The entree of a seven course meal must encompass all the qualities of the other seven courses. It must have the type of humor that fills your stomach and makes your body shake. It must bite of spicy satire along with an aftertaste of irony. It must be refreshingly original. Up until this point, I have been tempted by Vonnegut, inhebriated by T. Robbins, shocked by H Thompson, humbled by J Carroll, spiritually lifted by Pirsig, and tricked by Faulkner. The one who combined most of these qualities in my inflated opinion is Douglas Adams. He will sorely be missed."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I have also been compelled to write a review of this masterpiece of a book with Douglas Adams' passing. It is a true shame.But on to happier topics: the book! It is fantastic! I don't know how many times I have read and reread that book. And the best part about it, is that one never gets tired of it.

The hilarous situation and comedic dialogue (sharpened by Adams' ever-present wit) are massively entertaining and serve to make the book a quick, enjoyable romp. You can read this in a day because you won't want to put it down. As light-hearted and funny as it is however, it also has some serious undertones. Some of Adams' comments on the human condition have a dead-on accuracy that shine through the thinly-veiled comedic pretentions. This book is a must-read for all of these reasons. And besides, where else can you find the meaning to Life, The Universe, and Everything?"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Being a voracious reader, I can honestly say that is one of the best pieces of work that I have ever read.

I first read this book sometime in the '80's and every time I reread it I uncover new jewels from the prose.The language is expressive in a way most contemporary fiction simply isn't. The analogies are strange and surprising and wonderful. Instead of merely being words on a page, this book has a such a distinctive, lighthearted voice that it allows a person to almost hear the author speak.To be sure, this is not a science fiction novel in the normal sense. The reader is not expected to wonder at the majesty of fantastic cities reaching to the skies where, within, the reader is fascinated by all manner of wonderful inventions. This is a book of everyday life extrapolated to an entire galaxy. Yes, there are interesting doodads interspersed, but they do not serve the &quot;Wowwee&quot; factor so much as the idea of &quot;Yep, that's what a large corporation would make, all right.&quot; For people who like to believe in benevolent galactic empires and the eventual triumph of logic in all endeavors, the mishmash conglomeration of nonsensical entities and the triumph of bureaucracy over common sense will frustrate their idea of what science fiction is supposed to be. This ain't the Foundation Series.Yes, it is silly, strange, and seemingly inane, but everything follows its own bizarrely congruous logic that allows the reader to suspend their disbelief and enjoyably follow along in a world that makes it own nonsensical sense.I suppose the humor could be called Pythonesque since I have to guess that anybody who does not enjoy Monty Python would not enjoy this book. However, for people who enjoy vivid language, entertaining characters, quick and witty humor and a plot that is truly original, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I don't know what to say about Douglas Adams except; that cat really knows where his towel is. This book is just plain funny, and it will soothe your science fiction needs as well. After reading so many science fiction stories about what alien life might be like, here is a universe which is not only teaming with alien life, but it turns out that most of that life is every bit as flawed, and often ridiculous, as life here on Earth. Which in a strange way makes you feel OK about the whole thing. In an infinite universe anything is possible; it takes an author like Adams to suggest (as he does in one of the stories) that the natural wind patterns of one planet results in the landscape being eroded over time into nothing but expensive hotels and casinos. ANYthing can happen, not any plausible thing - even if you aren't a science fiction fan, I think you'll still enjoy this."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a great book for people who not only like science fiction, but like humorous novels too. Douglas Adams throws in a mix of humor and irony in a science fiction setting,and that's what I personally like about the book. For example, you have to laugh at Arthur Dent who is upset that his house is being demolished, when little does he know that his planet will be demolished shortly afterward. The Hitchhiker's Guide also makes comments about the human race that aren't just funny, but also make you think as well. My favorite quote from this book is, &quot;This planet has-or rather had-a problem, which was this: most of the people living on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time. Many solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these were largely concerned with the movements of small green pieces of paper, which is odd because on the whole it wasn't the small green pieces of paper that were unhappy.&quot; I've read it 3 or 4 times this year since I bought it. This book is a definite must read! If you like the Hitchhiker's Guide then I recommend you read the sequels too because the story doesn't end when you finish the book. When I finished the Hitchhiker's Guide for the first time, I had to run out to the book store and buy the next book. Now I'd have to say that that Douglas Adams is my favorite author and I hope other people become fans too."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"If you're looking for a book with a deep and meaningful plot, lengthy setting or description, or in fact much logic to it at all, keep going. This is not the cult classic that you're looking for.If you're instead in search of incredible humor, a dash of surrealism, characters you'll never forget, and lines that it seems half the country can quote by heart, then you're in the right place. Congratulations. Pull up a chair and down these three pints of bitter quickly, before the world can end.HGTTG does have meaning; it does have messages--but no, the plot isn't really the point. This is a story that starts off strange and stays that way. It's hilariously funny, and its satirical elements are sharply intelligent. It may very well make points that will stay with you. But the reason, I think, that many people read it and like it is that it is simply hysterical in much the same way that Monty Python is hysterical. Adams can't lose as long as he keeps pulling out one zany and unexpected surprise after another... and he does just that throughout.This isn't a book that takes days to read, so I'd recommend that anyone who's in the mood for something off-the-wall and humorous give it a try. Who knows? Maybe you'll join the ranks of those who know just what's so unpleasant about being drunk, what the secret to flying is, and the Ultimate Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Greetings hoopy froods from America-landJust a short correction for you.

I just have to say this -- as hilarious as these books are, I think Douglas Adams is basically a very serious man with important things to say. In his later books, my guess is that he was a little bothered by the way everyone just raves about how funny his stuff is, without talking about the troublesome nature of the very real issues he raises. This stuff is absurd, and is deadly serious, at the same time. You should try to be aware of that, and of the tightrope Douglas Adams was walking here.Also, I personally know one woman who chose to make her life's work one of helping animals, and actually became a veterinarian (which required YEARS, YEARS, YYYEEEAAARRRSSS of poverty and going to school to become one) because of Douglas Adams' book &quot;Last Chance to See&quot;, which is about endangered species.I think Douglas Adams is a good and great man, a really warm philosopher, and it seriously wouldn't surprise me if he was remembered and talked about in pubs long after, say, Bertrand Russell or Alfred North Whitehead are just footnotes in dusty thesises in library archives."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This is a classic science fiction as well as cult novel.

Douglas Adams did a brilliant job carrying the reader along with this absurd sci-fi novel. In fact, at times the book gets so absurd that it's hard to follow. But I still recommend it as a great read.Basically the book is about two friends that live on earth. Arthur Dent and Ford Perfect. Ford Perfect(who is actually an alien) reveals to Arthur that the world is about to end.Not long after their conversation, a Vogon spaceship appears and announces that earth will be destroyed shortly because it is in the way of a new intergalactic highway bypass that is being built through our galaxy. Ford and Arthur manage to board the ship before the earth is demolished, and they are quickly discovered.The Vogon ship ejects them into space and they get picked up by another ship called the &quot;Heart of Gold&quot; which houses the Infinite Improbability Drive-makes the improbable happen. They travel to the planet Magrathea to figure out what to do about their non-existent planet earth. Then discover that earth was really a giant organic computer that was working on finding the meaning of life. But 5 minutes before the program was done the planet was desroyed. Ah, the irony!This book was all over the place, in a way that reminded me of Slaughterhouse five. The characters would go off on weird tangents that didn't really have much to do with the plot of the story. But I enjoyed its off the wall style and bazaar storyline.

Together, they start a wild adventure that will introduce them to Zaphod and his girlfriend Trillian. Not to mention a depressed robot.I've been hearing about this book since high school. Many of my friends have recommended it to me, but I've never gotten around to reading it. Believe me, that was a huge mistake. I was frequently laughing out loud at the book. The characters, the situations, and the narration - all of it was perfectly comical. I'm sure I averaged a laugh a page, leading to some strange looks from my roommate as I was reading.If you're looking for a fun, improbable book you won't be able to put down, look no further. I'm already planning to pick up the rest of the increasingly inaccurately named trilogy."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I heard about this book as a humoristic book. Well, it does have some funny parts, but it's not hilarious. It is, though, very interesting. It is the only book I've ever read that doesn't fit itself to your logic, but you need to fit your logic to it. It is a crazy book, and I don't think it fits to all people, but if you liked it, you'll find yourself quating it at any opportunity. I found metaphors in it that fits to almost any discussion: About Capitalism, Zionism, science, and everyday conversations. It's an amazing, funny and weird book and I think you should at least try and read it."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I picked up the Hitchhikers' Galaxy to the Galaxy beacause of the recommendation of a friend. I really had absolutely no idea what to expect except for the seemingly, pointless question he asked me, \\"What is the answer to Life, the Universe and Everything?\\". Needless to say, I didn't know what the heck he was talking about, and was even more perplexed when he told me the answer was 42. So, when my class was sent to the library to pick out a fiction novel to read for class, I found this book in my hands, and I'm glad I did. I find it quite difficult to describe this book, because I know I won't be able to do justice to it, but let's say I was constantly laughing the whole way through. The plot, or lack thereof, revovles mostly around an ape-descended lifeform living on the wretched blue-green planet in the Western arm of the universe, named Arthur. Arthur lives in England and lives a rather typical humanoid life, with the simple exception of his friend, Ford Prefect. Ford is a wonderfully interesting character who really is not a human, but an alien hitchhiking through the universe with the assistance of the trusty guide, yet finds himself exiled on Earth for 15 years and befriending Arthur. As it happens, a Vogon spaceship shows up and destoys Earth and all mankind to make way for an intergalactic highway, yet Ford and Arthur escape due to Ford hitching a ride on the Vogon ship. Thus, begins their adventure. Through a long, and quite improbable journey, Ford and Arthur meeting old aquaintences, the ruler of the universe, Zaphod Beeblebrox and another surviving human, Trillian. Together they go on a entirely zany and humorous adventure. It's really quite worth the read and the book we leave you desiring to read the next 3 books of the triology (yes, there are 4). My only complaint is that there is really no defining moment in the book that makes it truly memorable. I guess you could say its lacking any real climax. Also, the hundereds of juxtapostions, ilogical and improbably things, and oxymorons really leave you kind of feeling a little empty. For all the humor, the book is really lacking any substance or something to take away from it, even if you do now know the answer to the universe. Yet, I recommend it to all who are looking for a great laugh. Its a wonderfully written book and will keep you involved, so go check out!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This is the first in a series of humorous science fiction novels that had their origin in a BBC radio series, first airing on March 8, 1978. This first story by Adams was also made into a short television series. The stories are centered about an alien named Ford Prefect, who has been spending some time on Earth serving as a roving researcher for &quot;The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,&quot; and his human friend Arthur Dent, a common English &quot;everyman&quot; who is constantly searching for a drinkable cup of tea. At the start of the first novel, Dent wakes up in the morning to discover that his house is being destroyed to make way for a bypass. Ford Prefect arrives to tell Dent that Earth itself is about to be demolished in order to make way for an interstellar bypass by the Vogons. Just prior to Earth's destruction, the two stow away on a Vogon ship. The two survivors are thrown out of the ship but soon meet the egocentric Zaphod Beeblebox, Ford's cousin and President of the Galaxy (&quot;President in particular is very much a figurehead-he wields no power whatsoever&quot;), who has a surgically-added extra arm and extra head. With Zaphod is the girl Trillian (Tricia McMillan) who had been picked up at a party on Earth by Zaphod. They are traveling in a prototype space ship, &quot;The Heart of Gold,&quot; stolen by Zaphod. The ship is powered by an Infinite Improbability Drive, which can be used as a method for crossing vast interstellar distances in a &quot;mere nothing of a second&quot; by generating small amounts of finite improbability. The development of an &quot;infinite improbability generator&quot; was made possible by calculating exactly how improbable such a generator was and creating this finite improbability. Another character in these books is Marvin, a manicly depressed android with a powerful brain. This unusual group of characters travel to the planet Magrathea which specializes in custom-made luxury planet building. However, two nuclear missiles are fired at them. Fortunately, Dent accidentally triggers the infinite improbability drive which turns the missiles into a bowl of petunias and a sperm whale. They discover, from the character Slartibartfast, that Earth had actually been designed by the Magratheans as a gigantic computer whose job it was to find &quot;The Question.&quot; Another computer, &quot;Deep Thought,&quot; had earlier calculated the answer to life, the Universe, and everything: the answer was &quot;42.&quot; But, no one knew the question. Unfortunately, the Earth had been destroyed five minutes before the completion of its analysis by the Vogons. This book is thoroughly enjoyable and I recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Great reading by Stephen Fry.

Just a great book, and if you like this one, read the other four! They're great!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"If you're considering buying this book it is worth the investment. The only problem with it is that you will want to read all of the rest of the trilogy. This is probably the best book I've ever read with the possible exception of &quot;The Restaurant at the End of the Universe&quot; which is even more bizarre and delightful."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book is amazingly funny. It is totally unlike any sci-fi book you've ever read (unless you've already read one of the trilogy), and cannot fail to amuse even the most uniterested of people.It's characters are all interesting in their own right, with the arrogance of Zaphod, the ignorance of Arthur and the know-all-ness of Ford providing a for a totally original revelation in science fiction.It will suit all types of reader, never failing to amuse. Adams' flippant style is allways engaging and no-one can fail to admire his style, as well as the many amusing plot distractions that seem almost unique to his writing.To breifly summurize the plot: a simple Earthman, Arthur Dent, discovers that a good friend of his is actually an alien working for a remarkable guide to the galaxy. This alein friend, Ford Prefect, rescues Arthur from the planet Earth which is demolished and takes him on a highly entertaing, spin around the galaxy in which they are both blown up more times than is healthy, and are almost totally deprived of tea.The first time I read this was in Wales, and this book alone kept me sane during the week I was there. (no offense to Welsh people, I have Welsh blood too [although admitedly I keep it in a small box under my bed][only joking]).I actually compared this book to Red Dwarf by Rob Grant and Doug Naylor for my GCSE (an exam) in English, for which I got a solid B, I've also read the 5 books in the trilogy at least half-a-dozen times, so I'm more than familiar with the book. And it's still funny.Thankyou, goodnight, and hang onto your towels."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"If you saw the recent movie version of HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY and wondered, \\"What in the name of Zarquon is going on here?\\" it probably means that you've never read the book upon which the movie was (loosely) based. Or, in my case, you've read the book often and you were still mystified by events unfolding onscreen.So, forget the movie. Forget the theater in which you saw the movie and the snacks you had while watching it. Forget the nap you took during the movie, or the couple making out behind you when they thought you were still sleeping.No, forget all of that, and make a point of getting this book and its sequels as soon as possible. To say that the book is better than the movie is like saying the Pangalactic Gargle Blaster is a fairly potent drink.The late, great Douglas Adams created an altogether, wholly remarkable universe where the space-time continuum was so ripped, torn, swirling, rife with eddies, and filled with floatsam and jetsam that it would take me a millinnium of riding a runaway Chesterfield sofa just to contemplate it and explain it to you.Let me just say: the book is laugh out loud funny. Imagine crossing the priceless lyrical wit of P.G. Wodehouse with the scientific imagination of H.G. Wells, and you may begin to approximate the genius of Douglas Adams.Our beleaguered hero, Arthur Dent, endures a series of increasingly improbable journeys that take him from one end of the galaxy to the other. Amazingly, far reaches of the galaxy--exotic though they may be--have many of the same problems that we have here on earth. Namely, too many telemarketers, lawyers, and lemony fresh handi-wipes. And too few places to quaff a decent cup of tea.OK, I give up on describing the book. It's actually harmless. Mostly harmless, anyway. Get it. Read it. Laugh one of your heads off."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book is still so funny and original (the film's not too bad either with the guy from The Office off BBC America). I just love Brit humor - it is tops (check out Ben Elton (Stark) and Steve Horsfall ( You Are Here )too)."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This is a book that manages to blend in bits of a fantasy sci-fi world in a way that makes it seem realistic and entertaining. Other reviewers who complained about the plot (notice how few there are) miss the value of this book. It is a place to be, a hitchhiker in a detailed and fantastic universe, who, hopefully knows where his towel is. This book is endlessly quotable. There is a rhythm to this book that taints your thinking. It is funny and intelligent.However, I did dock this book 1 star in the review because it is a slow-starter. It takes about a third of the book to get off the planet (literally), and all the real fun is in space. However, once you get past that first hump the rest is smooth sailing except for the abrupt ending. (Douglas Adams had trouble meeting his deadlines and so the manuscript was taken, as is, at a slightly awkward spot.) Be sure to have The Restaurant at the End of the Universe ready to read right afterwards because it really does seem to &quot;finish&quot; this book's plotline.I rarely enjoy reading a book I've already read before but this one and the rest of the series are an easy exception."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The first thing to note is that despite its name this is not a guidebook. Rather, it is an intricate story about a group of people - and a paranoid android - with rather nebulous connections who use, work for, or are otherwise involved with &quot;the Guide&quot;.Although some fans of &quot;hard&quot; science fiction do not have much time for this book, I think that it is a classic. Adams uses everything from subtle irony to blatant sarcasm - plus a fair about of slapstick - to weave this complex and highly improbable story which pokes fun at most professions, many ideas and just about every thing else in the history of time and space.If this book doesn't make you laugh you need a vacation. If it does, the good news is that Adams manages to keep the concepts and jokes fresh throughout most of the 5 book \\"trilogy\\" which is testimony to his skills as an author.And a final note - which has got to be the most compelling reason to buy the book - if you don't know what the number 42, towels, yellow bulldozers, and mice have in common - Don't Panic! - you will once you have read this book!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I'm in the seventh grade and wanted to read book for enjoyment. I usually don't but this book was reall great. I am now going to start to read the second book in this excellent series."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I first read Hitchiker when I was ten, and in the ten years (and hundreds of re-readings) since it has been a source of infinite pleasure and enlightenment. I now have all the books (2 copies each), the radio broadcasts, the original radio scripts, the videos of the TV series and Neil Gaiman's Guide to the Guide (as well as absolutely everything else that the exquisite Mr Adams has ever written). I am currently studying at Oxford University and I take offence at those misguided souls who think that HHGTTG is childish, has no lasting worth or will only be enjoyed by undiscriminating readers. Hitchiker is not only a supremely funny and inventive book - it's also extremely intelligent and full of subtle insights. It works on so many levels that it is accessible to everyone (if they keep an open mind).Vogon poetry, the Babel fish and the Pan-Galactic Gargle Blaster are surely all the evidence you need of Adams' sublime genius (and there are 4 more books of it).Oh, and Douglas Adams has been hinting that Hitchiker 6 might be on its way (pleeeeaaaase! pleeeeeaase!)Anyway, my heart belongs to Ford Prefect forever. And remember, Hitchiker isn't just a book, it's a way of life."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Sorry about my little review below. I just can't understand people who don't like this book. This is the best book by my favorite author. I am an aspiring author and if I could write anything half this good, I could die happy. I'd been trying to write zany space comedies even before I'd even heard of Douglas Adams, but once I read this, I knew I had a long ways to go. Anyway, the rest of the series pales a little in comparison to this book, (especially 'So Long...&quot;) but they're all massively entertaining. If you liked the Hitchhiker's Trilogy, try his Dirk Gently series as well. Also, Douglas wrote 3 excellent stories for Doctor Who, &quot;The Pirate Planet&quot; in season 16, and &quot;City of Death&quot; and &quot;Shada&quot; (unfinished, unfortunately) for season 17, a season in which he also served as the show's script editor.Someone said that this book was a Star Trek wannabe. If anything, it serves to show just how limited Star Trek can be when there's books like Hitchhiker's Guide and shows like Doctor Who and Red Dwarf out there. Those poor trekkies, I feel a little sorry for them actually.Anyway, I've gotten a little off the point here, that being that this is the best humor writing around and anyone who can't appreciate this humor just doesn't get it."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I listened to this book on CD; the six CD BBC Radio production. While I certainly found the book amusing, I don't know why people are so excited about it. It seems that Adams pretends to have a plot but really does not want to have one. The tone is too ridiculous to be meaningful and the characters are too flat.The event that starts the novel is the demolition of Earth for a hyperspace bypass. Only one human, Arthur Dent, escapes with an alien taking human form, Ford Prefect. Following this, they meet some other characters and have a random, bizarre romp around the galaxy.There were some interesting ideas here but Adams just didn't pursue them. Super-beings create a computer to determine the answer to the meaning of life (this in itself could have an interesting point; man relies on machines for the most important of tasks etc...) and after millions of years, it reaches the answer. &quot;The answer is 42.&quot; As this made no sense to the super beings, they designed a planet-sized computer called Earth to find the question to the meaning of life. In the novel, the question is never revealed even though one of the characters knows it.The title of the novel is an actual book in the story. It a collection of articles and miscellaneous data about the galaxy, towels, alcohol and all sorts of different topics; this could have formed the basis for an interesting plot. The story could have featured, Ford Prefect, himself a contributor to the guide travel about and write about the places he visits and other such tidbits. It could be some sort of \\"Lonely Planet\\" book for the galaxy.There were other parts of the novel that were just plain weird; the editor of the, &quot;The Hitch hiker's Guide to the Galaxy,&quot; takes an inter-galactic cruise in his office. The main characters travel in a space ship powered by an Infinite Improbability Drive. The characters visit a restaurant that exists at the end of time...I fully admit that the book is funny; it has a sort of British humor that I just love but after that, there's not much of substance here. However, seeing as it is incredibly popular for some reason, it may be worth a read."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The book The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy was a very good book.

This, I believe was the Fiction book I had decided to read for my reading class. After having finally read through it, it turned out unbelievably bad. I'll admit that it sounded interesting to begin with. Or the subject at hand sounded mildly interesting. And the cover kind of drew me in. But it became intolerable to a point. There were too many random things in the book. It was difficult to answer questions about the book, like the hidden meaning behind its entirety. I don't think there was a point to it. But then again, I guess you could call it an &quot;adventure&quot; book more than a &quot;self discovery&quot; book. Although the part that humored me the most was the depressed robot. I guess you can say I'm not a sci-fi fan. As much as I like watching the sci-fi channel, my feelings towards it is just like any other. It was dull and boring. Too much random junk in it, I like books that have plots and so forth. But if this is what you fancy, then so is it. By all means, read the book. But for those who share the same feelings as me will strongly agree that it was terribly made. I personally, don't see how it is considered one of the best books ever. Along with a few other books I've read who to me, weren't quite up to par either. Who judges that anyway? Its randomness not only made me bored out of my mind, but it also made me confused, talking about the &quot;Golden Heart&quot; and whatnot. I hope I don't have to read this book again. The book in a few parts seemed a bit repetitive. What I didn't like the most was when it talked about nothing. Seriously, it said, in a certain part that it had nothing to do with the story, or plot in particular. Which was more than a waste of my time.

Hilariously funny. A mix of creativity and infinite imagination. Highly recommended!!!!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I clearly did not understand this book at all. I read it based on a recommendation of a scientist I work with who said it was an incredible read, but this came out as one lame novel. Maybe it's because it was written for a previous generation of reader, but Adams's novel doesn't really do anything all that exciting. The premise is intersting enough, Arthur Dent being a human being who is saved from the destruction of the Earth because of the need to build an intergalactic highway. Some of the details are also fascinating (and what saves the novel from being 0 stars in my eyes), especially the way religion and technology are described in such a satirical form, but the book iteself is poorly written, choppy, and frankly unentertaining. If someone can tell me what I was supposed to get out of this novel, please pass the information along.I really do think that my negative views towards the book stem from it seeming dated in my eyes and how the humorous and sarcastic tone coming out as something quite standard in today's writing world. Maybe the novel was a breakthrough when it came out for the way it viewed the world and the way Adams pokes fun at almost everything, but none of this can cover up the fact that in my eyes, this seems like a poor, finished product, one that relies on its somewhat interesting satirical moments to cover up its other flaws."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I tried to get into this book years ago when my brother sent me a copy. At the time I had difficulty because it seemed just pointless chatter. Recently I had the opportunity to view the old series on DVD and thoroughly enjoyed them, so I read The Restaurant at the End of the Universe. The book is wacky and fun, and has more than a mild amount of social criticism concealed in its pages.Since I'd enjoyed Restaurant, I returned to Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy and again found it difficult to get into it. I was well into the tale before it seemed worth the effort. Even then I found patches that were dull.Despite the on-again/off-again interest, I did enjoy it over all, partly because I was familiar with the characters from Restaurant. As a first book, it's not bad, but I'm glad I read Restaurant, or I might again have given up on this book.My favorite character here, as in the second book, was Marvin the depressive robot. Most of us probably know someone just like Marvin; I know I do. In fact I've known several. His poorly disguised attempts to gain sympathy and his unwillingness to take it even when it's offered, lest it decrease the satisfaction of his \\"martyrdom,\\" is very funny precisely because one does know people like him.I didn't care much for Beeblebrox, but I don't think you're intended to. (I've known people like him, too.) He's an extreme, the other end of which seems to be Arthur. Because of this, they're both memorable types. Ford on the other hand, after the brief stir created by his introduction, seems so middle of the road that one either confuses him with Arthur or Bebblebrox, depending upon what he's doing or saying at the time. Trilliam, too, gets lost after her introduction. She's very bright but she's just there. She's not independent as a personality. She's a \\"straight man\\" for Beeblebrox and support for Arthur. If she were removed from the book, I don't think it would make the slightest difference, which is too bad. More could have been made of her character than was."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"...that hasn't already been said?Probably nothing, though it didn't stop all 494 of you from trying.#495"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I WAS EXPECTING THE BOOK TO BE MUCH FUNNIER.

If you're into science fiction humor than this is a good book for you. I will give the author credit for good characterization. He goes into good detail about the different appearances and traits of each of the characters which brings the book alive. Both the setting and the plot were a little confusing however. The setting was constantly changing and the topic of conversation quickly changed from one thing to the next in a random way. This made reading the book a little tedious and frustrating to follow. All in all, it was not worth the time for me to read and understand this book, because it didn't catch enough of my interest."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Perhaps this is just another unfortunate example of the hype exceeding the final product, but despite the ubiquitous praise and, more importantly, the highly entertaining book, I found myself ultimately disappointed with the final experience. Sure, Douglas Adams is a funny guy. Sure he's got an astounding imagination, with a gift for the turn of phrase, not to mention the idiosyncratic character. But the absence of one aspect of the experience truly depleted for me what could have been the grand sci-fi/humor classic that The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy had been portrayed to me as: the lack of an epic feel.Adams quickly throws us into the midst of the absurd, yet entertaining events of his first novel. If any one thing can detract from this book more than another, it is the pace. It moves fast. It moves very fast, and to an extent I can comprehend how this is necessary. Adams needs to take the reader for a ride, from one local to another, one character to another, one hilarious punch line to another. But in the mean time, the flow of the novel is sacrificed, not to mention coherence, character development, and valuable descriptions of what are certainly some of the most imaginative environments. Instead, Adams takes it on faith that we will fill in all of his numerous blanks. It's no surprise that this novel reads more like the radio show from whence it was born.As far as the story goes, Adams must be commended. He notes in the foreword that he only figured out the plot as he went along, and nonetheless, the structure of the plot certainly doesn't feel that way. The ultimately problem resides in the fact that the entire novel seems unfinished--as he states in his foreword, it was. This is not to criticize his strategy to turn the book into a series (or a trilogy of five books, as he prefers to call it), but more a comment on the conclusion of the first book. It is all well and good to prolong a story over several novels, but the way to make up for it is to give each novel its on independent narrative arc, making it more of an episode in a series rather than the first act. Unfortunately, any reader whose interest is remotely piqued will be forced to buy the subsequent novels simply to understand the first.But ultimately, the novel--and hopefully the remaining books in the series--are purely entertaining and fun. Indeed, there is much I can criticize, but nonetheless it is oftentimes overshadowed by the fun and funny style and story presented in the text. At the very least, I can say that Adams has a grand gift. Narrative humor tales are few and far between today, and so The Hitchhiker's Guide takes the tally as certainly one of the better representatives in that genre. The book still possesses all the potential to be a truly great masterwork, even the sci-fi/-humor epic that Adams intended. Comprehensively, however, it fails to encapsulate the image of the galaxy rather than just the style."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"As it seems most people love this book, I am a voice of the silent minority, or perhaps majority. Anyways, they are silent so no one really knows. This book did not have much going for it except for the fact that it weighs in at a slight 320 pages. With the Harry Potter books approaching 1000, 320 is slight. The problem with this book lies in the fact that it never ends.Despite a mildly engaging premise, the book quickly lapses into slapstick humor and cheap laughs. The poetry fiasco being the first of many encounters sprinkle throughout this book. My main quarrel with this book is actually in the ending, I would say spoiler alert, but there is no ending to spoil for anybody. The characters simply get back onto their ship and the book is over. I actually found myself turning the page expecting some sort of conclusion.Now, not every book without an ending is bad. Take Cat's Cradle by Kurt Vonnegut.(spoiler) Even though the main character meets his end on the last page without any sort of fanfare or conclusion, the ending is so well crafted that the reader is not left feeling lost. After all, the world ended, why shouldn't the main character. But in Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, the characters just continue on as if nothing has happened. The reader is faced with many unanswered questions about what will happen next and why the earth is so unimportant. Call me earthcentric, but I don't know what Douglas Adams has against humans and the earth.I know many people love this book and I am not here to argue with their views, but the other side's views need to be expressed. So, if you open this book with the expectation of it being anything more than a collection of anectdotes without conclusion, I do not recommend this book. Find yourself a nice book that will leave you feeling full."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"the book had that old book smell and the pages were tinged a little yellow, but there were no missing pages or rips, as well as no marks to the cover or pages."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Great book for a good laugh.

The writing is just way below par. This is the sort of book that is based more on gimmicks than story. Things don't have to make sense, because the author will just think of a device to justify them. My favorite (or least favorite) example of this was in the first book (I think) where an invention called \\"improbability drive\\" means that anything can happen, at any time, for absolutly no reason. People can fall out of the sky, time can jump forward, whatever, it doesn't matter. Plot be damned! I dunno...it must have it's merits considering the cult popularity of this book, I just don't see them. It's not that I have no sense of humor, I just think funny things need to make sense too. This book is string of random events stuck together to form a story, and moved along by a cheap plot device. It has it's moments of side-splitting, rolling around on the floor laughter, but they're few and far between.

By the time this little story is over, Arthur Dent, the protagonist, has probably not only flipped a time axis over, but has probably done so exactly at the moment the thing had the right number of pock marks/wormholes.This is the story of how an Anyman from England goes on a fantastic intergalatic voyage after bureaucratic, fascist-oid aliens commit wholesale planetcide against the Earth in the name of Progress, demolishing it to construct a hyperspace bypass moments before the Earth, one big organic computer, is to render the 10-million year Question. (Kinda makes Arthur's house demolition for similiar reasons at the beginning of the story look like wormmeal by comparison).By confronting robots and computers that should ge given frontal-circuit lobotomies, greedy mice that saw their 10-million year investment sour before it went boxoffice, and various and sundry &quot;whoops&quot; incidents in outerspace, Arthur becomes a Space Novitiate, ready for more space adventures in sequel books, and ready to turn that time axis over with a swift flick of his wrist, as soon as the stuff stops jiggling.Don't pass this book by if you think it is too Trekkie or Sci-Fi-ish from the title, especially if you do happen to like absurd/obscure British humor like Monty Python.

At least, not all the way through. Sure, I have tried in the past to get interested in a book, but I've never found a book that captured me to the point that I actually finished it. I've graduated high school, and I even have a year of college under my belt, and I somehow managed to do it all without reading any of the required material from any class.Then one day in the summer of 2001, I make my regular visit to Slashdot, to find that an English fellow by the name of Douglas Adams had died. The news post had 600+ comments on it from other Slashdot readers, so I knew this was someone big, but I had never heard of him. Well I did a little bit of searching and found that he almost has a cult following, so I decided to check it out. The thought of trying to read *another* book was definitely unappealing, but so many people had so many great things to say about him and his works, so I decided to go for it.1 month later I had finished all five books in this series, and it remains, to this day, the only book(s) I have finished completely... And I have tried diligently to find other books to capture my imagination like these books did.It's really tough to call these \\"books,\\" because they are so much more than that. They all have a very unique life and soul to them... They're so warm and friendly, so comforting and relaxing... And ever so funny. It's also really hard to explain what's so darn funny about them. Adams doesn't make any punchlines, he just tells the story... But the way things work out, and the way people say things, you find yourself cracking up much more often that you'd think.I know, you're probably thinking, \\"The way they *say* things is funny? This is just text!\\" Well there's a point to that. But the other side of the story is that these characters really become a part of you, and when you're reading, you begin to act everything out in your head... You can see the people, the spaceships, the planets, the wild locations, the facial expressions... And it really starts to turn into a movie inside your head.This series of books has forever changed my life. I look at everything in a new perspective, I have a new appreciation for a lot of things (You start to realize what you've got when you read about a guy who travels through the galaxy with almost nothing except a towel), and I have an almost renewed sense of humor. I can not say enough about this wonderful series, and my only wish is that Douglas Adams were still alive so I could thank him myself for writing such an inspiring work.If you are even remotely considering purchasing this book, I would wholeheartedly urge you to give it a shot. It's only [price] for the greatest piece of literature you could ever hope to own...

Every time you think you've read the wackiest thing you could, you find something to top it in the next page.Even if you are not a science fiction fan, you should check out this book. The SF angle is just a back drop for a far-out comedic masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"over all i think that this was a really good book. it was funny and kept you reading. i would recomend it to amyone"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I downloaded the Audible.com version, and listened to it while in bed with the flu. Douglas Adams had me laughing so much. He really lifted my spirits. Listening to Marvin, the manic depressive robot, was especially helpful getting my out of my funk. I had read this book years ago, and it made a huge difference to hear him read it. I love his voice and the way he portrays the various characters. I had forgotten the answer to the great question of the life, the universe, and everything. I was so relieved to hear the answer again! Ah, now I feel so much better. ;-) I was sad to learn that Mr. Adams passed away earlier this year. I'm looking forward to experiencing more of his trilogy."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The hook for me, who is no science fiction genre reader, was the bit about the Vogons, the species that tortures its captives by forcing them to listen to bad poetry. Having been promised that, I picked it up and thoroughly enjoyed the high-minded wit and glee that endows THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY. That and the book is rather short, making it perfect for when the mood calls for light reading but not junk food. Adams obviously had fun with this, kicking at all matter of conventions, including the genre in which he chooses to phrase his satire. His quintet of travelers are personable, even the self pitying robot. Written some time ago, the book presages some technology that is beginning to appear now; the titular travel guide referenced throughout the book, for which one character is a writer, resembles a Palm Pilot, for instance. My only complaint as an outsider to the genre is that there is no real climax and resolution in the story; after the initial, hilarious exposition, it heads into episodic adventure and just ends en route to another destination. Which means, I have to read the next book. I suppose there are worse punishments out there. This small hardcover edition is quite nice and a bargain. Go for it instead of a paperback."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The absolutely whimsical meanderings of the author make for some delightful reading.

It takes all of the seriousness linked to traditional sci-fi and tosses it out the window. It takes a particular and peculiar mind to take the story of Arthur Dent, Ford Prefect and the rest in the directions it goes, and thank heavens Douglas Adams had such a mind.

Really want to see the movie as well."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a uniquely humorous journey of a normal man, Arthur Dent, who finds himself wandering through space after the world explodes. Arthur and Ford (the man that saved him from the earth) find their lives twisted with coincidence as they travel with the Galaxy's President on the universe's continuously improbable ship, The Heart of Gold. As they discover legendary planets, escape genius mice and fly at the very dangeous speed of R17, Arthur finds himself rambling through the endless adventure that is the universe.This story is amusing, but sometimes too witty for young readers, like myself, who are just becoming familiar with advanced books such as this one. Confusing phrases are omnipresent throughout this well-told tale, sometimes making reading slow and difficult. When I read this book, I didn't understand some advanced jokes, and lingered over challenging wording. I was force to read on with these troubling terms in the back of my mind. One of these points was when Arthur and Ford first find themselves on The Heart of Gold during the ship's improbable journey. Everything seems random as I realized when a group of monkeys asks them if they would read their copy of Hamlet. This befuddled me until I found that it came from a saying stating, \\"If 50 monkeys were put in a room, one would produce a writing as brilliant as Hamlet.\\" This story may be hilarious, but Douglas Adams' terminology often goes over the heads of less expierienced readers.The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is surely one of the most entertaining books I've read, but it is also the most confusing and advanced book by far. The story may be at a level too high for most Junior High/High School students, but for me, the laughs in this book far outweighed the confusion in it. The characters in the book were exceptional and the setting was incomparable, even for a less savvy readed. Every day I looked forward to uncovering a new chapter in this masterpiece. I recommend this book to less skilled readers looking for challenges, but mainly to clever readers seaching for absurdity and fun. Anyone who is a Monty Python fan will love the book, even if they are young. However, it will take an older advanced reader to fully take in hidden coincidences, jokes, and metaphors featured in this book."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"When the planet Earth is destroyed by the Vogon alien race in order to build a new hyperspatial express route, Arthur Dent catches a ride with a passing Vogon ship with his alien friend Ford Prefect and rides off on their first adventure. Ford, as a researcher for making the new Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, now goes to make new additions while traveling. As you go discover new members to this group, soon enough, the crew is full of a whole hilarious genre of characters. From the two headed Zaphod to an always-depressed robot name Marvin, this book will make you laugh with jokes on almost every line! As the first book in the trilogy of four, I personally can't wait to read the next one.This book easily gets 5 stars from me, even just based on its comedy and story line. It's a great science fiction that will have you laughing even when making fun of the stupidity of the human race at times. My favorite part was actually in the beginning when Arthur is stressing about his house being torn down, when the whole world is about to explode within the hour! The author, Douglas Adams, uses a unique kind of writing style that always keeps this book interesting, and the way he describes things will keep you connected in the book. He makes up tons of alien words, but still lets you know what he's talking about through mini Hitchhiker's Guide entries.Overall it's a great book, and you should for sure pick it up as soon as possible. Not only will it entertain you with a creative story, it will start you on an adventure throughout the next three books in the series."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is the first of the four books in Douglas Adams' trilogy, or so he calls it, as well as one of the funnier books that I have read. This comedy is about a man named Arthur Dent who suddenly becomes at risk of being blown up with the rest of the Earth when it is demolished so that there can be room for an interplanetary highway. He is saved by his alien friend, Ford, by way of hitchhiking onto a Vogon, a rather disgusting and apathetic alien, ship. When they're thrown out of the ship they end up on a new ship, The Heart of Gold, they meet the president of the universe, Zaphod Beeblebop, and Trillian McMallan, the only other survivor of the demolition of Earth, only because she left earlier. The four of them go on an adventure to a place that no one really knows much about and find out the surprising secrets of the planet makers; Arthur gets a tour of their factory, as well as the secrets of the financers of Earth. I, personally, loved reading this book. The characters were all important to the story and no one of them took the spotlight for too long, they all shared. I particularly liked the humor of the story, it was simple and quick, and the style of writing; it left much for the imagination, making it all in all a great book, not the best I've ever read, but great."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"To me, there's certain literary classics like Les Miserables, the books about the Musketeers by Alexandre Dumas and a lot of Shakespeare books where they're often quoted or referenced and on people's classics of all time list yet how many can actually stomach Les Miserables' 1300 pages? Hitchhiker's Guide is like this only it's very short, funny, and really needs the other books to understand the story.Arthur Dent wakes up in the morning and finds a bulldozer wanting to bring down his house so he lies in front of it. A man named Ford Prefect comes up to him and convinces the bulldozer to not demolish his house. However, an announcement says that a galactic highway(or something, lot of science speak in here) needs to be built and Earth's in the way so Ford and Arthur escape just in time.They eventually get aboard the Heart of Gold, a ship carrying Zaphod, a rather smallminded man who just happens to be President of the Galaxy, his science-y partner Trillian, the ship's computer \\"Eddie\\", and Marvin, the depressed robot, also the Paranoid Android(yes this is a Radiohead song). They then find themselves on a legendary planet which does rather cool business and want to know the answer to Life and Everything.One thing that I didn't care much for was as soon as things were starting to get good then woosh, book's over. Unlike Narnia or Harry Potter which are standalone books, this feels like a big book seperated into smaller books. You could even read one of the Lord of the Rings books without even reading the other 2. Here it's like \\"you just read 200 pages, now buy the other books.\\"However, the book is funny and contains interviews with cast members and a foreword and photos(Zooey Deschanel who plays Trillian is sure hot), just be warned that you'll probably end up getting the others as well."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I love this book! It's just so much fun to read and it's a really exciting story! Everyone who likes sci-fi should read it!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Critics call it a \\"romp of cosmic proportions.\\" Many are \\"not sure if science fiction had ever seen anything like this before 1979,\\" and as one clear-minded (and totally spaced-out) Adams' enthusiast points out \\"There aren't too many books that lead off with the destruction of the earth. After all, where do you go from there?\\"What is it about perfectly dry, diaphragm-jiggling British comedy that sets human beings all over the world rocking on their heels with laughter? Its a mystery to me, just like every single one of Douglass Adams' utterly ridiculous topics of sarcasm. I read one review for the book that called The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy a waste of time, and gave it the most severe form of anti-praise possible by condemning it inferior to the cultured genre of sci-fi novels everywhere. If The Guide made me cry from laughter, then that review made me cry from ignorance. Here is what this sadly unenlightened reader has to say about the book: \\"Total garbage. It didn't make any sense at all. Read the other reviews. Everyone says how wonderful the book is but no one says what the book is about.\\" This guy is obviously a very unappreciative, pea-brained Vogon in disguise, because his sort of poetry is most assuredly not the kind I want to be reading. I wish some practical people could just sit back and enjoy something as marvelous as The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, even if their isn't any clear point, if only for its sheer hilarity.While we're in the mood for galactic puns, I will try to be a bit more down-to-earth, as they say, and will concede that there are several points of real relevance in the story. One, Adam's pure sarcasm and mind-bending logic has a gigantic, blaring message: as obnoxious as a bullhorn announcing your impending death by Kill-O-Zap gun for stealing one hell of an expensive government/science project powered by the most improbable form of improbability ever discovered. And that, my friends, is satire. The Universe. It's nothing more than an over-sized and very bizarre perspective of our earth: a whacked-out upside-down kind of microcosm (in reverse)! Throw in a few bureaucratic hyperboles, and you've got a real slap in the face aimed pointedly at many single-minded businessmen. I'd bet you anything that critic was an economist.Just a note on Adams' humor; Be forewarned: don't drink anything before you read it (this is a very dangerous thing to do) and you may want to finalize your will (or your taxes, if you are financially-inclined) before you turn the first page (the one that says \\"for Jonny Brock and Clare Gorst and all other Arlingtonians for tea, sympathy, and a sofa\\") just in case you die of laughter. Also, you may not want to read this book in front of your psychiatrist least they come to believe that their fears have been confirmed and you have indeed gone stark-raving mad (they did predict that was going to happen in the end, after all).Such is the style of the late Mr. Douglas Adams. Oh, he's really a riot (and I say that with all sincerity). Who else could come up with a scenario where two white mice deceive us all and actually control the earth right under our noses? This is how I would define him: A lot of dialogue, a lot of adjectives, and a lot of completely insane British humor. Not only have I closed the book with a zillion new ways to look at our universe, but I've also got a fairly oversized dose of hilarity thrown in the bargain as well (lucky me). If there's someone out there who likes to critique, a sci-fi geek, or a rodent-loving freak who hasn't picked up The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy... jeez. You do not know what you're missing!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Douglas Adams truly is the master of parody. This book is absolutely marvelous.

I have to say that the book was hard to understand in places but was very well thought of.

Yes, we are a &quot;gifted kid&quot; magnet school, but let me tell you... the humor in this book is just astounding! We reference this book at least once a day (and who wouldn't, what with 42 and towel lines right there at our disposal?). As a reader of decidedly more serious sci-fi, I was expecting something along those lines when I picked up this book... imagine how delighted I was to find what I actually held in my hand was one of the best parodies of the genre I've seen. A definite must-read for anyone who considers themself ready for a new experience in reading. Just read... and let the brilliance wash over you. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Douglas Adams is a master. Anyone who hasn't read his Hitchhiker's series needs to prioritize better. Hitchiker's Guide is light enough to never stop being fun, but looks seriously at humans and why we are the way we are. He seems to be able to capture the human condition through farce without becoming shallow or pandering. This book is a necessary element of any serious Sci-Fi reader's library."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"If I were to rate all of the books that I have ever read, this one would be the funniest. He takes statements that sound very scientific, draws them out so they sound even more scientific, and then ends them with something so stupid and random that it leaves you wondering why you thought that the sentence sounded so scientific in the first place. An example of this is the first couple of paragraphs of the book, which say this:&quot;Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the Western Spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun. Orbiting this at a distance of roughly 98 million miles is an utterly insignificant little blue-green planet whose ape- descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea.&quot;I recommend this to people who have a British &quot;Monty Python&quot;-like sense of humor, are science fiction fans, or are both."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I first read this book in college some 20 years ago, and I still highly recommend it.

I bet at least one person responds &quot;42&quot;!). It's imaginative and very, VERY funny. I've never read anything so unusual in my life. I've recently discovered Terry Pratchett's &quot;Discworld&quot; novels, &amp; while they're funny, they pale in comparison to HHGTHG."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This is a book that people just come back to, again and again, and again, compulsively. Not many books are like that -- friends who have read this have all plowed through it at least 5 times. I myself discovered it in the early 80s, and have definitely read it dozens of times by now, no lie. There's just something about it. You can't stop, can't get away -- aaaaaahhh!Seriously, this straddles the line between &quot;funny-odd&quot; and &quot;funny ha ha&quot; more successfully, and more hilariously, than any book I can think of. One thing I should tell a person coming to this for the first time -- Zaphod Beeblebrox actually does start to make sense, during the sequels. Well, not &quot;SENSE&quot;, exactly, but his self-sabotaged brain becomes the key to a lot of cool hijinks. The second half of this book, after Arthur and Ford are picked up by the Improbability Drive, appears TOTALLY random, but actually does make sense in the context of the later books in the series. You should remember that this was originally a radio series, and this book is just the first few installments of it. The cutoff point is sort of arbitrary.As the series continues, Douglas Adams makes some really good philosophical points about getting along with each other. We should thank this guy, I think. The more I think about it, the more I realize what a solid, good person Douglas Adams is, to be able to laugh at the insanity that governs our modern lives. To even be able to SEE that it's insane is good, and to get others to laugh out loud at it all is GREAT. What a guy. Cheers to Douglas Adams, I say. Read his books, you'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Simply the funiest SF book ever.

The answer to the question being 42 (am I right on that?) and a sulking robot named Marvin not to mention the construction of a highway through space which causes earth to be demolished. This book is definitely not for the &quot;cool&quot;. It's for the geeks and freaks who haven't grown up and are still enjoying life. You'll laugh at every page as you go through the book.

Considering the price of the eBook and the unfortunate quality of the bonus material, it's hard not to feel ripped off.Hopefully Amazon will deal with it and upload an improved version at a later date.For now, apart from the convenience of having it in digital format, it's not worth it."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I was a graduate student in philosophy when Hitchhiker first came out. Either because I was overwhelmed with school work, or because I (foolishly) thought I was too brainy for Douglas Adams' little gem, I breezed through about half of it, concluded that it was crap, and tossed it aside. (Shades of Majikthise!)Now, some 30 years later, I've given it the serious read it deserved all along, and discovered why Hitchhiker has so many fans. It's hilarious, of course; Adams' talent for weaving together non sequiturs is unparalleled. It's incredibly imaginative, marrying the best of cosmology with the (intentional) worst of pulp science fiction. Best of all (at least so far as I'm concerned), it's extraordinarily philosophical, chock-full of logical jokes and wonderfully paradoxical arguments. But it makes its philosophical points parabolically, and with such a whimsical and funny touch, that the depth can easily be missed.Some examples: the hilarious logical conundrum involving identity and substitution in which Ford Perfect entwines the bulldozer-happy Mr. Prosser; the famous Babel Fish demonstration of the nonexistence of God; the sly allusion at the end of Chapter 9 to design arguments for the existence of God; the sperm whale's discovery of impermanence in life and personal identity; the parable about searching for undiscoverables that features Veet Voojagig's search for Planet Ballpoint Pen; the ontological nature of a world in which improbabilities become probable; the wrangle between humanists and technicians; and of course Deep Thought's search for the meaning of everything--which, among other issues, invites readers to think more about the propriety of questions than the virtue of answers.Even though it's taken me 30 years, I'm glad I've finally rectified a serious failing in my education by reading Hitchhiker. And now, on to the greatest test of all: using it in the classroom as a text! I can't wait."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Great book, irreverently funny, very interesting, and a fast read.

Afterwards my Dad, pleased with how much I liked the first one, bought me The Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, all five books in one.

If you like surprising, funny books, you should read this one!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Two years ago I had the privilege of hosting Douglas Adams at my home in San Francisco for a brainstorming meeting on a game project (which eventually became Starship Titanic). I had heard of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, aka H2G2, but hadn't read it. What I had heard was that it was very funny - Monty Pythonesque humor applied to sci fi. Wanting to get a rise out of Douglas, I made him some tea and served it in a ceramic mug from Japan with a little ceramic frog hiding in the bottom of the cup. Douglas sipped his tea coolly, and when the frog emerged from the depths of the tea Douglas gave a little startled grunt, caught my eye and laughed, and continued to drink his tea. As I expected, unflappable.Now years later, and three years after Douglas' untimely passing, I am finally enjoying what brought Douglas his initial fame. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is the first book in a five book trilogy in which our unsuspecting hero Arthur Dent narrowly escapes the Earth seconds before it is demolished to make way for an interstellar highway. Arthur escapes with his colleague Ford Prefect, who reveals to Arthur that he is actually from another planet and was working on a guidebook to the galaxy before getting stranded on Earth. Catching a lift with the cooking crew of the Vogon ship that destroyed Earth, Arthur and Ford are subjected to the torture of Vogon poetry before being ejected into space, only to be picked up by Zaphod Beeblebrox, the galaxy's BMOC, with his Heart of Gold improbability spaceship.Thus starts the string of ever more unlikely events in this romp through astrophysics and the hilarious imaginings of Douglas Adams' mind. Adams is a master storyteller, rarely letting his readers rest before hitting them with another plot twist or belly-acher. His humor is quintessentially British. One could easily imagine a young John Cleese in the role of Arthur Dent, deadpanning his way through the most absurd of events. Even if you have never read or enjoyed science fiction in your life, if you have any sliver of a sense of humor, you will enjoy this book.Since the combination of a lot of driving, an iPod purchase, and a subscription to audible.com, I've started to listen to more books than I actually read. The Hitchhiker's Guide is one of those books, read outloud and with great fourish by the author himself, Douglas Adams. As I understand it (someone correct me if I'm wrong) H2G2 was originally broadcast by radio. Thus it is ideally suited to be listened to as an audiobook. Adams has perfect comic timing in his delivery, though the book moves so quickly and covers so many diversions and plot twists I may want to listen to it again just to make sure I catch everything.The next book in the H2G2 5 part trilogy is The Restaurant at the End of the Universe. Equally funny and absurd, Dent and his co-horts escape total destruction once again and set off to find this fabled restaurant."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"\\" Gordon Logan (Scotland) - See all my reviewsThe book begins with the hero sitting down in front of his house in order to stop it being demolished to make room for a highway.

Adams's observations on the overall stupidity of mankind are right on target (Goodbye and thanks for all the fish!) The part that I found to be the most funny was when Adams made fun of philosophers. I actually doubled up with laughter when the man proved to God that He didn't exist. (I think I might have bruised a rib laughing.)And, as a sidenote, the Vogon poetry part is also another favorite of mine.I actually went on to read the rest of the \\"trilogy\\", which, was, to put it simply, mildly disappoiting. Following the example of the first book, the series ends abruptly with too many loose ends to name."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This is the first, and undoubtedly the best, of the several books that (somewhat confusingly) make up the Hitchiker's trilogy.Adams has blended a fantastic sense of humor with a brand of philosophical thinking that would have left Socrates tied up in mental knots.There aren't too many books that lead off with the destruction of the earth. After all, where do you go from there? Adams uses this departure point to take us into outer space, where advanced interstellar communication is old news, and the collaboration of alien species is as common as it is in Star Wars. But this tongue-in-cheek universe is a far cry from that straight-laced epic series.The rulers of this universe are often bogged down in the same type of senseless rituals and paperwork requirements that plague the corporate and bueaucratic world here on Earth.Adams throws so many curveballs and insane elements at us at once that it's difficult to know what to expect when you turn each page.There's no sense in trying to explain the impact on the plot of a Vogon construction fleet, a ship powered by an Improbability Drive, or the long sought after answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything. You just have to read it.This might sound like the book itself is confusing, but that's actually not true. Adams has a way of explaining the inexplicable in a way that makes it, if not completely logical, at least entertaining.I highly recommend this book, especially to a young teen reader who might be looking for some answers that aren't in the rule book. This book might not have the answers either, but at least it raises the questions. Or maybe it doesn't even raise the questions so much as make us laugh about the results.Or something like that.Anyway, this is a must-read. I can only hope that the impending movie does it justice."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"One would believe that Earth is a normal planet in a normal otherwise insignificant solar system along with other normal planets with no normal intelligent life. However, Arthur Dent is about to learn much more about Life, the Universe, and Everything than any other Earthling ever will. This is mostly because his planet is soon blown up, his best friend happens to be an alien named Ford Prefect, and he has been living on a planet that was really the most intelligent super computer ever created and was run by mice. Although Arthur gets past the fact that he almost dies on two occasions and has a fish living in his ear, he never gets past the fact that he has no idea what is going to happen next. He and his friend then become \\"hitchhikers\\" and get picked up by a criminal named Zaphod Beeblebrox, who just happens to be Ford's cousin. After all of these incredibly bizarre and improbable things happen, Arthur learns his destiny as part of the genius super computer called the \\"Earth\\" that was created to find the Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything. But will he be able to escape the cops, whale and flower missiles, and mad mice that want the Question more than a run on the exercise wheel?"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Not long ago, I read The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and i. was pleasantly surprised about how much I enjoyed reading it. Everything from the writing to the concept it embodies had me positively spellbound.This book is about a dispossessed earth-man named Arthur Dent and the tremendous effect he is having on the universe. After narrowly escaping from the destruction of the Earth with his friend Ford Prefect whom he had believed to be from earth but turned out to be from a small planet somewhere in the area of Betelgeuse, they travel around the galaxy together meeting up with a large ensemble of friends along the way. The whole series of books follow Arthur Dent's journeys around the galaxy taking him to many mysterious places such as the ancient planet of Magrathea, and to a very strange planet named Brontital in a synthetic universe in one of the offices of the MegaDodo Publications (the home of the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy) on Alpha Centurai. And also to pre-historic earth to see the cavemen wiped out by a bunch of telephone sanitizes.The whole series is completely astounding and to think it all came out of the mind of Douglas Adams; the creator of the television show, the radio show and the author of all five novels. I would firmly advise this book to anyone who enjoys to read science fiction. Even if you do not ordinarily like sci-fi usually, there is a good chance you will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book is one of the best books I have read in a while.

I went and bought his complete works, he is one of my favorite authors now."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book is a surprisingly quick and easy read. Douglas Adams' sarcasm, wit, and subtle (or sometimes not-so-subtle, but outright ridiculous) humor make for an afternoon's delightful entertainment. On the surface the story seems random and shallow. There is very little character development, if any at all. Basically, how the characters are introduced when they first appear is how they'll stay -- the reluctant, anxious Arthur; the zany Zaphod; the hopelessly depressed and cynical Marvin -- they remain in their molds throughout the story. The plot also appears to be just barely existent. We know that Zaphod is searching for something, but even he doesn't know what it is, and whatever it happens to be, who cares? -- we never find it anyway. The \\"fight scenes\\" in the story seem to be more of a spoof or parody than anything else. \\"We don't want to shoot you!\\" \\"Well, that suits me just fine!\\" Adams also pokes fun at things we hold near and dear to our hearts, such as government (ha!), philosophy (ha ha!), and poetry (wha?). The chapter on the philosophers literally had me laughing out loud. No matter who you are, there's got to be SOME kind of humor in here for you!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I had read this book quite some time ago, and I somehow misplaced it over the years.

A great book and a great product combine.....let me get my towel!!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"My interest with this series of books began when I started with the Time Warner Cable National Division. The trainer, who had just started as well, created a Hitchhiker's Guide to Cable(we still use this reference today). The test accounts in our billing system were built with the character names from this book. So, I watched the movie and loved it. I promptly purchased the Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and placed it on my bookshelf. It sat there for 4 years until Saturday when I choose it for my next book using a very complicated system called the alphabet(Adams, Douglas).That said, I must tell you that I love Stephen Fry. His reading of this book was so perfect. What a lovely man. And what a lovely, hilarious book. Mr. Adams, I wish you were still with us."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I read this as a boy and now my daughter (10) and I listen to it on Books on Tape on long trips: we laugh hard and long every time. Now we are reading it together before she goes to bed every night and it is an absolute hoot. Fall-down funny! Seeing and hearing her laughter at the very jokes that still amuse me if one of life's great pleasures.I love the laid-back swinger's voice that Ford Prefect adopts, the twisted logic of his arguments, Dent's continual flusteredness, the digressions, everything about the book.I have to think that Adams himself must have been a great friend and lover of life. Can't say enough good about the book or its author.Reading it now, and this will seem like a stretch, I am reminded of The Lord of the Rings. Many people have commented on Tolkien's ability to make Middle Earth seem like a land steeped in a history and literature of its own by citing scraps of poetry and historical figures without completely explaining them. Adams' digressions have the same effect, in a comic key (a great example of this is the description of Old Janx Spirit at the beginning of the book, and the blues-ish ditty of which it was the subject). This style makes an otherwise simple tale much more absorbing than a bare retelling of the plot would suggest.I envy anyone who is opening this book for the first time."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I had high hopes for this book, and it met them all. There is a story in here somewhere, as an undercover alien rescues his buddy just before Earth gets destroyed, then they hitch a ride on a crazy new spaceship, but the plot is not what provides the pleasure in this book. Adams had me laughing out loud multiple times with his nearly-nonsensical asides. For example, there's a tense scene, and all of the characters are transfixed on something Very Important, but one of the minor characters starts humming ironically because he hates everyone else so much. Just one line, never followed up anywhere, but it's a brilliant way to get a laugh while engaging in consistent characterization. There's also a deliciously absurd chapter about how one line of dialogue gets caught up in a space-time wormhole thing and starts a massive galactic war and leads to a charmingly unsuccessful invasion of Earth. This book didn't teach me any Valuable Life Lessons or enrich my view of Life, the Universe, and Everything, but it made me laugh a great deal, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Now I look forward to reading other books in the \\"trilogy.\\""},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy is a book that takes us all around the universe through the life of two hitchhikers. The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy is written by Douglas Adams. The general purpose of the book is that humans are not the smartest beings in the universe or even the planet. The intended audience would be teenagers to adults. People who are looking for an interesting science fiction book should read this book because, it is very interesting, and because of all the events in the book it makes the reader not want to stop reading.This Science Fiction book has one of the most unbelievable plots, I have ever read. It starts off with Arthur Dent, the main character of the book, and he has just found out his house is being demolished for a highway system. At the very same time this even occurs, Vogons(aliens) are getting ready to destroy earth for a hyper-drive system. Only seconds from extinction, Arthur's friend, Ford Prefect, grabs on to him, and hitchhikes onto the Vogon ship. This jump to the ship, sets Arthur and Ford, on an amazing journey. Ford meets an old friend Zaphod, and Arthur meets Trillian, a girl he met at a party on Earth."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I didn't expect to laugh out loud reading this.

The perfect mix of science fiction and humor, it cannot fail to throw you into pangs of laughter."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"As I was reading this, I said, \\"Man, this book is almost over already. How in the world is it going to be wrapped up in the last 3 pages?\\" Well, it doesn't get wrapped up. Its one of those deals where you have to read the whole series for stuff to get wrapped up. I usually hate those kinds of books, and I'm also not a big fan of Sci-Fi books in general, but this book was quite funny in certain places and I got a kick out of reading it. I particularly liked the part where the police officers discussed how they were really sensitive literary people during their big shoot out.I wouldn't be surprised if I finished the entire Hitchhiker series because the first book is pretty funny as far as written works go, and I would imagine the whole series would move as fast as this book does. I was kind of hoping it would be more surreal and less funny like the Neverending Story, but I still found it to be quite enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"One of the few books I find laugh-out-loud funny. Each time I read it, it still makes me chuckle. Sure, it's a little lacking in the plot department, but Adams can show us the humour in things we've taken for granted like no other author I know. An eternal favourite."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I found a battered copy of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy amoung piles of dusty old books in my parent's basement, and have been in love ever since. A work of shear genius, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (H2G2 to diehard fans) has become a cult classic. Douglas Adams has an inimitable comic wit that shines through in everything he writes.

I find that the experience of having read it, connects me to so many people in such a variety of backgrounds. High school students, PhD professors, Americans, Norwegians, Buddhists and Muslims. People in Japan, in Egypt -- people in so many walks of life connect with Douglas Adams references.It is such a great experience as a book that the world can gain Douglas Adams references. We describe the inadequacy of the administration systems in our college by talking about how the main character in Hitchhiker's Guide had gone round to see the display department. He finally found the plans in a locked lavatory with a sign that said, &quot;Beware of Leopard.&quot;That's the display department.It was dark.Well the lights had gone.So had the stairs.This book comically captures the world we are living it. It is a great relief from what has gone wrong with the whole modernity plan. It mocks religious conflict, overbearing leadership and failed communications. To keep your sanity in the modern world, read this book."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"If you took the dry humor of Joseph Heller and the unique science fiction of Kurt Vonnegut, you would be near an understanding of what this book is. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a bit of fresh air from most other Science Fiction. Everything from Existentialism to Asimov's Foundation series is hilariously scrutinized by the metaphysical universe that Adams used for the setting of this story. The humor of this book reminds me most of the story-lines on the Simpsons. The action of this book requires the reader to suspend his disbelief. This book is so grossly absurd that it almost seems to parallel some of the problems of modern life. In the end, this book shows that while most of these problems will never be overcome, there will always be fodder to poke humor at, and that's at least a start."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Absolute genius! I first read the series when I was about 14 (20 years ago, or so) It was engaging and entertaining then. Since then, I've read any other Adams literature I could get hold of. Any shape or form you can use to experience this, do it! Old BBC TV broadcasts, or the radio series - all excellent entertainment. I just re-read the series, upon Mr. Adams' passing, and realized how much it really had changed my perceptions. While not earth-moving, Mr. Adams has succeeded in making me look just a little sideways at any 'scientific certainty'. Its a great book / series, currently reminds me a bit of Scott Adams' Dilbert in comedic sensibility, with Star Trek science (and pseudo-science), tempered with dry British wit."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The hitchhiker &quot;trilogy&quot; is a wonderful series, from a wonderful author, one who recently died. His death is truly tragic."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is one of few books that I have enjoyed reading. It is a mixture of humor and science fiction correlated through a strong, but somewhat confusing, plot. Douglas Adams, the famous writer who incorporates humor into sci-fi, is the writer of this fantastically written novel about a character by the name of Arthur Dent and his adventure around the universe. He is miraculously saved from the earth's destruction by one of his friend's. Arthur never knew his friend was an alien until this day. His friend, Ford Perfect, is an alien who has been trapped on earth for fifteen years; originally he came to earth for research, in order to expand The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. The story continues and Ford Perfect saves Arthur's life from the destruction of earth. They hitchhike a ride on a Vogon ship; Vogons hate hitchhikers. Ultimately the Vogons throw Arthur and Ford out of their ship. In the mere ten seconds they have, to survive in outer space, the most improbable phenomena occur. The Heart of Gold, a new ship designed with the new Improbability Drive engine, saves Arhur Dent's and Ford Prefect's lives from the vacuum of space. Amazingly, the person in charge of the ship is Zaphod Beeblebrox, President of the Imperial Galactic Government. In his kindness and generosity, he allows the two hitchhikers to stay on board. The story picks its' pace from this point on. Douglas Adams wrote a book that would not only interest the young and feeble mind, but also the mature and intellectual mind as well. His well-developed characters and great sense of detail throughout the book really makes the reader become part of the novel. The confusion the reader feels towards the storyline of the book is directly proportional to the confusion Arthur Dent has with his surrounding. By making creating a sense of confusion around the reader, Douglas Adams does a wonderful job of presenting Arthur Dent's character. Another well-developed character in the book is Ford Perfect, the researcher of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. This character is the \\"know it all\\" type of character. He is the one that guides Arthur to his confusion about everything around him. Whenever Arthur asks Ford a questions, he gets an answer that confuses him, as well as the reader, even more. This sense of confusion and intellectuality between the two central characters is very unique and interesting. In addition to a well-developed character line and plot, the book targets the reader's weak understanding of life and the universe, creating a sense of mystery for which the reader ponders to unravel. The only weakness this book has is its confusing plot. But the reader will get used to this after he/she reads the first couple of chapters. As a teenager, I believe that this book is an excellent choice for any age group. People can have hours of fun reading it. It is full of comedy, action, and suspense. Once you pick it up, you will not want to drop it down. As of the answer to the most fascinating question of all time, the answer to everything, well, you will have to read the book to figure out this one for yourself."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"It's hard to argue that this book isn't painfully funny (unless you happen to be painfully unimaginative), but I found this book to be especially wonderful for it's sharp satire and philisophical statements. I guess you may call them anti-philisophical statements because it makes the reader view life with a new sense of it's intrinsic absurdity. My favorite character is Arthur Dent, and throughout the book he is continually disparaged as some sort of simpleton. However, throughout the course of the series, we are subtley made aware of Arthur's virtues in contrast to the other characters, and in particualr, the Guide. Adams makes them so seemingly complex, that they are in fact utterly ridiculous and nearly pointless. He applies this same logic to life in general. It is chaotic, absurd, and often pointless, so like Arthur, you might as well enjoy a good cup of tea."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Intriguing! Well-developed characters, understandable plot, this book has it all! It's about hitchhikers traveling through the universe. There are billions of planets and one digital book explains all of them, plus everything else in the universe. The book starts with the Earth blowing up. There is someone named Ford from another planet who is on Earth and he grabs his friend and gets on one of the spaceships that is blowing the earth up. They are thrown into space but Ford's cousin, Zaphod picks them up with the spaceship he stole. Then they continue to travel the universe together with Trillion (an earth woman), Arthur, (Ford's friend) and Marvin, a robot. I loved Douglas Adams' writing style! The descriptions were a little weak, but it is fun to imagine what characters and objects look like. Whether you like science fiction or not I think you will like this book."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"\\"The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy\\" is a truly remarkable book.\\" This is a statement repeated many times throughout the book. No, Douglas Adams wasn't commenting on his novel, but the \\"standard repository of all knowledge and wisdom\\" that exists within it. It contains everything from how to mix your own Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster, a popular alcoholic drink that gives you the feeling that you're, \\"having your brains smashed out by a slice of lemon wrapped round a large gold brick,\\" to explaining just how useful a towel is to the average hitchhiker. All of this exists within Douglas Adams's The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, an even more remarkable book which is clever, hilarious, and will keep anyone amused for hours.The story unfolded very quickly when it zoomed in on Arthur Dent, a very ordinary man, as he was told by his friend Ford Prefect-who he just found out was an alien-that the world was going to be demolished in roughly twelve minutes. It just keeps getting better from there.Adams created a wide variety of personalities for his characters. Arthur Dent was a normal man that was quite happy with his dull, quiet life on Earth. He never really adjusted to being a hitchhiker. Zaphod Beeblebrox, an alien, however, was the joking, impulsive President of the Imperial Galactic Government. He was rather full of himself and didn't tend to worry. To illustrate yet another personality, there is Marvin, the depressed robot. Marvin never had a positive outlook on anything. Ford Prefect was the easygoing semi-cousin to Zaphod. He is just guy who liked to \\"go with the flow.\\" These are just a few example of Adams's genius when it comes to creating characters.Douglas Adams had a brilliant imagination. One example of his creativity was in his description of the Vogon poetry. It was the third worst that ever existed, barely passed up by Poet Master Grunthos the Flatulent whose poem was entitled, \\"Ode to a Small Lump of Green Putty I Found in My Armpit One Midsummer Morning.\\" I can't think of many authors that published something like that.The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a novel that could be enjoyed by anyone. Most of the humor is easy to understand, and everything is appropriate for people of all ages. Even younger children could appreciate the humor and the interesting characters. The novel is great for people with strong imaginations as well. Having an open mind is rather important while reading it, however, since it could be described as strange. It seems to appeal more to \\"geeky\\" people. Despite this, I thought it was a great book; everyone that I know that has read it loved it just as much as I did.Overall, Adams was remarkably successful with his The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. I have never read a book that had such original ideas and characters; the storyline was unpredictable and I was constantly being surprised. I savored every minute I spent reading this novel. Anyone who loves reading, and even some who don't, would love this clever, entertaining, and, \\"truly remarkable book.\\""},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I had put off reading \\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\" for several years because it was something that many people talked about but that few had read. I assumed that if that were the case, the book couldn't be that good.I now regret the choice not to read the book until now. Not only is the book an engaging, easy read it also is very funny and gives some very good \\"quote lines\\" that you can use in later conversations - as long as the others you are talking to have read the book also.The very first page of the book grabbed me and held me until I was finished with it a few hours later. I knew I would like the book when the author, Douglas Adams, starts out talking about the end of the earth and how a girl had finally figured out how to solve the earth's problems only to tell us it didn't matter because the earth was going to be destroyed. Luckily, he said it in a much funnier way and the rest of the book followed closely with the same humor and great writing.I would definitely recommend this book to anyone. It is something you should be able to finish at most in a couple of days of reading and is well worth the time it takes to read it."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This is a great book. I never would have thought than anyone could blend science fiction and humor. Actually, this book is more of a humor book with science fiction thrown in.This book follows the travels of Arthur Dent, as the world gets destroyed, and he gets miraculously saved and whisked away into an outer space adventure.I really enjoy Douglas Adam's writing style.

The combination of science fiction (sorta) and irreverent, Pythonesque humor, was a revelation to me when I first picked up this book, and it continues to be a source of enjoyment and pleasure as the years go by.If you don't know the basics of this book by now, I'm surprised. But to recap: first, the Earth is destroyed. Hilarity ensues.And I'm not kidding.This series of books, as they careen through the galaxy, into the past and the far-future, introduce you to paranoid, depressed robots, wacked-out sentient elevators, torture devices hooked up to fairy-cake, and entire planets destroyed because they have exceeded the \\"shoe event horizon,\\" always entertained me; no small feat. The characters are interesting, can be related to and, despite the comedic tone, stick with you like the best characters do. The adventures are ridiculous and riotous, but good clean fun.If you want spaceships that are dank and furnished with old mattresses, or space captains that have baths on the bridge, or aliens that have all the sex appeal of a road accident, this is the book for you. If not, give it a miss, and you're poorer thereby, but it's your life. And above all, of course, don't panic."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"It really depends on who you are whether you would want to panic or not.Hitchhikers, starts off confusing because Adams' writing is , how to put it , insane, to a first time reader, But thats not necessarily a bad thing.

Don't break the stratosphere without one.This book is loads of fun. Besides a quick read, it contains some now famous scenes (almost ubiquitous depending on the circles one runs in). The super computer \\"Deep Thought\\" (a tongue in cheek reference if ever one existed) gives its infamous answer to the \\"ultimate question\\" of \\"life, the universe, and everything\\". Earth gets marked for destruction to clear the way for a \\"hyperspatial express route\\" (but not everyone inhabiting earth comes from earth, or are what they seem). The universe has an irresponsible meglomaniac amoral president (Zaphod Beeblebrox). A man named Slatibartfast gets rebuked for creating fjords in the new Africa. A depressed robot lays facedown in the mud dejected after causing a spaceship to commit suicide. A whale spends its final moments before meteoring onto the surface of the legendary planet of Magrathea. The Improbability Drive of a super space ship creates... well... the improbable.

A \\"Hitchhiker\\" is the equivalent of an interstellar train jumper. Ford Prefect fits this job description perfectly. He found himself stranded on earth as a result of his hitchhiking. Here he meets Arthur Dent, a seemingly average inhabitant of planet earth. Arthur's house stands in the path of a hungry bulldozer, but Ford Prefect tells him not to worry because \\"the world is ending\\" in about twelve minutes. Great characters, scenes, and ingenious plot devices abound as the pages rapidly turn.The book also has a philosophical dimension. It makes our planet seem like a small, insignificant speck in a manner similar to Voltaire's \\"Micromegas\\". Consequently, it also makes the universe seem like a vast, enormous, incomprehensible mass (which it is). Human insignifigance gets handled, as it should be handled, with humor. This probably explains why the book gets quoted in many philosophical texts: these passages can take some of the edge off of a bare examination of the human condition. So all those struggling with the absurdity of it all should look here for solace and a good laugh. Even those seeking just a good laugh should look here. Just read it already!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I found myself smirking and nodding knowingly a lot more than laughing out loud as I read this book. It is in no way an out-and-out humorous story. Instead, Douglas Adams has found himself a solid science-fiction platform from which to write a witty and surprisingly insightful social commentary.You'll recognize all sorts of people from your life in the characters in this book. You'll also find yourself thinking on a regular basis about the insights into our day-to-day existence that Adams manages to capture so cleverly and them turn on their ear.Intelligent, witty, insightful and highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"this story is about the worst thursday ever known to man.

With a twistedly awsome plot, great cynical monty python style humor, intelligently funny. I didnt read the summary or hear anything about it until i had started it, so i was expecting a serious storyline, hah, I was pleasently suprised. Events are based on made up physics, so you are no longer bothered by inconsistant ideas that dont fit into the writers idea of reality. If you are not easily offended, and you have an semi-intelligent sence of humor, you will fall in love with this book, only problem, TOO SHORT, i guess thats why there is about 5 books in this increasingly inacurately named \\"trilogy\\" Like It, Love it, want some more of it.Code-man out"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I realize that it being the year 2011 and having never read The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy makes me a bit of an anomaly in the matrix. I saw the movie and thought it was mediocre and I just assumed that the book would be likewise. After being urged by a friend to give this book a shot, I finally did and here I am finally reviewing this book which turned out to be a pleasant surprise.By now, most of mankind knows the plot [(although the amusing thing is, there really isn't one :)]. Seconds before the Earth is destroyed, a human named Arthur Dent is plucked off the planet by his friend Ford Prefect. As it turns out, Prefect has been stranded on Earth for over 15 years, posing as an out-of-work actor while doing research for the revised edition of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.Dent and Prefect leave earth and begin to go on a intergalactic journey full of twists and turns while being picked up by the Heart of Gold, a ship which houses the might Improbability Drive that naturally helps transport them across galaxies faster than the speed of light. The rest of the characters include a two-headed, three-armed hippie who happens to be the president of the galaxy; Trillian, whom Arthur tried to pick up at a Earth cocktail party; and Marvin, a weary, depressed and highly intelligent robot.As I mentioned earlier, there isn't a particularly deep plot to this book which is what makes it such a unique blend of sci-fi, comedy, and philosophy. Douglas Adams spares no expense in poking fun at science fiction and some of it's clich&eacute;s such as asking the menacing guards on alien ships if they are truly happy with their jobs and if not why don't they just quit and find another profession? Of course, the deep philosophical questions of our existence are not spared by Adams either. Deep Thinker, a supercomputer that takes a total of 7.5 million years to answer Life's greatest questions and then another 2.5 million years for its successor to come up with a question to the original answer, lol.As others have said, you don't even have to be a science-fiction fan to really appreciate this book. Just be prepared for some of the quirkiest and oddball comedy you've ever read!-Travis S"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I put off reading The Hitchhiker's Guide for many, many years, for fear I would not enjoy it. The book only seemed palatable to those who loved sci-fi, or belonged to an older generation. While both of those groups may certainly well like the book, I now realize that my scope was far too narrow, as I thoroughly enjoyed the book, and regret not having read it sooner.The story follows London native Arthur Dent, a sort of hapless \\"any-man,\\" who, with the help his good friend Ford Prefect, is whisked into space seconds before the demise of planet Earth. Dent and Prefect are taken on a galactic journey across the universe, as life's biggest questions are attempted to be answered.The writing is very witty, with sharp, clever dialog, and fun, well-developed characters. But even more memorable than the book's humor is the prevalent, if not overt, social, political, and religious commentary throughout. It becomes clear Adams has written this novel as a means of showing us ourselves, so as we laugh at the silliness of the plot and characters, the joke is truly on us.Now I will fearlessly delve into the next book of this series, excited to see where the story continues. And maybe I'll declare my joy of sci-fi after all."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"A most remarkable book, full of humour and wisdom not found in current sci fi novels.I would recommend this to anyone."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book is a surprisingly quick and easy read. Douglas Adams' sarcasm, wit, and subtle (or sometimes not-so-subtle, but outright ridiculous) humor make for an afternoon's delightful entertainment. On the surface the story seems random and shallow. There is very little character development, if any at all. Basically, how the characters are introduced when they first appear is how they'll stay -- the reluctant, anxious Arthur; the zany Zaphod; the hopelessly depressed and cynical Marvin -- they remain in their molds throughout the story. The plot also appears to be just barely existent. We know that Zaphod is searching for something, but even he doesn't know what it is, and whatever it happens to be, who cares? -- we never find it anyway. The \\"fight scenes\\" in the story seem to be more of a spoof or parody than anything else. \\"We don't want to shoot you!\\" \\"Well, that suits me just fine!\\" Adams also pokes fun at things we hold near and dear to our hearts, such as government (ha!), philosophy (ha ha!), and poetry (wha?). The chapter on the philosophers literally had me laughing out loud. No matter who you are, there's got to be SOME kind of humor in here for you!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book was one of the best I've read in a long time. It goes to show that maybe your planet blowing up isn't so bad after all! Throughout the story I laughed out loud multiple times. It has many hilarious quotes throughout the book but my personal favorite is \\"It says that the effect of drinking a Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster is like having your brains smashed out by a slice of lemon wrapped round a large gold brick.\\" I would recommend this to many people, but if you are very religious, some things might offend you. Overall the book was amazing. I am definately going to buy the other books soon!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Not that this is a kid's book. This book is just so engaging and funny and is just perfect for keeping the cynicism of teenagerdom at bay for a bit, that it's a great gift for a difficult to buy for age.I've read it so many times, I sometimes forget that parts of it haven't actually happened to me.My brother and I quote from it liberally; from the whole series, to be fair.Other reviewers have reviewed the text admirably, so I'll only add that I think this book should be required reading in all middle/junior high schools."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This was an interesting read. If you are looking for something decidedly different, this may be worth a look.The story follows the misadventures of Arthur Dent. In the beginning, Arthur loses his house and his world in the same day. The Earth is destroyed by a fleet of bureaucratic Vogons, making way for a galactic freeway. Fortunately for him, Arthur is rescued by his alien friend, Ford Prefect. The two of them then fall into a variety of improbable situations, eventually learning the ultimate answer to life, the universe, and everything.This book is really short and should take no time for someone to buzz through. The storytelling was vivid, unique, and downright hilarious at times. The manner in which the author narrates is generally when the book is at its funniest, so I now find it odd that they tried to make a movie out of this. People should be aware that the humor is most definitely British.My biggest complaint with the novel is the overabundance of the weird hard-to-pronounce names and the mind-numbing technical jargon (which really isn't technical). Sometimes it appears the author is having so much fun with a particular joke that he forgets to let the audience in on it.All in all, Hitchhiker's Guide was a fun little read. I may just pick up Mr. Adam's second book, but I'm certainly not desperate for it."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Arthur Dent is a more or less normal English chap who is currently occupied with protesting the imminent destruction of his house for the purpose of constructing a bypass. Arthur's friend, Ford Prefect, has still bigger concerns. Unbeknownst to Arthur or anyone else, Ford is actually an alien (albeit a humanoid one) who has been basically stranded on Earth for the last 15 years. Ford's original aim was to spend a couple of weeks gathering information about Earth in order to update the book for which he is a roving researcher. The book in question is, of course, \\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.\\" However, the time for leaving is well-nigh and Ford takes Arthur along thereby saving him from a fate worse than domicile demolition.As they travel throughout space, the duo meets several interesting life forms and learns a variety of shocking facts. For example, Arthur learns that humans were only the third most intelligent form of life on Earth. Eventually, they even learn the answer to the \\"Great question of Life, the Universe and Everything.\\"I had some initial trepidation about reading this novel since its reputation has most certainly preceded it. I find that it's often easy to be disappointed by \\"cult classics.\\" However, this story has reached such a wide audience, that it can no longer really be considered \\"cult.\\" There is indeed a Vonnegut-like quality to much of this novel. Anyone who has read \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" will certainly recognize a stylistic similarity. Early in the book we are introduced to an alien race called the Vogons. We are told that on their planet \\"elegant gazellelike\\" creatures existed that the Vogons would catch and sit upon. It is then explained that \\"They were no use as transport because their backs would snap instantly, but the Vogons would sit on them anyway.\\" Aside from some dated cracks about digital watches, this book is leavened with humor that generally stands the test of time. The brevity as well as the fact that it takes neither itself nor science fiction too seriously makes this a book worth reading and accessible to those who wouldn't think of picking up anything written by Arthur C. Clarke or watching a Star Trek re-run."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I bought this for my mother-in-law for her birthday. She was going on a trip.

The theme is probablyjustice, because Trillian, Zaphod, Ford, Marvin, andespecially Arthur face injustice, and go against it.

(Did I spell that right?) I had a few good chuckels with this one. I like how the author, Douglas Adams, sometimes strayed from the plot, wich was a nice break from the story. I could relate to the main character, Arther Dent, who was just a normal guy who got swept off his feet into a world were the impossable can happen. The style of writting is excelent and makes ful use of the interesting settings and events. I liked the supporting characters, too. Each had their own destinct view on life and the universe. The Bad: The main character didn't interact withe the supporting cast enouf. He barly even talked with one of the most interesting character. I would have liked them to continue fighting and not getting along. Aurther Dent is to normal. He should have had more to do with the story. I felt like the author was just using him as a camera, to take pictours and not to interact withe the world.

At others, like watching a Monty Python sketch that drags way too long."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"\\"There's an infinite number of monkeys outside who want to talk to us about this script for Hamlet they've worked out\\"Arthur Dent wakes up to find a construction crew outside his house, waiting to demolish it for a bypass. Little does he know, a Vogon construction fleet is outside his planet, waiting to demolish it for a hyperspace lane. Fortunately, Arthur's friend, an alien from a planet in the vicinity of Betelgeuse, Ford Prefect, lends a hand and the two hitchhike away from Earth moments before its destruction. This is their journey.I Liked:The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a classic, the perfect blend of comedy and scifi fun. Adams is acutely aware of scifi stereotypes and what makes people laugh and has blended them to perfection.Our protagonist/hero, Arthur Dent, is a complete deconstruction of the \\"hero\\", the man who can elbow his way into everything and come out on top with ladies fondling him. Arthur is completely at the whims of chance and his friend, Ford. It's delightfully funny to see his reaction to being the third most intelligent life form on Earth and how positively useless he is to the Heart of Gold.Ford Prefect is a delightful \\"sidekick\\", who ends up being way more helpful and useful than most sidekicks. It is he who saves Arthur Dent, it is he who attempts to find ways out of scrapes, it is he who sticks his neck out on the line.Zaphod Beeblebrox is a kick in the pants to those who are interested even passingly in politics. I find it a riot how his job as president is to focus attention AWAY from those who have power. My absolute favorite line of his is \\"If there's anything more important than my ego around, I want it caught and shot now.\\"Trillian is your stereotypical damsel in distress/buxom lady, only she isn't either. A passing comment suggest she may be a physicist and a mathematician--far better than Arthur, whose only job is to \\"whine about Earth\\" (my poor attempt to render the book's words) and restate the obvious. She is competent, adventurous, smart, and not another objectified woman (though she certainly wasn't ugly, her beauty is not the primary attribute she has).The story seems rather simplistic, but I found it a riot, which is what I believe was Adams intent (that, and a satire to our world). Arthur worrying about his house being destroyed when Earth is minutes from destruction makes him seem rather petty; seeing Zaphod race after Magrathea for the sole purpose of fame and money shows his shallowness and makes a funny statement to our constant pursuit of the purpose of life. Having mice manipulate humans shows how we are so eager to make ourselves more important than anyone else and our inability to see out of the box of our self-importance.I Didn't Like:The ending is a bit abrupt and kind of hokey. But then, you really can't critique the ending, given what the purpose of the novel is. When I listened to the audiobook, I found it challenging to figure out the Hitchhiker's entries and the story.Dialogue/Sexual Situations/Violence:Mild profanities.Trillian is Zaphod's girlfriend and travels with him on the Heart of Gold. Arthur attempted to go after her, but Zaphod whisked her away.Earth is destroyed. Vogons torture people with their poetry.Overall:If you want to laugh, if you like British humor, if you have read a lot of cheesy/70's scifi books, you need to read this book. Heck, if you like to laugh and like scifi, you at least need to try this out. It's funny, it knows what it is picking on, and it is clever. I also recommend listening to the audiobook where Douglas Adams himself reads the book. It's a delight to see how the author intends the book to be read.Brought to you by:*C.S.

As the plot thickens, Aurthur Dent, the main character, gets more confused and out of the loop, and keeps getting more confused throughout the series. Aurthur Dent is the last surviving human from Earth after the Vogons blow it up to make way for an interstellar bypass. Aurthur is led by his alien friend and fellow hitchhiker, Ford Prefect through the adventures this catastrophe leads to, but most importantly, he is guided by The Hitchhiker&#65533;s Guide to the Galaxy.

Well, Douglas Adams has done just that in this little book, and he alone rules this genre of sci-fi comedy. He has weaved together some wild futuristic scenarios using an improbability drive, the Vogons, the planet factory, the mice, and of course the guide - always with unpredictable British dry wit. The contrast of Zaphod (the care-free, figure-head galaxy President), Ford (the partying hitchhiker and reporter), Trillian (the mysterious woman), and Arthur (the bewildered last man on earth) is fantastic! Many sci-fi books have a robot, but how many are depressed and cynical? Guess what, Marvin is. Adams even throws in a some social commentary, which just makes you laugh at the way some things go around here. The fast-paced action and humor will always keep your attention as you learn why the earth was created and the answer to the question of the life, the universe, and everything.This book is a classic in both science fiction and comedy.

I suppose that my being cynical has much to do with my liking towards this book, but I think that if you're impressed with the way that he describes earth, in the begining of the book, than the rest will be a sure ride from there.If not, you can always sell it at a garage sale...but then again, who knows when you'll need a good mind teaser..."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Between his own tilted perspective and his sarcastic puns, I couldn't stop laughing. The smallest details provide the most interesting observations as well. Improbability is pushed to the limits with Arthur Dent and the unusual crew he meets when he escapes the Earth's Imminent Demise."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is about Ford Prefectand Arthur Dent, and their journey throu space and time.It's a very good book that every sience-fiction-freakshould read."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I read the whole 'trilogy' of five...and loved every syllable.

But a note of caution: Make sure you read all five, but do so in the RIGHT [chronological] order. Enjoy"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This is the story of an ordinary Englishman (complete with all the nuances and eccentricities that usually accompany) and his extraordinary companions from various other points in the galaxy. It is the story of the destruction of the Earth to make way for a hyper-space expressway. It is the story of the theft of a starship that has the ability to pass through all points in the known and unknown universe simultaneously (talk about the perpetuity for getting lost). It is also the story of the discovery that the goings on on the recently demolished planet Earth held a lot more universal significance than was generally thought by its former inhabitants - which isn't surprising considering that it is also revealed that those who thought they were the most intelligent beings on the planet were actually only the third most intelligent.Douglas Adams has the very unique gift of being able to successfully bend science fiction with British humor. His observations are hilarious, intelligent and are very true to life. He is also has the propensity to be able to show just how silly people can be as well as how dependent they can be on their technology.This book is the first in a trilogy of five books (please don't ask me to explain) including \`The Restaurant at the End of the Universe', \`Life, the Universe and Everything', and \`So Long, and Thanks For All the Fish' and now a fifth book entitled \`Mostly Harmless'. The story of \`The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy' is based upon a radio program Douglas Adams originally wrote for the BBC in the early 80's with some changes thrown in to solve some continuity problems as well as some back-story. There are also several books on the original radio scripts that are work checking out as well as condensed versions of the radio show that are available on various media.It's a must read for any fan of science fiction - especially anyone who enjoys British humor. It's one of those books that can be read over and over again without diminishing its freshness. In any incarnation, it is a very enjoyable series and well worth taking the time to enjoy."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"For readers not too enthusiastic about the vision of a futurehumanity trapped in a maze of the ultimate machines, Adams hasan optimistic insight, unusual for a science fiction writer.You can summarize it in a sentence: this ultimate machine,which will do everything and will make us practically dispensable -well, this machine will have a button, and this button won't work. For itwas built by this ridiculous remnant of those old times - Man.Or perhaps the machine will work, but won't do the thingswritten on its package. Or do them, but not exactly. Very not exactly.In a media enchanted with super technology and hyper machinesthere is nothing more refreshing than this basic insight, whichturns and flipps the narrative of the novel to the most unexpected,grotesque and hilarious directions, leading it to an orgyof the destruction of meaning.very funny and optimistic in it's weired way - maybe one of the fewways open to optimism in our all to serious world."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Every person who has even the slightest bit of nerd in them has been exposed to references from Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. People make references to it damn near constantly. Before reading it, I imagined what a wonderful story I must be missing out on. Finally, I got around to reading it for myself. The story itself is painfully dull and pointless. Adams' writing style is distracting and juvenile; not juvenile in a lighthearted storytelling sort of way way, but juvenile in way like it might literally have been written by someone in middle school. Names like Zaphod Beeblebrox and Slartibartfast for example. I imagine Adams sitting at his type writer trying to think of a name and not coming up with anything so he just starts speaking in tongues letting his mouth move about while doing an impression of Corky from Life Goes On. Eventually the random combination of palatal fricatives and lateral approximants formed these combinations of sounds at which point Adams shrugged his shoulders and said, 'Slatribarfast, good enough'.But it's not the writing style or the non-existent story that makes me hate the book. It's that before when I heard a reference to this book I would imagine the smart witty story that went along with it. I imagined the epic tale that was waiting for me someday when I actually got around to reading it. I looked forward to the day when I would get where the references fit in and smile knowingly along with those people who have read the book. Instead I will now frown when I hear those references. In a sense the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy really is stunningly hilarious, it's one big twisted joke like the infamous 'Man Eating Chicken.' I imagine that on the last page, of the last book Adams probably delivers the master punchline by revealing that anyone who made it that far is now infinitely aware of the horror that is Vogon poetry."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Oops. Did I just say that here? That can't be a very popular thing to say here, what with about 500 people giving it 5 star reviews. But again: Not That Funny. Well, now you're thinking that this guy just doesn't get it, has no sense of humor, etc. But I don't think that's it. I believe I have a good sense of humor; I think Monty Python and The Holy Grail is hilarious, as well as many other British comedies. I also like Science Fiction. I wanted to like the book; the concept is hilarious and it seems like it would be something I would really enjoy. But it is not done well. The biggest problem is that for the most part the laughs are far apart, and not all that funny. And it just doesn't work as SF without the humor. You should do yourself a favor and, before you buy it, read 5 or 10 pages next time you're at the bookstore. I'd bet that there will be a lot of you that aren't that impressed. If you're still reading this (and I have my doubts) let me recommend an alternative: Doorways In The Sand by Roger Zelazny. This has some similar elements to Hitchhiker's Guide (aliens posing as humans) and is witty, clever and highly readable. Zelazny at his peak. If you like Hitchhikers I promise you will like this."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Douglas Adams mixes dry British humor with science fiction to produce an astounding novel satirizing the arrogance of human beings on Earth. This novel is The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. This novel begins with Arthur Dent trying to stop bulldozers from destroying his home in order to build a new superhighway. He meets a guy named Ford Prefect. Prefect hitches a lift right before the Earth is demolished by alien Vogons. The author satirizes humans' trust in technology and philosophy in this story. He uses quirky phrases that are so stupid and out of this world one has to wonder what he was on while writing this novel. This novel causes me to laugh aloud. I think anyone who enjoys sarcasm and satire will love this book. It's easy to read once the science fiction is gotten past. This a great novel in order to appreciate twisted British humor."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book is about a normal man (Arthur), and an alien man (Ford) in their quest throughout the universe. These two men get swept off earth right before it turns into gravel for a highway. These two men then travel from ship to ship, and from planet to planet in the search to complete a book on everything.My favorite part of this book had to be when the two men where inside of a planet trying to get away from these guards. The guards had come after them because they where trying to protect a wanted man. During this scene though, the two cops where shooting at Ford, Arthur, and Zaphod. During the fire though the two parties where talking about how they shouldn't be shot and how they had to shoot at them. Soon this all stopped when the two cops had been shot in their air supply but something unknown.I would not recommend this book to people with an undeveloped sense of humor. This book includes many jokes for older people and many scenes that don't seemed to be finished. During this book you are reading in Fords' point of view then without realizing it you are now reading in Arthur's viewpoint. These sudden switches lead me to confusion and didn't allow me to see the moral of the story. After reading this book and kind of realizing some of the jokes and meanings, I realized the author has good ideas but i don't think he expresses them well. This caused me to not like the book and discouraged me from wanted to read any more of his books."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"If you've watched the movie, read the book.If you've read the book, don't watch the movie."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"What can we say about this book? Something that has so thoroughly entered the lexicon and mindset of the people in the late 20th century and early 21st century can only be regarded as a great book. It has had an incalculable effect on the genre of science-fiction. Deep Thought and HAL (of 2001, A Space Odyssey) have completely created the idea of artificial intelligence and a writer can't begin to write a phrase uttered by a computer intelligence without dealing with that reality. If it teaches the genre anything, it teaches it the importance of humor. We have said that some writers are too ugly: M. John Harrison's Light suffers from this; China Mieville's Perdido Street Station and The Scar suffer from this; the classic Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever suffered from this; hundreds of overly-pretentious, read-it-it's-good-for-you-just-like-broccoli books published every year all suffer from this same fact. Laughter is very, very important to the human condition and it can't be ignored successfully. It is wrong to dismiss The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy as a flight of fancy but ultimately unimportant; it is, in fact, tremendously instructive.WHO SHOULD READ:Everybody should read this book. Everybody. There really is no audience that it can't appeal to. Children as young as 12 or 13 can enjoy as equally as codgers in their 70's. The institutions that Adams was bashing so many years ago are just as relevant today. It's a slender book, a fast read, and widely respected and, as such, comes with a pedigree. We're not sure if the movie will be anywhere near as good as the books (though we have hopes given the success of the radio series) but to the extent that it inspires more sales of this book, so much the better for our world.WHO SHOULD PASS:There is a certain group of people--a people suffering from a strange psychiatric illness--that have no sense of humor. These are the people most often associated with enforcing political correctness. They are the people claiming offense and injury at all audible and epistolary provocation. They are the people who think children shouldn't run or laugh but sit still and silent until spoken to. They are the tragic wastrels of a life fiercely lived with a clutching, grasping notion of universal justice, imposing order (most often religious), and political retribution. They are the people who leave shopping carts abandoned in the parking lots because \\"those people\\" are paid to put them away. Douglas Adams will be entirely lost on these individuals. They should return to reading whatever hate-inspired literature that teaches them to abhor who they are, where they live, and that people exist at all.READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"A colleague had a line from the movie made from this book in his signature block at work. I just let it pass, not putting much thought into it.Later a friend and I were discussing books we have read, and wanted to read. He asked me if I had read the 5 books in this trilogy, and when I said no, he said I had to put that at the top of my &quot;to do&quot; list.I ordered the books, and when they arrived I started reading. I enjoyed every page. Douglas Adams took what we know as life, subjected it to his sense of humor, applied it to space travel and life. What resulted was one of the funniest and at times, thought provoking books I have ever read. By letting us see ourselves through Ford's eyes we can see some of the bizarre parts of our lives here on Earth.I would highly recommend this book, and the rest of the series to anyone who enjoys reading. They are sci-fi (which I don't like at all), but that is a very small part of the storyline. If you wished, you could imagine the travelers traveling from country to country on Earth, with a few minor exceptions.The next time I talk to my friend who recommended these books, I will have to thank him very gratefully."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The book I read was entitled The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, by Douglas Adams. I am so glad that my english teacher, who shall remain nameless, recommended this book. It was an excellent book. The storyline kept me so hooked that I enjoyed reading every bit of it. The characters were very unique and humorous at the same time. Now Douglas Adams isn't any ordinary writer, Adams had an unusual way of writing conversations. This only made it better though. From what I hear, almost every book has a theme, but I could not find the theme in this book. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, in my opinion, was a book writen only to make others laugh, not to teach a lesson. One of my favorite conversations in this book was,\\"You want me,\\" said Prosser, spelling out this new thought to himself, \\"to come and lie there...\\"\\"Yes.\\"\\"In front of the bulldozer?\\"\\"Yes.\\"\\"Instead of Mr. Dent.\\"\\"Yes.\\"\\"In the mud.\\"\\"In, as you say, the mud.\\" -p.17.This conversation went on and on and kept me laughing the entire time. I would have to recommend this book to others for a number of reasons. The most important reason is the fact that this is one of the only books that I have ever read that actually made me laugh. I would definatly have to say that this book is one of my favorite books right now. I used to hate reader so much, that the mere sight of a book got me angry. After reading this book, I probably will never hate reading again. This book makes reading fun. Another reason is that this is a book that my namless english teacher enjoyed reading as well, therefore making it teacher approved. If I ever had, or wanted to read this book again, I would probably enjoy it just as much as the first time, and I am sure you would too."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This novel is a wonderfully paced comical satire on ... life the universe and everything. Filled superb writing and quirky storyline this book is short enough to read in one day. Thankfully there are four sequels in this trilogy there is no shortage of adventures and insane situations for Arthur, Zaphod, Ford, Trillian, Marvin and whoever is met page to page. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys rambling humor. While the book is confusing, it only makes you want to turn the pages more. The writing style reminded me of Joseph Heller. I may be one of a handful of people who have ever compared Heller to Adams, but the irreverence and the quick chatter gave me a definite feel of Heller. One of these reviews said that this book was a great work of British comedy, don't let that scare you, it is really a great work of comedy. Also don't let the Science Fiction genre scare you either. This novel is so snappy and &quot;plausible&quot; that you get so caught up in the characters and story that you forget it is science fiction.Thanx for your time.T"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"How can anyone NOT read Douglas Adams and like it? Let me rephrase that. How can anyone NOT read Douglas Adams? The man is the master, and I mean the MASTER of science fiction/comedy literature at it's best.

He is saved by his friend Ford Prefect, an alien who has been stranded on earth for 15 years while trying to write an update to the now outdated Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

Looking back, this first book was one of the more hilarious of the five. It is characterized by Adams' traditional zany style of humor (prevalent in the first 3, not so much in the last 2).The best part of this book is being introduced to the wonderful cast of characters that Adams has created, especially Arthur and Marvin. If you have a sense of humor, they will make you laugh. There's not much of a plot to speak of, which is the book's major weakness. However, it is an appropriate setup to the rest of the series, and I would definitely advise everyone to at least read this initial installment before plunging into any of the other installments.My advice: read it. Expect a classic, but don't expect the greatest that Adams has to offer (that, in my humble opinion, would be the fourth book, SLATFATF)."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This is a book about a book.

The one thing that I noticed about this book was it's so great that you read it really fast, and when u finish you wish you hadn't read it as fast as you did.Anyway I've never Read anything like this book and probably never will again.

Why? It mercilessly exposes the hypocrisy and humor of everything in human society, from the ridiculous to the sacred. Examples - the ridiculousness of atheism (Babel fish), inherent human supremacy (dolphins and fiendishly clever mice), ethical conundrums (Lintilla), engineers (Zlarty Bartfast), egomaniacal thieves (Zaphod Beeblebrocks), economists (defoliating the planet to increase the value of the leaf as currency), philosophers (the Babel fish again), inefficiency of governments (the destruction of the Earth), and myriad others. I have gotten more enjoyment from this book than almost anything else I have ever read. It is also worth every cent to purchase the BBC audio adaptation of the story."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I re-read this book after far too many years away, but found that it hasn't stood the test of time all that well. The humor and style are still there. I still wish that I could writing as wittily as Douglas Adams. The plot, however, begins to crumple after too many re-examinations. So do the characters. Arthur Dent just isn't that exciting a hero. This book is best considered as a clever satire on sci-fi conventions and on the world at large.Why have I found this beloved book to be wanting? Perhaps it's exposure to some of Adams' later works, where plot plays more of a role and where characters come to life more (I think - next up will be a return to the second HGTG book and to Zaphod's harrowing adventures). Perhaps it's the bitter taste left by the fourth and fifth books in the series, written by someone who didn't care anymore. And perhaps it's exposure to the works of Terry Pratchett, Adams' equivalent in the fantasy genre. Whereas Adams was content in this book to simply have fun making fun, Pratchett develops some of the most intriguing heroes and villains and ordinary people and makes you feel at home on the Discworld, which is really just a good metaphor for our world. Adams doesn't really seem to like people that much, but Pratchett does.Still, any sci-fi fan or fan of Monty Python should give this and its first two sequels a try. Adams is a great wordsmith, and his departure from novels for other pastures is a bit of a loss."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Well just wrapped up this book...And unlike other reviewers, I promise I wont write a book report giving every thing away.Any hoots, this book did have some laugh out-loud moments. After the first few though you began to see the setup long before the punch. Some long roads were traveled to get to the 'funny' and at times were a little too predictable.This type of humor has been played out to death since the time of this books writing. So the wit-factor is just not there.At times I got the impression this book had no idea what it was doing or where it was going. Almost as if it was not really thought out and planned but more just banged out and made up as Adams went along.Well all the reviews loving this back can't be wrong either. I guess this book is really more not to my personal taste.

That would be room enough for all the witty comparisons and good ideas it has. Also, the true randomness of the writing would still be interesting as a novelty.As a full-length book, it is a disaster. There's no plot, no characters, the randomness doesn't make any sense. If you shuffle the chapters the book would probably be as readable as it is now. It reminds me of some writing I and my friends did when we were 11 years old, only duller.I don't understand the high praises it has.BTW, I like a lot \\"nonsense\\" humor from people like Monty Python.

But overall, I was a teensy-weensy bit disappointed, probably because I'd heard so much praise about it, I really expected to laugh my buttocks off, and I didn't.

This is my favorite novel, and that's not an easily won prize. Keep in mind that it's not for conventional thinkers, or literalists. But for those out there that have a sense of humor and an interest in absurdity, this is like a religious text.

But since that was several years ago and I just finished the book for the first time, it was fun to finally understand what the hell they were talking about! This book led me to the oddest way of speaking while I was reading it. Its quirky style had me forming Dr. Seuss-like rhymes and saying quotes from the book. Anyone with half a sense of humor will love this book and anyone without one should read it so s/he may find one!Oh, and &quot;the secret is to bang the rocks together, guys.&quot;Anyone know where I can find a Babel fish?"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book takes a look at the absurdities of Earth applied to space. One example is: On earth we would build a major high way through a national park, some idiot alien builds a high way through our planet.... go figure 1. The book is supposed to be childish. 2. It is old so some of the comedy may not apply today. 3.

His personality was the most human, and interactions with his character were some of the most humorous passages in this book. This was my first venture into science fiction, and after reading Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, I am hooked on Douglas Adams' writing, and can't wait to read all his other books. I loved the unexpected jokes, the whimsical names, and the way millions of years of anticipation and egos are deflated by single hilarious sentences.HOWEVER, I agree with several other reviewers that this book is way too short. It doesn't feel like it's over when it's over. And I was disappointed that the Hitchhiker's Guide itself was ignored for most of the book! Can't say I learned much about galactical hitchhiking at all..."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I've just finished reading all 267 reviews that Amazon has right now on The Hitchhiker's Guide. The reviews simply split into two camps. The 'I didn't get it' camp was home to a small, and unfortunately quite vocal, minority who simply thought the plot was confusing or the author was 'dumb' or some such schtick. Not to berate these readers, some were genuinely confused, but the sole reason they didn't like it is that they didn't *get it*. The people who understood the context of the novel, grasped its underlying satirical genius, loved it. So much so that their 5-star ratings totally eliminate the negative effect of the few low ratings. Folks, if you like to laugh and you're more intelligent than a mattress, give it a read. It's short, and it's worth it."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Douglas Adams takes sci-fi to the next level; humor.

I was really hoping to kind of get the feminine end of things from this book, since I have a little girl who's going to have her own little series of discoveries. I already know how to whistle through a blade of grass, find the stars, etc. I was hoping for some more variety - how to properly sew a button, or make doll clothes/furniture/what have you. That sort of thing. What I got was a book that you couldn't have distinguished from the \\"Dad\\" volume without the benefit of the cover.Not that I try to enforce stereotypical girl/boy interests, but there are obviously some differences you're going to run across. I'm all about sexual equality,but somewhere you've got to fill both roles. I'm glad there are Moms out there who want to be the expert on how to carry a football or change a bicycle chain.

It is also a very transparent look at what this disease does to the spouse of the one diagnosed. The forwards by the Chief of Geriatrics, Pastor, and the authors, give you a glimpse into how this disease must be responded to by the whole community. It should be on everyone who serves senior's bookshelf. Mrs. ErkenBrack and Ellen Childress show by their open, frank comments, and emotionally packed stories that we all need to support, care and uphold people who are facing this illness. The Reasonable Expectations for those whose loved ones are being cared for by others in Chapter Five and Guidelines she suggests in securing a facility is worth the price of the book. Many families I have met over the years struggle in these areas. And the poem on page 98 titled &quot;See me&quot; found in the locker of a nursing home patient is a jewel. The journey of faith and friendship is also addressed by both of the authors. They believe that God helped them form a bond that, not only enabled Ellen to cope with each situation that came up, but was crucial to their ability to reach out to others whose lives have been shattered by this diagnosis. Paulette and Ellen's inter-generational friendship is a study in why the senior population should not be isolated within communities unless it is absolutely necessary. What they bring to each other and to the reader is immeasurably precious."},{"Title":"Shattered Lives : Finding Hope in the Midst of Alzheimer's and Other Related Dementia","review":"As the caretaker for both of my parents who are suffering from memory loss and dementia, I read as many books as possible to learn just everything I can to help me in this demanding but rewarding job. Shattered Lives - Finding Hope in the Midst of Alzheimer's and Other Related Dementia is probably the most moving book that I have read. Most of us read these books for facts, emotional strength and to learn from others new ideas to provide the dignity and comfort our loved ones deserve at life's end.Ellen Childress tells her story in a very emotional way. The love and strength she found in God guided her through the heart-wrenching journey of providing care and love for her husband Herm when he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's. Told to Paulette ErkenBrack, her story is from the heart. From emotional issues to demanding dignity for her husband before and while in a nursing home, Ellen succeeded in leading her husband and herself through the labyrinth of health care issues, doctors and learning how to deal with the pain of loss. The loss is unbearable. Ellen left nothing out of her story; her grief is real and her emotions raw. Tears fell from my eyes while reading this book.For those who are living this difficult journey, this book will give strength and guidance. Ellen's words touched my heart and through the sharing of her experiences and faith in God, I felt a kinship to her. I recommend this book to everyone, and especially to those caretakers who feel desperate for new informative ideas, more faith and the knowledge that we are not alone.I received a complimentary copy of Shattered Lives as a member of the Dorrance Publishing Book Review Team.

Shattered Lives: Finding Hope in the Midst of Alzheimer's and Other Related Dementia offers a personal and honest look at the debilitating disease and its effect not only on the person but on the person's spouse, family, and friends. Childress share an honest assessment of her sorrow, anger and other emotions as she shares her story, her struggles to advocate for her husband, and her times of laughter. I highly recommend it to persons who feel alone with struggling with the disease, whether personally or through love of another with the disease.

The writer shows Herm's slow decline and the distressing consequences it has on Ellen. However, this book also gleans lessons from the suffering of this loving couple. These lessons learned can benefit others who must face life with Alzheimer's, for &quot;Shattered Lives&quot; provides a wealth of practical guidance for dealing with this disease and its effects while offering encouragement to loved ones who must cope with life during and after Alzheimer's.

Her work as an Activity Director in several facilities and her skill as a writer have given her the tools she needed to share Ellen's story of dealing with dementia. Last year, when I personally faced my elderly father's change in personality, his anger and hostility towards his family, Paulette's experience and wisdom helped me to realize these changes were beyond his control. Education, knowledge of the physical and emotional changes that dementia brings is vital in living through this time. &quot;Shattered Lives, Finding Hope in the Midst of Alzheimers and other Related Dementia&quot; will help to inform and enable you to be a more effective care-giver.Martha Pope Gorris, Author &quot;Held Captive by Futile Thoughts?

Several are Biblical, such as Abraham and the idols, how Moses became a stutterer, Jonah and Ninevah and one of David. Children will also delight in Solomon's lesson about the importance of small creatures.Other tales are Talmudic, for example one about the boy who prays with a flute.Still others are humorous, like the tale of the cobbler from Chelm: On a trip from Chelm to the big city, he falls asleep under a tree, but first points his boots toward Warsaw so he'll know which way to go when he awakens. As he sleeps, a branch dangling from the side of a wagon turns the boots around. When he wakes, the toes point towards Chelm so he follows them back home.

Robinson (1919-1983) was an author and former Anglican Bishop, as well as Dean of Trinity College until his death from cancer. He first achieved fame as the author of the bookHonest to God, 40th Anniversary Edition, which was written in 1963 while he was still serving as a bishop in the Anglican church in Woolrich, England; there were rapidly more than 350,000 copies in print. The book championed Tillich, Bultmann, and Bonhoeffer, and suggested that \\"The Bible speaks of a God 'up there,'\\" and of a \\"three-decker universe\\" consisting of \\"the heaven above, the earth beneath and the waters under the earth.\\"He wrote in the Preface to this 1967 book, \\"This book is a considerably expanded version of material delivered as ... Lectures at Stanford University... in May 1966... My original intention had been to devote the lectures to the subject of Christology. But it became increasingly clear that before one could develop the theme 'God was in Christ'... one must first try to explore further the meaning of 'God'...\\"He asserts, \\"the conception of God as a Being, a Person---like ourselves but supremely above or beyond ourselves---will, I believe, come to be seen as a human projection... The real question of God is not the existence of a Being whom we visualize as embodying these in his Person. It is whether this conviction about the ultimate nature and meaning of things is true.\\" (Pg. 29)He says that God-language \\"stands for that which by its very nature cannot finally be reduced or translated without remainder into anything else..\\" (Pg. 54) Later, he adds, \\"Words, images, or descriptions can but try to catch and express this reality---either, as it were, in terms of 'so what' or in terms of 'as if.' And both forms of translation fail if offered as adequate accounts of what God is.\\" (Pg. 69)More controversially, he argues that \\"So much of the conventional presentation of the problem of evil... assumes a Being which is 'personally responsible' for directing the course of events so as to produce the distribution of suffering we see... Such a Being is declared by the atheist to be morally intolerable, and I find myself concurring. Any human planner who foresaw, let alone designed, a flood or a landslide, would evacuate the area beforehand. I have no wish to defend such a conception of God...\\" (Pg. 116-117)Ultimately, he endorses \\"Christian panentheism,\\" as \\"fundamentally appropriate to Christianity---in a way that deism or pantheism or even theism is not---without being exclusively Christian... I also believe that the most appropriate model... for a satisfactory theology of the incarnation is a panentheistic one.\\" (Pg. 161)This is another of Robinson's early \\"exploratory\\" books (before he turned conservative in his later years; see hisCan We Trust the New Testament? (Mowbrays popular Christian paperbacks), for example)."},{"Title":"Me and the Arch Kook Petulia","review":"I found a yellowing copy of this book in my basement. It was a movie tie in for a Julie Christie, George C. Scott and Richard Lester film. I had heard the film was great but a book? Well, I was curious. The book is wonderful. The movie and the book are pretty much the same but the book maps out the relationship a little bit better. A young woman from a poverty stricken background finagles her way into marrying a rich young man from a very wealthy family. He turns out to be a monster who beats her regularly and terrorizes her. The family dynamic risen around the young man is to hide his violence and force her to do the same. A young boy from Mexico ends up in the mix and Petulia begins to look for another man who will help them both. She chooses an aging doctor with a gentle disposition. Without completely communicating what is going on in their own personal lives, they fall in love. Constrained by their pasts, it is difficult to understand what is true and what are secrets. An unforgettable book."},{"Title":"The Catholic","review":"This is a skillfully written account of a young man becoming sexually obsessed with another young man after one night of erotic love making. David Plante is very wise to spin a tale where one night of sexual joy can lead anyone into the wild world of speculation about the barely known lover and the pain of longing and obsession for someone we really do not know. Plante explores the components of sexual obsession which may include project onto the lover a range of concepts that are beyond reality. Yet in some ways the book is more hopeful and optimistic than most of Plante's novels in that eventually obsession fades, becomes less intense, is less painful, and finally disappears as sanity is regained. When I read Hollingshurst's The Folking Star, I was reminded of Plante's The Catholic. Both deal with sexual obsession and the way the mind eventually forgets the love object, which leads to the healing."},{"Title":"The Catholic","review":"honestly this is the most pretentious, meandering highfalutin prose that is insufferable to read... quelle disappointment. it actually starts off rather well with a scene from catechism class... from then on it just gets so dreary... I can't tell you! boring ass book which doesn't make a hell of a lot of sense. If it were even comprehensible it might be readable lolhere I'll pick an excerpt totally at random:\\"I was unsure about the differences between sexes, and could only distinguish them by the feelings they aroused in me; and I noted, as I'd noted in the presence of many women, that Roberta's body was, to me, fixed solidly in her personality, which, being a unique personality, made her body unique, so it was as if she, as each woman, had her own sex. There was not a female sex.\\"To me, all men belonged to the same sex, and men did notr have fixed personalities, nor fixed bodies.\\"hunh? well, it's a novel about a homosexual/gay guy... and he relates to men's bodies in a way he can't to womens. that much I understand, but nothing of that understanding has anything to do with these two (as it happens) paragraphs.

Here's the run down. Daniel picks up a trick, Henry. Daniel is totally out of touch with reality and imagines, yes imagines, that he is in love with Henry. Daniel is friends with a married couple, Charlie and Roberta. He used to me roomies with Charlie in college, and I think they got drunk and messed around once, the the story really doesn't expand on it and is determined to keep it a secret. Yeah it's a secret of what happened, but you don't keep it a secret from the reader, otherwise what's the point in bringing it up. I think the guy was totally high when he wrote this book, because it almost comes across as just sporadic random thoughts that ramble from one extreme to another without any point. I think the author was trying for some kind of poetic poise, but it just doesn't work. I guess we are seeing a world totally through Daniels eyes where you don't really get the entire story, and Daniel is this messed in the head queer. At times I thought maybe Daniel was supposed to be mentally challeged (I'm being politically correct, what I want to say is retarded.) The copyright was 1985, but I think this story laid at the bottom of some pile of stories for years before it was published, because it is just too tame and bland to have been written during the eighties."},{"Title":"Despite All Odds: The Story of Lubavitch","review":"This book is a fascinating account of the Lubavitchers, an intriguing and successful group of Orthodox Jew whose worldwide influence continues to expand.This book is also a moving portrait of the present Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, as he enters his ninetieth year, after more than forty years of leadership.

The topic strikes a cultural chord, appealing to our myth of rugged individualism. We are all resilient - up to a point. For every child that develops severe problems due to a traumatic experience, many more do not.But there is an illusory quality to the seeming variations among individuals in their capacity to conquer adversity. If we look deeply enough, we find that certain types of chronic adversity in early childhood are virtually insurmountable. No one overcomes them.Luthar's edited volume goes a long way toward explaining what types of adversities predict this catastrophic failure, and why. With chapters from leading scholars, it explores factors that predict good or bad outcomes among children exposed to child abuse, divorce, poverty, parental mental illness, community violence, discrimination, parental alcoholism and drug abuse, and an accumulation of multiple risks. The book also explains biological and genetic influences on childhood outcome, and provides suggestions for how we can promote resilience through early childhood interventions.This is an excellent overview of a complex topic. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Miss Prestwick's Crusade (Signet Regency Romance)","review":"Miss Prestwick has a mission: to ensure that her nephew is properly recognized as the twelfth Earl of Camberwell. Of course her task is not as simple as it seems: there already is a twelfth Earl of Camberwell -- Edward Beresford, a cousin to the deceased heir, Christopher Beresford; plus the unpalatable truth that she has no physical proof that her sister was actually married Christopher. Add to that the fact she knows (based on bits of information that Christopher has seen fit to divulge) that the present earl, Edward, has always been jealous of Christopher and has always coveted the title. Such a man will no doubt make things really difficult for Helen!However, when Helen confronts Edward, she is surprised and relieved to discover that while he doesn't totally believe her story, he is willing to investigate her claims and to house her nephew, William, her duena, Miss Horatia Barnstable and her, until they discover how exactly things stand. Helen is floored -- she never expected for things to go so smoothly even though she is resolved to see things through and baby William restored to his rightful position -- but grateful for Edward forbearance. But why exactly is Edward so accommodating? Is he not quite so black as Christopher painted? Or does he have some sinister plan up his sleeve? As the days pass and Helen begins to see just how much in tune with Edward she actually is, and how much she actually likes and respects him, she cannot help but wonder about Christopher's claims. Unfortunately, Helen has a few skeletons rattling in her own closet, and as the days pass, and as Edward's agents fail to turn up any evidence of Christopher's marriage and William's legitimacy, Helen cannot help but fear that her secrets will be revealed and that the impact of those secrets will cost William and her dearly...What I liked about \\"Miss Preswick's Crusade\\" was the fact that both Edward and Helen acted in a manner that reflected their ages, maturity and life experiences -- in other words if you rather enjoy Regencies where either the heroine or hero indulges in massive hysterical bouts of infantile behaviour, give this book a miss! However while the romance that developed between Edward and Helen was quite nicely paced, it was also true that it took Helen a long time to reconcile the evidence before her eyes (as to Edward's character) with Christopher's tales -- in fact it took her so long that I sometimes wanted to shake her. However, when one factors in what Helen's past experiences were and what she went through (plus the betrayal that she suffered at the hands of those that should have stood up for her), you can totally understand her hesitation to trust Edward outright. And because Helen kept waffling on whether or not she could trust Edward, the pacing of the storyline was not always smooth -- in fact things really slowed down after the first quarter of the book. On the whole though, if you're in the mood for a good grown-up romance novel, complete with a believable hero and heroine, then definitely \\"Miss Preswick's Crusade\\" will completely satisfy."},{"Title":"Miss Prestwick's Crusade (Signet Regency Romance)","review":"Miss Helen Prestwick has journeyed all the way to Portugal to do one thing: to prove her late sister's child is actually the rightful Earl of Camberwell. However, it's her fear that the current earl, after hearing her story, will simply turn her away. When she meets Edward Beresford, he is nothing like the monster she expected. In fact, he is actually quite nice.Mr. Beresford, who has no real interest in his earldom, intends to help Helen prove her claim--even if his entire family thinks her story is too far-fetched. While he investigates her claim, Helen Prestwick stays in close quarters (she's trying to restore his family's art collection). The more they get to know each other, the closer they become.But Miss Prestwick is hiding a secret from her past--a secret she feels might rattle Mr. Beresford's newfound friendship with her.All in all, the story was nothing I hadn't read before. The lead characters were interesting, if not a bit stubborn. (I was happy to find a hero who wasn't handsome, or arrogant, or a rake). The secondary characters were a bit surprising (a couple of them turned out to be better than I had originally suspected). But the main story is somewhat predictable, and the ending is a bit rushed. Still, I came across a few parts where I was unable to put the book down. Overall, Ms. Barbour has given us an enjoyable read. I give it 3 1/2 stars."},{"Title":"A Cat","review":"I have the hardback version and don't understand why that isn't available.

I decided to read it because it was so short and I wound up really enjoying it and even reading one of the observations out loud to my husband because it reminded me so much of our cat! This is not a novel or a wonderful work of literature, but the thoughts and observations about all things feline are wonderfully on the mark! Anyone who shares life with a cat will be sure to appreciate this cute little book."},{"Title":"A Cat","review":"Not just another cat book, this one. This book just purrs with elegance and wit. By far the most intelligent cat book in print."},{"Title":"A Cat","review":"Leonard Michael's book about cats is a perceptive insight look into the nature of cats. He sees cats in a fanciful way, relying more on his imagination then the concrete facts of feline life. Cats are examined more like a dream than a reality. Being a cat lover, I can understand his feelings. When you're with your cat, it's time to be yourself, be in your own world without the clamor of responsibilities and the constant interruption of your peace and quiet. It is very much like being in a space where you see like a child or understand things emotionally like in a dream. Michaels captures this feeling from your cat's perspective. &quot;When a cat shuts its eyes, you disappear.&quot;The sparseness and concise observation of &quot;A Cat&quot; is reminiscent of the Tao Te Ching of Lao Tsu. I do find that cats are like sages, sitting in meditation on life, able to put life in perspective better than humans are. We are inferiors in our efforts to sort out the essentials despite our supposedly superior intelligence. &quot;To be as quick as a cat you must not think.&quot;Michaels investigates the irony of a cat's love of privacy while it seems so receptive to affection at the same time. I think he's given me personal insight into why I love cats. I like their ability to be close but it's such a personal closeness that it has more a sense of aloneness than loneliness.I feel comfortable with this book like I do with a cat, although perhaps a little cumbersome in comparison. Michaels says it best, &quot;Compared to a cat, we're big, slow, blundering figures. When we lie down, our gross earthen nature must make us appear something like rocks and trees to a cat. Therefore, it feels free to walk on us.&quot;An extra added treat are the wonderful line and brush drawings.&gt; River"},{"Title":"A Cat","review":"The collaboration between text and illustration make this delightful book an extraordianry success on many levels. It is both humorous and thought-provoking, ironic and poetic, wry and sublime. Lerner's spare, minimal drawings are as eloquent as Michael's words. I would like to buy a dozen to give as gifts if only it weren't so difficult to find!"},{"Title":"A Cat","review":"A wonderful collection of thoughts and meditatations on the mystery of being as incarnated by the cat. Michaels' words take you from the simple pleasure of holding a cat to quotes from Chekov. Lerner's outline gesture drawings suggest the inner mystery of the cat."},{"Title":"A Cat","review":"This book is very lively and endearing. The author is not literal, but imaginative and clever. The illustrations show the cat's extraordinarily graceful yet clean, simple gestures as she/he goes through it's ordinary day."},{"Title":"A Cat","review":"This is a charming book, wonderfully witty and engaging text, beautiful drawings that capture the moods and inner life of every cat I've ever met. I'm planning to give it as Christmas presents to every cat-lover I know. Really a treat!"},{"Title":"A Cat","review":"This book is out of print/stock and I believe it should remain so forever. I have read many books about cats and have shared my life and loved many feline companions of the heart. The customer review board justly does not not favor revealing ending or significant plot developments, but, really, to convince cat-lovers of the absurd &quot;aphorisms&quot; in this book, I need to quote at least one or two of these astounding one-liners: &quot;A cat refuses to be trained&quot;; &quot;You stroked a cat and heard its purring, but it gazes at you in that tragic way and gives you no credit for trying.&quot; and &quot;When a cat shuts its eye you disappear.&quot; Really, the text make me think the writer had maybe SEEN a cat, but had never lived with one. In the context of these banal cat myths, the line drawings become irrelevant to someone who really lives with and loves cats. PLEASE, if you love cats or want to give a gift to a cat lover, don't waste your time and money hunting down an out-of-print copy of this book - you will be more than annoyed, you will, I predict, be extremely irritated."},{"Title":"Behind the Scenes With Benetton Formula 1: Racing Team","review":"The book gives a good overview of the live behind the scenes of a Formula 1 racing team."},{"Title":"Star (Thorndike Core)","review":"In this book, Star tells the other girls in her therapy group (Misty, Jade, and Cat) about living with an alcoholic mother and being deserted by a deadbeat dad. Her story is heartbreaking and very real. Finally, she and her little brother Rodney are able to live with their elderly grandmother and have a chance for happiness and real love when tragedy strikes again. Some V.C. Andrews stories really capture my attention and others do not. This one got my attention. I can't wait to read the rest of the series."},{"Title":"Star (Thorndike Core)","review":"Yes, these last two &quot;mini&quot; series are totally insulting to V. C. Andrews name and talent. She would not have written weak, empty-headed dramas about four teenaged girls feeling sorry for themselves. Where is the shock! Where is the horror! There was a time when V. C. Andrews was beating Stephen King in horror paperback sales, there is no horror here anymore. Very sad and depressing that the Ghostwriter has begun to ignore the die-hard ADULT fans of V. C. Andrews who read her because her novels were so gothic, so dark. I am so angry with these books I could spit nails, what would Stephen King's fans do if he started writing teeny-bopper romance melo-dramas? Ms. Andrews' was a HORROR novelist, and just because she was a woman, they are altering her style to a more sudsy, soapy variety. Dispicable!"},{"Title":"Star (Thorndike Core)","review":"In the second story in the Wildflowers series we hear Star's story. Star likes to put up a tough bravado but the truth is her past is filled with pain. In Dr. Marlowe's therapy group she tells the story of parents that constantly fought, and a mother that never really wanted to have kids. As she continues to tell her story Misty, Jade, and Cat may realize that Star, under her wise cracks is just like them. I found this book to be a nice read, but not really up to par with the rest of the series. I liked reading this book. But compared to the other two in the series I've already read (Misty and Jade) it was just lacking something. Neverless I'm still reading the series (Cat is on my shelf right now and I'm going to buy the full-length novel Into the garden). I reccomend this book to fans of a series but try to get it from your library instead of spending your own money on it."},{"Title":"Star (Thorndike Core)","review":"I'm a huge V.C. Andrews fan. That is, the REAL VC, and not the ghost writer of Andrew Neiderman. My one star rating is for all the mini series books out there. What a marketing ripoff. By the time you buy each individual little book in the mini series, plus the final book that reunites them all, you will have spent considerably more than the price for one normal sized VC book. Now that the hype of the series has died down, i find that they go and finally publish all the books together in one massive volume, like they should have done in the first place. The real VC would not have pulled such a horrible money-making stunt like the publishers are doing. The mini-series books have a hastily-written feel to them, as if the publishers needed to get some kind of VC book out on the shelves asap, with little thought to the content, or even if the faithful VC fans would even care about a mini-series like this. The VC magic was totally absent from any of the mini-series books, and i felt like i was reading a &quot;young adult&quot; teeny-bopper VC Andrews, instead of the old &quot;adult&quot; VC Andrews we all love. I think all of the books in the mini-series should be put in the Young Adult section instead of in the horror section of the bookstore. They feel like a cross between a weak version of R.L. Stine books and some other book aimed at 12-year-olds. There really is a juvenile feel to these mini-series books that i did not like. The ghost writer has gotten worse with each series, and it was obvious many series ago that he has adopted his own modern writing style, even though the story is told in the first person. I never liked this current &quot;modernization&quot; of the VC Andrews stories. The older books were the best ever, because they were written by the real V.C. Andrews, and had memorable characters. Tell me, does any true VC fan care much for the new crop of characters in these mini-series?? NO! Compare the new books to the books in the Flowers In The Attic series and Heaven series. It's like compairing junk to a treasure. It's so obvious that the Andrews family is in all this for a share of the money they are making off the ghost writer's books. I wish Andrew Neiderman would stop attaching V.C. Andrews' name to the stuff he writes. VC would not be proud. Her stores were ten million times better and more interesting than these damned mini-series books. The fact that the name V.C. Andrews is a copyright is a shame. Why doesn't Andrew Neiderman just write the books and put his name on them? We all know he's the one writing the books, so just stop with putting VC Andrews on the cover. It's become a joke now. We all know the writing and story ideas are nowhere near as good as the ones the real VC used to write. Please skip all the books in any of the mini-series. If you want to read the REAL V.C. Andrews, then stick with the first few series she wrote. For those who don't know, she died in 1986, shortly after Dark Angel, the second book in the Heaven series, was written."},{"Title":"Star (Thorndike Core)","review":"My first V.C. Andrews book was &quot;Misty&quot; and I absolutely loved it! I was really excited to read Star, because she's my favorite of the four girls...and I was kind of disappointed. &quot;Star&quot; is really really good, but the first thirty five pages are kind of slow. It starts with Star being dropped off at Dr. Marlowe's office, today being her day to tell the other three girls (Cat, Jade, and Misty) her story. She starts with telling them how her mom's an alcoholic, and her dad left them when her and her brother (Rodney) were just little kids. Her mom soon meets someone, and they come home totally trashed, night after night, for quite some times. When this is happening, Star's little brother is getting hurt at home, and Star is having problems at school. Her grades are slipping. After a while, Star's mom dumps her and Rodney off to live with her grandma. When Star starts school, she meets Steve, and they quickly become boyfriend and girlfriend. Steve has the same problem as Star - his dad drinks and his mom is dead. But one night something horrible happens, and Star is changed forever.This book is REALLY good, but the beginning is kind of slow, which is the only reason it's not getting 5 stars. Some people say that this book is geared towards 6th graders ~ I highly disagree, and thought this was suggestive. It is good though!"},{"Title":"Star (Thorndike Core)","review":"'Star' written by V.C. Andrews gets 5 stars because it was an excellent book for a teenage girl. The book shows teenage girls that they are not the only ones going through a rough time with adolescence. It made me realize that no matter how bad I think the problem is that I am going through, there is always some else out there going through something much worse. This book made me want to cry at times and I recommend it for any teenage girl who is having a hard time dealing with life right now. It will make you realize that what you are dealing with really isn't all that bad."},{"Title":"Star (Thorndike Core)","review":"Star was so surprising to me. I never would have thought that V.C.Andrews would put a Black girl on the cover. As an avid fan,an African American and avid reader of V.C. Andrews, I was shocked. I thought the story was good. It's not as good as Heaven, or Flowers in the attic, but nonetheless, it was good."},{"Title":"Star (Thorndike Core)","review":"This was better than Misty and poor Star goes through a lot. not as exciting as I thought it would be, but at least it's about a black girl, which is different."},{"Title":"Star (Thorndike Core)","review":"Unfortunately I wasn't impressed with this read. Having read and owning copies of all the original V.C. Andrews books and having been a captured reader of HER books, I can only say that when her reads came out originaly, I believed this writer to be a PHENOMENON, and still do! However this book, as well as many of the other books, written by 'other hired writers' just don't seem to cut it for me. These writings done after her death don't seem to have the same appeal and have never been able to capture her forte. For me, this book was another disappointment. In my mind there will never be anyone who can write her books and I think most of the new books written by 'other writers' just shouldn't be using her name. But that's just my opinion.I keep buying them or getting them at local library, so it's something in them that keeps me coming back. I think though, that it is the hope of finding another one that can equal Victoria's writing herself. And that's just never going to happen.

The writing is truly the best."},{"Title":"Star (Thorndike Core)","review":"Star was a really enjoyable short story. The V. C. Andrews series are really wonderful. However, I am not happy with how short the books are. I enjoy reading a book for a week. I pick up one of these &quot;Novels&quot; and its over in a couple of hours. Star is an excellent book about a young girls struggles and you can really empathize with her. I am looking forward to the rest of the series. My only disappointment is that it ends too soon. I do have to admit that every time I read a V. C. Andrews book I am looking for the thrill of Flowers in the Attic. I have yet to find a book of that quality."},{"Title":"Star (Thorndike Core)","review":"When I read Misty, I thought this was going to be a great series. Now Star reinforces it.

Maybe it's because her romance with the abused boy is so clich&eacute;d, or maybe it's because the lavish houses of Beverly Hills are missing. Whatever it is, something is lacking in this story. Might it be a talented writer?"},{"Title":"Star (Thorndike Core)","review":"Star's life hasn't been easy. Having an alcoholic mother, responsibility fell onto her shoulders at an early age. She was forced to be a parent to her younger brother, since her mother was always either passed out or getting drunk at the bar. After her father abandons his family, Star's mother takes up with a man named Aaron who she ends up running off with, forcing Star's grandmother to become guardian to the children.Like the first in the series, this is a story that (sadly) is unremarkable. Star never got to have a childhood; mothering her brother gave her adult responsibilities at the time of life where she should have been enjoying being a kid. On top of that, the one person she's close to also has an alcoholic parent, and this brings further tragedy into Star's life.I agree with people whose reviews say these stories are not like the real V.C. Andrews' books; the lives described are too typical/average to even compare, but putting that aside and taking them at their own merit, they're okay. More like relatable \\"me too\\" fiction than \\"woah, that's messed up\\" fiction."},{"Title":"Star (Thorndike Core)","review":"the reviews on here make me sad. star went through hell and back and everyone seems to hate star. i've been through hell and back just like star. i have almost died four times. been sexually abused and had several people i love die. the indifference people show star reminds me of the indifference people have towards me. people have treated me like they were thinking &#34;she brought all this upon herself by not being pretty enough&#34;.it's really sad when you grow up suffering and noone has heart enough to give a damn."},{"Title":"Star (Thorndike Core)","review":"Star's not really better or worse than her predecessor, Misty. Her story isn't VCA caliber, but it's not a bad book for teens to read. It seems that Neiderman was relying on stereotypes for this book, but by itself it isn't a horrible read, just a lite teen book. Compared to the other books in this series, it's so-so."},{"Title":"Star (Thorndike Core)","review":"Star acted more of a mom to her little brother Rodney while their own parents Aretha and Kenny were so busy squabbling with each other. Star and Rodney were lucky to move in with their grandma. I was glad she fell in love with Steve. I believe Star should have told her grandma about Steve's problems while he was alive. That way Steve's life would have been saved. Star took it very hard when Steve died. Yet her grandma didn't panic when she found out when her own granddaughter needed help."},{"Title":"Star (Thorndike Core)","review":"Ok, so Star was good, I expected the worst and got one almost up to Misty, but not quite. Don't get me wrong, it is really good, but I hated something about it... something I can't identify. I guess I just can't quite picture it as much as the others. She did have a bad life, worse than Misty's for sure, but it was downright DEPRESSING! I know ones like FLowers in the Attic and My Sweet Audrina are both sad and maybe depressing, but something just *clicked* in them, I loved them, and I felt I was leaning outside the homes looking in, seeing, watching... and that's how it's supposed to be. I guess the thing I find most depressing about these *New* books is they catigorize them as &quot;Horror&quot;. Horror? No! They are stories of some little girl's life, and they aren't scary at all, just sad! I think sometime after Ruby series, the ghostwriter lost interest somewhere...

The only one in this series so far with anything even remotely shocking is &quot;Jade&quot;. The narrative style is horrible--considering that the girls are speaking, the language is very unconversational. Who would really tell an oral story using phrases like &quot;She looked at me sadly, her eyes searching me like two tiny headlights.&quot; Which brings me to another complaint: Every girl uses the cheesiest metaphors, and none have a distinctive voice--each story sounds like it's being told by the same girl. If I hadn't gotten these first three for 1/2 off, I'd be mad at the waste of money. But I guess they were worthy of 1 star and $2.00 each for keeping me mildly amused for a few hours... I will buy cat and the reunion novels but only when they too are 1/2 off or in the used bookstores.

I thought the Orphan series was bad but the Wildflowers are terrible! I have found nothing yet in either series that would make me gasp or swear to my husband that I'll put the book down when I read one more chapter. If not for the name V.C.

Please Mr. Neiderman, don't disgrace V. C. Andrews name and lagacy with another miniseries after this awful second one. Write books like the first three series of ghost written books, not R. L. Stine clones. If the horror and rage cannot be done again like in the books that SHE wrote, then at least return to the drama that was in the landry, cutler and logan series, I swear, these two miniseries are some of the worst books that i'm sort of emabarassed to have in my collection, but they have V.

Set in the mid-nineteenth century in Kent and London, England, social class is portrayed as utmost importance. For young orphaned Philip Pirrip-Pipp- life is a struggle of realization of the real world and place in life as well as culture. Through traumatic events, mishaps and altered expectations to the truth, Pipp learns that social improvement is irrelevant to one's real worth.The reoccurring motif in, \\"Great Expectations,\\" is in direct relation to the major them of self-improvement through social class. Through characters, places, and infatuations, this motif is prominent. Miss. Havisham, Estella, the Satis House, and Bently Drummle all introduce different levels and perceptions of social class of the 1800's. Bentley Drummle represents the grotesque side of high class, Miss. Havisham and Estella are the quintessence of the highly educated, lavish and greatly respected side of the upper class, and the Satis House is merely the embodiment of the riches young Pipp adores and idolizes. Each character not only adds to Pipp's life long obsession of social well being, but life lessons learned in his battle for fulfillment."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Charles Dickens was one of the most popular writers of all time, creating some of the best-known characters in English literature. In the book \\"Great Expectations\\", the protagonist and narrator, Pip begins the story as a young orphan boy being grown up by his sister. I like this book, because Charles Dickens takes you right inside the Pip's mind and you live through the events and discoveries of his life with him. Pip is passionate, romantic and somewhat unrealistic at heart. That makes the novel interesting. Of course, you cannot forget the great love story (Pip and Estella). The other characters Magwitch, Miss Havisham, Joe Gargery, Miss Joe, Estella, Mr Jaggers and Mr Wemmick are all unique and special in their way and they add to the novel's richness. Another thing I really liked was how all of the characters are interrelated to each other in ways that you may not discover until you get to the end of the novel. This novel will make you sometimes laugh and sometimes make you feel sad, but it is always entertaining. Latif Dose simplifies the texts. The language is very clear. There are not old English words and this gives the reader much pleasure while reading the novel. I think most young people would like this novel because it's not as hard to read as an other classic books. I recommend Great Expectations to anyone who wants to read a good, classic book because Great Expectations has a little bit of everything in it, mystery, romance and suspense. You cannot easily find all of these properties in other novels, which makes &quot;Great Expectations&quot; a special and a classic one.. That makes this novel very different. It is probably one of the top ten English novels of the 19th century. Some of the passages are beautiful. I cannot forget Pip's response to Estella when she says \\"You will get me out of thoughts in a week.\\""},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"There is really no need to recount the plot of this classic - I think most people who are thinking about reading it already know it is a story of poor boy done good and has wrong assumptions about how he comes about it. But despite the storyline being well-worn, there is till so much to get from this story. What comes across most clearly is the theme that nothing comes without strings-attached - Pip's great fortune, that at first looked like manna from on high, turns out to cause more trouble than it is worth.Dickens is a joy to read - his description is masterful, and his ability to paint pictures of his eccentric characters is unsurpassed - the contrasts between the charming Mr Wemmick and the slimy Mr Jaggers; the amazing Miss Havisham; the self important Pumblechook (who I could not stand! Is there any character in literature so annoyingly self-deluded?). My absolute favourite is Joe - his convoluted ways of attempting to pass information onto Pip, his attempts to spare Pip from his evil sister and his localised venacular. The only disappointing characters are the two main ones - Pip comes across as insipid, uninspiring, and frankly undeserving of the fortune that he falls into. Estella is so sketchily drawn that you never get any feel for her, and I think that given how much complexity Dickens manages for some of the minor characters, he could have afforded more to Estella.However, this is a great read. Don't read it just because you fell you \`have to read a classic' - read it because it is a well written story with the right balance of humour and pathos."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I don't think I'd be giving away much of the plot if I were to say that the story revolves around Pip, a young, middle class orphan who has dreams to be a wealthy, respected gentleman, but has no hope of this as he is a rural blacksmith apprentice. His prospecs change, however, when a mysterious, anonymous benefactor offers to make Pip's dream a reality. I won't give away the ending, but the novel supports Dickens' belief that the middle class is the class to which people should aspire.The plot of this story wasn't to my liking. Dickens' attempts towards the end to wrap all the subplots into one neat little package annoyed me...similar to plot twists in modern Hollywood movies--things so outrageously convienent that it makes one want to roll his eyes. The manner in which things are written, however is fantastic. While the main characters are rather boring, the minor characters, (especially Biddy, Herbert Pocket, and John Wemmick) were much more interesting. Thankfully, Dickens focused on them enough to flesh them out and make them memorable. I would recommend this book, not because I enjoy the plot, but because the writing style is superior and because I, being lower middle class, enjoyed the positive viewpoint Dickens extended concerning my class."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"What have I missed all these years? I'm ashamed to admit that this is the first Charles Dickens' I've read and I'm 40! Heavens forbid! Don't make the same mistake.......read this book now!I've spent the past week being thoroughly entertained by Pip! No wonder Dickens' is considered such a great writer....this book will have you laughing out loud, and being inspired by the incredible depth of understanding Dickens has for the human condition at all levels of society.....and he manages to do so while weaving a story about one young boy's transformation and maturation...and the tradeoffs for every choice in life.Once you pick this book up, you won't want to put it down until you finish.

In this semi-autobiographical work (a trademark of Dickens' writings), the life of a poor young boy, Pip, is followed from his humble beginnings to his rise into the middle-class, due to the mysterious aid of an unknown benefactor. His pursuit of Estella, a beautiful young girl raised to break the hearts of men by her jilted caretaker, Ms. Havisham, is a classic of literature that has been repeated countless times since. The tragic, gradual break between Pip and his family (particularly the humble but caring Joe) is heartwrenching. Pip's eventual realization of the insincerity of the middle class, and his love for Joe, brought tears to my eyes.&quot;Great Expectations&quot; is a wonderful, moving book that has been copied and satired again and again, from Mishima's &quot;Forbidden Colors&quot; to South Park. An important and unforgettable novel!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"A great story about a young man who has lost his mother and father and is being raised by only his older sister, Charles Dickens' &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is a story of diversity, poverty, and growing up.

As Pip grows up, he must strive to understand what is going on, and why it is going on.The book is very long and almost covers Pip's entire life.

And even I have to appreciate this classic. Charles Dickens knew what he was doing, okay? Great Expectations is a classic, and there's a reason it's a classic. For the plain and simple fact it was well written, with an interesting plot and a good twist. Just because something doesn't contain profanity, sex and violence doesn't mean it should be presumed boring. A basic summary - it tells the story of life, obsessions and social status. As far as I'm concerned, it isn't boring. Just wake up to yourselves, teenage world. Virginia Andrews isn't the extent of reading pleasure."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I find myself surprised at the comments provided by earlier reviewers. One critic gave &quot;Great Expectations&quot; one star because he/she failed a test. Why should Dickens be blamed for that? Another said there was no structure (in a Dickens novel???). Another, that there was &quot;little direction and less power.&quot; That there was no theme and no plot. Perhaps I am seeing things that aren't there but, whatever the shortcomings are, it is not in plot, themes, or characterization. It is the story of the orphan Philip Pirrip, known to everyone as Pip, from the age of about seven to the age of twenty-three, with a brief section at the end that takes place about eleven years later. Pip is being brought up \\"by hand\\" by his loud and quarrelsome sister and her kind and quiet husband, the blacksmith Joe Gargery. Young Pip is soon asked to serve in the home of Miss Havisham, who appears to be half mad since the day, years earlier, when she had been left at the alter by her old lover. Miss Havisham is raising a young girl named Estella to be heartless in her treatment of men when she grows up as a form of revenge against all men. And, Pip naturally falls in love with her. After a few years, Pip finds himself wealthy due to some unknown benefactor (who he mistakenly thinks is Miss Havisham and who he also believes has planned to have Estella marry him when they are older) and he now has \\"great expectations\\" made of him. He plans to become a gentleman and he leaves the kind and devoted Joe to live in London, Pip hoping to leave behind his humble past of which he now feels ashamed. After a few more years, he discovers that his unknown benefactor was Abel Magwitch whom he had helped when he was seven. Magwitch had been convicted and deported to Australia where he became a wealthy sheepman. Even though Magwitch was forbidden to return to England, he does so just to see the young man he had been helping to become a gentleman. Through problems with the law trying to arrest Magwitch, problems with Magwitch's past, the loss of the fortune and of Pip's great expectations, and through illness, Pip discovers the basic goodness in Joe, the devotion of Magwitch and of Pip's close friend Herbert Pocket, and what really is important. He discovers the value of family and of close friends and confidants. Estelle, who had married a cruel oaf, also learns her lessons and finds that she may have a heart as well (in the more common of the two endings of the novel). This is a great novel."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"If you're like me, you were forced to read some Dickens in High School and found him to be pedantic and to sound archaic.

I enjoyed getting the feel of what it was like in the old days of Britain."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I am making my way through Charles Dickens...not in any particular order...the first few I've picked are mostly familiar through TV or film adaptations that I've enjoyed and/or on the recommendations of friends.\\"Bleak House\\" was my first read, finished last month. \\"Great Expectations\\" is my second read.What can I say? I am just so enamored with Dickens's story-telling and character development that I have a fear that when I am done reading his canon I'll have to declare a 13-way tie for first place. We'll see.Between Bleak House and Great Expectations I *almost have a two-way tie for first place, in no small part because they are such different types of books...Bleak House was a universe of characters and subplots; Great Expectations fewer characters and not as much intrigue, although the last 1/4 to 1/3 of the book is riveting. And some good comedy also.But I am going to put GE at #1 and BH at #2...while I loved Bleak House as I read it, and have a few favorite characters, \\"Great Expectations\\" will *stay with me* much much longer I think...Bleak House is brilliant (really brilliant) for its commentary on the period and for its settings and for its intricacies; Great Expectations is brilliant because it is simple and timeless.I'm not nearly vain or clever enough to think I'm the first to recognize this, but three neat things about Great Expectations are: 1) it's a novel which illustrates the old warning \\"Be Careful What You Wish For...\\", 2) it is the complete opposite of \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" - an earnest, non-cynical first-person narrator who meets so much kindness along the way, and fewer \\"phonies\\" (although there are a few), and 3) it's such a personal novel that anyone who dares wonder what they could possibly learn about human nature by reading such an \\"old\\" book NEEDS to read it for that very reason.The characters are just so memorable...if I had to pick a favorite, I think it would be Wemmick...you probably work with him and don't even know it: he's the man (or woman) who is competent at work, works for an insufferable boss, and has a completely different home life than work life. His care of \\"The Aged\\" is a remarkable example for any of us in caring for our parents.The love stories are also very touching - especially the ones that turn out for the best...but no spoilers in this review.And the story of Pip's unrequited love is so true to life...and although I think it would have been worse for Pip to lose Estella had she been more than just beautiful outside but also beautiful inside, Dickens wrote beautifully and agonizingly of the highs and lows associated with unrequited love as only one who has experienced it can truly identify. One of the worst and most painful aspects is not the fact that you aren;t chosen but that they chose *that* person. And all you can think is: anybody...anybody but *them*.A memorable book and must reading.Now on to another Dickens novel! :-)"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"It is one of the magnificent books in history that everyone should have.

Brought back so many childhood memories and thrills !! Worth reading over and over !"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I enjoyed reading this novel mostly because of the rich text and language Dickens used to display the imagery. Dickens wrote this piece in such detail that allows the audience to fully engage in the text, relate to Pip and his struggles, and bring a deeper thought to the way we treat our individual social statuses. As citizens of the United States, we are obligated to work our way to \\"the top of the food chain\\". The majority of the time, we are not given a high status, by blood or other means, to build a superior reputation for ourselves. Therefore we must have the will and determination to make our personal goals become reality. In Great Expectations, Pip's struggles and adventures are great examples of how the audience can relate to the story line and setting throughout the novel to our own personal lives.I thought that Dickens' creatively demonstrated that an individual's social status is not what determines the rights of respect and standards on a person's character. The ability to prove our greater meaning in this world is not something that the government can label us on. As humans, we have the right to make mistakes and errors in life, but out of the morals and standards in which we uphold allow us to make those mistakes result in a learning experiences. Pip strives to become a better man throughout the novel for various reasons. However, Great Expectations allows us to see the connection between the book and real life. In both situations there are/ will be countless obstacles getting in the way of ambitions we set. When Pip decides to leave Joe behind and pursuit his ambitions of becoming a true gentleman he made a decision, much like Dickens himself, to benefit his own life. With any decision there must be great responciblity and will.Personally, I strongly believe that anyone can improve their well-being within a reasonable manner. Only with dedication and support from relatives or friends can one truly achieve their goal. Sometimes our goals don't have the exact result we wished for, but we should be grateful for what we have and work hard for what we want to improve. What I have learned from this book is that no matter what your status is in school, work, at home, or in society as a whole, we all have the ability to make something greater of ourselves. Each individual has the capability to achieve all of ambitions in life we wish to imagine."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is one of my favorite books, so when I got my kindle I was delighted to see it for free.

The story is narrated by Pip, brought up by hand by his sister, Mrs Joe Gargery, commanded to attend Miss Havisham, jilted bride now in decay, where he falls in love with the beautiful Estella and decides he wants to be a gentleman. Eventually, apprenticed to Joe Gargery, blacksmith, he comes into a fortune, and is convinced his benefactor is Miss Havisham, intending him to become a gentleman so he can marry Estella. Miss Havisham's intentions for Estella, of course, differ markedly from this. Dickens includes a rich cast of characters: the guilty and regretful Pip; the cold and cruel Estella; the warm Herbert and Clara; the kind-hearted and faithful Joe and Biddy; the capable Jaggers; the split-personality Wemmick; the nasty Orlick; the single-minded Magwitch. Great Expectations is a much easier and funnier read than the only other Dickens book I can remember reading, and this books immediate predecessor, A Tale of Two Cities, and I noted the echo of the knitting women at the gallows in Estella's actions.

In my opinion, GE is a glorious (not glorified) soap opera chronicling the wildly fluctuating vicissitudes of Philip Pirrip's (Pip's) eventful life, from an orphaned, tormented child apprenticed to genial blacksmith Joe to, by a turn of ironic fate, a wealthy \\"gentleman\\" of leisure. As been often noted, Dickens created worlds, if not universes, in his novels, and GE is certainly no exception. In this review, I will try to avoid detailing the plot, which is already well-known. Instead, I will comment upon Dickens's use of backstory and flashback to flesh out most of the major characters in the novel.Even the most colorful, flamboyant characters in GE are not one-dimensional or stereotypically good or evil. We learn how Miss Havisham's marital jilting by Arthur compelled her to become a spectral recluse in her gloomy estate. We learn how Miss Havisham's misanthropic upbringing caused her frosty ward Estella (whose name suggests a blazing but distant star) to become an inaccessible man-hater. We learn how Magwitch, Pip's surprising benefactor, became a convict through cynical ad hominem prosecution in the barbaric English court system, was transported to the penal colony that was Australia, and how he acquired the money through hardship just to help the orphan Pip, who showed him mercy at the graveyard, and why he risked arrest in London to see his gentleman. We learn that Estella's mother, servant to Mr. Jaggers the lawyer, was convicted of murder but saved, after a fashion, by the lawyer and how she had to sacrifice her daughter so that she could become a lady. We even learn about the somewhat schizophrenic Wemmick, Jagger's clerk, who is sullen and joyless at work but positively animated and exuberant when he is at home (The Castle) with his elderly invalid father The Aged. Through these backstories, we find out that no Dickensian character is ultimately utterly despicable, or demonic, or flawless, or saintly. They are all achingly human, trying to live life the best they can.Since GE is primarily about the growth and development of Pip, we witness his human complexity most of all. In a paraphrase of a comment made by his friend Herbert, Pip is intelligent and naive, curious and hesitant, loyal and perfidious, snobbish but introspective, a false gentleman (through wealth) and a true gentleman (through re-discovered contrition, feeling, and love). Dickens's revelation of the humanity that still lurks in the most wretched of us is encapsulated nicely by Pip's caretaker and brother-in-law, the brawny but forgiving Joe, who says about his abusive father, \\"Whatsumever the failings on his part, dear reader, remember that he was that good in his heart\\". This noble, some may say Christian, sentiment, elevates GE beyond its busy, coincidental melodramatic soap opera plottings and trains its sharp focus on the multifaceted levels of the human condition."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Compared to other Dickens' books I have read, this one is the most bizarre and strange story, and it took a little bit of adjustment to get into it. But it didn't take long to lose myself in the magical, grand drama by this literary wizard. As usual, this book has rich background materials, the marshes, deprivation, violence, mysterious and dark past, turns and twists, surprises and over the top coincidences, vengence and forgiveness...The first person perspective by the protagonist is candid and often humorous as well as insightful about the conflict and frustration of an underprevileged person with aspirations in the society where status of a person is not very mobile.

Raised an orphan, Pip acquires a mysterious benefactor who funds his attempt to become a gentleman.

I would watch Great Expectations on the big screen, I'd watch the mini-series, I'd pay to see it live on Broadway - and none of that would compare with reading it again."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"My English teacher from my freshman year in high school didn't like this book, but I loved it! I thought Pip was pretty cute when he was a little boy, and I really didn't see any change in him when he became rich like my teacher said. This is a great book, and it's the only book I liked that I ever read in English class along with 'Anthem' and 'Of Mice and Men'. Like most books it goes slow at first, but you get into it more and more. Although I really, really do like this book, I refuse to see the movie which stars Ethan Hawke and Gwenyth Paltrow, because just by looking at the commericals and the pictures from the movie, I could tell that it's not like the book at all and for that, I know that I would hate it. As a matter of fact, my friend told me that it wasn't. So, I refuse to see the movie, but I was able to see an older movie of the book and I liked it, because it was like the book and that's what I like. This is a wonderful book and I wouldn't mind reading it again! A must have for any literature fans who like to sit back, relax, and well...read. : )"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I had to read this book this year for my English class. At first I was interested, when Pip was a child, but I quickly became sick and tired of it's boring nature. I am in the honors program in my school, and we only had about 2 and a half weeks to read it, but it seemed like 2 and a half years. I was disappointed most because this massive plot builds up, and I was waiting for something to happen, but nothing really did. Furthermore, it was a bit hard to understand, especially since my mind was drifting, becuase it is hard to pay attention to this book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is definitely one book that I'll read again and again throughout my life. If I had to pick a favorite character, it would probably be Estelle because even though she was cold and distant and VERY conceited, she still had a heart of gold. It was lonely Miss Havisham who made Estelle the cold-hearted person that she was. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in reading about interesting characters that continue to develop throughout the story."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I've been out of college for awhile. Being away from literature and into the &quot;Real World,&quot; I had almost forgotten what reading a good book is like. I picked this up and literally couldn't do anything else until I finished reading it! Highly recommended for anyone who loves good fiction."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Read the review from the high school student who thinks he's a martian, and I think you'll agree that most of the bozos who give this novel less than five stars are full of snot."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"You said no one who is still is high school will understand this book. That is not entirely true. I am in seventh grade. I not only loved the book, I understood it too. I have done character analyses (for instance: Bentley Drummle had a troubled childhood) and critisized Pip's character. My mom insists that he's a &quot;loser&quot; - but, then again, she never did have that much insight into character. The poor guy is in love so he can hardly see straight! Anyway, I don't pretend that I'm average, because I'm not. But I enjoyed it and understood it."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"It's just too, too bad that no one reads this anymore. It is a timeless story of a young man (love-stricken from young childhood) growing to adulthood by means of a mysterious benefactor. Mr. Jaggers, John Wemmick, Biddy, Matthew and Belinda Pocket, Bentley Drummle, the Aged Parent, and Miss Skiffins are just a few of the absolutely marvelous characters that Dickens created for his story. And how could I forget Estella Havisham, the object of Pip's (christened Phillip) affection? Mr. and Mrs. Joe get a fair part of the story, and they are both delightful - one, because she is so horrible, and the other, because he is so good. A few of the more minor characters (the aformentioned Miss Skiffins is one) such as Trabbe's boy and The Avenger are superb even though they may only speak a few words. If I could give it ten stars, I would!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is Dickens' 3rd last novel, and nothing indicates that he was running out of steam. While this lacks (in my opinion) the energy of &quot;Dombey and Son&quot; (1848), &quot;David Copperfield&quot; (1850), &quot;Bleak House&quot; (1853), or &quot;Hard Times&quot; (1854), it is still a phenomenal piece of literature. Pip is an interesting creation. First we see him as a small child who is victimized by his sister. His brother in law Jo (while not too bright) never approves of Pip's abuse. It is interesting that Dickens wrote this troubled marriage scene soon after his own divorce! It is also painfully tragic when Pip starts to make his way into the world and he has to realize that the kind hearted but simple Jo has to take a back seat to his success. Jaggers offers some welcome comical touches. It is interesting that Pip becomes victimized by a legitimate colleague Orlick and as it turns out, the old thief was his benefactor. (In my opinion the old thief was a literary reincarnation of Fagin.) To this day, I have never forgotten the chills when I discovered that the old thief in the early part of the novel was his benefactor. So we have domestic quarrles, true to life tragic events, strong images, comical touches, and surprise events!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I reallly liked this book, though it made me tired to read it and I could not have any distractions while I read, I am really glad I did. This book was a good challenge if you stick to it. The book all comes together at the end if you keep reading. The characters are really deep. My teacher says the best thing about Great Expectations is it has a twisted plot line and the worst thing about Great Expectations is that it has a twisted plot line. Overall, I enjoyed the book, except the last two chapters. I believe Dickens got tired of writing the book and desided to end the book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book is superb. Everything about it is very real to life (unlike much of Dickens' other novels). Though it may be hard to comprehend, it doesn't take a genius to understand the themes of this book. I'm not going to spoil it for anybody, but believe me, the themes plays into everybody's life, including love, money, and heritage. I also recommend Catcher in the Rye if you're into the types of books that make you stop and ponder."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I had to read Great Expectetions for school, at first it seemed like the worst book ever written, it was boring, confusing, and seemingly pointless. But, of course that was before I finished it and fully understood what Dickens was tying to convey. the whole book is a mystery, only in the very end do you finally find everything out. Note: if you are going to read the Cliffs Note version of the book (which i highly recommend you do) do not read the character summaries, because that will kill the whole book for you. Believe it or not, this is probabaly the only classial book with enough suspense to compete with the modern thrillers. Oh, and by the way, if you don't have to read it for school, I highly recommend you listen to the audio tape."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Those who have known the whole constitution of true art will assign to its realm Great Expectations. What I say may not convince you of its quintessential nature, but hopefully it will open your mind to possibly the greatest novel of all time."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Those who have known the whole nature of true art will surely assign to its realm Great Expectations. What I say may not convince you, but please, do yourself a favor, and read the book. The Bible, Tolkien's books, and Great Expectations are the greatest I have yet to encounter."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"After having a very diffiult time enjoying A Tale of Two Cities, which I found to be unappealing, austere, and excessively verbose, I was prepared to denounce this book as well. However, it is far too good to heap words like &quot;boring&quot; upon simply because it is long and involved. The autobiographical narration lends it a personal quality far more appealing than that of A Tale of Two Cities, and above all Dicken's empathy for his characters is apparent. The branching subplots weave together seamlessly as the novel progresses (Unlike some people I'm not going to spoil the ending for everyone). Even if you've been turned off by Dicken's before, give it a chance."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"One of the best books I've read to date. Not at all boring unlike many other books of this time period. Can be quite humorous and the plot is masterful. The characters are masterfully portrayed, especially Joe and Pip. It's not even difficult reading! Are the majority of reviewers 16 year-olds that were forced to read it?"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This was a pretty good book. Some parts of it were hard to understand, but most of it was ok."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"An overall enjoyable read. The book is very well written and Charles Dickens has written excellent descriptions. I'm fascinating at the people who come here and rate it low, ah well, they obviously cannot read great literature. If you don't like books like this, go back to your &quot;Star Wars super adventure novels&quot;"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations By: Charles DickensGreat Expectations is about a boy named Pip who comes into great property and is searching for the benefactor of his fortunes. I didn't care for the ending much because I was thinking something great should happen, but then there's a big let-down. It was hard for me to keep my attention on the book. Everything is explained with such great detail, and half of the things explained don't need to be. If you enjoy reading books that are very detailed, this is the book for you!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is truly a masterpiece. It is an inspiring tale of a departure from innocence into the cruel realities of the real world. Although not totally enlightening, it is entertaining and leaves one on the edge from chapter to chapter."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"\\"Great Expectations\\" by Charles Dickens is a story of a boy named Pip and his experiences growing up. The story begins with Pip visiting his parents' grave sites. Here he meets a runaway convict and begins a new journey. The convict persuades young Pip to get food and a file for him. Pip does and the convict is thankful, but later is captured and confesses that he alone stole the food. Pip is sent for by Miss Havisham, a middle-aged woman whose whim it is to live in the bridal dress she wore on the day she was jilted by her lover. She hates all males and sends for Pip to enjoy the sight of him being tormented by Estella, a proud, beautiful young girl. Pip falls in love with her. Pip's sister dies before he comes of age, and Pip receives money from an unknown benefactor. During this time he learns about himself, his love for Estalla, and the unknown benefactor. This book is about a young mans life who has a few unique experiences and what he learns.Charles Dickens uses imagry that takes the form of real objects. The detail and words he uses gives more meaning and detailed images. It allows each situation to be clearly seen. The imagery also comes from the analogies and metaphors. It gave the book more life, more meaning. The visualizable images, metaphor and other kinds of figurative language set up great results thought the entire text."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"OK... I know how Dickens is supposed to be this wonderful author, but lets just face it - Its boring! Its not his fault, when he wrote everyone wrote like that, but these days its just too hard to follow.. The plot was really good tho.. almost like an old soap opera, with twists and turns everywhere.. Now if he could have written the same story in 200-300 pages instead of 500, maybe people would enjoy this book more!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations by Charles Dickens is a great mix of humor, thrills and suspense. You never know what will pop around from the other side of the page. Pip gives us an insight to the way people really are and, what they should be."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book is great it has many twists and turns and always leaves you thinking. I would definetly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is worth the time to read. It's actually a bit amusing to see if you can follow the bread-crumb trail and predict what'll happen next. (Usually, you'll be right.) I offer this warning: * Do NOT read the abridged version! * In tightening things up, they usually cut out the best parts."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Pages are all different size and roughly cut. A bit rubbish, really. This is not a reflection on the narative, which of course is well reviewed in general."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I was forced to read this book in my English class this year, and I almost died. For a more thrilling read, try a dictionary or a phone book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Charles Dickens ReviewI think that this book was a little bit advanced for us to be reading there was way too many different characters and way to many character changes. If he would have kept the book simpler, it might have been a little bit easier to read and understand. It also would have helped if the author would have only given some of the characters one name instead of giving some people two names making it look like they were a completely different person, that was very confusing.It was good at the end when things finally started coming together and making a little more sense. One of my favorite parts was when Pip finally realizes that he is not meant to be a gentleman, and that he was meant to be a blacksmith. The major themes were the only thing that really helped me understand the book. I really didn&#65533;t like this book very much because I couldn&#65533;t really relate to it, therefore, I couldn&#65533;t understand it. I think that we should have read a book that was more modern and practical."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is my least favorite book. I was forced to read it for freshman honors English, or I would have stopped reading it. It has a good plot, but because Dickens was paid by the word, he added too many useless details. I really didn't enjoy dinner scenes that lasted for 17,000 chapters without revealing anything remotely important. However, the way the characters intertwined was fascinating. If you want to get the interesting part of the book, read the cliff's notes. I've also heard it's a little less mind-numbing on tape. Only read the book if you're going to be quizzed on it the next day. I don't know if all Dickens is this bad, but I'll not read any more of his books until I'm forced to for my next English class."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations was not that great of a novel.

I wouldn't call it horrible but it is intensly boring. Dickens takes a whole chapter to say something anybody could say in a sentence. Im in the eighth grade and am required to read it.

I only recommend this for reader lovers, highly advanced people in litereture and who can understand something not written in english."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book was very dull and boring. I was made to read it in English and I soon realized not far in that it was very boring. It's not a good book for highschool readers. It is written in very dull and boring text. I mean the theme is great and all but the language and storyline stinks. I would not ever read this book again and if I had a choice to get this book or nothing i wouldn't get anything. It isn't a book to buy but for some odd reason is still have the one left from school. This book is quite possibly the worst book i ever read. If you are really interested in this book then go see the stupid movie or rent i from the library."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Do not read this book. It is a form of painful torture! If you have to read it for school buy the Cliff Note. Or if your instructor is on to that kind of thing, at least listen to the audio book. At all costs do not read this book! Take it from someone who knows."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"You won't be needing a bookmark with this novel- more like a pillow! I read this my freshman year of high school, maybe I was just too young to understand it and appreciate it, but I could not read the whole thing without falling asleep.

Unless you are suffering from insomnia, I wouldn't buy it."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I had to read GE for my freshmen honors English class, and I thought Lord of the Flies was bad! Dickens takes 1 paragraph to convey an idea that could have been said in 1 sentence! Many of the vocabulary is just out of our time, and take the fun out of the story. Unless you have heaps of time and patience, I recommend that you stay away from this &quot;book&quot;."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I did not have \\"great\\" expectations after reading some of Mr. Dickens other work (see my review of \\"Tale of The Two Cities\\").

They are going back to the classics. I never received the Great Expectations.The computer said it was sent but never showed up on my Kindle. I have a Kindle and I have also ordered products from my computer. I somehow found myself with two (2) accounts with Amazon. I could order books for my Kindle with one account and anything else with the other account. I have tried to straighten this out twice. The result of the last time was to close my Kindle account and the loss of all my books on my Kindle. I still am unable to order from my Kindle and now am also unable to order Kindle books from my computer. Which makes my Kindle completely useless, just a piece of garbage.While I'm on the subject I recently ordered a book and received an E mail saying the bank refused to honor the credit card number. Some time ago I had notified Amazon of a new number that the bank had issued. They had gone back and used the old number. I straightened that out and then I received an E mail saying the Book was undeliverable and Amazon was issuing a refund (the address was right). I may never receive that refund because they keep going back and using the old credit card number.I will never order anything from Amazon again."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book has a good story concept and Dickens writes well...but the story would have been alot better had he not been paid by the word. His lengthy descriptions of mundane tasks serve to break the pacing of a novel that already barely dredges along."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I am in the seventh grade and we had to read this book in literature. Thanks to a great teacher, we were able to get through this book without too many difficulties; however, I would not recommend this book to anyone who does not want to invest a while in reading it! I took us the whole second semester to finsh this book, doing most of the reading at home. While most everyone was engrossed in the storyline, it was like pulling teeth to actually read! I really enjoyed the story, but I would raher just remember the story than refresh my memory by rereading it because, face it, the story is just too long!P.S.Since I feel this is such a great story, instead of reading the book, might I recommend watching the movie?"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"In the first twenty or thirty pages, I was pleasantly surprised by Dickens's humor and had great expectations for his storytelling and prose-writing talent.I mean he is hailed as one of the greatest literary giants of English literature, as well as one of the most popular novelists of his time.But alas, my great expectations were dashed mercilessly, and I found myself - not unlike how Pip finds himself in the last portion of the novel - banging my head against the hard, boundless boredom that permeated the first 300 pages of non-drama, non-action, and non-story whose only saving grace was that it was not endless.In the beginning, Dickens sustains the story with action, and there's nothing wrong with that as it makes the story more engaging. But aside from that in the first interminable and insufferable two stages of \\"Pip's Great Expectations\\" that span exactly 300 pages, I was thoroughly disappointed in Dickens. Other than Pip getting rich all of a sudden, NOTHING happens: no desire, no real conflict, no gaps, no turning points.As far as the story is concerned, the 300 pages is crap.I said it. Don't gasp.The story finally, finally, finally picks up when Pip finds out the identity of his benefactor, goes through rather inexplicable mental ordeals about accepting the truth along with free money and sentimental outbursts with his \\"dear friend\\" Herbert about pretty much everything, followed by an incredibly maudlin confrontation with the guilt-stricken Ms. Havisham and a final showdown with the villainous Orlick into whose clutches Pip idiotically falls with a stupid letter that gives him little reason to risk the whole grand escape plan he and Herbert hatch for the next day.My conclusion: this book is overrated.Why is it that academics pick these boring books that can't tell stories as part of the western canon? I love reading classics, thanks, but THIS?The book displays a glaring lack of storytelling talent, psychological insight, and restraint. His prose is dense, sprawling, and unseemly as sentences are connected by ugly semicolons and don't flow beautifully at all. The scenes are more told than shown to the detriment of the flow of the story, and characters burst out into mawkish sentiments left and right.Yuck.People are irresistibly drawn to anything related to themselves. I have a sneaking suspicion that the academics who bill this book as \\"most fascinating\\" and \\"greatest and most sophisticated work\\" see THEIR prominent characteristic in it.Cloying, verbose, mediocre at best in the story composition, and irresistibly boring for the first 300 pages, it's \\"most fascinating\\" in the perplexing literary status it garnered over the years, \\"greatest\\" in its unnecessary length,and \\"most sophisticated\\" in the exquisite boredom it creates at that threshold pitch that is above sleep-inducing but below engaging.I won't be reading another Dickens in a long time.Read something else and save your time."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I'm a senior in high school and was asked to read this book for my AP English 12 class. While it had some parts that were somewhat interesting, overall I couldn't get into the book. I couldn't even finish the book, I was so bored with it. I don't recommend it."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I am an avid reader and enjoy reading most books. This book, however, I found exstremely boring and I constantly lost interest. There were very few interesting chapters and I was thrilled at finally finishing the book and moving on to another that was better. I can honestly say that this book was one of the worst books I have ever read and would never recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is one of my favorite Dickens books, detailing a lifelong love story between Pip and Estella. So sometimes the circumstances aren't realistic - so what? TV shows these days aren't either. Pip is a likeable character, and the various other characters represent real forces in our society. This is a great novel."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Each time that I read Great Expectations I'm left wondering whether or not Pip would have been happier if he had never been made the gift of \\"great expectations.\\" More importantly, would he have been a better man if he had remained apprenticed to his blacksmith brother-in-law Joe rather than having been sent to London to be trained in the ways of a gentleman?Great Expectations is a Dickens cautionary tale in which the author warns his readers of what can so easily happen to a person when given the opportunity to \\"better himself\\" by leaving his home, family and friends behind for education and fortune-seeking in the big city. As soon as word reached the local townspeople around whom Pip had spent his early years that a fortune was soon to be his, Pip found himself treated with respect and awe by the very people who had had little time for him in the past other than to chastise his behavior and relationship with the sister who was raising him \\"by hand.\\" Their \\"boy\\" became \\"sir\\" overnight it seemed.But sadly, after arriving in London and seeking to impress his new friends and colleagues, Pip decided that those who loved him most were an embarrassment to his future prospects and he only occasionally felt any guilt about his lack of contact with them. It is only when Pip's future prospects shockingly take a turn for the worse that he seeks the comfort of the family that he left behind.Along the way, Dickens fills Great Expectations with some of the most memorable characters in British literature history. There are Miss Havisham, the spinster who never recovered from being jilted at the altar; Joe, the blacksmith and Pip's brother-in-law who never stopped loving Pip as a son no matter how much Pip neglected him over the years; Estella, the beautiful young woman whom Pip has loved since they were small children but who has been raised by Miss Havisham to give her heart to no man; Herbert, Pip's best London friend, a truly good man who both benefits from Pip's help and who eventually offers Pip a new future of his own; and, of course, Magwitch, the colorful escaped criminal whom Pip meets in the first pages of the book.This is one of those books that I read every few years because re-reading it is like visiting an old friend after too long an absence. As the old memories come back, it's like I've never been away."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"First of all (as I like to say!) I'm no smarter than you and I thought this book was great, that said, this book is not THE easiest to read in that it does take a while for things to get really interesting. I rated it 5 stars because it is excellent but you need to have some patience with this book, in the end it is much worth the effort....and keep me updated!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I don't know what you guys are talking about. If you're a serious reader - and I expect you are if you willingly attempt this book - then there shouldn't be a problem getting into it. Dickens is far easier to read then Dostoevsky or Tolstoy or even Hawthorne or James.You have to understand that you can't skim the classics. If you do, then you miss out on subtle prompts and hints. In fact, any good book should have some buried clues, clues that if you don't pick up, the plot will be confusing or pointless. That's what makes these kinds of books great, the challenge and the reward, plus the wonders they do for your vocabulary.If you want books you can skim over before bedtime and still pick up the plot and characters, that's fine, not everyone needs to be a serious reader. However, don't go around bashing great books that you shouldn't be reading, because you might turn off somebody who will really enjoy it.If you have a real problem with the book, mention the plot, or accurately describe why you don't like the writing style."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations is truly one of Dickens' best works. It is long but there is so much to offer - rich, memorable characters, universal themes, exciting adventure, unrequited love, murder, mystery, and revenge. The plot touches heavily upon social class distinctions, education, economics and crime and punishment. Issues that still resonate with the modern reader today.Great Expectations, famously, begins in a cemetery where the orphaned Pip is visiting the graves of his parents. There he encounters an escaped convict from a nearby prison ship who is to change his life though Pip will not understand fully how until many years later. As the book continues he meets many surreal characters with perhaps the most memorable being Miss Havisham, the crazed jilted bride, whose manipulations in regard to Pip and her adopted daughter,Estella, break Pip's heart and leave Estella a shallow, empty woman. Another one of Dickens more famous characters appearing in Great Expectations is Pip's guardian, Jaggers, the successful and possibly compulsive obsessive, attorney. Less well known but equally memorable appearances are made by Pip's loyal friend Herbert Pocket whose unusual family provide comic relief and social satire, Pip's brother-in-law the kind but uneducated Joe Gargory, Mrs. Joe, Pip's shrewish sister who is raising Pip \\"by hand\\", Jagger's assistant Wemmick who neatly divides his home life and his work life plus a host of others. Life in 19th century England - both London and it's small towns - are masterfully kept alive by Dickens' sure contemporary descriptions."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"My first complete Dickens book was \\"A Tale of Two Cities.\\" Since that was an idealistic romance novel, this book rather surprised me with its portrayals of the darker side of human nature. Instead of heart-wrending sacrifices, I found painful ingratitude. Instead of perfect heroines, I found scheming, insensitive women. This book was not anything I expected with regards to characterization and theme. However, I would have to say this book exemplifies human nature much, much better. It was not a very entertaining read at all, but the craftsmanship and word employment simply could not be better. This book may not turn one's daydreams on paper, but it is a solid, landmark work of literature."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"My daughter had to read \\"Great Expectations\\" for 9th grade English,she was short of time and a slow reader. This unabridged version really filled the bill. She could listen while being otherwise engaged or read along with the book. The Actor/reader is the same one who read all of the Harry Potter books. Well read and helped keep her interest."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I wanted to revisit this \\"classic\\", having read it in high school and remembering it fondly. I was not disappointed, for I found the story more applicable to my life now, ten years later, than at the time of my first reading. Back then, it seemed a good yarn - lots of fun characters, intriguing plot twists - a grand adventure. Upon rereading, I was able to absorb the story while thinking about my own \\"coming of age\\", and weigh the morality of Pip's universe. At the same time, my original impressions were not misguided - the moral/societal questions Dickens explores are layered into the fun characters and strong plot development.In addition, there are some interesting \\"reading group\\" questions at the back, as well as some interesting commentary by various authors since the time of the original publication. For that reason, I would recommend this edition."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Above all what I loved about this book was how all the characters came together and were somehow related in some surprising way. The book was very well written. I had to read this book for school and I'm glad that I was forced to or I might never have chosen to read this book. The language was very understandable unlike some other books I've read from that time period. I really recommend it."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"One of the great novels in the English language. It would be presumptuous of me to add more. Most readers would benefit from reading this book. My first time was forty years ago. Great novels should be spaced out in one's life and reread at specific junctures."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"How nice to reread an old classic as an adult, instead of in the classroom. A wonderful novel of Pip who comes into his \\"great expectations\\" via an unknown benefactor -- who he believes to be Miss Havisham. We see how the influence of money and position affect Pip's relations with his family and former neighbors, and not necessarily for the better. There are lots of surprise twists and turns in the plot, especially about Miss Havisham and her adopted \\"daughter\\" Estella and her true parentage.As always, a Dickens novel is peopled with wonderful and unusual characters that eventually all play a part in telling the story. I noticed another reviewer said there were two endings. The version I read had only one ending and I don't know which one it was. I will have to search out another version to see which I liked best."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"First of all (as I like to say!) I'm no smarter than you and I thought this book was great, that said, this book is not THE easiest to read in that it does take a while for things to get really interesting. I rated it 5 stars because it is excellent but you need to have some patience with this book, in the end it is much worth the effort....and keep me updated!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I don't tend to be much of a fiction reader. Popular modern fiction is so often shallow, and as such seems a waste of time. Which is why I read Great Expectations, it has stood the test of time. I never read it in the past because I assumed that the prose would be somewhat archaic and difficult, but I was wrong, I found it very readable and surprisingly funny, which I also didn't expect. The funniest bits in my opinion are Pips first meeting with Miss Havisham and later his discription of his proceedure for doing his personal accounting, which I certainly identified with."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I did not want this to end! I knew the book, I knew the characters, but I doubt anyone else could have made them come more alive as they had existed in my mind's eye. The period of the time, the nuances of language and emotions - it is all captured here. I caught myself - a Dickens' fan, completely entranced. And you absolutely forget that it is all one person reading. The wonderful descriptors Dickens so artfully paints in complete portraits and scenery with words, flow effortlessly, almost musically so that the it unfolds in the listeners mind as sure as one were reading Dickens' words. I found myself taking the long routes home as I listened in the car on commutes. I would be pleased to purchase any other set read by Michael Page, particularly from this period. Now if we could just get Page to record any of Wilkie Collins' work..."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"\\"Great Expectations\\" is a thoroughly engaging novel. We find a set of interweaving story lines that rival today's best movies ('Crash' comes to mind. Sorry! I digress, already.) Anyway, as usual, the protagonist and narrator, Pip, bears all the innocense of Dickens' best characters. He is able to observe all the qualities and idiosyncracies of the good, the bad, and the ugly in Victorian England. As another orphan character, he is \\"brought up by hand\\" by his strict and nasty sister with the help of his brother-in-law, Joe Gargery, a benevolent blacksmith. The plot moves quickly as he comes upon an escaped convict who coerces him to get him food and a file. He finds the experience all too much, for he is in a no-win situation. He manages to escape this escapade with grace, but not the situation his sister places him into. She forces him upon the company of Miss Havisham, an old, bitter woman who has never recovered from being jilted early in life. Through her he meets a young woman, named Estella, and falls hopelessly in love. Through Havisham's patronage, he becomes an apprenticed gentleman as well as Joe's apprenticed blacksmith; then he obtains wealth from a mysterious benefactor. From these experiences, he acquires a gentleman's demeanor as well as a gentleman's appetite for money.\\"Great Expectations\\" is a worthy classic book experience. The characters are drawn well, especially Miss Havisham. (The images Dickens uses for her and her surroundings are among the most memorable of the novel.) It defines what true wealth is, and juxtaposes well the pompous and the hypocritical characters with the genuine and good. 'Great Expectations' demonstrates, more than it preaches, about the virtues presented. Also, the plot lines run together in a way that is so skillful, it hardly seems contrived. There is also some good irony and suspense thrown in for good measure. \\"Great Expectations\\" is a decent and enjoyable reading voyage."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations by Charles Dickens is a timeless 19th century novel that addresses issues in life that remain relevant today. In particular, it explores the modern individual's personal development through experiences that span from youth to adulthood.In Great Expectations, Dickens employs several techniques to effectively portray the personal development of the main character Pip. The title, Great Expectations, is significant because it reveals that the plot focuses on Pip's aspirations in life. The novel is a first person narrative, with an older Pip retelling and commenting on past events that had an influence on his social development. This element allows the reader to observe how a young Pip reacted to events in his life and how an older and more mature Pip interprets these events years later. A recurring theme throughout Great Expectations is the class system of Victorian England and the significance of social status. Pip struggles with the issue of social status throughout the novel and must come to the realization that social status is not connected to one's real character.In his novel Great Expectations, Charles Dickens combined aspects of his own life, with his knowledge of human behavior, to create a realistic portrayal of an individual's personal development. The novel's portrayal is so clear and its content so relevant that it continues to be read and analyzed over a century after it was first written."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"As young men and women, at some we must make the choice to stay in the community and be a humble fish in a little pond or strike out on our own in the big city.There are many ways to do this and Pip, the main character, does it scornfully although he does not know it at the time. Like so many people, he is lured by the bright lights, \\"sophisticated\\" culture and big money of the big city. He has no problem leaving behind a simple world where he is cared for via an unknown benefactor for an unknown reason. He guesses at whom the benefactor might be and what their intent is, but he gets it all wrong. He falls from the path of moral righteousness and has no idea what his life really means. Dickens masterfully crafts together this story. I think that Joe represented good Pip and Orlick was the alter ego. Additionally, I was kicking myself for not seeing a couple of plot twists, but I was so engrossed that I didn't see them coming. I hope the same thing happens to you.I wonder if F.S. Fitzgerald was influenced by Dickens because there is a fantasy like worship of the rich, followed by a downward spiraling degradation. Although F.S.F writes about the rich with outright contempt, Dickens neutrally accepts them more as a vehicle for the story.Anyway, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Charles Dickens' novel Great Expectations explores the side of human nature that many do not like to read in novels. In the United States, in the 21st Century, people would rather read about romantic-style plots where all turns out well for the protagonists. Dickens, however, chooses to illuminate what man can really be capable of: betrayal, duplicity, unfaithfulness, and a handful of other negative characteristics.Definitely an interesting novel, Great Expectations will undoubtedly have its audience intrigued and constantly pondering.I would highly recommend this masterpiece."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Unlike many of the reviewers who wrote so passionately about this work it is not a book that has played a significant part in my reading life. The great narrative drive, the tremendous skill in creating vital characters, the richly descriptive and often ironic language are aspects of Dickens genius.But somehow the world of Dickens dark and gloomy and Victorian and so British reality never really appealed to me. This says nothing however about the quality of the work and its great gifts to the reader. The book is the portrayal of a society, and of a moral education. This is a book about the formation of a character through experience, about learning from life's difficulties and disappointments to become a better person. It is about ' recognition' not only of one's own true and better self, but about what is important in life. This book as Dickens himself has had enormous influence on Western literature. I think of two very different writers, Kafka and Salinger both of whom clearly had Dickens in mind in certain points of their writing. Pip, Magwitch , Joe Gargary,Miss Havisham, Estella are living characters in the heart of Western literature. The book then I believe is far greater, far more than my own reading has given me of it. Not always apparently does the reader do justice to the work."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"i was a assigned this book to read over the summer between 8th and 9th grade for my honors english (it seems as though many students are assigned this book going into 9th grade honors english. is it some sort of nation-wide standard?)... at parts the language can be thick and a little harder to decipher than most the language of most authors people my age are used to reading... this is only a slight hindrance, though, because about half way trhough the book (assuming this is your first dickens book, as it was for me) you get used to it and you seem to be talking like pip in real life!!!!!!! (well, a little bit for me because i read the book wuite quickly, seeing as how i loved it) i kept saying betwixt instead of between, which i enjoy saying now because it makes me feel smarter than evryone else (jk).... anyway, i was the single person in my class that absolutely LOVED this book... the only thing that i didn't like was taking EXTENSIVE nots throughout the book, which ruins many of the other books we read (such as the amazing lord of the flies).... aside from that, the book is quite good... not only is dickens able to hold my attention through most of the book (when i say most, i;m excyuding the part where they are planning that escape with provis, which i thought was boring), which is a huge feet for someone such as charles dickens, who i expected to bore the living daylights out of me... overall, the plot is very good, but the messages that it carries are even better... pip is driven by greed all throughout the book, until he becomes mentally ill... when he realizes what he's done, he becomes a new person, and is at peace with himself... the realationship between him and estella is very complex, too.. until very late in the book, he is captured by her beauty, he partakes in a blind love for her. by the end of the novel, after all he has been through with her, he gains a true love for her based on her qualities, not because she is rich and beautiful.. this love was always there, he just did not uncover the exactness of it until he grew as a person through his sever low. so many vivid characters, i can't even explain how good the characterization is int he book... IF YOU HAVEN'T READ THIS BOOK, READ IT NOW OR YOU WILL BE DISSAPOINTED LATER ON!!!!!! if you can, read it twice, as i plan to (probably next summer, so it isn't so fresh in my mind)... group discussion on the book really accentuate the meaning of the book... the meaning is really deep, and most people don't catch all of it. the lake is much deeper than the top of the seaweed, don't be afraid to plunge to the bottom...though this book did not completely enlighten me and totally change my life, i did learn from it, which is something that rarely comes in spades. in this case it comes in spades, hearts, diamons AND clubs...enough rambling for me, im sure your not even going to read that whole review, it was quite long...review in a nutshell: good book with good messages (plural) and an engrossing plot... READ IT!!!!!other good books: bleak house by dickens (my man), heart of darkness by joseph conrad, farhenheit 451 by ray bradbury, lord of the flies by william golding, siddartha by herman hesse (not many people have read this, WHY?!?!!?!?!??!), don quixote by cervantes, old man and the sea by earnest hemmingway... can't think of any more off the top of my head... oh yeah, dracula by bram stoker...thank you, good bye"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Like many other high schoolers who wrote reviews on this page, I was forced to read this in my freshman english class. I thought it was an extremely good story. The characters (my favorites being Orlick and Trabb's Boy) are brilliant and subtley funny. The story is creative and unpredictible, and overall, it was absolutely supberb. The only reason this book doesn't get 5 stars is because it tends to drag a lot of the time, and Dickens overlong descriptions are a bit grating on the nerves, but I DO understand why people would have liked it like that in the 1800's. They liked their books long and juicy. It's a bit dated but Great Expectations is well worth a read if you have the patience. Even if you are impatient, you can not miss this great story and its wonderful characters, so at least see one of the many great movie adaptions. My personal favorite movie version of Great Expectations is the 1999 Masterpiece theatre version."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Having not read this since high school (and not being able to finish it due to boredom), and now having the ability to rediscover it since it was a free download, i decided to give this book another whirl.I was pleasantly surprised....I loved it. I found the book to be moving, interesting, and an all around great read. It has all the classic Dickens-style plot twists, with some great surprises, as well as some pretty contrived coincidences (also classic Dickens).I only took off a star because the ending was changed from how i remembered it. When I googled it, I found that Dickens often changed the endings of his books in to go with the times..... not a big fan of that!!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I just graduated with a Literature degree and, amazingly, had never read anything by Dickens. I had gained a sort of superiority to the man and his works. I would dismiss it as all sentimental unbelievabilities. But I decided to not be so proud and read one of his books. On a recommendation from one of my professors, I started with Great Expecations. What I found was a deeply engrossing, funny and humane book that captivated me for the week and a half that it took to read it. Much of it was very realistic (barring, of course, the unrealistic coincidences, that are actually, in their own way, quite comforting) and believable. Dickens went a long way to get into the mind of his narrator, and it works beautifully, as we struggle with Pip in every decision and look back with him at the bad decisions that he made. The themes of the novel (pride, isolation, friendship, hopeless love, etc.) can easily be translated into our own society, putting ourselves in the shoes of the characters as we deal with our mistakes and try to do the right thing. A very amazing book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"There is no doubt that Charles Dickens' \\"Great Expectations\\" is a masterpiece. The intricacy of its plot has rarely been matched. Its characters are unforgettable. It speaks powerfully to what it means to be human.Pip is the perfect picture of flawed humanity. He is essentially well meaning, but his vision always seems to get cloudy at just the wrong time. Throughout the book, Pip falls prey to his dreams and infatuations. In the process he ignores those who truly love him. Only in the end does he learn, in catastrophic terms, the importance of love. Only then is able to accept it.\\"Great Expectations\\" is the story of Pip's learning process. Along the way we encounter some of Dickens greatest secondary characters: the fierce Mr. Jaggers, the self-centered and mentally unstable Mrs. Havisham and her heartless prodigy Estella, and Pip's great friend Joe.I give a special recommendation to this Bantam Classic edition of the work. Its introduction by John Irving is one of the greatest pieces of criticism ever written.Though not my favorite Dickens novel, I give \\"Great Expectations\\" a heartfelt recommendation."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations succeeds beyond almost all novels of its time in exploring the roots of character and moral behavior. Charles Dickens makes the case for there being the potential for good in everyone. Evil and sin follow from a combination of being self-absorbed and selfish. What is remarkable about the way these themes are handled is that they are clearly based on an assessment of human psychology, long before that field was established.The book is also remarkable for its many indelibly memorable and complex characters. Miss Havisham, Pip, Magwitch, Mr. Jaggers, and Estella are characters you will think about again and again in years to come.The book also surrounds you with a powerful sense of place. Although the England described here is long gone, it becomes as immediate as a nightmare or a dream that you have just awakened from.For a book about moral questions, Great Expectations also abounds in action. The scenes involving Pip and Magwitch are especially notable for way action expresses character and thought.Great Expectations also reeks of irony, something that is seldom noticed in more modern novels. Overstatements are created to draw the irony out into the open, where it is unmistakable. Yet the overstatements attract, rather than repel. The overstatements are like the theatrical make up which makes actors and actresses look strange in the dressing room, but more real on the stage when seen from the audience.At the same time, the plot is deliciously complex in establishing and solving mysteries before that genre had been born. As you read Great Expectations, raise your expectations to assume that you will receive answers to any dangling details. By reading the book this way, you will appreciate the craft that Mr. Dickens employed much more.This is the third time that I have read Great Expectations over the last 40 years. I found the third reading to be by far the most rewarding. If you like the book, I encourage you to read it again in the future as well. You will find that the passage of time will change your perspective so that more nooks and crannies of the story will reveal themselves to you.If this is to be your first reading of the book, do be patient with the book's middle third. It may seem to you that the book is drifting off into a sleep-inducing torpor. Yet, important foundations are being lain for your eventual delight.Mr. Dickens wrote two endings for Great Expectations. Be sure to read both of them. Which one do you prefer? I find myself changing my mind.Give love with an open heart, without expectations!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"All right. I admit it. The book starts out slow. Dickens, though I love the man, writes in such flowery and long winded language at times. What takes many authors a line or two, Dickens will devote whole pages.And I almost put the book down for that exact reason. I'm very happy I did not.With so many detailed threads in the story, the depth to the characters--when they all start to blend together a few chapters in, the result is page-turning.The story centers around a young boy--well, almost young man-- named Pip, and revolves around his growing into age. You cannot help but love the boy. Much of Pip's worry and concern I could relate to--falling in love with a girl who refuses to return your sentiments and only plays with your heart, growing up and leaving home for the first time, and discovering your true relationships with others and yourself, as shocking as they may turn out to be.I felt as if I was side by side with Pip through it all, and that made the novel a wonderful experience for me. I recommend the novel for the young because so much relates to them, and also for the older readers--because you can experience it all again.A wonderful and heart warming tale. Just get through those first chapters.The book is timeless, with the basic story line being one that has affected almost everyone sometime in their life; falling in love with somebody who does not return the feelings. Pip, the main character, falls in love with an exotic and beautiful girl, Estella, but of course she does not have any feelings for him. So Pip does everything he can to win her approval, and most importantly her heart. It is hard to skip around in the book. While some passages might seem as if they have nothing to do with the story, they do. Everything in the story is tied together somehow. Skimming the book is not going to help. Certain events and people the reader thinks are insignificant or forgot completley, will appear over and over throughout the book. I am glad that i decided to read Great Expectations, despite the negative remarks from peers. I found out that most of them never made it past the first few chapters, so they missed out on the good parts. The only reason I did not give the book a higher score is that parts of it are slow and dry, but stick with it, you will not be upset. --This text refers to the Mass Market Paperback edition."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Dickens, for whatever reason, never crossed my path in high school, and in the years since I have found myself intimidated to pick up one of his books. This year I resolved to get over that and selected 'Great Expectations' to be my first venture into Dickens' famous fictional worlds. And what joy! As it turns out I had no reason to be intimidated because Dickens is imminently readable and highly enjoyable.This novel is told from the point of view of Philip Pirrip, nicknamed Pip, who begins his tale as a young boy visiting the graves of his parents when an escaped convict happens upon him and threatens him into helping him get food. This experience will have a huge impact on Pip's life, although just how huge is left to be discovered until much later in the novel. Pip soon finds himself in the service of an eccentrically, manically wounded old woman and her beautiful but cold-hearted charge Estella, whom Pip is doomed to fall for and spend the rest of his days pining for. He begins to feel oppressed by his poor life, anguished that his miserable situation will never be good enough to win Estella's heart. And so it seems to be a blessing when a mysterious benefactor takes Pip away from his home to make a gentleman of him in London. Certainly Pip is pleased to have been \\"rescued\\", but over the course of his teaching a curious thing happens to him: he begins to lose the humanity that had made him such an upstanding young man in the first place. He forsakes relations with his loving family, judges his best friend as a great guy doomed to failure, and slowly allows his finances to spin out of control as he begins to spend more and more of his unnamed benefactor's money.'Great Expectations' is, ultimately, a journey of self discovery. Pip rises in society and leaves his life behind him without realizing just how much it had been worth to him. When he reflects on all that has happened to him and wonders if the inaptitude he had sensed in his friend \\"had never been in him at all, but had been in me,\\" it is a thoughtful discovery that really makes you think about what is truly important in your own life. What makes someone a success? Is it the amount of money in their bank account? Or is it the friendships they forge? Does someone need to be educated to be happy, or can they just be satisfied with what they have? Dickens pulls you along through Pip's story with a great deal of wit and a dash of cynicism that, refreshingly, serves to enlighten the reader rather than depress them. It is an intelligent and heartfelt novel that has become a classic for all of the right reasons, and is one that remains relevant to modern readers -- the true test of a classic, in my opinion. As for myself, I have been thoroughly enchanted by my first experience with Dickens, and look forward to reading many more of his books in the coming year."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations was my first book by Charles Dickens, and I still believe it to be my favorite. It is a very powerful book that connects with people's lives all over. The main character,Pip, grows up in the home of a blacksmith. With both of his parents dead, he lives with his overreactive sister and her husband, Joe Gargery. Pip soon meets Miss Havisham and the beautiful Estella that lives with her. He longs to be a gentleman, but the social class division leaves Pip a blacksmith apprentice, and Estella a lady. However, one night, Mr. Jaggers (a lawyer)comes to Pip and informs him that he is a man of great expectations. Pip has no idea of who his benefactor is, but heads to London to start his eventful life as a gentleman.Great Expectations is a amazing book in many ways. Three of these ways are: the themes, the characters, and the writing. Themes in this book are very important. They can easily relate to us today, and these main ideas are crucial lessons through literature. Next, the characters. Dickens creates such perfect characters that they will stay in your mind and you will begin to link people you know to people in the book. Such characters include Miss Havisham, Joe Gargery, Mr. Jaggers, Magwitch, Herbert Pocket, and many others. These people in Great Expectations make the book enjoyable to read. Lastly, the writing is awesome.

This was a wonderful classic written by the magnificent author Charles Dickens. Charles Dickens wrote a book that truly captivated the power of human love. He showed us that life can be very difficult, and you have to work very hard in order for you to succeed.In the beginning of the book, a character named Pip lived on a forge near some marshes in England. His family was generally poor. He lived with his older sister and her husband named Joe. Joe was a fairly poor blacksmith. One day, Pip was walking on the marshes. Suddenly, a strange man came up to Pip and threatened him. The strange man was a convict who was put to die on the marshes. He was handcuffed and chained. He told Pip that he would kill him if he didn't bring him a steel file and something to eat. Pip then ran back to the forge and brought the convict a steel file and some food. This vivid occurrence haunted Pip for the rest of his life.After the incident on the marshes, Pip met a lady named Miss Havesham. Miss Havesham was a very weird lady. She always wore her wedding dress in her house. She never left her house. Miss Havesham had a very beautiful adopted daughter named Estella. She was an arrogant woman. While looking at her, Pip fell in love with Estella.One day, a mysterious man came to Joe's forge. This man was sent by a secret benefactor who was residing in London. The man didn't give his name. He told Pip and Joe that someone in London was requesting him. The secret benefactor wanted Pip to come to London so that he could become a gentleman. Pip was very excited when he heard that he could work in London. Pip and Joe agreed upon the proposal. Later in that same week, Pip left Joe's forge to travel to London. There he could be a gentleman with a bright and bold future.While in London, Pip encountered many strange mysteries. Pip finally met his secret benefactor. Read the book to find out who the secret benefactor was...Overall, Great Expectations was an outstanding book. It really captivated the vast stretches of life. Great Expectations really made me feel quite sad. I felt very sorry for Pip. He had a very difficult life. He had change his personality forever once he became a gentleman.

I am also sure that whatever edition you get will be great. This book shows tons of emotions, and is guided by the narrator, Pip. It is a superb book, that once you pick up you will never put down.Pip is raised by his sister and brother-in-law, both named Joe, b/c of his parents being dead.

It is easy to read and understand, and it holds students' attention until the very end. The plot is like a roller coaster and all the characters seem to be connected in some way. The end of each chapter leaves the reader in suspense and anxious to continue reading. Although the setting of the novel takes place in 19th century England, the novel's themes and the characters' experiences seem to relate to all social classes, races, and both genders.

While the book portrays England as dreary, in a strange way it makes England seem like a nice place to live in. 1800s England as depicted in the novel has a lot of poor people. But the people seem nicer and more innocent minded then people are these days. Even the bad guys in the story seem more innocent minded then people these days.The book begins with a young child called Pip visiting his parents grave only to be stopped by an escaped convict who asks him for food and a file. Pip goes and gets these things secretly to avoid getting in trouble with his sister. Later on the convict is captured and before he is led away, he lies that he stole food from Pip's aunt's cupboard to Pip's uncle Joe and this saves Pip from getting in trouble for taking the food. After that, Pip gets a strange opportunity at a house called Satis House owned by a Miss Havisham. She pays his aunt to have Pip play with a beautiful girl called Estella. Later on, Pip is told by an aquaintance called Mr. Jagger that he has great expectations. He tells him that a secret benefactor has provided for Pip to be educated. Pip, jumps at this opportunity. He goes to live in a rented room and is educated all the time not knowing who is providing him with the sums to be educated. He continues to think about the beautiful girl Estella who shuns his advances.\\"Great Expectations is a very haunting novel. With the book, I got a full view of what life was like in England in the 1800s. The character Miss Havisham is really scary. Her house with its room where there is a decaying wedding cake is almost like a haunted house. The book contains no supernatural elements though and that's what is so amazing, that Charles Dickens manages to make it scary without putting ghosts or monsters in it. Miss Havisham was clearly a woman with a lot of potential who ruined her life because she couldn't get over a romance that went sour. I felt bad for her and hope people learn from her example.The character that really caught my attention was Estella. I have had experiences in my own life where I had a crush on a girl who didn't have a crush on me and so I knew what Pip was going through and related to his character in this respect. Its when they're young that men are haunted most by those feelings for a girl or a woman, it is clear though that Pip needs to move on and find another girl to get in a relationship with.All in all, Great Expectations is a good fast read even though it is not an adventure novel, which makes the novel even more amazing."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Just a wonderful enthralling read! I enjoyed this so much! I read this in high school but decided to read it again. I just did not appreciate the story line or the characters back as a teenager. I am so glad I decided to re-read this again! I am now going to work my way through more of Dickens novels. His character development is wonderful! The story line has twists and turns to keep the pages turning! You just don't know what you are missing by not reading this novel! Yes, I recommend!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"There are few if any authors who could create such a variety of wonderful characters as Dickens has done in his many novels and short stories. They touch you and remain with you - even becoming icons. This is true in all Dickens novels, and it is no less true in this work. How bizarrely wonderful is Miss Havisham with her tattered and yellowed bridal gown and half century old wedding cake? Who else could come up with such a marvelous character?"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I'm not going to say much about the story, because you probably already know it. I first discovered the book over 40 years ago in high school.But I really appreciated this edition. As a forward, there is an overview of the book, pointing out things to help you understand them when you read them. It also clarifies some of the points made. It doesn't say anything about Pip suffering from depression, but I think he does, which contributes to his low self-esteem.Then at the back of the book, there is a section of notes, including the original ending. There are also notes on some of the words used or articles mentioned in the book.All in all, this was a wonderful read and look forward to reading it again."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations is hailed as a one of the great masterpieces in literature and for good reason. However, it does drag in the beginning and current audiences may not be able to fight through to reap the rewards this book gives out.

Throughout the whole book Dickens kept my attention and had me wanting more. From the very first page when Pip encounters the convict, I could not put the book down. I had to find out what was going to happen. Also when Pip's sister, Mrs. Joe, was attacked I was guessing to the very end to find out whom it was who attacked her. This is by far one of the best books I have read. All in all, I recommend you read this book. I'm sure that you will enjoy it as much as I have."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This novel is excellent. Although it starts out slowly, it begins to pick up in the middle. After giving many details about the main character Pip's family, Dickens gets into a little action. For example, the meeting with the convict in the churchyard is where the action starts to pick up. Seeing Pip grow up, I watched him go through a transformation. Once an unitellegent child, he grew up to be an intelligent young man. The book deals with child abuse, social status, and family and friendships. I saw how a sister took in her little brother to raise him and keep him from dying like the rest of their family. Love is another thing that continually comes up. When he was young, Pip fell in love with Estella and I saw how she tortured and teased him.

I felt bad for Pip because he was living as an orphan with an abusive sister. That must have been very exhausting mentally and physically. I admire Pip because he is very young and the fact that he has to travel,work, and take care of his sick sister, he is a very good rolemodel. I also admire him because if a ex-convict came up to me, I would be so scared that I would run away. The fact that he trusted Magwitch with a lot of things really amazed me. Pip has gone through a lot of things with his family and his own personal life in a considerable amount of time and I admire him for that. Hopefully him and Estella get together because Pip is a very nice guy and I think that they would have a lot of fun together."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"if there is ever a person i feel sorry for: it's Pip. we have all looked up to the pretty girl (or boy) at school, and had that utter pain of knowing that it is impossible. pip is the patron saint of the rejected male.i have two problems with this book: one is the deus ex machina-esqe conclusion in the final 50 pages, where everything falls into place. when i say everything falls into place, i don't mean neatly. the ending is anti-climatic and pensivly moody. but things seem to work out in a weird way that i have some problems withsecondly- the whole plot of the book is one whole huge coincidence.with that said... i didn't mind the two faults whatsoever. there are few books that i have enjoyed so thuroughly as GE.anyone that has read Dickens in the past already knows about his prowess as a writter. and for people who have yet to read him (or highschool students who have just recieved their copy of GE, with a frown) will realize why he has remained contemporary, and still enjoyed.when i was in highschool, and i had to read a tale of two cities... my teacher exhausted the book, going over every minute symbol that was in it... in the end, it bored me. so, with that said, i love two cities regardless cause i read it independantly, and enjoyed it on my own pace. i recomend to all highschool studends to read the book at their own pace and bugger what your teacher tells you (yeah, i'm a good rolemodel). school tends to destroy great works of literature, don't fall into the trap.... whooops i thought this was a book review...great book, beautiful characters, a classic and well worth 5 stars... nuff said(i shed a tear or two at the end)"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"When his magazine, All the Year Round, began failing due to an unpopular serial, Dickens was forced to begin publishing installments of a story of his own. The resulting work, Great Expectations, was published weekly from December 1, 1860 to August 3, 1861. This was his second semi-autobiographical work, but where David Copperfield was a confident expression of faith in middle class values, Great Expectations offers a bleaker view of whether those values will lead to happiness. In fact, Dickens own marriage had just come to an end after many unhappy years. Indeed he had recently changed the name of the magazine from the more bucolic Household Words. Despite, or because, of this ambivalence, Great Expectations became one of his greatest achievements.Pip, a boy of the marshes, is being &quot;raised by hand&quot; by his shrieking harridan of an older sister and her seemingly doltish husband, the blacksmith Joe Gargery. One day, while visiting his parents' gravesite, Pip is accosted by an escaped convict who demands that he bring him a file and some &quot;wittles&quot;. When the convict, Abel Magwitch, is later captured, he accepts the blame for stealing the file and food before being carted back to prison.Shortly thereafter, Pip is invited up to Miss Havisham's manor house to play with her beautiful ward Estella. Miss Havisham's life came to a halt when she was jilted at the altar, all clocks are stopped at the hour of her betrayal, the feast lies rotting on tables &amp; she wanders about in the decaying wedding gown. Estella is to be the instrument of her revenge upon men.Eventually, &quot;Great Expectations&quot; are settled upon Pip when a secret benefactor sets up a trust in his name and sends him to London to be educated and become a gentleman. Pip assumes, and Havisham allows him to believe, that she is his benefactress and that he is being elevated to a position that will make him worthy of Estella.As Pip rises in society, he leaves Joe behind, despite the many kindnesses Joe had shown him growing up. He becomes a shallow arrogant middle class climber. So he is stunned when he discovers that he is actually benefiting from the secret wealth of Magwitch, who made a fortune in Australia after being transported. Moreover, Magwitch's unlawful return to England puts him and Pip in danger. Meanwhile, Estella has married another, a horrible man who Pip despises. Eventually, with Magwitch's recapture and death in prison and with his fortune gone, Pip ends up in debtors prison, but Joe redeems his debts and brings him home. Pip realizes that Magwitch was a more devoted friend to him than he ever was to Joe and with this realization Pip becomes, finally, a whole and decent human being.Originally, Dickens wrote a conclusion that made it clear that Pip and Estella will never be together, that Estella is finally too devoid of heart to love. But at the urging of others, he changed the ending and left it more open ended, with the possibility that Estella too has learned and grown from her experiences and her wretched marriages.This is the work of a mature novelist at the height of his powers. It has everything you could ask for in a novel: central characters who actually change and grow over the course of the story, becoming better people in the end; a plot laden with mystery and irony; amusing secondary characters; you name it, it's in here. I would rank it with A Tale of Two Cities, Oliver Twist and David Copperfield among the very best novels of the worlds greatest novelist.GRADE: A+"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Now I'll admit that when all is said and done I am a newborn to the world of so called classic literature. So when I was assigned to read Great Expectations for English class, I'll admit to being a little more than skeptical. However once I began to read the novel I discovered something. The novel wasn't that hard to understand. While it did take a while to get fully immersed in the novel, once you were in you really wanted to see the novel to its resolution. The prose was easy to understand, and the plot crossed generations easily. Maybe classics just have a bad reputation with the younger generation, but Great Expectations went a long way to helping to shorten that gap. I think the driving force that leads me to recommend this book is the fact that we all have great expectations of life, and that we all dream of improving our status in the world. People will always share a common bond, and in this novel Dicken's truly shows us that."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"A classic! This was the full story, unlike the money I wasted at Wally World on an abridged copy"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I love classic literature and this was a great find. The reader of this great work does a stellar job creating the character's voices which adds so much to the story.I have enjoyed this very much and will share it with my family."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Pip is an orphan. His nagging sister and weakling of a brother-in-law are raising him. He doesn't have much, yet is compelled to help an escaped convict with food and drink. (More out of fear than compassion, mind.) He knows no other way of life, so he doesn't expect anything... until he meets Miss Havisham. Miss Havisham is an old recluse who still mourns after the man who broken her heart on her wedding day. One day, she invites Pip over to \\"play,\\" and that is where he meets young and beautiful Estella. The pretty girl intrigues and irritates him in equal parts. Proud and cruel, she makes him feel like a nobody. And that is how his desires to become a gentleman emerge. So imagine his surprise when a secret benefactor grants his biggest wish, a stranger with \\"Great Expectations.\\" Pip soon moves to London, abandons his old acquaintances for new ones, and reunites with mean girl Estella, now older and more beautiful. Will he be good enough for her now?Great Expectations is my favorite Dickens novel. Granted, I have only read this one and Bleak House (I've also read A Christmas Carol and another novella of his), but it is my favorite one of the two. This novel contains beautiful storytelling, lots of irony and Dickens's signature eccentric characters and hilarious dialogue. This is my second time reading this after over a decade, and I enjoyed it more the second time around. (I enjoyed this as much as the other novel I read at the same time as this one, which, to my surprise, brought up Dickens and Great Expectations.) Pip is a wonderful character. He does, however, get on my nerves when he wants to be around people that to me aren't worth it. Estella is such a snob, a total beyotch, but I can see why Pip would want her to think well of him. One thing I've always found interesting is that Dickens always depicts lawyers as greedy and callous. Bleak House illustrates this even more. Perhaps Dickens disliked lawyers. Could his father's stay at a debtors' prison have to do with this? Well, one thing is clear: Great Expectations is a beautiful novel, one of the best out there, even with its altered ending. I've read both endings and like them both (though I prefer his original ending). Two endings are great because they give you a choice. Anyway, a great summer reread. I have A Tale of Two Cities and look forward to reading it soon."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I love listening to audiobooks while I work out and have a special fondness for the classics, so I was very excited by the excellent reviews this audio version received. I had read that each disk contained 90+ brief tracks, which is fine with me as I have never had a problem importing audiobooks into iTunes. Well, there is always a first time. I don't know what iTunes uses to find CD info or track names, but not a single disk came up identified as Great Expectations, nor did the tracks have any type of logical naming system. I had to type in a name for 93-94 tracks on every single disk (eg. disk01track01, etc).The audiobook itself is quite good of course, thankfully. I just need to warn those who plan to import for their iPod that it will not be a simple process. Better have a couple of hours to type. Had I known this would be a problem, I would not have purchased this version."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"As usual with Dickens, improbable coincidences abound. They are artfully presented however and Dickens does offer one or two surprises.For one thing, the novel is quite violent. Dickens graphically describes one character dying from burns. He presents a ruffian or two. Even one of the better gentlemen manhandles his maid.Also as usual with Dickens, we find a full cast of memorable well-defined characters. Mr Jaggers, the lawyer to beat all lawyers, and his assistant Mr. Wemmick who never mixes business and home matters, except under exceptional circumstances. We find Miss Havesham a wealthy but bitter spinster left at the altar years before. We meet Joe Gargery, a wise well-meaning blacksmith who lovingly raises Pip, the novel's main character, taking him on as his apprentice. Pip leaves him when fortune mysteriously smiles on him. An unknown benefactor gives our hero a substantial income so that he may fulfill his Great Expectations and become a gentleman of means and of leasure.And there you have Pip in a nutshell: he leaves a loving home, a kind man and a good position to become a man of the world, a man about town, in short a bit of a parasite.But then to become a man of means is for Dickens to have attained heaven on earth and he only lets the truly good enjoy their fortune. Jaggers is rich and cannot be called good, at worst he is amoral, but he is a man of action. On the other hand the thoughtless and ungrateful Pip doesn't deserve heaven. Not just yet.Vincent Poirier, Tokyo"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"My only real complain about this bookis that Orlick seems to be an annoying intrusion. Both of the \\"Great Expectations\\" movies I saw deleted the role of Orlick, and I can't say I missed him. Along with \\"Oliver Twist,\\" \\"Great Expectations\\" was one of my father's favorites.Onto the text. Pip (who is still a child and a literary reincarnation of Oliver Twist)) has a frightening experience in a graveyard when the escaped convict Magwitch (kind of a literary reincarnation of Fagin) threatens him and demands a file and some food. When Pip goes to get these things, we meet his sister who is not so nice to him. Though her husband Joe is. (Undoubtedly, this tense marriage reflects Dickens's divorce.) Moving on, Pip delivers the file and food to Magwitch who is of course grateful. sadly, Magwitch is captured, but he remains grateful to Pip.Later, Pip meets the tragic Miss Havisham. Havisham was left at the altar, and she never quite forgave the male sex for this. Interestingly, she has no concept of time. She has friends who visit her on her birthday, they do not mention it. Havisham trains her adopted daughter Estella to hate all men. Pip continues to visit Havisham and Estella for sometime. Soon, some good news comes from lawyer Mr. Jaggers. Pip learns that he is to be trained as a gentleman. Pip knows that Jaggers is Havisham's lawyer, so he assumes this gift is from her. (Why not?)Pip is accompanied by Herbert Pocket who is the son of Miss Havisham's cousin. Herbert tells Pip of Havisham's tragic past. We are permitted some sympathy for her. Pip (who is falling love with Estella) knows that Estella resembles someone, but he can't quite place who.There is a sad, but true to life scene when Joe comes to visit Pip, and because this kind man is not so educated, he turns out to be an embarrassment to Pip. In a scene of self sacrifice, Joe decides to let Pip go his own way.Later there is a disturbing scene between Havisham and Estella. While we may feel sorry for Havisham, she tried to plant her hatred in Estella, and naturally, Estella could only take living for hate so long. The real drama is still to come. Pip finds out that his benefactor was indeed Magwitch. (The man from the graveyard!) While we may share Pip's horror to some extent, we later learn that Magwitch is a sympathetic character. Basically, Compeyson was a kind of Uriah Heep who manipulated Magwitch. To make matters worse, it is punishable by death for Magwitch to be in England.I don't want to give away the ending, but this is easily one of Dickens's greatest books."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"After reading a bunch of these reviews, I've come to the conclusion that this book should not be pushed on high school students or younger. It's almost sad to read a review from someone who just read the cliff notes. Come on now, do we really need to hear from you? This is my favorite Dickens novel so far, and though I haven't read them all, I loved everything about it. Though the ending is happy, it is by no means a Hollywood ending. Would recommend to any SERIOUS reader that wants to read authentic period prose and a great story."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I thing Great Expectation is a great book in many way such as the Themes, the Character and the Writing Themes in this book are very important. They can easily relate to us today. The main point of the book that affection, loyalty and friendship are more important than social class, wealth. The character of Pip made me feel quite sad. He had a very difficult life but he can improve himself and become the gentleman finally. There are many character of this book that also made this book very interesting follow up."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"and I very nearly did.For the first half to three quarters I was utterly and completely amazed. The character of Miss Havisham is genius, and a character like none I have ever met before in literature. The images of her sitting corpse like in her decaying house will stick with me for all time. Everyone should read this book for this fascinating character.While the first part of the book delighted me with wicked satire, and dark humor, the last quarter of the book was too morally right for me. Every character saw the error of his ways, and strove to be a better person, and here the book lost much of the original feel it had going for it. I suppose maybe in Dickens' time, he couldn't get away with a book that did not have a morally uplifting ending.However, I say this is a must-read for the characters of Miss Havisham and the beautiful Estella alone. Also the lawyer Jaggers is a great character."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations is filled with ambition, greed, cruelty, and love.

However, it still hasa very interesting storyline that is very very detailed :D"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations is one of Dickens's later novels, a work of his artistic maturity. The narrative is symbolic rather than realistic. Although, as in most of Dickens and in Victorian literature in general, the plot relies heavily on coincidence, it is acceptable here because the events are true to the internal, psychological, logic of the story.Great Expectations tells the story of Pip, a boy who starts as an orphan who moves on to apprenticeship in the business world of nineteenth-century England. Along the way, he falls in love with a girl from a wealthy family, and gains a mysterious patron.The book is heavy on character development and descriptive detail, but relatively light on action and suspense. The orphan Pip, the convict Magwitch, the beautiful Estella and her guardian, the embittered and vengeful Miss Havisham, the master lawyer Mr. Jaggers and Wemmick his secretive assistant - all play their part in this story which is a memoir, a mystery, and a romance.Great Expectations never loses sight of the social mishaps of the time and is often on the teacher's list in literature classics. Most people who read it will like it and will be able to identify with the characters, but impatient readers will drown in the details, extended descriptions and explanations, and deep characterizations."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Dickens is to me the most obvious of writers. Most of his novels are to various extents semi autobiographical. Most are populated by people with amusing names who, aside from the main characters, seem to be caricatures more than humans who think and feel with any semblance of subtlety or complexity. Most are deeply concerned with social injustice and class struggle. Most are filled with plot twists, and almost all are very enjoyable reads. Dickens is nothing if not a master storyteller who loves to manipulate the emotions of his reading public. His stories are theatrical more than novelistic. It is no wonder he is the most popular author of the Victorian age, and maybe second only to Shakespeare in the history of English literature.GREAT EXPECTATIONS and DAVID COPPERFIELD are my 2 favorite Dickens novels, probably because they both have more overtly autobiographical elements than his other works. I also love BLEAK HOUSE. GREAT EXPECTATIONS is the story of Pip.. of his rise and fall, and ultimate redemption. This novel gives us a clear window into the heart and mind of Dickens himself. The story itself held my interest from beginning to end, had important themes to explore, and despite it's lack of introspection in examining personality issues, made you care about the main characters. Dickens was one of the great writers but he is not my favorite novelist of that period. I prefer George Eliot's style as a novelist. To me, Dickens power was in connecting emotionally with his audience and it must have been some experience hearing him tell his marvelous tales in person."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is an excellent coming-of-age book with which many people will be able to relate. I will admit, the beginning was rather grueling, but looking back, I am glad I finished the book. Dickens has a fabulous vocabulary and an excellent sense of people. The characters are dynamic and quite various. I would recommend this book to other scholars."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book is a masterpiece of fiction. Until you read the book you don't realize just how influential this story is in western literature."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations didn't meet my expectations. I was a little bored throughout the begining and middle of the story. I think what kept me reading on was the desire to read a \\"classic\\" (I usually read biography or history).I continued reading because I wanted to find out if Magwitch would meet his daughter. In addition, I was interested in Pip's strong desire to be a gentleman. Other than help his friend in business and dawdle about thinking about an emotionally deadweight chic, Pip didn't seem interested in obtaining a job or taking real advantage of his opportunities. I'll give Pip credit for helping his friend attain stature in business, and eventually going on to operate with his friend after losing his unearned wealth. But the lazy part is 19th century gentleman, huh?Maybe Dicken's purpose was to show the benefits of wealth and the slothfullness of one who didn't have to work himself to attain it. Maybe it hit me at the wrong time, as my fiancee just took a hike and left me after I just sold my house (and now have no place to go). Trust you me, I won't be wasting my life away like Ms. Havisham though. I haven't reached gentlemanly status and need to continue working . . . .I've only read Charles Dicken's Nicholas Nickleby and Oliver Twist in addition to \\"Great Expectations\\". Of these, I thoroughly enjoyed Nicholas Nickleby. In the future, I'll look for Kates and Madellines and not Estellas. Great Expectations was a tougher read for me as these characters just simply didn't entice my interest too much. Of course, maybe I needed a brighter read . . ."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I first read this novel for a class. Years later, I picked it up again and reread it. It's excellent. The characters are very interesting. Pip who loves the cold-hearted Estella. It is good to see how their characters interact and how desire is lasting. You got to feel bad for poor Pip. Miss Havisham is the most interesting of all, still in her wedding gown after all these decades. A must read. It's a fairly long novel, but well worth the time it takes to read it."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I thought the book Great Expectations was a pretty good book. At parts of the book it was good but then there were those parts where I didn't like it in all books there are usually those parts. I though it was easy to understand.For the major themes I didn't always understand it all. Some parts I never really caught on to were at the beginning when he was a little kid then he had grown up I never caught on to that right away. But when I finally did it was good and interesting to find out.I do think Charles Dickens did bring the story alive. I think also he should have had so many characters because then it was hard to understand who was who and where did they come from. At some points I wish he would have had explained himself more then what he did. I got mixed up so much with all the characters it was hard to keep track of them because they were in the story and then they were gone then all of a sudden they came back. But out of it all it was a good book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Astonishingly this book joins passion and soul with dreams, i bought this book since i saw the movie and i just tought i needed to go deep inside, as a personal review, i've always enterteined the vogus idea to get an analogous life experience so this story might be great for those who dream with going ahead, this story is also helpful to find out for certain that you can see your dreams comming true from where you're least expecting."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Although I rated this book four stars, I wish there was a three and one-half star rating- that's what I'd really like to give it. Dickens is one of my favorite novelists, and normally I am passionately enthusiastic about his books, but I could only manage to get slightly warmer than lukewarm about this middling novel. Overall, it wasn't bad- it is, in fact, one I wouldn't mind rereading in future. However, I didn't think it was quite as good as many of Dickens' other works. The plot, while not bad or boring, was not as suspenseful and intriguing as that of &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, as slowly but enjoyably developing as that of &quot;David Copperfield&quot;, or as wonderfully tantalizing and gripping as that of &quot;Bleak House.&quot; The characters, while not hopelessly mediocre or bland, were not nearly as likeable and were much more forgettable than those of other Dickens novels. Although Pip was not a bad protagonist, I did not enjoy or like him as much as I did, say, Oliver Twist or Esther Summerson. Likewise, his character development, while interesting, was not, to my mind, as good or as interesting as that which is undergone by David Copperfield, a hero who I liked better than, and with whom I could sympathize more than with Pip. Estella and Miss Havisham, while interesting, did not add much to the plot, and when it comes to criminals those of &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, are, in my opinion, more memorable, and in many ways, more sympathetic than Magwitch. While not a thoroughly forgettable or bad book, I wouldn't reccommend it to first time Dickens readers- it may discourage them from reading more. Wait until you've read one or two of his better novels, such as &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; or &quot;Bleak House.&quot; Then come to this one- only don't come with expectations that are TOO terribly great."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Love it....Love it!

I'll speak to the edition itself, because formatting of Kindle books (especially free ones) can be very hit and miss. The illustrated Kindle edition by Top Five Books is easy to navigate, formatted well, free of errors, and contains a variety of illustrations. It is free, and there is nothing about this version that recommends choosing an alternative."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations is widely regarded as one of Charles Dickens' finest works and I have to agree; it is one of my favorites, second to A Tale of Two Cities. The story of a young boy's growth to manhood, and his rise to unexpected prosperity and subsequent fall, is strongly written and captivating. Great Expectations captures the attention from the first page and, unlike some of Dickens' other works, it never has a dull moment. Like all of Dickens' works, it is peopled with a large cast of unique and quirky characters whose relationships to each other, as the story unfolds, end up being as intertwined as a plate of spaghetti. Some of the scenes and characters in Great Expectations are downright bizarre; the scenes involving Miss Havisham and the Pocket family felt distinctly Alice in Wonderland-ish in their weirdness.What makes Great Expectations so strong is the main character, Pip. He is that rarity among Dickens' characters, one that has depth and more than one dimension and mood. He tells his own story and, as an adult reflecting back on his own childhood and adolescence, he reveals his own youthful selfishness with a poignancy that surely every listener can connect with. Haven't we all been Pip, selfish and unappreciative of the goodness of others and unworthy of their admiration?I did not listen to this particular audio edition, although I know that Brilliance Audio produces top-notch audio books and Michael Page is an excellent narrator. I highly recommend the edition I listened to, produced by BBC Audio. It is a no-frills production, but the narrator (Martin Jarvis) is outstanding. He truly has a gift for voices (I especially loved his rendition of The Aged), and adds color and personality to the story."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I enjoyed reading this book in high school and also enjoy watching one of the old B&W; movie versions if it happens to come on TV.

Lovely to have easy access through Kindle, and much lighter weight than carrying around the original hard copy variety."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"In my opinion, Charles Dickens remains the writer who defined the art of characterization in the 19th century. This novel contains a bevy of characters that the readers will find unforgettable. The haunting figure of Miss Havisham has stayed with me since my 10th grade literature class (almost 30 years ago) and my recent rereading of the novel brought her horrid existence into full view again. The plot has twists and turns and although I found myself having to stop reading and letting certain episodes sink into my understanding, the beauty and scope of the writing is truly remarkable. As a young student of Dickens, I resisted the long descriptions and difficult dialogue and I don't remember loving the book when I read it the first time. As an adult, however, my admiration for the novel is undeniable."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I read Charles Dickens's book Great Expectations. This book is about a young boy named Pip. Pip lives with his older sister Mrs. Gargery who is married to a black smith named Joe. Early in the book Pip meets an escaped convict that was on the run. He may not know it yet but the convict will have a lasting affect on him. When Joe finds out about the convict he asks Pip to help the police catch him. After a quick battle the convict and his partner are caught. Later in the book Pip meets Miss Haversham whose cold ward Estella Pip adores. An unknown person pays for Pip to go to London and become a gentleman.Charles Dickens is a wonderful writer. The Great Expectations is a great example of Dickens writing power. Moby Dick and other books are just as well done. I enjoyed reading the Great Expectations it was a long and detailed story of adventure and affection. I hope you enjoyed reading it too."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I can only agree, a great book that is very nicely done and is easy to read. I like it, it is simply a classic everyone should have read!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This seems to be a very nice copy of the book, it is easy to read in its big font and looks nice aswell. :)"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Yes, Dickens was paid by the word when writing this.Yes, this is a big bookYes, if you were forced to read it in school, you probably hatedYes, if you read it on your own at or after age 25... you probably loved it.I for one, thought this book was great, sure it was wordy, but it was not wordy in that \\"what the heck is he trying to say\\" way that gets many other wordy books (Crime and Punishment - though I blame the translators for that one).Short Summary: This is the story of Pip, starting from a young age after his parents and many younger siblings are deceased and he is being raised by his militant sister and her lovable but slightly dense husband, Joe. Pip has very little hope of a future other than an apprenticeship with Joe as a Blacksmith. Suddenly... doors start opening for Pip, and opportunities present themselves to him. He accepts but never knows who or why strings are being pulled in the background to open these doors for him. We follow Pip through his life as he accepts these opportunities, and they lead him down a strange but wonderful path of self discovery, maturity, and opening his eyes to the real world.The reason this book is so effective is because Pip is so real. We follow him through his blunders and successes, we dread his putting his foot in his mouth, saying the wrong things to Biddy, or Ms. Haversham, and we rejoice when he commits selfless acts and hate him when he commits selfish ones. It is my personal opinion that this book will have more of an affect on the late twenty year olds and up because by then you have suffered a bit, and made some of the same mistakes as Pip, you have wandered through finding your way in the world, and the confusion of who you are, wishing you were something else, loving what or who you cannot have, and figuring out what path to put your life on.The rest of the cast of characters is quite a collection of multifaceted, entertaining, and interesting people. Ms. Haversham is a favorite of many, so strange, so tortured, so heartless, and so intriguing... then we have Dear old Joe, so Simple, and mild, and encouraging. Joe's love is unconditional and unwavering. Biddy, is so loyal, so kind, and so honest, then you have her polar opposite, Estella. There are so many other characters that are interesting, fun to read about and that you will have strong feelings for one way or another.I highly recommend this book, even though it is over a century old, the language is not difficult to read (very little work required) and the plot and characters are stellar. True there are no explosions, but a book can be engaging with out them. Give it a try."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I agonized through this book in HS and have recently breezed through it. About 30 years have passed in between.What I was most struck by in my second reading was how relevant the story was to our own times. Child abuse and emotionally damaging relationships, celebrity lawyers, prison reform, the dangers of easy credit, how easily a person can dispose of their past identity. Dickens wrote about this 140+ years ago but he could have been writing about the present day. Yes, a reader has to warm up to the 19th century language, but once that happens, the characters and their emotions are so authentic and fully developed. I found myself so annoyed at Pip in the middle of the novel, I almost put it down. How could I possibly care about such an obnoxious young man. But I did care and cared more and more deeply as the book wound down. Pip's transformation was convincing because the reader sees how it occurs in small increments. In the end I took a deep breath and thought to myself, well, Pip, you finally grew up. It may not be the best book to force teenagers to read, but I hope mature readers will take it up and find the treasures inside."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is an incredible masterpiece of storytelling. Charles Dickens is witty and intelligent. He creates characters that you are able to warm to and he is able to sculpt a brilliant plot. Without putting in any spoilers i will let you know that the main character PiP, definitely got what he expected ! and he learnt something in the process - that character is far more valuable than status - even the status of being a gentleman !!\\""},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I was brought kicking and screaming to this story thanks to high school English Lit requirements but it ended up being my favorite of the term.

This is a classic to add to your home library."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I can't give this book enough praise. I read David Copperfield after, which was supposedly Dickens' most belove character, but I enjoyed GE much more.

This is the kind of story that you hear over and over growing up in poverty. It is almost in the category of Robin Hood, but this is the real thing in the flesh and blood. The old man in the cemetery scene still plays over and over in my mind. I should have read everything written by Charles Dickens by now, but yet I haven't. I started A Tale of Two Cities a little while ago and I have it on my night stand. I think that I'll get back to it tonight. I don't know who beats Dickens in superb phrasing and style. He is the Master.Richard Edward Noble - The Hobo Philosopher - Author of:\\"Honor Thy Father and Thy Mother\\""},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book was not as interesting as some other books that I have read.

Charles Dickens' eloquent language enthrawls you and keeps you reading on. I have seen how some people find this hard to get through; I was 12 when I read it and I understood it perfectly and loved it. Others think it is too long - this just gives you more to enjoy. I also had to read it because I was told to (for school) and I just read with enjoyment without focusing on every little detail like others have (which in my view is the reason for their disliking.) This book is a classic which must be read. Words cannot describe the quality of the book. Take my advice - purchase a copy and READ IT!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book at the beginning seemed to me a little boring but as i read on it got really interesting.

It really makes you think about yourself, society, and the world. I HIGHLY recommend this book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"There really aren't words for this book.

The characters are unforgettable and the story which starts out slow in the beginning grows very quickly. The book is about life, living and the disappointments that come with it.

Its very sad and disappointing to the reader but you cant help saying to yourself that the ending fits."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"O.K. lets face it. im in fourth grAde. this is a very good book,but its hard.im akmost half way tttthrough it. its been a challenge."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"After several futile attempts, I was literally forced to read this novel for school. I found that the reason I had such difficulties beginning it, was due to its monotonous and dull beginning. Once past that section, Great Expectations dramatically lifts. I found the whole idea of a women stopping her clocks and living in darkness due to unrequited love a little morbid, yet also slightly romantic, and I found myself disliking the main character with a vengence. Not his best, certainly, but still okay."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"A word I hear spoken often today is: boring. I hear that word coming out of the mouth of many teenagers. We live in a society that is so bombarded with continual stimulation, that we expect to be entertained at every turn and get bored too easily if &quot;forced&quot; to read a classic book like Great Expectations. Many high school students would rather be doing something else than reading so it doesn't surprise me when I see all the reviews by teenagers who said they hated the book. I recommend that they read it again in 20 years after seeing the world."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Although Great Expectations is better-written than most contemporary novels (Miss Havisham alone makes the book worth reading and demonstrates Dickens' wonderful skill with characters), I fear that GE is most people's only contact with Dickens because it's short enough to assign for school. (So is A Tale of Two Cities, a great story, but not much like other Dickens works.) If you can stick with them, I recommend even more highly Dickens' Bleak House, Our Mutual Friend, David Copperfield, and Little Dorrit--they're long but they are great, well-written stories with fully developed characters and (sometimes mysteriously long) plot and description that turns out to be crucial (you get a hint of that in GE). Don't give up on Dickens; his works are classics for good reason."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I was quite disappointed reading this book after having read David Copperfield. Although both books bear some resemblances, the plot in Great Expectations is much more condensed and simpler. The story is again the orphan-boy-who-gets-away-from-home-in-search-of-a-happier-life. The plot, however, is much less intricated than it is in David Copperfied. There are fewer characters (and fewer pages!) in this book. That caused me an impression that the story is not as feasible as it is in David Copperfield. Some things seem to be rather unreal or fantastical. There are some qualities, however, that remain the same as they are in David Copperfield. The narrative, the characters descriptions and their surprising behaviour keep the reader up to the last page. So this is my advice: if you are one of those who tried to read David Copperfield but gave up because thought it was too boring or long, Great Expectations is an excellent book for you. And maybe, after you have finished it, you'll be willing to read a much better one: David Copperfield."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"i have read the book twice once last year for my teachers book report and this year for the 9th grade merit english classes.

I admit it. The book starts out slow. Dickens, though I love the man, writes in such flowery and long winded language at times. What takes many authors a line or two, Dickens will devote whole pages.And I almost put the book down for that exact reason. I'm very happy I did not.With so many detailed threads in the story, the depth to the characters--when they all start to blend together a few chapters in, the result is page-turning.The story centers around a young boy--well, almost young man-- named Pip, and revolves around his growing into age. You cannot help but love the boy. Much of Pip's worry and concern I could relate to--falling in love with a girl who refuses to return your sentiments and only plays with your heart, growing up and leaving home for the first time, and discovering your true relationships with others and yourself, as shocking as they may turn out to be.I felt as if I was side by side with Pip through it all, and that made the novel a wonderful experience for me. I recommend the novel for the young because so much relates to them, and also for the older readers--because you can experience it all again.A wonderful and heart warming tale. Just get through those first chapters."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"From the many rave reviews of this book, I was expecting to read a literary masterpiece.Howver,my expectations were negated, just like Pip's.

Michael Page reads Dickens' great novel beautifully, giving each character exactly the right voice without ever sounding phony, hammy, or exaggerating or over-emphasizing anything.Page makes every sentence perfectly clear and delivers each line of dialog just right. His virtuosity in scenes with several characters talking at once is truly wonderful. I've never heard of Page before -- is he an actor? -- but he certainly deserves an award for his brilliant performance reading this novel, one of the crown jewels of English literature."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"My biggest complaint concerning many audio books is that they're poorly narrated--often in monotone, or with one character's dialog sounding much like the others. Not here though--this version is expertly narrated.

I first read the story in high-school and immediatly fell in love with Dicken's eloquent style. His descriptions of Pip's surroundings, emotions and experiences never fail to capture my imagination and tug at my heart. Dickens can be very tough to read, but also very rewarding because you know that you are enjoying a piece of literary genius. Great Expectations provides a nice into into his style and prepares readers for his more challenging stories.The story is long, and detailed but extremely captivating.

I won't say it's the best just because once a work of art attains greatness I find it quite incomparable to other great works. Great works are ones which have fully succeeded in expressing the emotions and convictions of the artist, and without a doubt Great Expectations acheives this. Unfortunately I only hold this view of the book containing the original ending, which was not the originally published ending. (spoiler) The original ending at first seems sad and frustrating, but one can't help but to feel satisfied in knowing that through suffering Estella had gained a heart, which is much more than she would have gained through a cold and heartless relationship with Pip. The happy ending which was published is almost a fairtale ending and it perverts the themes which make the novel so relevant to reality. I must admit, like Dickens' friends and publisher, the original ending was hard for me to swallow, but as I dwelt on it and how it related to the novel, no other ending seemed appropriate, especially not a happy one."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Well, i have read all of the previous reviews, and it is apparant that people either love this book or hate this book.

Yes, it is rather boring at times, and yes, it has a long, involved, and confusing plot, and yes, Charles Dickens gives very tedious descriptions of everything. But the morals and meanings portrayed in this book far outshine the faults. If you cannot find them, then it will most likely be boring and dull.

After having read some eight or nine other Dickens novels, revisiting Great Expectations was a somewhat different experience this time around.Like David Copperfield, this is a first person narrative. Being inside the mind of the central intelligence and narrator, the reader can only know what he knows. Therefore, there are fewer narrative threads and multitudes of characters to weave into a complex tapestry than there are in other great multi-layered novels such as Bleak House and Little Dorrit. The jovial wit and exuberance of Pickwick becomes saturated with a world weariness and verges on cynicism in most of the novels of the second half of Dickens' career. As one of his last completed novels, Great Expectations fits within this pattern.Pip is not quite the bland, colorless character that Oliver Twist or David Copperfield are. True, the structure of the plot almost demands that he be a passive recipient of much of the action. His fate is mapped out for him by the anonymous benefactor from his youth and it is not until well into the second half of the novel that he actively seeks to steer the course of his life with each subsequent piece of knowledge he acquires. Pip is not quite an innocent. From an early age, he is consumed by guilt over unknown sins he feels he has committed. He does fall prey to vanity and he descends easily into spendthrift habits and enjoys his unearned prosperity with shameless hedonism. His greatest sins seem to be pride and vanity, leading to the snobbery that fuels the snubbing of his faithful and saintly brother-in-law Joe. To his credit, he is self-analytical and examines these shortcomings as soon as he realizes he possesses them.The sentimentality that often mars even the greatest of Dickens' novels is muted in this one. Pip is fully aware that he is no angel and there are few \`catch phrases' as often appear in his other novels to signal the reader to be moved. On the other hand, the coincidences are piled a little too high for my taste and the evil Orlick subplot seems to be one adversity too many for this plot which can sustain its own weight on the saga of Pip, Estella, Miss Havisham and Magwich.As much as any novel, in Great Expectations Dickens captures the torture of a male's infatuation with an \`unattainable' female beauty, especially one so willing to inflict heartache. This novel still reaches across the centuries with an emotional power that is timeless and universal. Regarding the so called happy ending that Dickens revised as a concession to public sentiment, the ending for this novel is not quite so clear cut as one might expect in a Dickens novel. The last sentence, in particular, includes a double negative that in no obvious way equals an unequivocal positive. By doing this, Dickens is able to sustain the tone of the novel leading up to it and not betray the thematic thread he has followed for almost 500 pages. Despite its shortcomings, Great Expectations possesses a power never surpassed in his novels."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Anyone who loves the english langauge language will enjoy this book.

Used a dictionary and encyclopedia to figure certain things out.I purchased the BN classic and it provides a bit more history that one would have known, unless you've done a research paper on it.

First, I admit, I have difficult transitioning to Dicken's novels. They are written in English, but not in the version of the langauge I speak. However, after reading for a while, I am able to adjust to his style.This novel is great for many reasons. First, it helps me to understand the poverty and hardships faced by the poor in England during his time. Whenever I read one of Dicken's novels, I am always left with an attitude of gratitude. Additionally, in this novel, nothing works out the way I expect or want it to. I wish that Pip would not have acted as he did once he came into his great expectations. I wish that things could have worked out differently with Miss Havisham and Estella. But, the ending is well done. The twists are what I enjoy most from Dicken's novels. I highly recommend this novel."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"As background information, I am in the process of reading most of Dickens 22 novels. I bought the Penguin Popular Classics version of the novel. It is very basic and comes in a simple green cover. It contains no introduction or analysis, just the text plus a very brief historical sketch of Dickens. It seems to be an excellent value for the money and I bought three Dickens novels in the series. I was a bit disappointed in that one book seemed to fall apart as I read it: the binding seemed very weak and cheaply made. It was marginally okay for the present book which is just 400 pages, and the book did not fall apart, but did seem damaged after one read. Another Dickens novel, which was 700 pages long, fell apart with at least 50 pages coming loose. After this bad experience, I bought other versions of Dickens's works - Wordsworth Classic versions and the regular Penguin Classic versions, the ones with the photo on the covers.Charles Dickens, who lived from 1812 to 1870, is the best know male English writer of the 19th century. He authored 22 novels plus numerous short pieces. Most of his writing was first written in serialized form, later published as single novels.A young Dickens at the age of 12 had the unenviable job of attaching labels 10 hours a day at the Warren's boot blacking factory. That experience shaped much of his writing career. Still in his teens he became a law clerk, then later in his twenties a journalist. The last job as a reporter led to the serialized writing of his novels. His works were social commentaries with larger than life characters, or colorful caricatures, living in the slums of London. He was a critic of poverty, social injustice, and the slow moving court system. Those themes permeate most of his novels and it is present her in Great Expectations. This is a novel set in London and the countryside close to London. It is a story of a young boy who wants to grow up and become wealthy and to be a gentleman. Those are his \\"great expectations.\\"Without giving away critical plot elements, it is the story of a young boy called Pip, whose parents are dead, and who lives with his sister and her husband Jo who is a blacksmith. They want Pip to learn the trade and be a blacksmith as well. They live in a small town near marshlands near London. His ambitions are grander and he wants to escape to London and become a gentleman. Will Pip find happiness? Will he succeed? Action shifts back and forth between the small town where Pip first lived and the city of London. It involves Pip, lawyers, accountants, Pip's new friends, his love interest, etc.The novel is not used by Dickens for any pressing social issues, although one might argue that it shows how Pip's ambition blinds him to his true friends. But mostly it is pure entertainment. The book is a classic but has a choppy feel that one can attribute to the way it was written. It was written as a series of dramatic stories for popular serialization which were then combined to make a single novel. I enjoyed the read and would highly recommend the book.Having read 10 of Dickens's novels I still rate David Copperfield as best, and ahead of the present book, both as a work of literature and for entertainment value. In many ways the two novels are similar, but the plot is far more interesting and realistic in David Copperfield, and Dickens has many more interesting characters in that book, and as a bonus it is almost twice as long."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I have absolutely no doubts whatsoever that Charles Dickens, if he lived today, would still classify as an author's author. He's a master of all the things that make for great writing and storytelling. Dickens has an ear for dialogue most authors would kill their own mothers to possess. He also is a master of creating vivid scenery, another sign of excellence essential to great writing and one which many authors lack. Finally, but not least in importance, Dickens knows character development. He REALLY knows how to develop intriguing characters, to the point where many of his books spawned figures that have become literary archetypes. Not bad for a guy who grew up in extremely adverse circumstances. He even spent some time in a factory sticking labels on bottles after his father's imprisonment for debt. Most people wouldn't recover from such poverty, but Dickens did. He went on to a successful career in journalism before settling down as an author of serial novels. This format, which allowed Dickens to write and release his stories piecemeal, made him a great success with the public. The anticipation for the latest chapter or two of his stories often led to near riots. Not many writers can elicit such a response today.Many consider \\"Great Expectations\\" a seminal work by a master. Millions have read it, most unwillingly, but most consider it one of Dickens's most accessible stories. It's a tale about a youngster named Phillip Pirrip, known throughout the story as Pip, and his rise from relative obscurity to the heights of wealth and privilege. As the story opens, we see Pip lamenting the passing of his parents in the local cemetery. Their deaths resulted in Pip living with an older sister and her blacksmith husband Joe. Life is tough in Pip's village. His sister wields a heavy hand against her younger brother, relatives like Uncle Pumblechook berate him, and they live in a place where convicts often escape from barges floating on the river nearby. In fact, Pip has a frightening encounter with one of these prisoners at the beginning of the book. His actions, undertaken at the command of this felon, result in a series of incidents that lead Pip to the home of the local recluse, a dour old woman by the name of Havisham. This woman, as rich as a lord but as unhappy as one could ever be, takes a liking to Pip and keeps him around for entertainment.It is during his tenure as Havisham's court jester that Pip comes into contact with several important figures that feature prominently in the story's later episodes. He meets the cold yet beautiful Estella, Havisham's adopted daughter, and falls in love with her. He also makes an initial contact with the old lady's lawyer, the highly successful Mr. Jaggers, and an odd young man named Herbert. All play an integral part in what is to follow, namely the announcement (through Jaggers) that Pip has suddenly come into fortune, or great expectations, that require him to move to London in order to train as a gentlemen. In London Pip spends time with Jaggers, his assistant Wemmick, Herbert, and even Estella. He spends his money, helps his best friend in covert ways, and wonders who in the world set him up with this money and property. Jaggers makes it clear that he isn't supposed to dig too deep concerning the origins of the fortune. Instead, he is to wait until the day when the individual responsible steps forward. When that happens Pip's world as he knows it nearly collapses. He must move heaven and earth to avert disaster while at the same time coming to terms with who he is and what his future holds.\\"Great Expectations\\" is, in a word, great. It contains all of the hallmarks one associates with Dickens. The characters, everyone from Wemmick to Jaggers to Havisham to Joe, sparkle brightly as fully formed individuals living and laboring under very real problems. Atmosphere is divine: Pip's village and London come to life under the writer's pen. Even the author's penchant for examining social ills moves to the fore in a chapter that looks at the horrific conditions in London's main prison. Another real plus is the humor. If you haven't read Dickens, you don't know what your missing in the humor department. This author has an amazing sense of what is funny, and it is nowhere more apparent than in the scene in which Pip and Herbert take in a play starring one of our hero's relatives. This short chapter along with the ones describing Wemmick's abode are absolute masterpieces of hilarity, and they're actually bright spots in what is otherwise an occasionally dark piece of writing. And last, but not least, there is the downbeat conclusion. There are actually two conclusions to \\"Great Expectations\\". Make sure you pick up a copy that has both of them.About the only thing \\"Great Expectations\\" lacks is length; it's one of Dickens's shortest novels, which is probably the reason millions of teachers assign this book to their students. That's unfortunate because most kids want nothing to do with this book once it's forced upon them when in fact they could actually benefit from reading it. Why? Because \\"Great Expectations\\" teaches us a lot about love and identity, two things that matter quite a bit (or should matter) to young people. The teachers ought to assign something like \\"Hard Times\\" and let those who want more seek out \\"Great Expectations\\". The prevailing opinion on this book is that it is semi-autobiographical. It doesn't really matter whether the story is about the author's life or not. What is important, I think, is that this story attains a perfection that few books ever reach. That's why it's a classic, I guess. If you haven't read Dickens before, you should start right here."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations, 1860-'61, Dickens's second to last completed novel is the first tome I have ever read and is one of the best books I've ever read.The story centers upon Pip who is orphaned and lives with his mean sister and her kind husband Joe. The book's classic opening is when Pip meets an escaped convict and he forces Pip to give him food and then later is caught. Little did Pip know that this occasion will live on and he will be reminded of it in a very unexpected fashion later in the bookYoung Pip is then sent to Satis House to meet the very mysterious and eccentric Miss Havisham who, jilted at the altar spends the rest of her cursed recluse life in her rotting, yellow wedding dress in Satis House. Pip also meets Estella, a beautiful, yet very cold and proud girl brought up by Miss Havisham to hate men as revenge for her fiance's betrayal.Great Expectations is the story of Pip's life and of all the surprises (there's a lot of 'em folks) hopes: some lived some smashed, and of course, Dickensesque eccentrics who populate the book.Great Expectations is the first tome I have ever finished and I must say that it was worth it. Since I didn't have the book for a while, it took me about three months to read it but have no fear, for this is a pretty quick read with many twists and turns along the way.This book is often considered Dickens's masterpiece. Well, I don't really know about that but it has to be close to that. It certainly was a great read and I think you will agree."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I've taught this book in 9th grade for years because it is a curriculum requirement. During that time, I have raved about the incredible abilities of Dickens to create memorable characters, plot fascinating fiction, make the lives of ordinary people in England memorable, write incredibly descriptive passages . . . .The time has come to tell the truth. While it may be a great *work of literature*, Great Expectations is a tough book to like.There is much to appreciate - in the intellectual sense of the word - about GE, from carefully drawn characters to an infinitely detailed plot. Without exception, students love to play *connect the characters* as the novel progresses. They discuss the unrequited love between Pip and Estella, Biddy and Pip - they love the relationship between Joe and Pip. They are fascinated and repulsed by Miss Havisham and her house. They are shocked by Magwitch, and enthralled by his sacrifice. Truly, this has all the makings of a 9th grade *hit*! So what's the problem? Language,length, and format.The language is off-putting. So much is colloquial to the time and difficult to bring current. Joe's dialect (along with the convict's) is VERY difficult for my deep south students to imitate when reading aloud, and sometimes even difficult for them to decipher at all. Sentences can go on (and on and on and on and on) so that the end hardly seems connected to the beginning. While common when Dickens was writing, these patterns are a bit difficult for a modern audience.Length and format are a problem that go together. Originally published as a serial, this novel was presented a chapter or two at a time, with a wait between installments. That allowed a reader to digest the events in a chapter, contemplate the relationships, discuss them with friends and build up anticipation for the next installment. By virtue of that style, many side-stories are included that have little bearing on the overall plot. Likewise, there is much detail included that seems almost irrelevant when one is reading the novel in full. Those are the very things that fostered interest in the serial, and yet in a novel, they seem extraneous and confusing. At the end, the novel seems (just a bit) overwritten (and perhaps that is because it wasn't originally a novel).In summary, my feelings about this novel are mixed. The story itself is fascinating, but I find myself eternally dreading that time of year when I will yet again introduce it to another crop of unsuspecting students . . ."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"In this delightful edited version of Dickens immortal tale, Hugh Laurie reads. Now you may or may not know Mr. Laurie spent years in London as a kind of character actor. Today he;s playing House on TV. But, he reads GE as each of the characters. As he is so talented each voice is hardly like the other. Some may remember him from Black Adder and the silly prince. But here you see just how versatile he is.As for the story...Dickens' twists are remarkable. GE may have the funnest of the who did what whens. If your just getting to know the man and his works or love him to pieces. This version is superb."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"GREAT EXPECTATIONS has long been acknowledged as one of Dickens' best, but it gets even better under the smooth voice of narrator Martin Jarvis, an actor who was named Reader of the Year in the UK and who lends his passionate voice to this brilliant unabridged recording. Even prior fans of the novel will discover new nuances listening here to the Cover to Cover Classics version.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I was just 10 years old, when I first read an abridged version of this Dickens Classic. I must have read it many times since, and everytime I read it, I am filled with array of emotions, and a deep respect for the author. Pip, the hero, is a character that embodies hopes, disappointments and dreams of every boy. As he narrates his life, we grow with him, see many people come in and go out of his life, and we feel with him his emotions and predicaments. Life is full of surprises, unexpected twists and turns, and this novel is a great chronicle of the possibilities of fate. But most importantly, this is a story of pining... and a novel worth pining for.Miss Havisham, the old lady, epitomizes eccentricity, while Estella in her cold abandon represents every heartbreaker. This story is about pining, about love, about friendship (especially Pip and Joe, and later Pip and Herbert), about relationships, and most importantly about what one feels and lives by. Like all Dickens novels, this is a very well written story, and is much more engrossing than any of its on screen versions. This is a story that must be read at leisure and it must be failing of the reader to try and compare it with some cheap paperback that one can scram through while watching a movie and munching chips and cola. Classics deserve respect, attention and concentration: dedicate yourself to one, and trust me you will discover a lot more. A lot more about the novel and a lot more about your own self.We all have Great Expectations, and this one by Dickens beats them all!!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Written as a serial publication, Great Expectations is very fast paced and the character development is superb. It is also very easy to read. The plot is well developed and the number of characters and the interaction of subplots is masterful.When a terrified four year old Pip is coerced into bringing an escaped convict food, he sets into motion a chain of events that will determine the direction of his life and explain that of others. Having served in the house of Miss Havisham, a woman jilted on her wedding day and filled with hate and revenge for the male species, Pip receives notice of &quot;great expecations&quot; - the term for the potential inheritance of a large fortune. From his humble origins as the son of a blacksmith, he is destined to become a gentleman. But the identity of his mysterious benefactor continues to haunt him. And the lovely Estella, for whom he craves, could she be part of this inheritance? Why is someone grooming him to be a gentleman? Who? All these questions and more are answered as the story unfolds in this powerful work."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Looking at the reviews for this book, it seems many are reading this book for the first time, as I did, as part of an English Literature course in high school.Believe me, we can all assure you that this can be a difficult book for a ninth grader to enjoy. After all, we're talking about blacksmiths, pirates, and so on. Hardly things the average teenager of the 2000s can relate to.But if you're in your twenties, thirties, or forties, this book is as compelling a novel as you'll ever read. It's an opportunity to look back at Pip and ourselves, the great expectations we all have, and the major surprises, disappointments, and regrets of life.The adult reader can understand the vindictiveness of Miss Havisham, the pride of Magwitch, the true and rare friendship of Herbert Pocket, and, of course, Estella. Each man has in his life an Estella.Beyond the true-to-life tale of hope and defeat, is the wry humor throughout the book that a more mature reader can appreciate.Surprise yourself. If you hated this in high school, pick it up now; you may find this is one of the best books you ever read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"It is such a good and interesting read everytime I read it! If you're getting started on Dickens, I would totally recommend \\"Great Expectations.\\" Dickens considered it a short novel (probably true for him, considering the length of some of his other books like \\"David Copperfield\\") but there is so much depth in \\"Great Expectations\\", so many layers to it that it doesn't fall short in content. It is because of \\"Great Expectations\\" that Dickens is my favorite English writer ever. One of the greatest novels of all time."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"If you want a Dickens-phobe to convert, buy him/her this CD. Michael Page is one of those rare narrators who can bring male and female characters to life with equal credibility."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I simply loved this book. The characters are so rich, and the story so intricate and well written, I found it engrossing from beginning to end. I loved how the author explored Pip's journey of the desire and love, which really lives in the heart of everyone. This is a \\"must read\\" for those wanting to catch up on all the classics. I have not read much else of Dickens' work, but this story is a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"As I complete my reading effort of Charles Dickens' Great Expectations I feel both satisfied and enriched. This book is outside of the genre I usually read and I am greatful for having taken that leap into the unknown. The satisfaction came from a story that was not only told well but one that ended well. There, in my humble opinion, is nothing worse than experiencing a story only to find that the ending is not truely a completion. Each character and plot line is seen through to its end! The enrichment came from an insightful journey through the trials and tribulations as well as the successes and failures of these well developed characters. This adventure turns from a tale of successes and achievents to one of self realization and personal fulfillment through Mr. Dickens' skilled hand.Nothing is perfect. The story starts slowly. The reader must stick with the book to understand the fact that the beginning of the story was not simply necessary, but a foundation that supports and grows the story like no other introduction could. Some of the descriptions of places or things I found to be exporbitant. This leads to great character development but also to some tiresome chapters. As with any work of literature written durring the time period this book was written, the language is trivially dated or old.I would, and do recommend this book to my friends as one that will not simply pass the time but provide enjoyment!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I read this book when I was a kid and I still remember Pip and Estella. Amazing depiction of characters that stick with you and linger even after finishing."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I was an avid reader, but somehow things changed in my life, but thanks to my Kindle I am getting back to reading. With the Kindle reading is now convenient. Sorry for the plug, but it is true. I have read many of the \\"classics\\" in high school and college literature classes, but somehow missed this one, among others. I did watch the movie many years ago with my wife, and it was good, but of course, the book gives you so much more.Do be warned, this is not a high adventure action-packed read. It is simply a good story well-told. I was surprised to read so much to get so little, in the sense of reading many pages to find out so few or minor details. I continued to read as much and as often as I could to get through this book. It is a great story even if I think it could have been written in half the pages.It is classic for a reason, do yourself a favor and read it if you had not. I hope many high school students do not have to read this book, as it is something beyond their typical capabilities because it does not move quickly and is not too exciting. I think it is more a college level read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Much easier to read and get into than A Tale of Two Cities.

I guess it's just a case of \\"too each his own\\". I'm sure there are some books that I would think were terrible that others rave about. Having said that, I loved this book. I don't know why it took me so long to read it. I've been reading a lot of classics lately - mainly classics that my son is reading or will have to read for homeschool this year. For some reason I thought this book was on his list, but later, after I was in the middle of the novel, realized it wasn't. No matter. I'm very glad that I read it. I was surprised by how involved I became with the characters and the book when I was reading it. I couldn't put it down. I thought a book by Charles Dickens was going to be dry and boring. How wrong I was. I actually found myself grieving with the characters. I would be happy with them and angry with them when they did something that was, in my opinion, wrong or ill-advised At one point I actually found myself having a down day but couldn't put my finger on it until I realized I was at a point in the book where Pip was depressed. Some of the language and unusual expressions that are used in the book can be difficult, but, if you are a fairly well read person, you should be able to do fine. Great book!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I'm not sure how I got through school without reading it and I'm sure I would not have enjoyed it as much in my student days. However, it truly is a wonderful peek into human nature at its worst and at its best."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This being the first novel by Dickens, i didn't know whether i would like it or not. I was pleasantly surprised at how much i did like it. Usually the books that they force you to read i don't enjoy. Although this was never forced on me during high school, i know it is a popular book on high school curriculum. I found that i loved it and has become one of my favorites. I really liked the storyline and thought the characters were enjoyable. I will definitely have to pick up more of Dickens' works.SPOILER: a lot of people didn't like the new ending that Dickens wrote, saying it is too happy and that the original depressing ending was superior. I actually didn't like the original ending and didn't find the newer one to be too joyous. I read the new ending as Pip being doomed to always love Estella, making it more depressing than the original. Anyway, that was my take."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Dickens could put in some really cool surprises for the plot through his books, and this one is no different. When Pip learns who his benefactor is... whoo! I suppose some of the surprises could be predicted if you read enough, but it still makes for an interesting story, and especially good for the time it was written in.I remember reading this many years ago. This may not appeal to people who do not like 'old-fashioned writing', and yes, this book is different than many of the 'easy' novels you will find today, it is still a solid and die-hard classic with a cast of good characters and a story with enough twists and turns to keep it good. Charles Dickens wrote many fine books, and this is definitely one of them."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book truly shows how well written a novel can be.I read this book for school, for all those who are having to read this book for school, I reccomend reading it beforehand because not doing so means finding the book dull and unnatractive while answering all the tedious questions that can ruin a book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I must admit that beyond my initial attraction to the novel's title I made several attempts over a period of years to settle into the story but could not get past the first several pages. There are many things to throw off potential readers to aged classics like this one, not the least of which is Dickens' choice of character names such as Pumblechook, Wopsle and Magwitch, which I at first found absurd and annoying. However on a recent attempt I made it as far as chapter 10 (of 59 total) when it dawned on me suddenly and unexpectedly that I was hooked and that there was no turning back.The unabridged version is not something one can breeze through in an afternoon, especially considering that it requires the development of a certain skill to absorb Dickens' narrative style, much as it is with the often difficult prose of Henry James. Some parts read very fast while others are tortuously overwritten creating a virtual standstill as the eyes glaze over and one starts to look for good reasons not to throw the book against the wall and pull out tufts of hair from one's head in frustration - a good editor would do this book no injustice but I am not going to recommend the abridged version because most parts are not to be played with. But as is the case in life, our accomplishments must be earned, and so I will make this promise to those contemplating reading this work: make the effort, put forth the time to read this novel, which is not a short one, and before long it will grow on you and you will come to treasure your time spent with it, and even savour its pages as the story unfolds and comes to an end.It would be so much easier for the many students who are assigned this book to take the low road and read only a study guide and then rent one of the movies of it and then definitely not ace the class, but the intelligent ones could pull off a pass; but they would be cheating themselves of something that one cannot put a price on- a well told story with vibrant characters who share in our capacities to be hurt, to feel joy, to be knocked down and to live life, for what are stories if they are not reflections of ourselves, our desires, our fears, our untold secrets, our ability to connect to other souls and grow or be cut off and wither.Let me tell it to you straight. Dickens is a master storyteller. He has created a legacy that has been surpassed by only a few and is a standalone in terms of sheer narrative prowess. Modern writers, especially screenwriters (like myself, eventually) would do themselves no harm if they took Dickens' work to heart and used it as a model for their own for here there are no pyrotechnics, no stretching of rehashed plot ideas into the thinness of an overblown balloon, no exaggerated or contrived formulae, granted there is no small measure of coincidence in his stories, but here there are real characters with beating hearts and flesh, fully capable of a misstep and fall, part of a story that is relevant and timeless and enriching, even necessary to the human spirit if we are to grow and thrive and not kill one another with the evil and savagery that we are all capable of.As Nicole Kidman said during her Oscar acceptance a few years back: \\"art is important,\\" and for Dickens' contribution I am grateful and would be doing a disservice if I did not write this ditty for those that may listen. To Kidman's remark I would like to add that without art, life would no longer be tolerable and not worth living. It even convinces one to stick around for a little while longer. Those who do not feast on classics like \\"Great Expectations\\" are paying a very heavy price, one that not even Mr. Gates can well afford."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I spent a whole term going over this book in freshmen English class. It is an overall good book, full of interpritations. There are many symbolisms and allusions. However, it is important to remember that this book was originally a serialization, as it came out every week in the paper. There are some parts when Dickens drawls on with his plans, events, ect. However, there are scenes that are very fast paced and action filled. The overall plot is a young, naive boy of about ten lives with his sister and her simple husband named Joe. However, Pip is given a secret benefactor and is thrust in the life of nobility. Pip is tangled in his probelems of leaving Joe behind and his encouters with the shallow (and I mean SHALLOW) Estella and the wicked Miss Havisham. Dickens is a master with characters and the languege, but he doesn't describe any everyday events. For example, Pip goes to study law, but thats all we know. In my opinion, it gives the characters this higher than life importance, and less real. But, if you take this book slowely, maybe a chapter a night (instead of the five I had to do), you will definately enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"&quot;Great Expectations&quot; seems to be a term used to describe a young man with expectations of becoming a Gentleman. This is the story about a young boy named Pip who though considered poor, was raised as an apprentice in a respectable trade. When his parents died when he was very young he was brought up by his older sister and her husband Joe Gargery the blacksmith. Joe although a little slow, acts in many ways as a loving father and friend to the boy, and is more noble than any of the other characters in the whole book. His older sister however isn't as nice, and in the modern day world probably would have been brought up on charges of child abuse. (If this book was ever remade into a modern day movie I couldn't think of anyone else I'd rather see playing Pip's older sister than Kathy Bates. I pictured her every time the character is mentioned.)Pip then comes into some money by a mysterious benefactor, and becomes an ungrateful little boy who looks down upon those he used to associate with and puts on airs. At this point, in my opinion Pip becomes a very unlikable character for most of the remainder of the book. He believes Miss Havisham who is a mysterious mean old wealthy lady is his benefactor and falls in love with her adopted daughter Estella. I believe this makes Pip look very shallow, since the only redeeming quality she seems to possess is her looks.Pip moves to London and is entrusted to a lawyer named Jenkins and his assistant Wemmick to teach him how to become a gentleman. The lawyer Jenkins, while unloving, is likeable, and in his own way noble. Wemmick who leads a double life is one of the best characters in the book. (I believe there are many people who would like to keep their work life separate from the home life, and can relate to this character.)Jenkins hires a tutor for Pip to teach him how to act like a gentleman. It seems that all the gentleman in this story do however is spend money. Pip and the tutor's son Herbert who becomes Pip's best friend then proceed to work themselves into debt.A pirate which Pip met in his childhood comes back into this life, and brings many changes. (The pirate Pip meets reminded me of the sea captain from &quot;Treasure Island&quot;, or the main character in the &quot;Count of Monte Cristo&quot;.)In the end Pip tries to redeem himself, and in some ways does.There are some plot twists and mysteries to solve. Some work out well and are pleasant surprises, others just seem unnecessary to the story."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"GE is one of the better books that I read in my illustrious high school education. The book threw me a little because of all the words Dickens used to describe every character right down to the tiniest little thing. Pip and Joe is a good pair of characters to have in this book, because they are so different and so alike at the same time. They both like to work with metals and Joe is a blacksmith and pip is his apprentice. They are different in the way that they act. Joe takes the brutal ness of pips sister, and pip does not. When pip starts to work for Ms. Havisham it shows his torture that he has to take from Ms. Havisham in the way of verbal bashings. Thought Ms. Havisham does not beat him unlike his sister does, she is a very cruel and malignant women. Then one-day pip meets Estella, she seems like a nice girl but in fact she is a very cruel women just like her grandma. This is the beginning of pips crush and then turns into a passion. Dickens then goes into the part of the story where pip finds out why she wants Estella to hate men. He finds out that she was left at the alter by her ex. This set a fire in her and that is why she hates men. Then pip returns home one day from work at Ms. Havisham's house and he finds a lawyer there with Joe and some one gave him enough money to get a good education and a home. So he takes the money and pip goes to school in England and the story pretty much lost its importance after that, but pip does find out that the person who gave him the money was from the Escaped convict, he owned his own farm in Australia and he was rich from that. These are just some of things that happened in the book, to find out some of the finer details I urge to you read the book for yourself. It will give u a better insight into dickens writing also."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations was the greatest book that I've ever read.

He ends up being sent away to England to become a young gentleman, and strays away from the love of his life. A great deal of scandal goes on, and if I tell you anymore than you'll know what happens, but I will tell you this.

This typical Dickens, great characters, several plot twists, and a lot of description. For any one who has read everything by Dickens, I'd suggest &quot;Titus Groan&quot; and its follow up &quot;Gormenghast&quot; by Mervyn Peake.

Totally uncalled for, caught me on a bad day. Everybodys different and everyone has their own opinions and just because someone else doesn't like something is no reason to put them down. Its just frustrating because these kids reviews always say the same thing, &quot;this sucked&quot;, or &quot;this was boring&quot; and thats all they can say about it. But anyway, if thats the way they feel then I guess thats just the way they feel and nobody should write such nasty reviews or get mad for such a petty, stupid reason anyway. So, anyway, this is one of Dickens best, as I've said before."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Of all English writers,Charles Dickens is the champion of the genre of \\"Bildungsroman\\",a department of fiction writing pertaining to growth and development of the protagonist. Dickens's writings are darkly underlined by an all-dimensionsal illustration of aperson's character and by an uncanny portrayal of childhood. \\"Nicholas Nickleby\\",\\"David Copperfield\\" and \\"Great Expectations\\" have gone into the literary folklore as novels containing some of the finest amd most vivid passages ever composed on children's psyche and indignified lives. Perhaps the author's this ability to paint children's woe stems froms his own abusive and disruptive boyhood and perhaps in several of his fancy's infants,Dickens was actually trying to reflect his very own horrible childhood. \\"David Copperfield\\" is undoubtably his most personal and in certain fractions autobiographical novel but in \\"Great Expectations\\",employing a compatible first person narrative method,Charles Dickens conjures up a very much real life character who,like David Copperfield,narrates the story of his life as he progresses through his childhood,errors of judgements and unseeming expectations to a tragi-joyous adulthood;as he stives on in life with a plethora of illusions;as he realises the moments of truth one by one.\\"Great Expectations\\" is young Pip's story,a trajectory of his yearning to excel and drift away from the \\"oncommon\\",a desire to be loved and respected in society, a not-so-uncommon craving to grow up and establish himself. For an orphan living in the country marshes in England and brought up \\"by hand\\" by his sister Mrs. Joe Gargery,Pip's on;y genuine friend in his early boyhood was Jor Gargery,the blacksmith---also supposed by the central character to have been made to \\"marry her by hand\\". But a sudden and apparently misfortunate meeting with a fugitive from the nearby Hulks---and the consequent burden of guilt his troubled conscience has to bear---a visit to the queer Miss Havisham's and an unexpected deliverance of all his miseries all consire to Pip's rise in life. The mysterious London lawyer and master defender of criminals Mr. Jaggers arrives one day to inform Pip that if he would,then he is entitled to excercise a proposition of going to London and studying and doing all he can to rise up in life and be an established gentleman with no cost from his side---a mere boyish fancy of Pip till that moment. so marches on our gentle little gentry class boy to the city on te back of the notion that it was Miss Havisham who was actually his benefactoress and who had destined him and her adopted daughter,the cruel,unforgiving and heartless Estella,to be together. And thus begin young and inexperienced Pip's trysts with harsh realities of life.In a novel that essentially figures around human expectations and failures through the tame medium of words,Pip's story is massively apt for the enlightenment of this theme. Pip is found to be a real-life character leafed out of life's own text book and not an imaginary effigy of fairy-tale gratifications,which David in \\"David Copperfield\\" in some stretch is. He's an ordinary person with extraordinary aspirations but as he moves on in life,he learns about himself and this personal growth is exquisitely and relistically portrayed by Charles Dickens. Indeed it's in a great city like London where truth dawns upon Pip,truth that demolishes all ethereals about life,about riches,about Miss Havisham and EStella,and most important truth of them all,the truth about himself. Pip runs into debt,makes several mistakes,is broken down and broken apart by an illusory love and endures fits of remorse,which punctuate his entire existence arising out of a marked ingratitude towards Joe and Biddy,his friend from his old school. His only means of moral salvation from this quicksand of sin is te hearty relationship with Herbert Pockets,his best friend and companion in all his catastrophes. Actually in Herbert and his father,also the tutor of Pip,Charles Dickens creates two characters dissolved in innocence and ignorance with no big aims for money. When all of Miss Havisham's near and distant relatives are coaxing her to milk her fortune,the Pockets are the sole remaining figures to brush aside such ideas. This is one of Dickens's numerous tricks as a writer to subtlely show that goodness can still be glimpsed in an otherwise sadly denudating world.Charles Dickens is believed to have gone through his work \\"David Copperfield\\" thoroughly before writing \\"Great Expectations\\" but even so on certain occasions,the reader does decipher resemblance between these two high acclaimed novels. The shape of Pip's path i life doesn't bear that great degree of difference with these two popular fictional characters are often found to merge. Miss Havisham is reminiscent of Betsy Trotwood's resentment towards the male society,only more elongated and elaborate;in Pip's detest of Drummle and his love for Estella,the reader catches a fair glimpse od David's own contempt towards Uriah heep's lust for Agnes;Mr.Pockets and his family's fiascos and innocence bear a certain kinship with those of Mr. Micawber's;and Pip's deep friendship with Herbert reminds the reader of David's relationship with Traddles. These similarities could blot Dickens's claim to unprecedented imagination power or may strangely prove that life of one is often intertwined with aanother's. The first person narrative technique used to describe Pip's story in this book too isn't without some strong criticisms. The opinions and witty contemplations formed by Pip of people both is his marsh country as well as in London from an early stage in his life render the reader musing as to how his innocent and delicately humorous conjectures could suddenly be transformed into something satirical and concrete. Are his views constructed on the spur of the moment or are they being built now as Pip stares down the years and pens down his history? If the latter be more inclined towards the truth,then it definitely distorts Pip's authenticity as a writer and his memoir is left somewhat ineffective with misleading overlapping of the past and te present.Certain detractions are not so difficult to eke out from \\"Great Expectations\\" really but flaws are a regular parameter of any work of literature. The genius of Charles Dickens is never in doubt in this book as the reader discerns the author's accustomed mingling of humour and dark pictures in a book that promises life as it is. Dickens's obsession with wit and humour is revealed in the features of Mr. Pumblechook and Mr. Wopsle and in incidents such as the latter playing Hamlet on the stage. That when perceived from te swift flow of narration perfectly complimented by the dialogues and conversations and punctuated by moods of reflections makes the book instantly appealing. The caricature of the marsh country is another point of revelation of the author's informed and classy state. The world of Dickens is one of individual identities and aspirations,where all characters find their own proper places. And this world isn't a big one but a narrowed and trimmed realm of compulsive non-overlapping characters all fuctioning significantly in the due course of Pip's realisation of the world and its intricacies.The most beguiling factor in providing Pip's tale a touch of realism and in turn making the novel more touching and endearing is the evident defects in his character. He feels remorseful at his ingratitude towards his poor and \\"common\\" family;he is exasperated at the return of his \\"old convict\\" years later and in his refusal to address him not as Magwitch,his real name,but as Provis,his assumed name,he subconsciously admits denial of his own humble past. Pip isn't mature enough to handle his own humble past. Pip isn't mature enough to handle his own present either,and time and again has to rush to Herbert and wemmick,Mr. Jaggers's assistant,for solace and help. As illusions fade one by one and emotions of al sorts jumble up together in Pip's life,he's found to portray at least fractions of our own lives. \\"Great Expectations\\" is vastly a cofession of a dilapidated soul whose expectations in life are not without unforseen twists and turns. This is an immensely moving tale of a young man's ineptitude and discontentment told in restrained sentimentality,empathic ruminations and glittering descriptions. This classic is a gem for any literature lover,where Charles Dickens;s authority as a writer is amazingly deft."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Dudes. You gotta read this book.

The second kind is quite the opposite, an about-face, and of course \\"Great Expectations\\" would fall into the latter category. It's only main tender-bellied spot for me to prod with critique would be the fairly obvious plot unfolding, even to someone unfamiliar with the story as I was.As so often happens with \\"classics\\", in the end the main characters end up being one another's long lost aunts or cousins, fathers, daughters, stepmothers, caretakers, lovers, or perhaps the cause of misery to one or many, of course all unbeknownst and hidden until you happen to stumble in on their story. That's not really giving anything away, for those that are worried. And it is not to say that Dickens was unoriginal with this one, because it's a fantastic read, but that he's had better - even in the form of \\"Oliver Twist\\".Those that like the happy ending shouldn't really be too interested. Those who like ..., intrigue - um, stay away too. The heart of this pup is dialogue and the torture of internal thoughts and personal dissatisfaction.

I personally do not like to read but i truely enjoyed this book. Although the beginning is very slow and Dickins takes forever to get to the point many times, i found myself unable to put the book down at times. Great Expectations is a good book about loyalty, trust and fate. It also teaches you to remember your true friends and do not let wealth go to your head. The story is centered around an orphan boy named \\"Pip\\". Miss Havisham is the woman who looks after and takes care of Pip. One day Pip is at the gravesite of his parents and the convict, Magwitch, asks him to help him out. Pip does help the convict out not knowing what Magwitch will do for him in the future.One day at Miss Havisham's house Pip meets Estella. He falls in love with her but she does not return the feelings. In fact she is cruel and plays with Pip's emotions. Despite the way he is treated by Estella, Pip never gives up on on trying to win her over.Later on, Pip is told that he has come into a great fortune from an anynomous benefactor. After he comes into all of this money he goes to London, England to study and become a gentleman. While he is in England he becomes somewhat \\"stuck up\\". He treats his old friends like they are not as important as his new friends.While in England he finds out that Estella has married a man who he cannot stand. He also meets up with the convict, Magwitch. Magwitch tells Pip how he is Estella's father and how he is the secret benefactor to his new found wealth. In gratitude, Pip tries to help Magwitch escape from England, but while escaping the police catch them and arrest Magwitch and put him to death, while Pip's money is taken away from him.Pip goes back to Miss havisham's house and becomes friends with his old friends again. He also meets up with Estella there and after awhile the two marry.This book is well written in the way that everyone can relate to the subjects in some way.I really enjoyed reading this piece."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I still wonder why this book is a perennial reading requirement in junior high schools across the country. I had to read it way back when, and it almost turned me off from books in general. This is not to say it's a bad book, because, on the contrary, it's great, but don't have great expectations of an exciting contemporary read. To enjoy this book and appreciate the beauty of fully-fleshed characters, come-alive scenes, and intricately woven plot, you absolutely must keep in mind that this book was written in a different time, before the Hemingway revolution of sparse prose. As you read it, expect long verbose passages and miles between exciting scenes. But stick it out, and in the end expect a great read that stays with you a lifetime.

It is a well done Dickens-style (obviously) story of a young boy raised in a poor environment by his sister--his only living relative--and her husband, a blacksmith named Joe. After visiting a very rich and eccentric woman by the name of Miss Havisham, the young boy named Pip is approached by a lawyer and is told he has &quot;great expectations.&quot; And that he is to move to London to be bread as a gentleman, when after a certain period he is to inherit a large sum of money. The story goes on to London where he is brought up, and leads to some very interesting twists. The tale is well told, and enjoyable if you are fond of Dickens (while I appriciate Dickens.. I admittedly do not like &quot;A Christmas Carol,&quot; so keep in mind that if that is the only Dickens you have been exposed to, give him a try through one of his major novels.)

The book never had me. I don't think it ever actually tried to have me. It's premise centers around a boy named Pip and his life in 19th century England. It's only too bad that Dickens spends far too much time showcasing his prolific skills of writing in the English language and less time on any sort of a solid base for this specific novel. The reader feels absolutely no connection to any of the characters, most notably Pip or Joe. The one bright part of the book is Miss Havisham, who Dickens spends enough time with for us to empathize with her for her lonely life.The biggest problem of course, is it's lack of commitment to any sort of theme. A great novel, as many would claim this is, must possess the language and have something to say. It seems, especially at the beginning, that Dickens is taking his stand against early Industrial Revolution labor practices. However, the book never really delves into that in any way shape or form. When Dickens chooses to describe Joe's house or some other hovel, he persists to use the same kind of language as when he describes, for instance, Miss Havisham's or Wemmick's house. This book, on the whole, is as dry as Spanish sherry and is simply not meant for anyone who wishes to extrapolate anything of meaning from the books they read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"English not being my native language, I never had to read Dickens in high school. I decided to try Great Expectations as my first introduction to the great English author, on the recommendation of a friend of mine. And I was not disappointed!That said, I had a bit of a difficult time at first getting used to Dickens's use of language, and I found the first part of the book a little hard to get into, but I didn't have to struggle too much or for too long: after a short while the characters came alive for me and the story became so absorbing, that I could not put the book down. The novel has a fantastic, very tight plot, and the characters are memorable. This always works for me as a reader!Great Expectations was my first Dickens read, but it will certainly not be the last."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"** This review is a synthesis of the three Charles Dickens books that I've read:A Tale of Two Cities (Penguin Classics),Great Expectations (Penguin Classics), andDavid Copperfield (Penguin Classics). The rationale for reviewing in this manner is to provide a foundational point of reference for those new to Dickens' work.In the last two years I have read, in this order, Tale of Two Cities, Great Expectations, and David Copperfield. All three of these books were exceptional reads, and if you are thinking about dipping your toes in the waters of Charles Dickens you can't go wrong with any of them. However, notwithstanding the fact that these three books are all in the upper echelon of world literature, I have no difficulty in distinguishing between them and coming to the conclusion that they are properly ordered, from \\"most best\\" to \\"least best\\": David Copperfield, Tale of Two Cities, Great Expectations.It seems generally to be the case that, for those who have read just one of Dickens' books, Great Expectations is the book most people have been exposed to. And most people who read Great Expectations love it. The genre is probably best described as romance meshed with individual tragedy among numerous characters. However, perhaps the strongest part of the book is the manner in which the secondary characters present a contrast to the primary story. I liked the book very much, but I think it suffers from two flaws not present in the other works reviewed here. First, the characters are not as believable as in the other two works. Second, the plot follows an unlikely path, especially in the end. Concerning this second point, it should be noted that Dickens struggled with the ending of this work, and I think it shows.Tale of Two Cities ranks second in this group in my mind. This book is a combination of political intrigue, romance, and personal triumph. I rank this book above Great Expectations for the sole reason that the characters in this book are so strongly developed. I don't think I have been exposed to more memorable characters in any book I've ever read. The story is interesting, too, because it takes place against the backdrop of a historical event, the French Revolution. I think Dickens had an easier time writing a convincing plot in this story than in Great Expectations because he had the aid of a real historical event.Great Expectations and Tale of Two Cities are both excellent books, but David Copperfield is simply the best piece of literature I've ever read. To be sure, I'm only 24 and have only read 10 pieces of classic literature since my high school years. However, David Copperfield so outdid anything I've read that I feel more than comfortable in recommending it as certainly one of the best books of all time. Dickens did a remarkable job of capturing a wide variety of human emotions and mindsets. He was aided in this by two things. First, the length of the book gave him space to fully develop his sentiments. Second, the book is written in a first-person autobiographical voice, which I think made capturing sentiments much easier than in attempting to narrate them in the third-person. Further, because the book chronicles David's life from childhood through middle-age the reader is exposed to a wide variety of human thoughts. The characters, for the most part, are more believable and the plot is generally good; I took offense to only one chapter in the whole book.Now, if you haven't read any of Dickens' books, I don't recommend starting with David Copperfield. I would start with Great Expectations and work through a couple others before David Copperfield. In terms of the plots, David Copperfield is much more similar to Great Expectations than Tale of Two Cities. So if you loved Great Expectations I think you will be well satisfied with David Copperfield. The plot from Tale of Two Cities is the odd-ball of this trio. In any case, all three of these books are great pieces of literature... enjoy."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Many people scoffed this book back in my freshman English class, because it was Dickens, and Dickens meant \\"boring\\" to them. However, shrug off the normal tendencies to stereotype an old-time classic to be a bore, one can find a true delight in this beautiful story of a young man struggling with an impossible love, the pressures of money and society, and, of course, himself. It is an excellent, absolutely enriching read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is certainly one of my favorite books. It's about a boy named Pip who struggles to find his own identity. While struck with unfortunate circumstances, Pip remains resilient and continues his struggle in becoming a \\"gentleman.\\" Truly a Brittish classic, it has been called the unofficial autobiography of Dickens and it can be easily called one of his best works. The novel is filled with symbolism and characters that come to life as you read the pages. This book still graces my shelves and I look forward to reading it again. I recommend you pick it up and rea it too."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Perhaps the greates novel I have ever read. Not only enjoyable but contained relevan lessons for my life - you can't escape who you or where you come from by changing your circumstance."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Like several of the people on this review page, I had to read this book for a 9th grade English assignment. Unlike most of the people in my class, I read the whole book and liked it. The book is about a young English boy named Phillip \\"Pip\\" Pirrip living in 1800s England. He is the son of a blacksmith and then is invited to play at an old woman's house. The impression Pip gets from the old woman and her daughter is that Pip isn't good enough. From then on, he grows up and tries to get better for his life after getting a fortune, but things go downhill from that as he gets deep in debt and becomes ill. This book is by no means perfect and has plenty of flaws. The book is way too wordy and could probably be half as long as it is and still get a good point across. I also felt that the ending of the book was a little strange, but overall it was an okay book and I was not bored with it at any point."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"...the defect of almost all the movies (except, perhaps, the 1989 version with Jean Simmons as Miss Havisham (!)) is that the movies emphasize Pip's pursuit of Estella to the exclusion of almost all else. In truth, the core of the story is Pip's class strivings and his inability to distinguish the valuable from the shiny and superficial. Read the book and you will appreciate the character Biddy who is the polar opposite of Estella in every way, and the way, to paraphrase Othello, Pip \\"threw a pearl away richer than all he yearned for.\\"Some of Dickens' characters and coincidences are a little stretched, but they nevertheless are woven together very nicely in the fashion of a good suspense novel. Great Expectations is divided into three volumes, each representing a phase of Pip's Expectations. The structure is strangely like \\"The Monkey's Paw\\": The first expectation (wish) is for riches; the second expectation finds the granted wish not exactly what the protagonist thought it would be; and the third and final expectation leaves the protagonist trying to pick up the pieces.As another reviewer commented, do get an edition that includes the original ending. It is only a few paragraphs but it wraps up this morality tale in a way that is appropriate to the entire theme of the story. If you wonder where the \\"new, happier\\" ending was substituted, just look for the place in the very last chapter where Pip suddenly changes direction and makes a lie of what he has just told his family.If you feel that you cannot sit through the novel, then at least get the 1989 film version (though it is out of print--you will have to pay a little more than you might like) and watch it for probably the accurate representations of the various characters, if not some of the stellar performances of the most acclaimed 1946 version. If nothing else, you will see something very rare for any actor or actress--the opportunity to define two characters in the same classic. In 1946, Jean Simmons' Young Estella defined \\"beautiful but cruel\\" for a generation, and in 1989 the same Ms. Simmons revealed the pain but even greater cruelty of Miss Havisham."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is another book which is forced upon unsuspecting high school students. With many younger reviewers giving this classic 1 and 2 stars shows that this novel will not be appreciated by most studetns. If you hated this book in high school I recommend picking it up again after college.This novel follows the protagonist Pip, from inncocent boy, to dreaming adolecent, to proud gentelman, and comes full circle to the disullusioned adult. Tha characters he meets along the way are some of the most memorable in english literature, especially Miss Havishham, Estella, and Magwitch. Dickens also treats us, about half-way through, to perhaps the best twist of any novel I've ever read.The only thing I at first disliked about this novel were the bizarre coincidinces which caused seemingly unrelated characters to actually have close histories with each other. But I reconciled this for myself in the following way: A major theme of this novel are the machinations of characters to control other characters. Well we must not forget that there are meta-machiantions above this by Dickens himself, and for that all readers can be thankful."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Charles Dickens' Great Expectations portrays the life of the protagonist, Pip, and how he begins as a mistreated orphan and transforms into a gentleman with a mysterious benefactor. Set in the mid 19th century, Great Expectations is a novel with a surprising plot that keeps its readers guessing. Its' intriguing story line and interesting characters keep the story light-hearted and humerous, but Dickens' dreary descriptions and gloomy details bring also a sense of sadness and compassion to the novel. Aside from the novel being time consuming, indepth, and in great detail, Great Expectations is a classic novel that all should read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Though someone stated you have to be over 21 to appreciate this book (and I am 21 now) I first read this story when I was 14 years old, in 8th grade, and understood (and loved) it right away. Why? As an adolescent struggling with popularity (the modern, teenage equivalent of the English class system) and unrequited love, I immediately identified with Pip. Furthermore, the romantic atmosphere was completely intoxicating, from the vast marshes to the city of London; though the narrator describes it as disappointingly crowded and dirty my sense of the city from this book was much more elevated. I also admit I was helped by the updated Classics Illustrated comic book version of the book, which I peeked at now and then while I was reading Great Expectations--despite my aversion to revealing the ending before I reached it in the text (eventually, I succumbed to my temptations). If you can find this (probably) out-of-print illustrated version of the story--not sure what the status of Classic Illustrated is these days--make sure to buy it. But to return from my digression, the novel is where it's at. Dickens' impeccable imagination creates an vivid sense of place, an unforgettable cast of characters (including the ultimate romantic ideal: Estella), a rich and textured story, and an immortal message of aspiration, disappointment, and dreams. This story really fired my imagination as a teenager, so I encourage those youngsters who may be dissuaded from reading it to pick it up--I'm not guaranteeing you'll like it but if you read it before you're forced to you just may find something valuable in it. As for the rest of you \\"grown-ups\\" if you haven't read this masterpiece yet, get off yer asses and take a trip to the local library. It'll make your day."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I've read many, many books throughout the years, in a wide variety of genres. Periodically, I try to stretch myself by taking on works that I might not otherwise gravitate toward. Sometimes I am rewarded; that is how I discovered Hemingway and Vasily Grossman (much to my delight). However, I generally read for pleasure and will never be considered an erudite literary critic; in other words, you won't find me reading Shakespeare.I recall reading A Tale of Two Cities in high school and to my recollection, enjoying it. With that in mind, I was determined to give Charles Dickens another shot, with the knowledge that if it were to my liking, there would be a wealth of material at my disposal. That is how I came to read Great Expectations.The novel centers on young Pip, an orphan taken in by his domineering older sister and kind, blacksmith husband. Pip is destined for a life as an apprentice blacksmith, a member of the English lower class, until an encounter with an escaped convict radically changes the course of his life. For you see, young Pip harbors \\"great expectations\\" and a life far beyond that set before him. With the help of an anonymous \\"sponsor\\", Pip begins his journey toward life as a gentleman.When reading Dickens, Tolstoy, and even more so Shakespeare, the first hurdle is becoming familiar with the language, the style of writing and the idioms and terms used by writers of the era; even more so with Dickens, where he routinely spells words phonetically when spoken by Cockney British commoners. Somewhat offputting at first, the reader soon becomes comfortable with the style and is amply rewarded and entertained.Having read numerous novels from the period, I was well familiar with the British class system on the mid-19th century, but nowhere is its rigidity more apparent than in this work. Within days of attaining a sponsor, young Pip completely removes himself from his former friends and relatives (both geographically and socially), even expressing embarrassment for having been associated with them. There are several story threads that work themselves together nicely near the end of the novel.Having become reacquainted with Dickens, I fully expect to sample more of his work."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"First of all (as I like to say!)

To me, it is not dissimilar to David Copperfield in its themes; however, David Copperfield moves me to tears every time I read it.I came across an original review of Great Expectations at The Atlantic Monthly's website. The reviewer wrote of Dickens and this work &quot;The very title of this book indicates the confidence of conscious genius. In a new aspirant for public favor, such a title might have been a good device to attract attention; but the most famous novelist of the day, watched by jealous rivals and critics, could hardly have selected it, had he not inwardly felt the capacity to meet all the expectations he raised.&quot; T.A.M. then went on to state that they felt the book did in fact live up to its title.Unfortunately I am not permitted to type in the whole web address so that you could more easily find this review, but if you are interested, go to The Atlantic Monthly's website and under the section entitled &quot;Books and Critics&quot; type in &quot;greatexp.htm&quot; at the search engine. The review itself was posted in September 1861."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I read this novel for my freshman english class and I thought it is one of the best! It has such a strong story line to it. I thought it was an excellant book and I recommend everyone to read it. It will give you a whole new prespective of love, family, and yourself."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"It's rather amusing to read some of the comments -- obviously written by people (i.e. teenagers) forced to read it for sophomore English class. Hating &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is kind of like hating Beethoven, Shakespeare, or Monet: O.K., it's not your taste, but it's really a waste of time to say &quot;IT SUCKED.&quot;Dickens's novel is one of the all-time champs. Unforgettable characters, beautiful writing, and a depth of understanding of human nature rarely equaled in English or American fiction. As they say in theory class, it works on many different levels. If you hated &quot;G.E.,&quot; well, then, you probably wandered into the Literature aisle by mistake. You probably also don't like &quot;Wuthering Heights,&quot; &quot;Jane Eyre,&quot; &quot;David Copperfield,&quot; or anything by Hardy or Austen, if you've bothered.Otherwise, if you love literature and haven't read &quot;Great Expectations,&quot; consider your education incomplete."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This has to be my favourite Dickens novel. In fact, I would go so far as to place it alongside Flaubert's &quot;Sentimental Education&quot; and Dostoevsky's &quot;Brothers Karamazov&quot; as one of the great novels of the 19th century. I am astonished by the number of one and two star reviews even though they do appear to come mainly from high school students being &quot;forced&quot; to read the novel for English class. Judging by the spelling mistakes and grammatical errors which proliferate these submissions, Dickens is not the only thing that they've had trouble staying awake for. In addition, it is ridiculous to suggest that Dickens's novels were so lengthy because he was &quot;being paid by the word.&quot; His books initially appeared in serial form as books were very expensive in the Victorian era and he understandably wished to avoid precluding large sections of his target readership from being able to sample them. The fact that some current &quot;readers&quot; find this novel &quot;too long and boring&quot; is, I believe, a sad reflection on our media saturated society where a two-second attention span is rapidly becoming the norm."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Why, in God's name, do high school teachers insist on stuffing this complex novel down the throats of their teen-aged students? Because the initial chapters are narrated by, Pip, a little boy we watch become a young man? Because there are pirates and bad guys in it? Because there's a sort of love story? I'm sure some high schoolers understand GREAT EXPECTATIONS but the majority of them... I don't think so.GREAT EXPECTATIONS contains many complicated, adult themes and issues that adults will surely appreciate. A virtual encyclopedia of human emotions--fear, child abuse, anticipation, disappointment, love, jealousy, manipulation--this greatest of all of Dickens' novels has everything. And all these ingredients are woven into an incredibly entangled plot, full of twists and turns. On top of all that, the novel is also a virtual encyclopedia of the layout and attitudes of Victorian London.Holding it all together is Pip's incredible perceptions into his world and his emotions. Never before had there been a character so aware of his feelings and, still, because he is human, he allows these emotions to sometimes compel him to do the opposite of what is right and best. Pip does sometimes behave like the child and young adult he is, but that doesn't mean this novel is suitable for anyone of that age.Rocco Dormarunno, author of The Five Points"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great expectations is an extremely wonderful book!this book starts talking about a boy named Pip.he is trying to live up to everybod's expectations of him while trying to live his own life.Pip was born an orphan.his older sister adopts himand thats how his sister is admired for bringing him home and raising him. she was married to joe her husband. this story really starts off when Pip meets the convict on the old church graveyard on the hill of the marshes.The convict told Pip to bring a metal file,pork pie and a meat bone. The convict was very thankful. from that day on Pipd id not tell anybody about that day. His sister later on dies and he meets a girl named estella. estella was adopted by miss Havisham. Pip loved her but miss Havisham taught her to hate all men.This book is a wonderfully good book. I would recommend this book for children ages 13-21. It is an arduous book for some readers but it is aninteresting book to read. I love books that Charles Dickens writes. He is an awesome writer. If you like to read about romance, deception, horror and drama then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Hi, Great Expectations is probably (besides David Copperfield) my favorite Dickens novel. I read it when I was a child, and having been re reading it ever since. It is told through Pip, the narrator. His voice is clear and realistic.The reader feels for him as if he were a real person. Miss Havishman is a sad character and her disappointment in love is very understandable. Mr. Jaggers the lawyer is sharp as most lawyers ought to be and are. I felt for Magwitch, Pip's benefactor. And I understood Pip's feelings towards him when they meet again after many years, Estella is not my favorite character, but she learns to be a better person. Charles Dickens is, needless to say, a timeless writer, one of the very best. Eugenia RenskoffDifferent Flags"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Charles Dickens, Great ExpectationsDickens tells an intriguing yarn, creates suspense and amuses us with a range of eccentrics, friendly such as Wemmick or Herbert Pocket, or macabre as with Pumblechook or Jaggers. As in David Copperfield, he gives us strong and often threatening women, like Betsy Trotwood, and here Mrs Joe. Both of these semi-autobiographical novels begin with a shock to a child that reverberates through the rest of the action. Both are seen from the dual child-adult perspective; both belong to the Bildungsroman genre. Both have been repeatedly adapted for stage, screen and radio drama, and yet both have their weaknesses of characterisation and narrative tedium.Several decades ago it was not unusual to find a Dickens novel as a set text for public examinations. Today this would be unheard of: \`Too long, Sir!' \`Boring, Sir!' I recall attempting to \`teach' Nicholas Nickleby to secondary modern school pupils in the Sixties. Then that outmoded method of \`reading around the class' was still in vogue. The lads enjoyed that and were doubled up laughing as Nickle Arse and Queers went about their business. Those who say they still love Dickens today, are probably thinking of one or more of the excellent BBC adaptations rather than the text of the book itself. Reading a Dickens novel today, except as a Simplified Classics text, is no mean feat.It has taken me several weeks to get through Great Expectations, reading it in bite-sized pieces, often as a Book at Bedtime treat. That is probably the best and most appropriate method, since like most Victorian novels it was designed for serialisation, which also of course accounts for the repetitiveness and the prolonging of tension by ending each Part on a cliff-hanger. It is not easy for the modern reader to read with the eagerness and innocence of his Victorian counterpart. The sheer thickness of the books and the at times plodding nature of the narrative demand a time and patience that for most of us today is in short supply.Nevertheless, I am pleased to have made the effort, and was for the most part captivated by the narrative and relished the sheer exuberance of the language, as when Dickens allows Pumblechook or Joe Gargery to indulge in their respective bumbling monologues. True, I got tired of Pip's continual self-analysis as he expounds on his guilt in rejecting the advances of good friends like Joe, Biddy and, later, the convict Magwitch aka Provis. I cringed, too, at the moral miracles of a converted Miss Havisham, kneeling before Pip. And the fire was an unconvincing contrivance. As for the cooked-up non-serial happy ending, the less said the better."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I read this book when I was in high school.

A wonderful novel of Pip who comes into his \\"great expectations\\" via an unknown benefactor -- who he believes to be Miss Havisham. We see how the influence of money and position affect Pip's relations with his family and former neighbors, and not necessarily for the better. There are lots of surprise twists and turns in the plot, especially about Miss Havisham and her adopted \\"daughter\\" Estella and her true parentage.As always, a Dickens novel is peopled with wonderful and unusual characters that eventually all play a part in telling the story. I understand that there were two endings of this book published. The version I read had only one ending and I don't know which one it was. I will have to search out another version of this book to see which I liked best."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"My grandad recommended I read this. I will admit to being very skeptical on the first few pages. I had to read and re-read some of the passages quite a few times to undesrtand what was being said through the old english slang. However, once I passsed that, I found it to be a touching and very interesting story.It is filled with some of the greatest characters ever created in literature.Along the way you will find many truths applicable even in today's society and Dickens expresses it in way unique to him.Dickens has created one of the most beautiful novels ever written: Great Expectations. It's a must read for any book lover and it is by no means overated.This is one you would want keep as part of your collection. It is simply a treasure."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I loved this book. When my teacher first told us we had to read it I thought I would be bored. Boy, was I wrong. It was a little hard to get past the dialect, but what a great story. Dickens did a wonderful job with the characters and how all their lives are somehow connected."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"From the moment I discovered that \\"Great Expectations\\" was a mandatory book to read in many high schools I thought that I belonged to those happy people on whom, by good luck, it hadn't been forced in their teenage years. I do not think that even if it had, the novel wouldn't have brought me pleasure later, when I grew up, but my past experience with it would have certainly impeded taking the book in my hands again. There is little doubt that in many cases high school stifles the willingness to read literature (not \\"bestsellers\\", however) when young people are confronted with such serious and complex works as \\"Great Expectations\\".The situation with \\"Great Expectations\\" is similar to that when a high school student is forced to read a fairly technical textbook on contemporary physics: there are chances that he or she will like or even be enthralled by some ideas in the book, but inability to follow and understand details (although symbols might be recognised) will almost certainly produce a negative opinion of it in the end.\\"Great Expectations\\" is one of the greatest novels I have ever read. Often humorous, with a carefully planned structure and set of heroes, wonderful narration and an unmatched appeal to senses, it reveals a story of unrequited love, an affair which now stands out as one of the most painful in classical literature. The complex relationship of the principal heroes - Pip, a touchingly honest and faithful young gentleman, and Estella, his beautiful and highbrow tormentor, are at the heart of the plot. But such original figures as Miss Havisham, Mr Jaggers, Mr Pumblechook, Joe Gargery and Biddy supply a rich background - each of them being a perfect example of a character in literature. For, as Alphonse Daudet noted, \\"It is the business of the novelist to create characters, not to write fine prose\\". Though Dickens' fine prose is also above all praises.But \\"Great Expectations\\" is much more than a simple romance - it is a great life lesson. Why do people \\"destined for each other\\" often end up being apart? What makes us break other people's hearts? How long will true love last? What obstacles surmount?"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"What can I say that hasn't been said already? &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is a tremendous novel from the introductory paragraph to the final sentences. The plot is deep and intricate, and there's even a surprising plot revelation occuring late in the book about the origin of Pip's wealth and opportunity in life. The characters are all well-defined and inherently interesting, and such major characters as Pip, Estella, Joe, Miss Havisham, and others vividly live in the mind. Even minor characters such as Mrs. Joe and the Aged Person are memorable and amusing. The novel's storyline, beginning with Pip's early childhood and ending in his late middle age, is epic in breadth. &quot;Great Expectations&quot; treats the reader to a delightful plot and scene for all of its five hundred pages.Even better, however, is the brilliant prose Dickens gives us in the novel. It is humorous, moving, touching, witty, clever, and always perfectly phrased. Never for a single second does the reader feel bored. Like many great works of literature, there are plenty of moments where the writing is almost awe-inspiring in its beauty and language. With a talent as great as Dickens, one could write about almost anything and it would be tremendous reading. When paired with the brilliant plot of &quot;Great Expectations,&quot; it feels almost heaven-sent.Many readers see the term &quot;classic&quot; on a novel and feel that it becomes a type of chore, and add it to a laundry list of literature that somebody felt would be good for them. &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is a classic, but it's not at all the literary equivalent of medicine. It's a delightful treat, and a quick read despite its length. I can't imagine reading this and not treasuring it. It is, quite simply, fantastic."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I studied this book for 2 years in high school and never really read the book itself until a month before my super majorly imprtant exam. Up till then, i was surviving on cliff notes and whatever my tutor said. I had tried to read the book at least a hundred times but fell asleep after the first page.I give this book 4 stars for the fact that dickens is such an AMAZING writer. i'm not saying this coz its a classic. after studying this book for 2 years, you get to know the structure, the language, the relationships between the different plots and sub-plots. and i was BLOWN AWAY by the BRILLIANT way dickens tied everything together. SIMPLY AMAZINGI admit, it IS a tiring read. but like what another review said, Great Expectations was meant to be read chapter by chapter, one per week or soemthing like that. the book i read came with a timeline which shows the publication of each chapter.I do recommend this book. just make sure that you're really really awake when you're reading it. pay attention to the details e.g. how the atmosphere reflects the different characters stuff like that. Read it once. and read it AGAIN. i swear the 2nd time you read it, everything will become clearer. Read it a third time and you'll notice how Dickens pulls the novel off. pretty intriguing."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I know lots of people will flay me for saying this, but this book has a lot of repeat value. I could read it every year, for five years at least without getting bored doing it. I had read the abridged version in school, and a year ago i had seen the movie (featuring gweneth paltrow and ethan hawke). I liked these so much that inspite of knowing the story i bought the unabidged version and was plesantly surprised how much i enjoyed it. Both the movie and the abridged version concentrate only with Pip's relation with estella. The book is infact much wider in its scope. For example Pip's relation with Mr.Pocket fills more pages than that with estella.Charles dickens surely spins a superb yarn of pip, his ambitions, desires, weaknesses, and pureness of character which is so entirely credible and believeable that it seems like an autobiographical account told in the third person. This inspite of the novel containing eccentric characters like miss havisham difficult to find in actuality. Another important contribution of this novel is to portray the relation between pip and estella. Its extremely difficult to say what exactly it is. Infatuation? No. It was the very soul of his existance without which he could not exist. It lasted from childhood till the end. Love? Unlikely. He was torturing himself in her company and this can hardly be called love. Hatred? No. Vengence? No. On miss havisham's part maybe but not on that of pip or estella. There's no answer forthcoming. Just when we thought we were intelligent and mature enough to understand relationships Mr. Dickens comes along to tell us to start from kindergarten once again.I found Mr. Dickens style of writing quite modern. Of course there's an influence of the times he lived in but the novel has a very modern tang. In fact if the means of transport were cars instead of horses, there was electricity instead of candle light and so on, making only such cosmetic changes the novel would definitely seem to be written very recently. I just realised - the movie proves this."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I must admit, this review is slightly prejudiced. I am a high school student, and I read this book for fun. I had tried to read Dickens before, but found myself having a hard time ploughing through the complex vocabulary and intricate parlor dialogue of Hard Times. But I decided to take another stab at Dickens, perhaps with something a little more palatable. All of Dickens' novels, I realized at the end of Book I!!, are VERY, VERY SLOW -- AT FIRST. Then Dickens decides to play on his own soporific introductions!!!!! There is a crucial turn in events for Pip, and the book takes off. Every few paragraphs, there's another handhold so to speak, to keep the reader's suspense and to keep the plot building. Both the language and the many interwoven plots are delectable and unavoidably magnetic -- your hands just can't seem to put down the book, no matter what you do. This book has it all. It also helped me understand why I hated reading the Odyssey for English. (Translations always lose some of the vivacity and fullness that the author has pumped his or her very original work full of, and it is this fullness that made the work so great in the first place.) It is a long read, and you have to be willing to be patient with the beginning. But it's definitely worth it. And the more you read, the easier it gets. After reading this book, I feel inspired to read all of Dickens' works!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"When I found out I had to read Great Expectations, by Charles Dickens for school, I was extremely dissapointed. I had already read A Tale of Two Cities, and absolutely hated it. Students in other classes had read Great Expectations and not liked it either, so I figured I would not enjoy it either. But I decided I would read it anyway, because it is considered to be one of the best books of all time. The books starts out fairly slow, and it takes the reader a few chapters to get used to Dickens's writing style, for he uses an abudance of description. He was paid by the word so he had incentive to do so. For those who are able to survive the first few chapters, they will enjoy an extremely lovable book and not be dissapointed. The book is timeless, with the basic story line being one that has affected almost everyone sometime in their life; falling in love with somebody who does not return the feelings. Pip, the main character, falls in love with an exotic and beautiful girl, Estella, but of course she does not have any feelings for him. So Pip does everything he can to win her approval, and most importantly her heart. It is hard to skip around in the book. While some passages might seem as if they have nothing to do with the story, they do. Everything in the story is tied together somehow. Skimming the book is not going to help. Certain events and people the reader thinks are insignificant or forgot completley, will appear over and over throughout the book. I am glad that i decided to read Great Expectations, despite the negative remarks from peers. I found out that most of them never made it past the first few chapters, so they missed out on the good parts. The only reason I did not give the book a higher score is that parts of it are slow and dry, but stick with it, you will not be upset."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Dickens takes you on a ride that will keep the reader enthralled throughout.

How did I get through high school without reading it? My hs English teachers chose the heartbreaker, David Copperfield, so it's not my first Dickens. I can see that Dickens can tell a story.

It's funny, I couldn't get through it as a kid, but now I've really enjoyed it. Charles Dickens writes these characters that seem so alive. He describes them so well, their little mannerisms, that that part alone fascinated me. Pip's perception of them felt really spot on for a kid. He was definitely put upon to some degree, but much of what he felt was horrible behavior toward him by the adults was really stuff that's common to every kid. It reminded me of how I felt sometimes toward relatives and friends of my parents, all of whom I like now, and I both laughed and felt horrified to realize it.

For a younger reader the language can be difficult, so I helped him as much as I could. I thoroughly enjoyed the story though!

As we get farther and farther away from the lifestyle of the 1800's I think it is important to look back and see what life was like before technology. I also enjoy the British take on things. I don't always &#34;get it&#34; until I re-read it a time or two, but the humor is there. (SPOILER ALERT!) I actually thought the ending was sad until my son pointed out that in class they considered the fact that when Pip &#34;saw no shadow of another parting from her,&#34; could mean that they were never seperated again.

The plot revolves around the rise of a young man, Pip, in society due to a mysterious benefactor.

At times the writing felt antiquated and I had to reread some passages to get the gist of the meaning, but it was fun to feel sort of challenged as a reader."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This was not an easy book to read but had a good story line from a great classic author. I didn't get to view the movie on PBS so I read the book instead."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I have undertaken to read as many classics as I can, and this one is one of my favorites. Very dark and rather depressing, to be honest, but still a great book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This was a tale of intrigue in that the twisting intermingling of characters gave forth to romance and human tragedy."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"A great classic. I just 'have to have it ' on the Kindle Fire . Like a familiar leather shoe!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations Saw the movie and loved it so figured the book had to be better.I wanted to read it for years"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"My daughter needed this book for school and the weather was too bad to go out and look for it. We found it on Amazon and had it shipped to us. It was delivered sooner than expected."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Nice story, interesting characters, language is a little old fashion, but all and all a good read. Author shows great promise.."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Excellent book. A little difficult to understand some of the old English terms but quite enjoyable. I wish I had read this in high school."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"One of my favorite books of all time. A love story with a twist and very well conceived but the author. Great book.."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"My objective is to read as many of the classic books as possible. I found this book to be very hard to put down and kept me wondering what was going to happen next."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Dickens is a rare genius who succeeded in capturing vividly the manifold pains - physical, emotional, and moral - of childhood and the effect of these scars in the adulthood. As a result, his stories still resonates powerfully after so many years. On the weak points, Dickens tends to rely on remarkable coincidences to tie the plots together, and the psychological studies of his characters are not as sharp and profound as those of Dostoyevsky or Henry James. I also found the contrived happy ending very unsatisfying."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book is an incredible read. The main character really absorbs the attention of the reader. The plot is amazingly well done, you won't want to put the book down!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Everyone must read this book. It is quite a story, but not for the weak of heart. It will make impostors change their ways (or at least know the extent of wrongdoings) and those who are earnest count their blessings that they are."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book shows alot of character and keeps you wondering what this little boy is going to go through next. charles dickens is a wonderful writer. This book should be made mandantory for all students to read while they are still in high school."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"More high school students should read this book. I loved this book, and I read last year as a freshmen. If you think about it, high school students can relate to this book just as they can relate to books written now. Even though it is written in older times and with &quot;big words&quot; doesn't mean one should not read it and say it is boring and stupid. Many high schoolers can relate to Pip when he was bored with being a blacksmith because he got tired of doing it, because alot of times high school students sign up to do stuff that it turns out they don't like or that they are tired of because they thought they would like it or their parents made them do it. Many high schoolers can also relate to when Estella makes fun of Pip, because they argue with siblings or that guy/girl who sits next to you in biology class that you don't like but they still talk to you. Then when Pip gets his chance to finally become a gentleman, many high schoolers finally get their chance to do something they want. Once you read the first few chapters of Pip's childhood and up to when he gets to become a gentleman, you are hooked. I personally loved this book. It was one of the only books I read in my freshman year of high school, and now I am glad that I read it. It was wonderful."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This was a great book because of the way that he made it seem that you were there.Also because of the way he kept you on the edge of your seat, and the way that all the characters are all familiarized to each other makes the book good but hard to understand,except the way that he wrote it in Old English made it hard to read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I first read this book when I was 12 or 13 - ten years later I decided to read it again because I remember loving it so much. It was just as good the second time round.While not his best book (of the ones I've read David Copperfield takes that prize) it is a thoroughly enjoyable read with larger than life charcters and, in places, Dickens' trademark subtle, sarcastic humour. Add a great storyline and you've got a great book.I cannot believe that so many younger people are panning this book. Not being full of adrenalin-packed scenes does not make it boring! Get an attention span!One more comment - while the recent film with Hawke and Paltrow was a good film in its own right, it lacks so much when compared to the book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I am 16 years old and this was my summer reading book. I thought it was pretty good. Just because you have to read it for school, don't just discount it as a worthwhile book. Yes, it is long, but it DOES have a point. You have to keep in mind that Dickens publiched this in monthly installments in his magazine - so yes, it is long. But take your time and enjoy the story."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This review comes from a 15 year old male. I found this to be a rather good novel. If you are willing to read a big novel, do so and you should find some enjoyment in this book. If you can't stand reading some pages with just too much detail to get to the actual plot, avoid. Email me your comments, peace."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations has been one of the first of many novels I happen to touch upon fashioned by Charles Dickens. I set forth to reading it with a mind not interested but curious. Zeal may be the one motive that takes me through the first part of the novel. Fleeting moments of ambivalence of good and evil throughout the novel can always be found in one's life. As have been articulated, I find myself in Pip's reaction to what his fate and destiny has brought him. Pip's oscillation between compunction and remoselessness, egotism and selflessness is the cardinal element upon whcih the story is built .On the other hand, the plotting of the novel is superbly constructed, with the lives of countlss characters interwined with one and other. Miss Havisham, I reckon, is one of the best of them. This is one great novel that you should not miss. Miss it and you shall lose what is more valuable than Pip's expectations."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is a classic story of unrequited love and growth. It teaches something to everyone who reads it. There is so much beauty and depth in this novel, it cannot be put into words. My advice for anyone and everyone who will read this in the future is to treasure every moment you spend reading this book. Take every detail in and you will never regret the time you spent because it is entertaining and absolutely thrilling. There are a lot of twists and turns in the plot as well as the emotions in the characters and it literally brought tears to my eyes."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I read this book in 5th grade and I loved it! I still do. It is the best book. I think it is not boring at all and is very very very funny!!!! I think that everyone will like it once they get into it!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I think that two clarificifactions need be made to edify those who thought this book &quot;sucked&quot;, and that the characters were &quot;insane&quot;. Dickens is exaggerating! For example, there are hardly any people in real life like Jaggers, who do everything in such a business-like way. And yet he is very interesting and highly entertaining. And for everyone who thinks there were too many details: try to imagine just a bleak straightforward account of Pip's life. A good novel shouldn't just be a summary. And if you think it's wordy and too descriptive, try IVANHOE (another great book). Regarding the alternate ending: YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE FOCUS OF THIS BOOK IS NOT PIP&quot;S LOVE FOR ESTELLA. Who gives a damn whether he marries her or not? The focus of the story is on Pip's aspiring to such expectaions, and being drawn away from his family and humble origins, until he discovers the true treasures of life. I loved this book, and if you do not think it ranks as a classic, then what does?"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations is the story of a young boy, Pip, and how he struggles to reach the experiences of Estella, the girl he loves, as he grows up and matures. This novel, written by Charles Dickens, explains the disappointment of loving someone without response, and being unsatisfied with one's life, because of having such high expectations that one cannot meet. I liked the way that the author portrays the characters and the setting to give a resemblance of the theme. I was interested throughout the story, for it is gripping and unpredictable. I sincerely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys novels that one can relate to with a deep meaning. Also, to anyone that likes a challenge Great Expectations is an ideal book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"When a game of leap-frog goes awry, young Pip Maplethorp's father is killed.With the family crumb-winner out of the picture, Pip is forced to travel to London where he finds employment as a Governess to the Lingus family (whose daughter, Constance, taunts him with cries of \\"you're lost - lost in a Fog of Lag !\\"). On day, while gathering pond scum, Pip meets and befriends Dr. Wetherbee. This chance meeting provides the book with one of it's few moments of comic relief, as Dr. Wetherbee repeatedly strikes Pip about the face and head with a cricket bat that he affectionately calls \\"Trevor\\". I won't ruin the book for you by telling you what Pip sees behind the potting shed that makes him no longer desire to be a Pediatrist, but I will tell you that, after reading that chapter, I never looked at pudding the same way again. I predict that this book will have resurgence in popularity and soon everybody will be saying, \\" Is that your Dickens in your hand?\\""},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is Dickens' greatest novel, and one of the best of all time. Full of some of his most memorable characters, such as Magwitch (convict with a heart -- or liver), Miss Havisham, Pumblechook, Jaggers, Wemmick and more. From the opening graveyard scene to the final confrontation between Pip and Estella, you're hooked, laughing and crying. Pip is the Dickens character with the most psychologically realistic growth, and is therefore the author's most sympathetic hero. Wonderful plot, wonderful description, an absolute must. I highly recommend the Bantam paperback because the introduction by John Irving, &quot;The King of the Novel&quot;, is just as extraordinary in its own way. It's a superb, personal, passionate defense of Dickens that has affected me as much as any of Irving's best novels."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"While reading the reviews that others had written, I was amazed at how many people did not like this book. Maybe if you weren't so rushed into reading this book, you might actually enjoy it. Some of the reviews may stop you from reading this book, but I am telling you to read it. It is very descriptive, has a wonderful plot, and a great author. Ignore the other reviews because this book is clearly a classic and will ALWAYS be a classic."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Yes, it's hard to believe. Not a page is wasted. There are no digressions and few apparent digressions; the story - admittedly a long story - is swiftly and cleanly told, and it contains all the character growth, suspense, and frippery that one could reasonably ask of any story. This is DESPITE the fact that the book has all the virtues of any Dickens novel. The languge is, as usual, witty and a delight to read - in fact, more so than usual: it turns out that first person narration suits Dickens. All of the charcters are memorable - in fact, more so than usual: it comes as a great surprise to hear that this is the Dickens novel with the fewest characters, if you actually number them. The usual quota of gorgeous incident is there: in fact, more. And so on. It's hard to imagine a more nearly perfect book. -And there's one other thing I should mention. \\"Great Expectations\\" probably has a special personal appeal to many different sorts of people, but I would like to especially, from personal experience, commend the novel to graduate students. I hope they'll see what I mean."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"An undeniably solid book. I can certainly identify with Pip, but it was, at times, drab. Maybe if I hadn't been forced to read it I would have enjoyed it more."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I coulda thought there would have been a better ending, but it doesn't really matter. Mrs. Dooley gave us a really easy test over it, so I don't really care, because we spent a whole 3 weeks reading this book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Pip craves the approval of Miss Havisham and the love of Estella, who basically treat him like dirt. Even when he's with them he's miserable and knows it. Pip also knows that he's being an ungrateful snob towards Joe and Biddy, who've done nothing in his life but love, respect, and protect him. This because he cannot help but view them through the eyes of the rich and vindictive Miss Havisham and the beautiful but really darn mean Estella. Despite all this, Pip is a likeable character with whom it is easy to identify and sympathize. Eventually he confronts the superficiality of his expectations and embraces his true nature. In the process he transforms both Miss Havisham and Estella into feeling human beings, understanding and remorseful of the pain caused by their previous conduct."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"...this book and I are! I had to keep reminding myself that this story was fiction, otherwise I probably would have gotten much more emotional about it than I did. Many of the emotions Pip went through, I have also at some point. What doesn't kill you, makes you stronger (or at least very sick... poor Pip!)."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book is in one of my Top 5 Favorite all time books. I have read it again and again. The only problem I have with it is that I am never able to get through part three. How could I call it my favorite then? Read the book and discover the magic."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"My first experience with this book was as a freshman in high school. Being so young, it was nearly impossible to grasp the depth and breadth of this genius piece of work. This story is amazingly broad in character development. Through the novel, one is able to follow the life journey of Pip, and his ties to those closest to him in life. He &quot;changes, and changes again,&quot; and can never fully recover from what he learns. There's no going back. This book will forever remain one of my favorite. It's one that leaves you wondering how a person could have the talent to create such a touching, masterful work."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"People have enjoyed the adventures of Pip and friends (or enemies, as the case may be) for decades! Though quite confusing at times, Great Expectations was a well thought out novel. This book required more concentration than most, with a cast of characters that would fill the world many times over. I had trouble reading it in the normal haphazard fashion I usually take; a chapter here, a few pages on the way to school, because of all the details put into it. I know this classic was written with money being paid per word, but I found much of the long, rambling, descriptions to be the one major fault of the novel. I think that the one reason people accept and cherish these lengthy descriptions is because Great Expectations is one of the &quot;classic classics&quot;, so to speak. People expect it to become tedious in places, filled with descriptions of anything from a desk drawer to toenail clippings. But overall, I found this to be a touching book, about mangled love, childhood, and life in general. A great read for anyone with patience!!-LJ"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I think that this book was superb, not just because it's a classic but because of it's morals and it's story of young Pip and how he goes through many many adventures and many wonderful happenings in his life. That's why of course it's called Great Expectations - the title tells all"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book helped me realize I do not need to read books in a conventional manner to fully enjoy them. I read the book with the aid of books on tape while in the back of my parent's Toyota riding through Holland. The atmosphere of the many hours spent enjoying the book while I would have been sleeping or staring vacantly at the fields still calls me to thank my eighth grade teacher for assigning it to me. Even though I remember groaning at the first sight of the thick novel, I am happy to have known the eccentric nature of the rich old lady, the adventuresome curiousity of young Pip, and most of all the intriguing presence of the girl Pip would be affected by for his whole life"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This novel, written by Charles Dickens, shows us that we cannot achieve happiness from money. It also teaches us that if we succumb to our desires we will end up losing in life. I recommend this beautifully written masterpiece to anyone who enjoys reading"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"After doing numerous analysing on the novel, I find Estella the least developed of all the main characters in the book. The chapters in which she apperas in are short; her actions are small and her speeches are simplistic. I find it a pity that Charles Dickens did not actually further develope Estella and based the entire story on Pip"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book is one of the most depressing novels I haveever read. Just about anything and everything goes wrongfor Pip and just about everyone in the story dies. It wasa good book, don't get me wrong, just a bit of a downer."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Hi! my name is Roy Chan and I am reading this when I'm in 7th grade. I decided to read Great Expectations because I thought it has a lot of excitement. When I read it, it turn out okey but when I'm in Chapter 6 it is boring and hard to understand. So I give it up. Maybe I don't understand this book because I am too young. Maybe I will read this book again in 9th grade."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I was forced to read Great Expectations because my Accelerated English teacher made us. I do not think the novel was very well thought out and was much too indecisive in many parts. Dickens did not seem to know really what he wanted to do with the plot. He even made two endings!!! He was much too descriptive and that made the story even more boring than its story line made it in the first place. I have heard that many people think this was his greatest book and that makes me wonder if they have read anything else by him because I do not think anyone could get much more boring!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Well I read this book with some great expectations and I shouldn't have. I figured that it was going to be a wonderful book because of the author (wrong) Ihad to strugle just to read 2 pages without getting sleepy. Altough I have great respect for Dickens and all of his accomplishments, I did NOT like this book !!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Last year as a Freshman in high school I was assiagned to read this book as a class project like many of the other critics who have already written their crities. Although I must admit that the book was in reality flat out boring and totaly lacking in point I would not recomend giving up on Dickens becuse of it. I can not with in any honesty recomend this book to anybody but I would eagerly recoment Dickens."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I had to read this for a high school summer reading list. It was the worst reading experience I ever had, and I love reading books. I cried several times trying to plug through the long-winded (obviously Dickens paid by the word) presentation. While some themes are mildly interesting, there were no scenes that captured my attention or held it for any period of time. This book might be great as an adult (which I'll gladly never know), but definitely not as a 16 year old. Sucks sucks sucks.Note to Teachers and Principals, please don't assign this to your high school students. There are so many better and more captivating books. This was the first book I ever read that truly took the joy out of reading for me."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This page tells me next to nothing about this product. When I try to find out anything at all about this audio version, I can't. I can't see the back of the package, which would tell me something, because when I click \\"see the back cover,\\" it gives me the Norton Critical version, which is NOT this product. The reviews also are of the paperback version, NOT this product. Please provide adequate product information. Who is the reader? Is there just one reader, or a cast? What else have the reader(s) done in their careers? Is this their first professional job? How is the audio quality? Etc."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I'm just starting to read it but I'm sure the novel will fulfill my \\"great expectations\\". But I have to complain about the physical book. The pages came incredibly badly cut and the cover was thorn and damaged, as if it had been used for over a decade!Besides, the introductory study gives a lot of details and hints about how the story is going to end and I hate that!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Put simply, Great Expectations is a wordy, convuluted, and overrated peice of trash. Written originally in different volumes and distributed to an excited Victorian republic, Dickens was able to make his audience care and feel for his odd, moving characters. He was the Stephen King of his day; a clever businessman who distributed mediocre books to the public. That Dicken's fever passed on from one generation to the next is fine, that this made Dicken's books classics in schools is a shame. But let me get to the actual book at hand! Yes, many characters in Great Expectations are original and interseting. Overall, however, Great Expectations is wordy (!), and painfully convoluted. It is often difficult to get through, and geared towards a certain audience only. This is not to say that everyone will dislike Great Expectations, but we live in an age (good or bad) of gritty realism. Authors like James Joyce and F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote with and still show a heavenly pen, Dicken's stories are what turns so many young people against reading. Anyone who wants to live in a former era, Great Expectations is a must; for anyone who wants a powerful, sophisticated read PLEASE put Great Expectations in the incinerator."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book was a large disappointment for me. I had seen the movie, and hoped that the book would be good. However, I was wrong. In fact, this book turned out to be one of the worst I have ever read. The book has too much description, not even important to the story. Dickens lost my interest in the book from the very first chapter, just a plain description of main character Pip's history of his family and town. This chapter drags on for too long, as does the rest of the book. As an example, the character Estella's rudeness towards Pip is repeated so often that it becomes annoying. I got the point of Estella's bringing up and lifestyle early on in the novel, and this did not have to be repeated so often. This book could very well have been interesting, but Dickens did not do a good job writing it. His continuous decscrptions of such landscapes as rivers and trees are irrelevant to the story, and caused me to drift away from it. I do not reccommend this book to anybody, and advise you to avoid it. I, as well as many other people I know, could not even finish this book. It brought no interest to me, and it is too long, considering that it contained nothing attention-grabbing and no excitement. However, if you do insist on reading this book, please just get the cliffnotes. It is not a book worth buying."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"when I read this book. Honestly, after I liked &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; I was expecting more from Dickens. Maybe Dickens wrote in the style of his time, which was to be very detailed, but it really doesn't translate well to today. I don't mind long books (I'm reading War and Peace now) but this book went into extreme detail about the most meaningless things.This story was essentially a Victorian soap opera. Theres all sorts of unknown parents, secret coniving, mysterious benefactors, and worst of all, many unrealistic characters. This book was so contrived and unnatural that I really don't see how it's attained &quot;classic&quot; status.If you don't mind meticulous attention being payed to the minutia, which is Dickens's style, then I'd recommend &quot;A Tale of Two Cities.&quot; If not, there are many other authors much better than Dickens that you can read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations was a mediocre book. I was not impressed. I had to read this book for my 9th grade honors English class. It was too long and boring. I see were Dickens was trying to go with the suspense, but it just made the book monotonous and boring. The uncanny coincidences just did not seem real. It's ok to use a coincidence as a tool of suspense, but this was just overkill. Every chapter was boring. I got tired pretty quickly of pip wishing he were with Estella for the whole book. Also, the book seemed to stray away from the main point for chapters at a time. Who cares about Wopsle's stupid plays? This could all be summed up in a couple of page short story. In conclusion, this is another swing and a miss for Dickens. STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS BOOK! If you want to read a good Dickens story, read \\"A Christmas Carol\\" and nothing else written by Charles Dickens."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I had to do this for school. I could hardly get through it. All they did was talk. It was long and boring. I HATED IT!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"The most boring book i've read in ages.

It is a required reading for English, mostly to show the difference between Flat and Round characters. Well it worked! Most of the characters in this book are flat! Ugh.I can't get over how the plotine doesn't even move normally. Its like when you want to drive somewhere and you hit a million and one detours. Eventually you'd say, \\"Screw it! Who needs food?\\" But nooo... Dickens just kept on driving around. I think only ONE subplot was actually straightforward, and that would be Miss Havisham and her ex lover.Basically, I got halfway through this book, then fled to Sparknotes. I wasn't going to read it. I was just going to make sure I knew enough to pass the test I had to take on the garbage.Ironically enough, those of us who used Sparknotes got better test grades than those who actually read the book. That say something about how much sense it made..."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book by far is the worst piece of shi--garbage I have ever laid my eyes on. The story has a skeleton, and a little bit of meat (and I like meat), but mostly, it's just fat. Especially the second stage of Pip's expectations, which finds Pip devoid of any characterizations beyond \\"I'm rich and you're not,\\" and \\"Oh, how I do love the lady Estella.\\" It's enough to make you vomit. Mr. Dickens should have made this a much shorter novel, or maybe even a short story. It still would have been boring, but maybe not as boring."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"A guy I work with read this book and it seemed like he was reading it for three years! Every day he sat there with his legs crossed sipping his tea and reading Great Expectations, spending about an hour on every page! What an aristocrat. It was brutal!Than I tried to read the book.I couldn't get past the first stage or the first part or whatever because it was so f*cking boring i thought my f*cking head was going to explode! NOTHING HAPPENED!That freak I work with didn't like it either.I'm just surprised he could read the whole thing without completely losing his mind."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"AAH! This book bored me to tears... literally. Thanks to Charles Dickens and his array of b****y women and the rest of the babbling morons, I never want to see that book again. It was thrown across the room many times in the course of my reading. Being forced to read that garbage didn't help much either. I don't understand why honor english students have to be tortured with his 500 pages of nothingness. I had to get the monarch notes to be able to understand it all! It made me feel like an idiot and maaaaaaybe if it was understandable and shorter.... it would actually be good. MAAAAAAAYBE!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I think Great Expectations was a very long, boring book that didn't have a plot. Dickens seemed to drag the story on and on. If the book wasn't as long, it might have been better. I heard somewhere that Dickens got paid by the word and that is was there's a lot of extra, stupid words in it. I also think that it was twisted because everyone was realted to each other."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"the book was boring, poopy, i didn't like it at all, had to read it for school, not a good time"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Dickens was actually a good writer, but he never could come up with a decent ending. His stories were well written, and the characters were interesting, especially in this book. This story follows the life of a young boy as he grows up and tries to make a place for himself in the world. He meets some interesting characters that, at times, get the better of him. He also falls in love with an unattainable woman. The story carries on without a climax, without a point, without resolution, and, ultimately, without an ending. It just abruptly stops. I think this was the best book I read by Dickens, which isn't saying much."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I thought that this was a pretty good book. In the beginning I wasn't sure if I would like it becuase it was kind of different but I continued reading it and I ended up enjoying it. Some of the parts in the story were kind of hard to read. There were so many characters to remember and to keep track of. One of the characters went by two different names so that got confusing. Another thing that got difficult while reading was the dialect that Dickens used while writing the book. I like the way Dickens wrote this book. He doesn't tell you about everything that is going on, so you have many questions about things and at the end everything is answered for you. It doesn't turn out how you would expect."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I found most of the book a good read. I was suprised by who Pip's benefactor was but that's what a good book is suppose to do. Intregue you, suprise you.... I didn't enjoy the ending though I thought with all that went on in the book that there would be a different approach to the ending."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I thought this book was a really good book. I liked it because it was very exciting and interesting. I thought it was difficult to read though because of all the characters in the story. I thought that there was way to many characters and there didn't need to be that many. Dickens also used a lot of long and hard words which I didn't understand that well. That made the story even harder to read. It was also very long and I think that Dickens could have taken some parts out. It got kind of boring during the middle of the book but at the end it was all worth reading. I think Dickens is a very good writer and I would like to read some more of his novels. He thinks of neat stories that no other author would think of. Overall, this was a very good book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I must confess that this was the first book I've read from Charles Dickens and did'nt liked it.I believed that he would describe more profoundly the rigid class difference in the british society of the end of XIX century."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book got to me fast and in great condition, and at a great price!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"The Great Expectation was a great book. I thought that it was a little hard to read. But I just read the part over that I didn't understand and I eventually understand it. Another thing that confused me is that Charles Dickens uses a lot of names for his characters. He should of just stuck to one name per character so that the readers wouldn't get confused. He also had some unrealistic plot in the story. Otherwise this was a great story how a boy becomes a gentleman and learns how to act. I would recommend you to read this book if you want to keep guessing."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"My daughter had to read this book for school and she said it was a great read. She is 14 and it was easy for her to understand and follow."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Like many other reviewers, I read this book because it is a requirement in many English classes. Although the plot becomes interesting at times, the majority of it is filler. The book is filled with pointless characters and chapters devoted to run-ons of Pip's thoughts.Because the book was written so long ago, it is also very difficult to connect with. The character relationships are annoying. The romance between Pip and Estella becomes very hard to believe, because Estella is not a likable person. And the dialect is very unbelievable. It is hard to picture someone using Joe's speech patterns, even in old English times.While there are probably many people who will enjoy this novel, I would not suggest this book to someone looking for a quick read (meaning high school students). It is very difficult to skim and requires alot of time to appreciate. If you have a lot of time on your hands and you enjoy long, character developing novels this book may be for you."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This was an interesting book. It is the first book by Charles Dickens that I had ever read. The language was weird but that was because it was a British novel written in a different era. I enjoyed it though because it was a escape to a different era and time. I plan on reading several other works by this author. It was slow to start but only because I was not used to the writing style or language. I would recommend."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"The setting of this book is in the Elizabethian era. Class, titles, and wealth is veryimportant around this time period and Dickens shows the importance in this great novel.Another theme of this novel is that not everyhting is as it seems.The story starts with Pip(Philip Pirrip) at the graveyard. He went to visit his dead parentswhen all of a sudden he was snatched by an escaped convict. The convict threatened Pipsaying that he will slit his throat if Pip did not bring food, a drink and a file. Pip did whathe was told and felt guilty for helping the convict out for many years after.He is asked to play at Satis House where he meets Miss Havisham and the beautifulEstella. Pip hoped that Miss Havishams intentions were to make his fortune, make him agentleman and have Estella to wed. He was wrong, instead Miss Havisham's intentionswere for Pip to fall in love with Estella and then have his heart broken.After this dissapointment, Pip hears news that an anonymous benefactor wants to makePip a gentleman and give him a fortune. Pip believed that the anonymous benefactor wasMiss Havisham but instead it was the escaped convict that Pip helped when he was ayoung boy. It gets even more interesting when Pip finds out that Estella is the daughter ofthe escaped convict.This novel comes with interesting twists and great themes that can have a reader thinking,\\" whats going to happen next?\\" I recommend this novel to any reader who likes a greatstory."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"The reason I choose to write this review is quite simple: to tell of a great book that gets better every time you read it. The compelling twists of &quot;Great Expectations&quot; are very involved and makes for a book that not only comes off extremely in depth but also entertaining. I first read this book and high school and have since read it twice more. It seems the more knowledge I have gained the more I take out of each segment of this book as it is more closely tied into my real life.Simply put this is Dickens masterpiece and that should not be overlooked as many of his books were of extreme quality."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I liked the book Great Expectations, I thought it was very interesting to read. When I first found out that we ha to read it I didn't think i would like it at all but I did, once I got into the book.I thought it was hard to read. Sometimes I didn't get it but othere times I did and did think Charles Dickens made it easy to understand. I don't think he should have written so many characters becasue I lost track of who was who and where they were at. He should have written more to the ending, like what happend to Pip and Estella.I did like when Pip started realizing that just because you have money dosen't mean you can be mean to people like Joe and Biddy and everyone else that do't have as much as he does. I liked how toward the ending everything kind of came togeter; that's whenI really understood who was who. I really liked how all the characters were sonnected in some way like Magwitch, Estella, And Molly. Also Compeyson and Miss. Havisham."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is one of Dickens's better known classics, though not his best. The theme is worthy enough of study, though, and the reading is enjoyable. Recommended."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations is one of Dickens less &quot;weighty&quot; novels. It is slow-moving and at sometimes tedious to read. While the setting and characters are developed well enough to draw you in to the story, the plot is quite unbelievable and the book sometimes tedious at times.The story is about Pip, a young working class boy who comes into great wealth because of a mysterious benefactor. He abandons his good old friends Joe and Biddy to follow his heart towards Ms. Havisham and her cruel daughter Estella. Also dragging along with him are Hubert, his friend and confidant, Magwitch, a filthy convict, Mr. Wopsle, a bad Shakespearean actor, Mr. Jaggers, a vindictive lawyer, Mr. Wemmick- Jagger's more amiable assistant, Molly, a servant with a mysterious past, and Old Orlick, whom you'll know all about at the end of the book.After my first go through, I gave this book a second chance to grow on me and read it again, but it didn't. Unless you are absolutely OBSESSED with Dickens,you are required to read it for a class, and/or you don't have anything to do over a weekend, then don't bother reading this book"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I found this book hard to read and hard to comprehend. The book is about a boy named Pip and his rise from lowly to gentlemanly status. Along the way, he manages to alienate his friends and he learns some valuable lessons about friendship in the end. The way the sentences are written and structured made it difficult for me to understand everything that was going on. Many of the sentences would be considered run-on today."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Dickens tells his story through the consequences of several secret, unsolicited acts of kindness. The consequences of these acts varies greatly. Dickens seems to be unconcerned with passing judgement on the acts themselves, instead he prefers to humor himself by exploring of their unpredictable outcomes."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"What can be said of Dickens, that hadn't been said before.

I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking to explore a well written piece of classic literature."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I have just, on Christmas Eve, given myself the gift of hearing this beautiful, classic Charles Dickens taleGreat Expectationsperformed by the master narrator, Simon Prebble. As all of Dickens' tales do, this provides a look at life for the ordinary man in that time and place, England in the 19th century. It is also a parable about the worth of people as judged by their wealth, status and power vs. their character and more. It is filled with wonderful character studies that only Dickens could do: Miss Haversham, stunted and destroyed by her bitterness, in turn doing great damage to the beautiful, cold Estella. The star of the novel, the orphaned Pip, raised by his shrewish and abusive sister and her wonderful, loving and simple husband Joe, the friends Pip makes, etc. Mr. Prebble reads this great novel as no one else can. He brings the characters to life so I could feel their emotions. All of the characters had unique voices and suitable accents that matched them perfectly. I was particularly moved by his portrayal of Joe. By the way, Mr. Prebble's beautiful, very masculine voice does the female characters believably. One does not even think about it. Thank you, Mr. Prebble, for narrating this novel and providing me with the best Christmas I've had for a while."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I loved it! In fact I remember reading Great Expectations during a 7th grade English class and getting in trouble for not paying attention to what was being taught. I came to this book on my own, as opposed to being made to read it, and while the lenth and the language was challenging for the first few pages, I remember falling head over heels in love with Dickens' style. This was the first time I felt myself get lost in a book. I've read it several times since in the last 14 years and I get lost in Pip's world every time!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Yes, the prose is overlong. Yes, the English language has evolved since Dickens' day, so you'll be using the dictionary feature on your Kindle often. But Great Expectations transcends time to bring a very relatable story to modern readers. The mystery deepens at every turn, the characters develop more fully and, if you open your mind and relax, the book's a downright page-turner (or page-clicker, for Kindlers).I tried reading this classic when I was younger and less patient, but it took a 40+-year-old me to 'get' it. Perhaps young people need to experience life and the lessons we all learn to really appreciate Great Expectations. Perhaps they relate a little too much with the freshly made gentleman and don't really understand why he castigates himself for his behavior. Or perhaps they're just not patient enough to 'zen out' and enjoy the book for what it is. Whatever the reason, I sincerely hope the young people who hate this book today, will pick it up again when they're more 'seasoned' - then they might just understand why it's a classic.If this review gave you information that was helpful, please feel free to click the YES button below!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great & free down load to PC Kindle product; yes, Kindle has a free software download so that you can read their books on your PC too.

The cover was rubbing off by the time it arrived to me, in a padded box. However the print on the cover is made, it is done very shoddily and couldn't handle being on a shelf, much less being read. I am very unhappy indeed. Phooey on whoever came up with this."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I was greatly disappointed with the way this classic story was printed. The typing errors throughout the book ie.words that all ran into each other, and even pages of the story missing, made what should have been a pleasant read into a chore to finish it.I had looked forward to re-reading all the old school classics on my new Kindle but if the conversion of the old publications to e-readers are of the same standard, then I will not want to do so.I fear that \\"Oliver will not be asking for more\\" unless the recipe is improved.I have rated it only one star ,not because of Dickens Story but because it was spoiled for me by it's typing."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I am no english literature purist by any stretch of the imagination but I did have high hopes for this book.The characters are realistic to the period but the story is very slow. The first half of the book is little better than boring. It picks up through the second half but finishes rather disappointingly.This book was purchased after a book club suggested it was Dickens' greatest work. Having read David Copperfield a number of years ago I would have to disagree.I am glad I read the book even if the only thing I got out of it was to be able to relate to it when others are discussing it."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great novel to stand the time.

However, I just tested the Amazon functions using it without actual reading."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I have read Great Expectations more than 2 times. I have listened to it also on Audio CD more than a few times. I occasionally just listen to any randomly selected track(s) at any randomly selected part of the story in it's unabridged version.I was excited to hear it in an abridged version and with several persons portraying the various characters.As much as I love the unabridged reading of the story; I was quite pleased with the acting out of the story in this radio-presentation-like recreation of Great Expectations.It was refreshing that Pip's dialogue was a faithful recreation of the actual text due to him being the character telling the story; so the Dickens' wonderful wordsmithing was not lost.It is a great story for all ages, to listen and learn to love; and I hope for their sake, to encourage them to read the story in its entirety."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I bought this book on Amazon about a year or so ago & just was really turned off by how much writing they cramed into even one page & the font is pretty small, it turned me off to the point that I never did even read the book, to those that did, hope it was good."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"A great reading but the sixteen discs are not labeled as to chapters on the disc nor are there any liner notes.

I BOUGHT IT FOR MY CHILD TO READ OVER THE SUMMER AND IT BOUGHT BACK SO MANY MEMORIES. I'M GLAD WE HAVE A COPY TO KEEP AROUND THE HOUSE."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I cannot fathom how this novel only has a rating of 3 stars. It is an exceptional book that well demonstrates the genius of Charles Dickens. Not only does it have suspense and charm of romance and adventure, but it delivers thematically a look at the hypocracy of wealth in Elizabethan England, and a philosophical perspective on the meaning of happiness. In the end of course there is the climax with every bizarre plot twist imaginable. It is true, this is not necessarily a happy one: Pip gains happiness at the end only by learning by immense misfortune to himself and others, and by having his &quot;expectations&quot; crash down upon him, nearly destroying his future. Yet, this novel is an essential read for anyone, no matter how old or young because it still retains its meaning as freshly today as it did when it was written. It's only unfortunate that it's wasted on all of these people who don't bother to take the time to actually to try and comprehend what they're reading and who have consequently made such poor reviews."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I'm here referring to the Oxford World's Classics edition, published in 1999. Firstly, I love the book itself. It's compact, the pages have a soft, easy feel to them, and the print is a welcome size: smaller but very readable. A+ here.The characters are particular and animate. Through the use of his famously detailed characterization and description, Dickens creates an elaborate colorful neighborhood of which you feel part. A+ for this escapism and for the sheer pleasure it brings. I especially admire his keen sense of the droll. However, while the tale runs well through the first half or so, as it progresses -- did you find so also? -- it loses the intact sympathies of the reader by trying to connect all the dots that its intricate plot has spun out into. It's forever tying its own shoes. I was similarly disappointment in the final denouement of Estella and Pip, as a let down and overly cerebral. (B-) But I highly recommend this book as a good Dickens novel, and on its own terms, a great one.A very fun read!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations, a book that Dickens ironically considered as one of his \\"little pieces.\\" Though it is small compared to other works by Dickens, what this novel lacks in size it makes up for in quality. Great Expectations succeeds beyond almost all novels of its time in exploring the roots of character and moral behaviour. Charles Dickens makes the case for there being the potential for good and evil within everyone. Evil and sin follow from a combination of being self-absorbed and selfish. What is remarkable about the way these themes are handled is that they are clearly based on an assessment of human psychology, long before that field was established. The book is also remarkable for its many indelibly memorable and complex characters. Miss Havisham, Pip, Magwitch, Mr. Jaggers, and Estella are certainly some of the most complex characters ever created by Dickens.Though a novel founded on philosophic concepts, the story is full of action to keep the plot moving. An escaped convict, an attempted murder, and a mysterious benefactor all add to the sense of mystery that exists throughout most of the novel and forces the reader to continue. Murder, deceit, jealously, and revenge also help to hold the attention of the reader while Dickens explores the depths of human nature.As you read Great Expectations, raise your expectations (sorry, I couldn't help myself) to assume that you will receive answers to any dangling thread. Every detail is important, if not to solve the mysteries of the characters then only to enhance the \\"sense of place.\\" Although the England described here is long gone, it becomes as immediate as a nightmare or a dream that you have just awakened from.This story by Dickens is a must-read and deserves five-stars."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"The great English master is at his best in &quot;Great Expectations.&quot; This is a story about loyalty, trust, and, this being Dickens, dark overtones of the human nature. One should not expect something for nothing, that is what this novel makes perfectly clear. Pip, who is the central figure of the novel, a good-natured boy growing up into adulthood, expects to be continously favored by fotrune and his mysterious benefactor who, he thinks, is acting out of the goodness of her heart. Along the way he meets a cast of character who represent the entire range of human nature: devotion, strength, treachery, level-headedness, and brutality.&quot;Great Expectation&quot; is a classic because of its relentless exposure of truth about the human condition--the condition in which decency and sanity are maintained at a high price, and innocence not at all."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I imagine many of the negative ratings are from high school students forced to read the classics, and this book is one of those undisputed classics. Why else would every student I've talked to have had to read this book? Me included.I must confess I didn't like it in high school. Dickens does have a way of writing elegant sentences conjoined by semicolons. A great editor would have told him frequent use of periods is acceptable.However, eight years later, while frustrated at my illiteracy in Japan, I was starved for great literature in English. I had gone through a couple of contemporary literature that always left me vaguely dissatisfied. I started reading my favorite author Jane Austen again, and picked up Great Expectations on a whim. What a difference those eight years made!!No one can touch Dickens ability to evoke an atmosphere. I felt I was right there with Pip in the foggy marshes, shivering before a menacing Magwitch. Or sitting around the fire of a small but cozy house while Joe was smoking his pipe and passing along nuggets of his own brand of wisdom. Or creeped out in Mrs. Havisham's mausoleum of a mansion.In addition, the dialogue is so authentic you feel as if you're eavesdropping on people's conversations. Joe's working class speech, Mrs. Havisham's upper class diction, the lawyer's dry speech all ring so true.Ultimately, the story itself is so carefully constructed, even after countless rereadings, the clues in this mystery of who Pip's benefactor is are barely perceptible. And Dickens' themes of human pride, ultimate humility, willfulness of character that only later realizes the consequences, and the six degrees of separation are priceless. Dickens' championing of the working class pervades all his books, but in this one his affection for the working man is more personal. You really can't help but love Joe and his bungling dignity.Yes, Dickens can border on the excessively dramatic. But most of the time this drama works to pull you into a touching tale."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Having seen the many reviews written by students, I must say that I would agree. In fact, they sounded like they could have almost been my students from the past. Overall, GE is well liked, but the major complaint most have is that the story line is too slow-developing. I think this is a fair assessment. Of course, this was the style chosen by Dickens since this book was compiled from serial form. How many people would claim that we ought to take a week's worth of a soap opera program and turn it into a movie? I doubt such a production would attract much attention. In the same way, a serial writer's objective was to build mini-climaxes throughout the book, twisting and turning to get the audience to scream with anticipation, so that the next segment would sell. From what I understand, Americans could hardly wait for the shipments to get off the ships. They would purchase the newest segment and immediately dig in!If you are a teacher, I highly recommend showing the 4-hour movie starring Anthony Hopkins (produced in the late 1980s, I believe). It is the best and most accurate of all the GE movies. This works really well in conjunction with the book, and it truly helps in the interest level for those students who are not as motivated as &quot;the readers.&quot; So go ahead and find out about the adventures of squeezable Pip, lovable Joe, the mysterious Miss Havisham, sweet Biddy, snooty Estella, and of course the mysterious Magwitch. I think you will be as surprised as I was when I first read it.

I must admit that it is a tad wordy and the details are overwhelming, but that just adds character to the book. My favorite characters were Estella, Biddy, and of course, Pip. Many poeple my age (I am 15) have said that this book was a long and boring ramble. I thought it to be exciting and very funny. I especially enjoy the part where Joe visits Pip in London and he has no place to put his hat, so he puts it on the mantle. During their meal, Joe's hat keeps falling, and Joe keeps picking it up. Finally, Pip gets so annoyed, he throws the hat across the room!

As his horizon suddenly expands with an unexpected fortune, Pip finds his own path crossed with the paths of a misanthropic Miss Havisham and her young, beautiful, yet seductive ward Estella. Extravagance feeds Pip's vanity to burgeon, desire flourishes his motives of becoming some one he can never become. Pip strives desperately to extricate from the deepest root of his whole being. And the obsession grows for Estella as he wanders of further away from his true path.Followed by the death of Magwitch, love once again awakes within Pip as he embraces the man hidden in the darkest corner of his soul.

Charles Dickens, develops a plot that portrays true life in the 19th century. Pip undergoes several events that reveal the true motives of life, the happiness in true love and the curse of wealth.The audience can easily relate to the overall theme of Great Expectations, the familiarity of the sycophant, ambitous characters enable the reader to apply the concepts to their own life.

As a kid, we had this book on our Literature List and every time we had to write down the answers of Literature tales, it was rather strenuous and boring as this meant to be a part of education. However, when it came to conduct a teaching class in literature, Great Expectation turned out to be an adventure. Unlike Oliver Twist and David Copperfield, Pip is not really a hero and also it does not end a Happy ending but Pip is being stripped of his wealth and his position in society. Pip is sent to London to be educated as a gentleman, he is impressed by the wrong people for the wrong reasons. He neglects and abandons the honest, hardworking folk who care for him and his pride is hurt when he learns who his mysterious benefactor is. Pip express guilt for his behavior who have a violent nature and crude ways but altogether he is courageous too. Pip, his father surname being Pirrip and his Christian name Philip, that's how he is called \`Pip' , has a fascination for Estella but is brought up by Miss Havisham to wreck revenge on all male sex and break hearts. Herbert Pocket is a character who has frankness was amiable and cheerful who became a friend of Pip. Dicken's novels have a central theme \`rags-to-riches' tale of a poor, underprivileged boy who is finally accepted into society. Strangely, this one has a different end. A nice read and great pick for Classroom Literature workshop."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"When i first red the book in the highschool i've looked through like Pip. But after some years, when i'm reading it again, now i can see it like Dickens do... It's a novel that anybody can selfexplain on any time of his life. If not, he's very lucky..."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"It's a shame that most people resign this book to their \\"having already been read\\" list as a result of this novel being assigned coursework in junior high or high school. Dickens was a master of depicting subtleties of human relationships and personalities. Great Expectations illustrates this gloriously. Whatever can be said of Pip, is that he is abashedly a hopelessly human character. I sincerely can't imagine a young reader to identify with the maturity of these character's substantive familiarities with one another. Please don't write this book off, because you feel as if you already know the plot line and story because you read it young, I guarantee, read as an adult, this celebrated novel will take on a whole new light when you have been out in the world and experienced the complexities of the human condition."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I respect the point of view of the reader who said that he/she can't add much to the opinion of countless generations who read this classic for the past 150 years. Classics last this long because they're masterpieces, and hence this work deserves five stars.The only thing to add in my point of view, is that I won't be surprised to learn that Dickens wrote this story especially for school boys who are really struggling to identify themselves and determine what is really important in life. No wonder this is one of the most required readings in middle school. In other words, adults won't find in it a mature story like the one in Steinbeck's East of Eden, or the taboo-sex theme of Nabokov's Lolita. This is about a young boy who goes on a long journey and ends up finding himself and realizing what really gives him happiness in life.As for the ending, there are two endings; published and unpublished, and I like the published more. Don't read further for I will give the ending away, unless you've read it already, but in the last paragraph Pip says that the mist of the evening when he held hands with Estella reminds him with the morning mist when he left the forge. The way I see it is that Estella will go through the same journey that Pip went through when he left the forge and went to London, the journey that was initiated by Estella's father and that helped Pip to be a better man. Now Estella will go through a journey initiated and guided by Pip in order to make Estella a better woman. Magwitch hurt Pip in the beginning but Pip helped him so Magwitch gave him all his money. The money was gone but was left was more important than money: The journey and experience that made Pip a better man. Estella was mean to Pip, but Pip loved her, and destiny put them both on a crossroads at the end of the novel, but because Pip loves Estella and because she is Magwitch's daughter, Pip decided to walk with her in a journey that will make her a better woman.Magwitch and Estella, father and daughter, never met. But there was a link between them; Pip, who became a better man because of the father, and who will now pay him back by making his daughter a better woman. Great Expectations is about the magical and ironic links between people, and how the person who you think hurt you the most may end up to be the person who helped you the most. The fact that an evil man is not as evil as he seems, and a pure man is not as pure as he seems.And these are just few of the many other themes in this classic. So the bottom line is, this novel may be more meaningful to the middle school son than to the forty something father. Read it early before you get older!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Victorian society got a good spanking when Great Expectations was published, at the time Dickens's anger and frustration was at one of its highest points. Pip, the novel's protagonist - I hesitate to call him the hero - is at once likeable and recognizable as a powerful symbolic tool, though the former quality intentionally decreases as the novel progresses.Pip is joined by a cast of the most memorable characters in literature - the cold, ethereal Estella, the crazy, wounded Miss Havisham, loveable dullard Joe, whip-smart lawyer Jaggers - the list could, and possibly might, go on for pages. If there were literary awards for Best Ensemble, the characters in Great Expectations would clinch them all. The characters function as both political/social symbols and, though they exist in a time period far removed from us, identifiable and memorable figureheads that will - and should - be a literary hallmark forever."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I first read this about 12 years ago as a teenager in High School of course at the time I could not possibly comprehend everything that is going on. On a whim I decided to reread this novel and am very happy that I did, Pip, Joe, Estella, Mrs Havisham all these charecters are so colorful and well written it amazes me. This novel covers a diverse collection of human emotions such as love, friendship, loyalty, shame, and forgiveness. If the only time you read this it was mandatory reading for freshman english do yourself a favor and pick it up again and reread it I found it very worthwhile."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Many reviewers have called this Dickens' greatest novel. One reviewer says it was the first time a character's feeling had been explored in such detail. These things I cannot comment on - this is the first Dickens novel I ever read, and I am not familiar with other works of this period. I can say that it was a damn fine read though.I must admit, maybe it was a convention of the time, but there were a great many impossible coincidences in this story. The term &quot;soap opera&quot; even crossed my mind at one point. In the end I forgave these improbable coincidences because the story was so compelling, and the novel so old, and the author of legendary repute.I loved the saint-like character Joe. I think he was my favorite character. And Dickens does a masterful job of showing the friendship between Pip - the protaganist - and Joe and especially Herbert. Miss Havisham is the picture of the bizarre rich recluse. And Estella the epitome of the cold-hearted shrew. All of the characters are rich.And it is true, as many other reviewers have commented, that so many issues are explored in this work. The meaning of true love, genuine friendship, the implications of &quot;moving up&quot; and it's effects on family and friends, good fortune, redemption, etc. It's all there - life is there.The book was slow at certain parts, but most of the time I found myself eagerly turning the pages. Dickens is a master at compelling his reader to turn the pages. What will happen next? At some of the titanic coincidences and plot turns I found myself thinking, &quot;what?! You've got to be kidding me...&quot; and then begging for more. I think you will too.There are some deeply heartfelt moments. Deeply heartfelt, touching, that inspired warm feelings in me. It was a pleasant change of pace from the darker, more cynical literature of today (though there are evil people and violent actions in Great Expectations as well). The final lesson of redemption is truly heartwarming."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is my favorite book. I've read it at least 6 times, and it is still a wonderful story. Dickens makes you feel what little Pip feels on the unexpectedly interesting journey of his life. From his childhood encounter with an escaped convict to a mysterious rise to riches and fame later in life, I am completely immersed in his story. The tale of his love for a girl named Estella who, not only will never love him, but emotionally tortures him every day of his life is heartbreaking yet somehow familiar. There are subtle lessons to be learned from this book. If you haven't already read it, you should."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"&quot;Great Expectations&quot; is Charles Dickens classic novels that portrays the story of Pip, born into a destitute and poor family, with little hope for a bright future. We would expect someone born into his social class to remain in this position forever, without much hope for improvements. However, Pip surprises us when he has a chance encounter with Miss Havisham, an old, grumpy, widow. She's obviously delirous, upset at men who have crossed her, and does take out some of her anger at poor Pip. But yet Pip is lucky behind his wildest dreams, for he is about to meet the beautiful Estella, and while this may appear normal, it is definitely not. And this is what makes &quot;Great Expectations&quot; a classic: the book is about Cinderella from reverse: it is the man, in this particular instance, who moves from working-class peasant to meeting an upper-class elegant lady who is beautiful beyong Pip's dreams.It is an aspiring tale in that it tells the reader that they, too, may be able to have widespread class mobility. They are not stuck in their present circumstances and may indeed exceed their own expectations.-- Michael GordonLos Angeles"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"First of all, I too am a student forced to read this book for a Freshman Honors English class, and I fail to see how many people can call this book a waste of time. Sure, I know the language is a bit of a challenge, but that's what a dictionary is for!Anyway, I haven't yet finished the book (I still have a long way to go,) for I'm only on chapter 13, but I had to chime in and counterattack what all of the rest of the whiney students have said. So far, the way Dickens portrays his characters (by means of language, description, and dialogue) seems ultimately realistic (it should be, considering it was written in the 1830's) and there are many things throughout the book one has to come to love: Pip's almighty guilty conscience, the friendship bond between Pip and Joe, etc.I can't sum up everything, for as I've said, I'm not finished yet, but for those of you who are being forced to read it, read it with an open mind.

One of only two of Dickens's novels that are written in first person narrative (the other being David Copperfield), Great Expectations is a fascinating tale of ambition, love, regret, missed chances and redemption, topped off with an adequately ambiguous ending (more on that later).Raised by his tyrannical sister and her kind, doting husband Joe, Pip is contented enough to become a blacksmith and live out his life by the misty Kent marshlands. That is until he is unexpectedly thrown into the path of two extraordinary people. The first is a convict, escaped from the prison barges offshore, a terrifying man who coerces the young Pip into stealing him some supplies from his sister's larder. Stricken by guilt and terror, Pip complies. The second is the mysterious Miss Havisham, a spinster woman who employs Pip as a playmate for her young ward, the beautiful Estella. Estella is regal, snobbish and cold - naturally, Pip falls head over heels in love with her, despite the realization that she's far beyond his status. Wretchedly aware of his own shortcomings, Pip yearns for a chance to make a gentleman of himself, and win the hand of fair Estella.And then, just as unexpectedly, fortune is thrown his way. He is informed by Miss Havisham's lawyer that a secret benefactor has endowed him with great expectations, and that he is to travel to London in order to prepare for his future. The only catch is that Pip is forbidden from investigating the origins of his newfound fortune, although logic dictates that it must be Miss Havisham, who surely has designs for both Pip and Estella. Locked up in a house full of bitter memories after she was jilted by her lover, Miss Havisham is certainly one of Dickens's most famous creations, with her own disturbing brand of revenge against mankind: to unleash her prot&eacute;g&eacute;e Estella out upon the world, to break hearts wherever she goes.Dickens has created a twisty and labyrinthine plot, with plenty of intrigue and adventure throughout, as familial bonds, secret alliances and loyalty among friends and work colleges are tried and tested. In typical Dickensian style, there are several extraordinary coincidences concerning shrouded parentage and wayward meetings, but everything hangs so well together that it's instantly forgivable. \\"Great Expectations\\" is Dickens at his best in terms of plotting and characterization; though there is a melancholy twinge throughout that no doubt stems from Dickens's personal trouble (he had recently divorced his wife, and has carrying on a stress-filled love affair with a young actress). As such, romanticized domestic bliss that so often concludes a Dickens's novel (reflective of Dickens's own longing for such a state) is completely absent here. The domestic angel-woman that is given so many names and forms throughout the canon of Dickens novels (here called Biddy, though she is virtually identical to dozens of other Dickens heroines) comes to a surprising end in \\"Great Expectations\\", as does Pip himself.Pip himself is certainly an interesting character; in that he is woefully aware of his own shortcomings, yet unable drop certain attitudes that make him miserable. After becoming accustomed to the life at Miss Havisham's manor house, he is frustrated to find that he now holds his beloved brother-in-law Joe in contempt, embarrassed at his low breeding and lack of gentlemanly manners (despite the fact that Joe was always his staunch ally against Pip's terrible sister, and the epitome of the virtuous commoner). Likewise is Pip's self acknowledgment that his love for Estella never brings him any happiness, only pain and longing. The fact that Pip is narrating his own story from a point in time *beyond* the proceedings mean that we are never overly critical of Pip, considering he is his own harshest critic when relating his behaviour - and it certainly makes you consider your own shortcomings.This is not to say that the whole story is woe and misery, as there are plenty of comedic characters that help lighten the mood, such as Pip's best friend Herbert Pocket, who (at their first meeting) challenges him to a fight, and Mr Wemmick, who survives his job by assuming two personalities: a grim and dour one during working hours, and a cheerful one when he returns home. There are several moments of humour in Pip himself, (though they are usually tempered by a sense of disappointment or miscommunication) such as his misreading of his parent's gravestone, or his excitement in reaching London gradually dissipating when he realizes that...well, that it's a bit of a hole.Last of all, there has already been several mentions in other reviewers about the fact that there are two endings to this novel; the first was considered too melancholy by Dickens's publishers, and so was revised (although to be fair, Dickens's himself didn't seem to put up too much of a fight, suggesting that he himself was divided on the issue). The published ending is still ambiguous, yet with room for hope (at least in the mind of Pip) as to the future with Estella. Now, most agree that the original ending is more powerful, and I have to agree. However, I do issue a warning *not* to read both endings in the same sitting. In my edition the original ending was added in an appendix directly after the conclusion to the book, and because it is so drastically different to the published ending, it disrupted my appreciation of the novel. I was left in two minds as to what truly happened. So if you're a serious reader, do yourself a favour and decide what ending you want to go with *before* you finish the book. It may be a tricky business, but it'll enhance your enjoyment of one of Dickens's best novels."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Dickens' ability to turn a beautiful phrase is done complete justice by Michael Page. He delivers all that Dickens intends for you to find in Great Expectations, as though he was Pip's shadow for those many years described in the story. This CD set is worth listening to; I looked for chances to get in the car and continue the story."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"When his magazine, All the Year Round, began failing due to an unpopular serial, Dickens was forced to begin publishing installments of a story of his own. The resulting work, Great Expectations, was published weekly from December 1, 1860 to August 3, 1861. This was his second semi-autobiographical work, but where David Copperfield was a confident expression of faith in middle class values, Great Expectations offers a bleaker view of whether those values will lead to happiness. In fact, Dickens own marriage had just come to an end after many unhappy years. Indeed he had recently changed the name of the magazine from the more bucolic Household Words. Despite, or because, of this ambivalence, Great Expectations became one of his greatest achievements.Pip, a boy of the marshes, is being &quot;raised by hand&quot; by his shrieking harridan of an older sister and her seemingly doltish husband, the blacksmith Joe Gargery. One day, while visiting his parents' gravesite, Pip is accosted by an escaped convict who demands that he bring him a file and some &quot;wittles&quot;. When the convict, Abel Magwitch, is later captured, he accepts the blame for stealing the file and food before being carted back to prison.Shortly thereafter, Pip is invited up to Miss Havisham's manor house to play with her beautiful ward Estella. Miss Havisham's life came to a halt when she was jilted at the altar, all clocks are stopped at the hour of her betrayal, the feast lies rotting on tables &amp; she wanders about in the decaying wedding gown. Estella is to be the instrument of her revenge upon men.Eventually, &quot;Great Expectations&quot; are settled upon Pip when a secret benefactor sets up a trust in his name and sends him to London to be educated and become a gentleman. Pip assumes, and Havisham allows him to believe, that she is his benefactress and that he is being elevated to a position that will make him worthy of Estella.As Pip rises in society, he leaves Joe behind, despite the many kindnesses Joe had shown him growing up. He becomes a shallow arrogant middle class climber. So he is stunned when he discovers that he is actually benefiting from the secret wealth of Magwitch, who made a fortune in Australia after being transported. Moreover, Magwitch's unlawful return to England puts him and Pip in danger. Meanwhile, Estella has married another, a horrible man who Pip despises. Eventually, with Magwitch's recapture and death in prison and with his fortune gone, Pip ends up in debtors prison, but Joe redeems his debts and brings him home. Pip realizes that Magwitch was a more devoted friend to him than he ever was to Joe and with this realization Pip becomes, finally, a whole and decent human being.Originally, Dickens wrote a conclusion that made it clear that Pip and Estella will never be together, that Estella is finally too devoid of heart to love. But at the urging of others, he changed the ending and left it more open ended, with the possibility that Estella too has learned and grown from her experiences and her wretched marriages.This is the work of a mature novelist at the height of his powers. It has everything you could ask for in a novel: central characters who actually change and grow over the course of the story, becoming better people in the end; a plot laden with mystery and irony; amusing secondary characters; you name it, it's in here. I would rank it with A Tale of Two Cities, Oliver Twist and David Copperfield among the very best novels of the worlds greatest novelist.GRADE: A+"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I listened to the unabridged audio tape version of this book narrated by Michael Page. It's one of those deals where you listen to each tape entirely on the left channel, then play the whole tape again on the right channel to get the next part of the story. Which is kind of awkward, since you forget which channel you were on if you also use your stereo for music; but these editions are probably the least expensive (by the hour) audio tapes you can buy.I think Dickens' tendency toward exhaustive descriptions works a lot better when you're listening to it in the car than when you're reading it in print. I might never have had the patience to read the actual book while sitting in a chair, but listening to it in the car was pretty entertaining. Colorful characters, humor, suspense, unexpected plot twists; I can picture a lot of it in my mind even now.

This edition has the 1986 introduction by John Irving. It contains the Dickens classic in its intact form, with the original ending following it separately. It is 528 pages.When Dickens first wrote Great Expectations, it had a different ending. There are some who feel that the original ending is more in line with modern tastes, and that Dickens \\"caved in\\" by changing the unhappy ending to one that was \\"more acceptable.\\" Some feel that Dickens went too far in order to cater to his audience rather than stick to a literary standard. In the introduction, Irving discusses this issue among many others and suggests that Dickens was not so much driven by the audience as he was in touch with their lives when it came to inspiration. Ideas in literature may seem fantastic and improbable, but Irving points to events in Dickens's life that would seem equally improbable had they appeared in fiction. He also mentions modern real life events that, if put in a novel a decade earlier, would have seemed impossibly unrealistic.Yes, Dickens was an optimist. But the new ending is not a \\"happily ever after\\" one so much as one that leaves the door open.

The narrator, who is also the main character, addresses you directly and colours the whole story with his own amiable personality. Indeed, one can imagine that the novel, published in instalments in that long bygone era before radio, television and other non-printed media, was conceived to be read out loud in the family parlour.The characters are straightforward, captivating and likeable. Totally removed from any realistic complexity, they are all the more memorable: nave, honest Pip; distant, cold, condescending Estella; devoted, loyal, simple-minded Joe; mysterious, ethereal Miss Havisham; etc.The plot, convoluted, wholly implausible and a tad predictable, evokes harsher but so much simpler times.

I received all 3 books quickly and in excellent condition."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Dickens was part of a great humanistic effort, of the 1800s, that more than ever evoked and espoused the Christian principles of human respect for one another. Great Expectations is about the unexplicable evil youth encounters and how one should rise above the hate and vindictiveness of stupid, petty people. It is a book that explains that there is great suffering in the world and there are those that will hate you for no other reason than that you look the way you do, or simply for the fact you exist in the form you are, or have the ancestors you have. And this hate may never be fully exposed, but be there none-the-less, lingering in mysterious shadow and never seen. An honest read of this book by my ninth graders allowed some, who felt anger and self-pity in the form of vengful hate, to rise a little out of their cycle of dispare. The greatest revenge, some say, against your oppressor is to live happily. The book shows how a vengeful heart is so self mutilating and unfulfilling. Great Expectations runs the coarse of someone who managed to forgive. It is a moving book and one that gives inner strength and respectful grace and recognition to the divine in all of us. It is better to not get bogged down in a discussion of Dicken's personal life, which is a mixed bag, but just read the book. Why would ultra feminists hate this book? Because they hate. Hateful people will hate a book that so poignantly exposes these wreched people for what they are. The book also shows, most significantly, and contrary to much of the belief of the time, that bad people can reform and become good. The significance of this, and its effect that Dicken's made upon this notion, is as haunting and deep a goodness as the evil Mrs. Havisham placed in Stela's soul."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great expectations is a very good book. It has action and a meaning. The book starts off by pip, which is a young orphan boy, going to a graveyard to look at his parent's tombstone. Then a escape convict grabs pip and tells him to bring him food and a file for his chains. The next day pip brings the man what he wants and then police capture the man but he protects pip and says he stole the food because he is touched by pips kindness. Then one-day pip is taken to the satis house, the home of miss Havisham, pip meets a beautiful young girl named Estella and falls in love with her. One-day Jaggers who is a lawyer tells pip that he has received a great fortune from a secret benefactor. The man tells pip he must go to London immediately to start his education as a gentleman. Pip thinks miss Havisham has given him the fortune. When pip is in London he finds new friends and begins to treat his old friends coldly, especially Joe. Several years later a familiar face comes in to pips room it is the convict, Magwitch. He then tells pip that he is pips benefactor. Pip then agrees to help him escape London. Compeyson is pursuing Magwitch and pip later finds out that Compeyson is the one who left miss Havisham on the alter and that Estella is Magwitch's daughter. Pip begins to care for the convict but later Pip hears that Estella has married another man. When Pip goes to visit miss Havisham she catches on fire and is burned badly. During the escape attempt Pip and Magwitch are capture by police. Magwitch is sentenced to death and Pip loses his fortune. He gets back together with Joe and later ends up marrying Estella and living happily ever after. I think that the author of this book could have made this book in 3rd person instead of 1st and it could have made it better. I think that this book was well writen had had a good message of dont let money go to your head and know who your true friends are. I recommed this book to anybody."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"It may be difficult to rehabilitate Dickens from the reputation assigned to him by his critics, such as his being labelled as a spinner of popular yarns; a prime representative of Victorian strait-laced morality; a notoriously verbose prosaist whose writing teems with rhetorical redundancies and digressions; a careless plotter and over-plotter with a propensity for hyperbolic and grotesque comedy, depicting grim and depressing situations peopled by caricatures and abnormally exaggerated personages. The criticism that he commits a number of unforgivable Freudian flaws cannot so easily be obviated as well. Unlike the more firmly established exponents of the realist novel, such as Stendhal, Balzac and Dostoevsky, with their searching psychological assessments of character and motive, Dickens seems concerned mainly with evoking the idea of a certain character and not the character itself in its concrete, three-dimensional actuality. This explains his penchant for caricature. Nevertheless, his ability to present concrete characters is illustrated in &quot;Great Expectations&quot;, one of his later and finer works, particularly the characters of Pip and the convict Magwitch, who are psychologically profound and sympathetic portrayals in comparison to the host of other characters. His ability as a profound satirist and social critic is conclusively demonstrated by his interweaving his analysis of class, injustice and crime with the narrative. Pip, who finds himself elevated from his humble origins to one of the highest strata of society, by being made into a gentleman by a mysterious benefactor, is shocked to discover that this same benefactor, the agent of his social progress, is a despicable criminal who offends him by his sight. The message is obvious: society is a complex network of interrelations that interpenetrate class divisions; Miss Havisham is jilted by Compeyson, who is Magwitch's accomplice; Magwitch is the benefactor of Pip, who is in love with Estella, Magwitch's daughter. All, Dickens seems to say, are equal, regardless of their class or origin, before the judgement of God, which transcends human judgement. This is memorably brought out in the courtroom scene, during Magwitch's trial, in the description of the shaft of light that illuminated the room, \\"between the two-and-thirty [prisoners] and the Judge, linking them both together and perhaps reminding some among the audience, how both were passing on with absolute equality, to the greater Judgement that knoweth all things and cannot err.\\" Dickens's moral is the necessity of human fellowship, which we see lacking in the dehumanised Jaggers and Wemmick and in Estella and Miss Havisham, who both come to tragic or regrettable ends, through their coldheartedness and pitilessness. This quality, Dickens's use of plot coincidences to deliver profound human statements, partially redeems him from the charges of being a mere popular storyteller or a romanticist. In this respect, and also with regard to his verisimilitude in rendering authentic detail, he invites comparison with the great realists, such as Flaubert and Joyce, the masters of radical and even amoral realism, though Dickens, with his undisguised moralising, his chaste heroes and puritanical heroines, does not sit comfortably amongst these two; both of whom had works banned, one for his apparent frankness, the other for his obscenity and scatology. &quot;Great Expectations&quot; remains, however, as one of the great representatives of the realist, or social, novel, the product of an age that abolished serfdom and slavery, that witnessed the Industrial Revolution, the growth of large towns and the expansion of business enterprise. as such, it is an invaluable document of its time."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"A classic British novel written by Charles Dickens, Great Expectations, is a great novel with a very good moral at the end.

Also, the cover does not press an image of the characters or setting onto you, and allows you to picture your own Pip or Estella. Other editions of this book might not give you so many resources and be so reader-friendly. I am glad that I was forced to read this book, because I would have never read it on my own, or I would have quit after the first book---- which is a little boring, but reveals some very important facts to develop the intricate and complex plot.

Charles Dickens did not write many books in the first person narrative, and in Great Expectations, it is from the narrative of the protagonist named Pip.The book is very interesting and when reading this book, you can expect to be sad, anxious, and moved.Dickens does a great job of combining all the characters together in one plot.The book begins when Pip is young and is met by an escaped convict and the book ends with a happy ending.-jonny"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Reaching deep into himself, Dickens created this novel of moral exploration, high comedy, and page-turning narrative power. Pip, an orphan raised by his bullying siter and her sweet-naured blacksmith husband, discovers one day that he has a mysterious benefactor. The good-hearted Pip suddenly has &quot;great expectations&quot; of his life and begins to reject spiritual values for materialistic ones. Depspite his financial windfall, things don't go well for Pip. Estella, the beautiful but haughty young woman he loves, coldheartedly tortures him. And then there is the reappearance of Magwitch, the escaped convict who forced Pip to steal for him when Pip was a young boy. While Pip's maturation and moral education forms the heart of novel with his usual array of unforgettable characters, such as Miss Havisham, Joe Gargery, Jaggers, and of course Pip. Great Expectations represents one of Dicken's greatest triumphs. It manages to be both funny and moving."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I got a few classics for the kindle app, can't go wrong with ant classics in my opinion!

It was rewarding and fun to see in my mind's eye, and take pleasure in, the huge banquet of tasty and very often humorous nuggets offered.

Lo and behold, I came to find that the sentence, as published in this edition, is NOT what was supposed to have been written. Doubtless it is a (large) typographical error, but it changed the entire ending of the novel. Shameful to have happened, particularly for a book that markets itself towards classrooms and reading groups.The only good thing that developed from this experience is that through my research I discovered an alternate ending that Dickens had originally intended to use. Reading about the controversy between the two endings was interesting. Aladdin's nonsensical third ending was not. Further, it makes me wonder what else in the story was horribly wrong......Great novel, but don't buy it from Aladdin. I won't be buying anything further from them in the future."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I had thought of reading this book many times and am glad I finally gave it a read.

The notes in the Oxford Classics edition are much better (more thorough and more informative), and so is the introduction. George Bernard Shaw's introduction to this Modern Library edition is an intelligent piece of criticism, but it's also very partial and shortsighted. There's nothing terribly wrong with the Modern Library edition, but it's not the best one. I have used this for a class I was teaching, but next time I'll be using the Oxford Classics instead (unless something better comes along in the meantime)."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is a great classic. One of my favorite books by Dickens.A book everyone should read at least once....(though you will probably read it more than once!!!!)"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This unabridged audio edition of Dickens' classic superb chronology of \\"Pip's journey through life going from a poor boy to becoming a man with \\"expectations\\" is simply marvelous. As Pip comes into a small fortune, and becomes a \\"gentleman\\" he learns the value and true meaning of friendships and life. But the journey is a long one, with many lessons to be learned along the way before he can find his true self. Dickens has given us a wonderful story, with rich details of the setting and characters that grow and are among the most interesting and magnetic to be found in literature.I don't need to go on and on about the book itself(although I could easily go over my allotted word count here), if you haven't read it yet ,just know you are in for one heck of a literary treat. It is a story that will transport you to another time and place, and you may not want to come back. I will however, talk about this marvelous audio book. Michael Page is the reader, and what a reading he gives. Just curl up and listen to this master storyteller. Every voice, every nuance is captured. There is no doubt who is speaking as he gives each character the personality and cultural characteristics as Dickens intended. He even does the women wonderfully, without going over the top. In my mind Miss Havisham has always sounded just the way Page portrayed her, Estella as uppity as ever,the humble Joe, along with all the rest.If you are a fan of this book, this audio edition will give you a fresh read and new appreciation of this fascinating book. If you are experiencing it for the first time, you can't help but to become enthralled. Great to take on long drives or for younger readers to be introduced to classic literature in a most entertaining way.Enjoy the read...for the 1st Time or the 50th time!....Laurie"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Read this book in high school many years ago and probably did not understand the story fully. Just reread it and I absolutely loved the story. The depth of the characters is amazing. You feel like you have know them all of your life. Much more enjoyable now than at the high school level."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Pip, the main character in Charles Dickens's Great Expectations, writes the story in first person as a middle aged man looking back on his life. Pip's parents die when he is young making him an orphan. Pip is \\"brought up by hand\\" by his sister, who treats him with scorn. His sister's lack of love, however, is tempered by her husband Joe, a blacksmith. Joe is a simple, uneducated man and Pip's only \\"friend\\" during childhood. Pip commiserates with Joe about his sister's verbal thrashings, trying to make the best of his unhappy upbringing.Early in the story, Pip has an encounter with a convict in the cemetery among the marshes near his home. Unbeknownst to him, this man would be the source for his \\"Great Expectations\\" later in life.One day Pip is invited to the home of Ms. Havisham. Ms. Havisham is a single, eccentric, old woman who stopped living in the real world many years earlier when she was spurned by her lover on her wedding day.Ms. Havisham has adopted the beautiful Estella, and from the moment Pip meets her, he is infatuated with her beauty. Estella represents wealth, education, success, and opportunity--things Pip values but thinks he will never have.Dissatisfaction within himself grows as he wants to be more in life than a partner with Joe in the forge. Pip becomes unhappy not only with himself, but also with Joe, who represents what he does not want to be--uneducated and simple. Failing to appreciate Joe's moral character, Pip's world view begins to change as he sees education as something to be attained--the sure way out of his wretched life and the means by which he could woo the object of his unmerited affections, Estella.Pip's life changes dramatically when he is visited by a well respected and fiercely admired lawyer, Mr. Jaggers, who brings him an unusual message. Mr. Jaggers tells Pip he is to receive \\"Great Expectations,\\" but the benefactor is to remain anonymous until and only if they choose to reveal their identity. Pip mistakenly assumes the benefactor is Ms. Havisham, and the manipulating, self serving woman does nothing to dissuade him from his incorrect assumptions.The story takes Pip to London where he lives a life of excess and discards many virtues from his childhood. He no longer wants anything to do with Joe and believes his future course has been immutably set--that he is to marry the beautiful Estella. He shares his indulgences with his new friend, Herbert, whose acquaintance he had made years earlier at Ms. Havisham's place. The two of them rack up excessive debt as Pip sees himself as \\"a man in waiting\\" for all his fortunes to come to pass.Things are not what they seem, however. It is eventually revealed that the benefactor is not Ms. Havisham but the convict, Mr. Magwitch, whom Pip had met in the cemetery many years earlier when he was a young, impressionable boy.Pip is confronted face to face with the despised convict, hounded by the remembrances of him torturing him in the cemetery, dreams that lingered, causing him much consternation. But now he has to accept the undeniable truth that his turn of fortune is not because of Ms. Havisham's provision, but the despicable convict's desire to make him a gentleman. The convict wants his life to be redeemed for something good and chooses Pip to be that vehicle.Through a series of events, Pip acknowledges the inexcusable way he has treated Joe and wants to make amends. Before he can accomplish this, however, other happenings complicate his life. The convict, now in England, needs Pip's protection. Pip must make a way for Magwitch to leave England without being discovered.While Pip hides him with a trusted friend, Pip comes to realize that the convict he had earlier despised has more redemptive qualities than Pip has within himself. As he makes provision for the convict's escape, Pip sees Magwitch change for the better, and in so doing, Pip also changes. Instead of hating the convict, Pip grows to love him. The self centeredness of Pip's indulgences is replaced with care, not only for the convict, but in growing degrees, for others.In the process of trying to escape, the convict is attacked by his long-time archrival and enemy. As a result, Magwitch is severely injured, discovered by the authorities, put on trial and convicted, but dies from his injuries before his death sentence can be carried out. Magwitch's estate is turned over to the authorities to make restitution for past wrongs. Pip is left penniless and obligingly accepts that his Great Expectations and source of income have dissipated into nothing. Meanwhile, Estella marries someone else--a man whom Pip despises.A few years earlier, Pip had secretly made arrangements for his friend Herbert to have a small expectation out of his \\"Great Expectations,\\" amounting to a sizable sum of money. When it becomes known to Pip that he will lose his \\"Great Expectations\\" to the authorities, his only thought is for his friend. Pip returns to visit Ms. Havisham and requests, in a show of repentance for the wrongs she had done to him, a sum of money that Pip could again secretly provide to Herbert.Herbert wisely uses this money to successfully buy into a business venture. He later marries and moves overseas in his business pursuits--none of which would have been possible without Pip's anonymous provision to Herbert.Pip credits this as the only redeeming thing he has accomplished, reflecting on all the other things he did or didn't do that could have been used for good.Pip falls ill following the death of his convict friend, Magwitch, and Joe comes to England to care for him until he is well. Joe surreptitiously leaves early one morning when Pip is sufficiently recovered, and when Pip wakes up, he discovers Joe has paid off all his creditors. Pip immediately returns home in penitence to confess to Joe all his past wrongs, realizing that Joe is a better man than he. He recognizes in his now humble state that his \\"Great Expectations\\" deceived him into using it as a source of pride against Joe.Upon arriving home, Pip's expectations are not what he envisioned. His sister who raised him by hand has long since died as a result of an attack on her by the evil Orlick. His childhood friend and confidant, Biddy, has just married Joe. In the end, redemption works its way for good. Joe and Biddy are happily married and the sore memories of Pip's sister are forgotten.Pip returns to London and within a month, leaves England and joins Herbert's firm, Clarriker and Company, overseas. Pip lives abroad with Herbert and his wife, and after successfully making partner, eleven years later, returns to his boyhood home in England. He discovers Joe and Biddy now have a son who reminds him of himself.Before bidding Joe and Biddy a final farewell, Pip makes one last trip to the Havisham place, the old woman having died many years earlier. Pip discovers Estella in the garden, a chance meeting since she no longer lives there. The old house and brewery have been torn down and sold off except for the garden enclosed by the ivy covered wall.Years of a stormy, failed marriage have softened Estella's vindictive, prideful nature, and she confesses that \\"suffering has been stronger than all other teaching and has taught me to understand what your heart used to be.\\"The reader is left to ponder whether Pip and Estella ever marry because Pip says, \\"I saw no parting from her.\\"In the end, Pip learns much about what matters--wisdom he would not have possessed if he had stayed working at Joe's forge. As a middle aged narrator looking back, there is sadness but sweetness about what he has lost because of what he has gained. Perhaps the reader is the real winner, having seen redemption on so many levels within each character. In the end, if we are honest, we can identify these shortcomings in ourselves. If Pip can work out his \\"Great Expectations\\" to bring redemption, perhaps we can, also--that is, again, if we are honest. Our sinful nature will always be there, but if we look for good, God will not disappoint us. Maybe \\"Great Expectations\\" will not only find us, but redemption will be there, too, just as it was in Pip."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This was my first time to read a Dickens book i thought i wouldn't like it but once i got to know all the people and there ways which were very funny ways at times, i really enjoyed the book and couldn't but it down i love the sweet friendship Pip and Herbert have in the story but the best thing was Joe how could you not love Joe in this story!!!! he wasn't the smartest person but he was the best person..!!!,Im not sure which ending i like most but i thought they were both good in there own way.. ;)"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This particular book is just the right physical size, as are the type and font, to make it easy to read, unlike any paperback version you are likely to find.To enjoy Dickens is to enjoy his preposterous characterizations, clever and cutting wit, wonderfully complex story lines, and of course his trademark maudlin interludes or devices.The latter make a pretty rich broth making one of his books go a long way. His use of language too causes one to undertake his novels fully prepared to spend time parsing his sentences and consulting a dictionary in order to satisfactorily comprehend his writing.In other words, Dickens can never be read lightly even though, strictly speaking, his work might be considered light reading.'Great Expectations' is particularly worthy of close reading for, whether intentionally or not, it harkens back to 'The Odyssey' by Homer. Yes, that's right, apart from being a truly ripping yarn, the gist of which you can doubtless cull from other amazon reviews, this is a book in which Dickens examines or, more accurately, lays bare the inner workings of the (male?) human psyche.Humans are raised upon a diet of myths of human perfection, a list of which is endless; superhuman athlete, heroic military personnel, idealistic politician, anointed prophet, perfect mother, exalted leader, etc. What Dickens does in this great book is discuss the contradictions that lie within us all that make us heroes one moment and cowards the next; paragons of virtue on the one hand, and unprincipled thieves on the other; selfless benefactors today and greedy self-servers tomorrow.Most of us believe ourselves to be endowed with above average amounts of courage, generosity, and charity, etc. In addition to pointing out such conceits, Dickens proceeds to demonstrate how we maintain these notions while acting in radically contradictory ways to them.This brings me back to Homer's 'Odyssey,' and also to the works of Wm. Shakespeare which are the West's most revered examinations of man's psyche. It strikes one that this book is Dickens' effort, successful and brilliant effort, to do as they have. Granted, the latter's work is sentimental and written to be broadly popular; however, this accessibility in no way can hide the fact that Mr. Dickens addresses fundamental human truths/traits in this book.Based on amazon reviews, this book is evidently assigned to many 9th grade English classes. What a shame, as it is doubtful that such a young person has yet had a broad enough experience of the personal contradictions that allow us to tick. Perhaps Freshman classes would be better served by 'The Great Gatsby,' 'Catcher in the Rye' and similarly glib works, leaving sublime works such as this for later years. (It could be argued that early exposure might arm one against future bad behavior...the point Dickens makes though is that we can't avoid ourselves.)"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Of all the Dickens novels I've read, this one is certainly the most atmospheric and perhaps the most true to life. In terms of art, this is probably his supreme achievement. The plot isn't as convoluted as it is in Bleak House. The action is more dramatic. The female characters, particularly Estella, are more believable and (in the case of Miss Havisham, for instance) more intriguing. The sentimentality and the overall length are under tighter control. The humor still abounds. The language is easier to read but no less descriptive. No, it's not a perfect work -- there are still cloying and annoying characters and incidents, and far too many ridiculous coincidences -- but to me, at least, Great Expectations is Dickens' greatest achievement."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"The book \\"The Great Expectations\\" was probably originally intended for middle-class adults in London. Today however the book is read and understood by both children and adults. Some things about the book that made it worth reading was first and most obvious the story line. Also the book seemed to go really fast. The story started with action wich made the book more enjoyable to read. Also it didn't get bogged down very much throughout the entire story. Another good quality of the book is that it didn't contain much romance, which can also slow a good book down. The main point of the book that affection, loyalty, and consience are more important than social advancement, wealth, and class, could have a strong affect on certain communities. Since this sort of theme has been around for a while and will continue to be around for a while gives the book credit for being a classic. Also the fact that this book is fairly old and is still being read to this day makes it a classic. The book was written in great detail. All the characters were fully described and all served a purpose. That also made this book very interesting. I would recommend this book to middle school students, and to adults as well as anyone in between. This book and the main idea was not difficult to understand. Also it is enough of an action and \\"turn around\\" book that it keeps the readers attention even to the end."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations by Charles Dickens was a very good novel in my eyes. The main character Pip believed, as a true Victorian, that a gentlemen is made solely of financial aspects and physicall possessions, and he is oblivious to moral aspects of the positions. Upon recieving his great expectations, he moves to London for a further education, and to become what he thinks is a gentlemen. Through Pips life he learns that his life as a gentlemen is not what he thought it would be, and his views of a true gentlemen start to change. With thanks to Dickens and Great Expectations, we realize that sometimes even a convict may be more genteel than a traditional gentlemen. He may start as a poor orphan boy, like Pip, or labour as a blacksmith, like Joe. truly, what matters is the heart and inner worth that make a genuine gentlemen, and social prestige has not a bit to do with it."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Although one of the first Dickens books that I've read, it is still one of my favourites. The scenes with Miss Haveisham's ghost wedding banquet are haunting and have stuck with me for years. We see how Pip saw this abandoned wedding banquet, and then we follow Pip and his subsequent relationship with Miss Havisham as he grows up. Miss Havisham, for some reason has resolved to take out her considerable vindictiveness on little Pip, and we see how this moulds little Pip's character. We also see the positive effect that a prisoner (Joe Gargery) has on Pip. The tone of this novel is quite gloomy throughout, but it does end on a positive note. Although gloomy, it does have Dickens' usual warmth and humour displayed throughout, and of course his wonderful characters. This is a book that will stay with you for a long time."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"great expectations is just that. i am not much of a classics fan, preferring contemporary writers. i decided to read this after reading john irving's \\"trying to save piggy sneed, in this book irving finishes with an essay on dickens where he says that great expectations was the book that made him want to write. being a big irving fan, i decided to read great expectations and i have to admit i was blown over by dickens' writing style. the humour, the characterisation, the verbal jugglery, the pompousness, the joy of writing were all apparent and absolute fun. the best thing about the book is that it hasnt aged one bit.dickens writes with rare moral courage and compassion for the failings of his characters, he creates a vividly colourful world populated by extraordinary characters too bizarre to be real, yet makes us trust in them, and slowly makes us sympathise with them and eventually grow to love them. the strength of this book is not in its plot but rather in the style of writing.a thoroughly enjoyable book if you love a colourful writing style."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I have to read this book for highschool, and even though I'm not through with it quite yet, I think it's a lot better than I expected. Charles Dickens threw in a few parts that I thought were kind of exciting. In the beginning, you really have to get used to different spellings of words, like &quot;skilful&quot;, for example, but after you get into the book more, you catch on.The main character, Pip, goes from being a boy raised by his sister, to becoming a gentleman. In his journey, he meets several different people, like Ms. Havisham and Estella, for example. There are many different things he must go through before he is told he has an opportunity to become a gentleman. Now I just have to see how it ends!I'd recommend it to people who are older than highschool, just because I think you'd enjoy and understand it a lot more! But if you're a real bookworm, you'd like it. :)"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"&quot;Great Expectations&quot; is an extraordinary novel of a young boy's journey to adulthood. We meet Pip as he describes his sister who &quot;raised him by hand.&quot; However, despite his misgivings about his sister he still feels very fondly towards his brother-in-law Joe Gargery. He meets many extraordinary characters along the way one of them being the classic literary figure Miss Havsiham. Miss Havisham had a broken heart and she raised her daughter Estealla to view men the same way she did. As Pip grows up and moves out on his own he becomes the only person to know the true identity of Estella. The other important character in &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is a criminal. He had threatened Pip in the marshes when he was a young boy and came back from New Zealand many years later to see Pip again. All though the criminal meets his untimely demise we still grow close to the character and miss him when he goes. This book gives an excellent view of not only a young boy's thoughts and emotions but outlook as well. It takes you on a journey that provides you with many lessons that can be carried throughout your life. Despote the magnificence and brilliance of the author's writing it is still a very difficult book. Dickens gives an amazing outlook on life and he deserves the recognition he has gotten, even since his death. &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is a true classic and deserves to go down in literary history."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Absolutely one of my favorite books ever written... superb, intense and emotional, this books is highly reccommended to anyone who likes literature. Follows the coming of age of Pip, who is realized so fully that the reader cant help but identify with him, and come to feel as if he knows him. Anything by Dickens is bound to be something special, but in my opinion this one takes the cake."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is a great story of Pip (Philip Pirrip)'s obsessive love for a woman who neither loves him nor seems in any way the typical heroine. As he strives to become a gentleman, aided by an anonymous benefactor's money, he succeeds only in alienating those who love him best and most honestly. Appearances, as in most Dickens novels, are deceiving, and those who are wealthy in a material sense are not those who are wealthy in the emotional sense and vice versa.The language and sentence structure are both complex; if you have any difficulty in understanding this sort of English you'd do well to wait awhile before reading GREAT EXPECTATIONS, because Dickens' brilliance is in the wording. This is less humorous than many of his other stories; however the humor is there if you look for it and listen for it in the phrasing.Dickens provided two endings for this book, and, frankly, I don't care much for either...but read the book, read both endings, and decide for yourself."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is a story that only Dickens could tell, and no Hollywood screenwriter can capture the same. Dickens created characters that can not be placed in another time. Pip is a blacksmith apprentince and meets up with a man in a graveyard named Magwitch. He helps Magwitch out and then Magwitch takes the blame and gets sent to Australia to pay for Pip's crime. Pip is then invited to play at Miss Havisham's manor with her ward Estella. And Miss Havisham uses Estella to despise any man. Since Miss Havisham was betrayed by her husband to at the altar by not showing up, she feels it's her life's duty to make all men suffer. So Estella makes Pip feel horrible for his hands and only allows him to get close enough to toil with him. You feel so sorry for Pip and how he is tormented by Estella. All the while he gets money from an unannounced bennefactor that turns his life around. And he moves to London to become a gentlemen. A great story about friendship. Dickens created quite a story that nobody can quite capture the same."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I have loved this book since I first read it in high school.

I have also become a great admirer of the work of Frank Muller, who has recorded countless works, both popular novels and classics (including Moby Dick, the brave soul!)When Mr. Muller sank his teeth into Great Expectations, he created a performance with the perfect combination of innocence, humor, irony and adventure. He had me laughing out loud despite being stuck in terrible rush hour traffic.The actor manages to become the characters to the point where you forget only one man is reading all of the parts. He has created convicts you could easily picture, and almost smell. His portrayal of Joe Gargery makes you love the character for his heart of gold. His portrayal of Wemmick's \\"castle\\" and the \\"ancient\\" was so hilarious I was almost in tears.Of course, Dickens had quite a bit to do with it too.I realize there are countless recordings of this great work, and I'm sure this won't be the last I will ever hear. But I will always remember Frank Muller's rendition with great appreciation and a broad smile."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations is a novel that will keep you interested all throughout. It follows the interesting story of a boy named Pip throughout his many life experiences and different phases of his expectations. The plot is connected in a unique way throughout the book, and mysteries are solved and connected with it. Through his beautiful writing and interesting plot, this novel is arguably Dickens's greatest work. The language does require your full attention to understand it, and it is a very long book, but the writing is so great that you don't really notice to much.The tone of the novel is pretty dark and gloomy, but there is a constant sense of hope throughout. With themes of social class, guilt and innocence, and ambition we see Pip grow as a person and learn about the struggles and trials in life. There is also a bit of a love story that occurs that puts some fey real emotion into the story.I would reccomend this book to younng adults and adults who have the ability to understand the writing. I would reccomend that a person read it when they are looking for a good book, but have plenty of time to read and really take the story in. You need full attention to read it, but it is well worth the time it takes."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Every high school kid who has written a review complaining about this book being boring should be boiled with their own pudding and buried with a stake of holly through their heart!Well, thats from A Christmas Carol but you get my point.This book is just great, you can't get any better than it except for maybe David Copperfield. Its one of Dickens best, I could read it over and over and over and over....you get the point.

I suggest finding a good summary. The movie was relaly good. Way better."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"As a student, I was expecting to read a literary masterpiece. I don't like long books like Great Expectations but this book went into extreme detail about the most meaningless things.The novel grabs you fast and has a story with many surprises and twists along the way.Theres all sorts of unknown parents, secret coniving, mysterious benefactors, and worst of all, many unrealistic characters. Miss Havisham, Pip, Magwitch, Mr. Jaggers, and Estella are the characters that you should think more about them understand them.If this is to be your first reading of the book, be patient with the book's middle third,because the real and important events starts very late;The story centers around a young boy--well, almost young man-- named Pip, and revolves around his growing into age. Much of Pip's worry and concern I could relate to--falling in love with a girl who only plays with your heart, growing up and leaving home for the first time, and discovering your true relationships with others and yourself.It is a darker work, but it has some exciting and entertaining parts to it, too. If a ex-convict came up to me, I would be so scared that I would run away. The fact that Pip trusted Magwitch with a lot of things really amazed me.Actually there are great descriptions with wonderful dialogues and I'd recommend this book to anyone who wants a good, but an illogical read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Do not give this book as a gift. It will disappoint. I am still looking for a high quality illustrated version of Great Expectations. However, I can vouch for the vendor who offered a low price and shipped promptly."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I thought this book was a little hard to understand with the way they talked. Some of the words the use you don't normally hear everyday or the way they phrase some of their sentences makes it harder to know what is going on. I liked this novel though the story was great in how all the events that took place connected to something else in the end of the story.My favorite parts in this book were when Pip was finding more and more about Estella and her family because it kept you wanting to read more and more of the story so you could find out what happened. The major themes of the story were kind of hard to understand because some of them are hidden in the story and Dickens doesn't come right out and say what's happening and sometimes he drags out the seen and makes it really easy to lose interest or just get confused.Dickens didn't really bring the story alive for me because I didn't really understand some of the parts in the book, but I did like the story."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"HOW I JUDGE A CLASSIC: I don't give extra brownie points to classic books. I ask myself, \\"If this book were published today by some unknown author, what would I think of it?\\" Perhaps this isn't a fair way to judge a classic, but that's the method I use.PROS OF GREAT EXPECTATIONS:- It has outstanding character development.- It's a story about people and relationships.- Good, authentic dialog.- A nice moral story.CONS:- Painfully slow pacing.- Long-winded writing style, long paragraphs.- Few characters that are that agreeable.CONCLUSION: Have low expectations when you read \\"Great Expectations.\\" Modern books have much faster pacing and are more easy to read.

The story line is mildly interesting, but most of the book contains fluff that is pointless and you just have to suffer through.

It is considered to be his greatest work to many critics. I read the book and found that it was probably the most boring book I had ever read in my life. Overall the book had a pretty well thought out plot. To me though the book was a classic and masterpiece only when it was first became published. People now in the present are not very easily satisfied with a book with a good plot and are well written. People now are just more interested in books that have a lot of twists and turns in the story. They want be able not know what is going to happen next in the story. The book Great Expectations even though it was such a boring book it did have some very interesting parts. Also the book was overall well written by the author. One strength that the book had was the fact it had such interesting characters. The author had well character development throughout the book. All the characters in the book were described that you tell each character apart because of their personality or physical appearance. The main character Philip Pirrip also nicknamed Pip was very well described as a character. The author told everything possible about Pip so throughout the book you saw the main character grow into man and also grow as person in general. When Pip when through something you almost felt like it was you in the book. Also another strength in the book was the great setting descriptions. It was so good because when you were reading the book you could actually picture the setting in your head. The book had very little strengths because I was forcing myself to actually read it. If it had actually been actually interesting I would have finish the book in one day instead of a three weeks. The only reason that I actually read was the fact I knew had to do a report on it. The book had many faults for a classic book. The main weakness of the book was the chapters that were pointless and just there to take up space. The book seemed was written to just tell a story of boy without any really interesting parts. I was somewhat disappointed in the fact that the book was considered a classic book because a classic book to me is book that can interest anyone and any age. The book had great plot and well-written characters but I thought that the book could have been shorter. It could have been shorter and would still have the same impact on a reader. The reader will eventually find out that the book Great Expectations is just a book to read when you have nothing else to read. Think this book just wasted my time. I hated every minute that I spent reading this book. In scale of one through to ten I would give it a four. The book is fairly good but the book is simply too long to tell a simple and boring story of a boy named Pip. I wouldn't recommend this book because I think that the reader will be truly bored. Probably the main target audience of this book was of young adult. The book is good for that age range because of the somewhat difficult and confusing vocabulary. The book Great Expectations is just a book to be read when there are no more books to read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"this book basically bored me to tears, it's one of those books that you really have to be into from the beginning to get the story at all, like harry potter or lord of the rings. main point = if you're not a charles dickens fan, the amazon description doesn't amaze you, and even you've read it before and reallllyyyyy disliked, then this book is not for you."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"In my opinions, the book is alright, but not the greatest book ever as other people like to say. The writing is beautiful and clever, but I think that the characters and plot are really all pretty stupid and unrealistic, especially Mrs. Havisham; that would never happen and I don't believe it's possible to wear the same clothing without bathing for all those years. The clothing would be torn apart and you would smell horribly. The cake would've been gone, too. And the aged one in Mr. Wemmicks apartment who gets happier the more violently you nod at him? A convict wants to give all his money to Pip because he scared him so much he got him to do what he wanted? I could go on some more, but I'm bored, 3 stars for the writing."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I love to read great books like BRAVE NEW WORLD by Aldous Huxley or FAR FROM THE MADDING CROWD by Thomas Hardy.

I read THE RISE AND FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE by Gibbons and gained much knowledge from doing so. I LOVE TO READ.But GREAT EXPECTATIONS was a GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT!

Dickens' tedious descriptions and constant indecision on how the plot should turn makes the novel lose it's potential merit.Thousands of scholars and other readers have lauded Great Expectations as the finest Dickens' work of all time. The fact remains that it appears Dickens could not decide whether to make this a tragedy or an &quot;all's well that ends well&quot; happy-go-lucky type of story. This is proven by his change of the original ending. However, any reader could give testimony of feeling &quot;yanked, strung along, or thrown about&quot; from page one as they wonder just what Dickens wants them to think about Pip and his less-than remarkable life. Should we sympathize, feel disgust, be concerned? Does he deserve Estella's scorn or is he a victim of circumstance?The more you read of this cryptic novel the more you grow to understand that Dickens doesn't know what his novel is about, either. The entire book seems to vary by the chapter. And the fact that the plot has a potentially good story behind it that Dickens doesn't care to elaborate on makes the entire thing a bit more tedious for the take.The fact remains that Dickens is a fabulous story-teller. He has accurate, unjaded descriptions, refreshing, occassionally bitter, sometimes triumphant plots, and enough suspense to keep you reading throughout the night. It's just that none of that takes place in Great Expectations.Holly Burke, PhD.Clinical Psychologist, Abnormal Psych.

But there are other great stories that Dickens has done such as \\"A Christmas Carol\\" and \\"A Tale of Two Cities\\" and I am unsure why this one is always required reading.The story itself is mildly interesting and the characters and dialogue are unrealistic. There were many times that I felt like I was visiting an insane asylum.Dickens is labeled as a classic author, and often that gives reader's pre-conceived notions that his novels must be good. But even the best of author's can have a mess-up every now and then and \\"Great Expectations\\" is certainly not one that I would recommend reading."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I know, I know...I'm just a stupid high school student who's brain has been fried by television. I was forced to read this novel in 11th grade and I couldn't finish it. Must be because I play too many video games, right?I'm a freshman in college now, and I still hate Dickens. Don't write me off as a slack-jawed Gen-Xer though, because I've read some pretty heavy stuff (Faulkner, Montaigne, Steinbeck, Salinger, Dumas, Hemingway, Vonnegut, Tolkien) and loved it. I eat up Mark Twain; &quot;A Connecticut Yankee&quot; was a page-turner for me, and &quot;Huck Finn&quot; is my all-time favorite book. I just don't like Dickens' writing style, which he shares with most other Victorian novelists: unnecessary verbosity, obvious pomposity about the self as a masterful writer. I agree that Dickens is one of the great storytellers of all time, and he may have had the greatest imagination for character development since Shakespeare. But his writing style turns me off."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I am currently being forced to read this book for my Honors English class in high school. I've already read it once before for a different class, so I know what I am talking about when I say this book is the ultimate cure for insomnia.I honestly try to appreciate what is *supposed* to be fine literature, but &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is about as entertaining as watching kale grow. First off, the fact that this book has two endings inspires a bit of skepticism in me. I've never heard of an author so indecisive that he would put two endings in a novel. It creates a generally unsatisfying conclusion, as you're at a loss for which ending to &quot;accept&quot;.Aside from which, this book has enough useless passages to fill a hundred pages or so. It seems that, basically, Dickens didn't quite know exactly what to write about, but felt the urge to *write* *something*. So he wrote &quot;Great Expectations&quot;, following the traditional poor-boy formula of his previous 15 or so books.I find it especially hilarious that none of my teachers have ever even read the bloody novel, but it's &quot;good&quot; according to the curriculum. In the words of someone from a certain other Charles Dickens book, &quot;Bah! Humbug!&quot;.Don't judge Dickens by this book, however. &quot;David Copperfield&quot;, for example, even though it follows the same &quot;poor-boy&quot; formula, is worlds better than this.As much as I'd love to say, &quot;Oh, it's a classic, everyone should read it!&quot;, I personally don't think so."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great works of English literature from the 1700s and 1800s shared one thing in common; twists and turns in the plot lines that are never fully exposed until the last lines of the book. Chief among these twists are reversals of fortune both good and bad. So goes this work of literature. Though read by many as children, I would consider it more worthy of young adults, as the text can be quite boring for anyone below their teens. Basically, the plot revolves around Pip, a boy who grows up poor in the care of his sister and apprenticed to a blacksmith; a blue collar job by any standard. But he comes into an inheritance which he gladly accepts, leaving behind his previous life. A second theme of this story is his awe and obsession over Estella, a pretty girl who he meets first when young and poor when she does not even see him, and later one when he is rich when she cannot look past him. This is the probably the part of the book best remembered; a boy infatuated with what he cannot get, only to re-encounter it on later on in life as something he might not want anymore.As a book, it is shorter than most of Dickens' work, and much easier to read. But it has less historical meaning, and to me, less exploration of social ills than his other works such as Oliver Twist and Great Expectations. The book focuses more on personal travails, and how relationships between individuals all depend on the where the individuals came from. The book is interesting enough, but not that exciting, and I would not consider it as a mandatory work for all students to read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I liked this book, I really did, I promise. But in my opinion, Dickens's other novel &quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot; is much, much better.So before you buy this book, check out &quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot; as well. Maybe you can buy both. :) Just don't go with &quot;Great Expectations&quot; because it is more well-known. That doesn't mean that it will be better in all people's opinions."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations, by Charles Dickens, was a very strong novel. I enjoyed it, but found parts of it confusing and difficult to read. It is a very &quot;deep&quot; novel which has twists and turns throughout. In the begining, Pip was an orphan who went to live with his sister (who was mean) and her husband (who was an OK guy.) Later, he goes to the home of Miss Hauisham. She is a lady who is kind of crazy because of a past situation. Her lover left her years ago. Here is where Pip meets her daughter, Estella, who is very beautiful ( and who was always moody and was spoiled.) Pip falls for Estella (I guess he can put her personality aside.) Later on, Pip becomes wealthy but he can't figure out who left him the money (He thinks it was Miss Hauisham.) It ends up that a man named Able left him the money. When Pip was young, Able asked him for food. Pip got it for him and Able was convicted and he was forced to move away. After he moved he became wealthy and because of Pips heart and help, Able left him a fortune. As for the end... you can read it for your self and find out the suprises. My only complaint is that there are some confusing parts (as I said above.) Overall, I really enjoyed this book and reccommend it for people who like Dicken's work. To be honest, when I first got this book I did not want to read it. I figured I would just rent the movie with Gweneth Paltrow, and base my report on that. It is SO DIFFERENT. The book and the movie are not alike. I decided to read it and so I did. I reccommend this book for people who like Dicken's work. He really did a great job with this one."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations must have been what the readers of Dickens' serial publication must have had when they first read it, and I have to wonder if they were as disappointed as I was after slogging all the way through to the skewed, disjointed, and extremely contrived ending. This was written as a serial, not a novel, and I think Dickens (and his readers) would have benefited from a rewrite before publication in novel form.If ever there was a novel that set out to have no meaning, no core, no arc, and most of all, no satisfaction, it must be Great Expectations. The novel's title clearly states Dickens' perspective and intention; that great expectations in life will be met by great (and bitter) disappointment, and the greater the expectation, the greater your disappointment in life will be. The idea that a woman jilted at the altar will spend her life grooming a young girl to make other young men's lives miserable, is a contrived, almost paranoid idea from a male's perspective. Mrs. Havershim's great expectations for life were dashed, because instead of moving on to meet a better man, she chooses to become a shut-in and ruin a young man's expectations for life. However, if it seems that Dickens is building towards some kind of message about not having overblown expectations and then being bitter if they don't work out, the reader is to be disappointed. Dickens goes out of his way not to make this point or any point, but to make a grimly sad tale bereft of any kind of compass or solace for either the characters or the reader.Pip, the protagonist, survives his encounter with the damaged Estella, who had been deliberately damaged by Havershim to be \\"unable to love\\". The ending, in which he encounters her again briefly and is glad she is able to have the heart to \\"understand his heart as it was\\", is unbelievable, pompous and drowning in its own self-pity, all at the same time. It also feels as if Dickens took a perfunctory way to get out of a story that had meandered its way away from him.Great Expectations must be the most disappointing, overblown \\"classic\\" novel I have ever read, not because it doesn't have a happy ending, but because of the way that Dickens has created his characters and shapeless mess of a story, and presented it in the most abrasive fashion possible. I was relieved at the end to have finished it, not satisfied, not sad, and certainly not edified. There is nothing to learn or grow from in this novel; it has made me less of a Dickens fan. And that is the most disappointing result of reading it."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I'm surprised that this book is a requirement in highschool. I had to read it in my upper division English Lit class in college and I just couldn't get into it. There are way too many retarded characters on which Dickens spends too much time, Pip gets more annoying with every page, especially his love for Estella who is one of the most disgusting characters in the book. I've read Jane Eyre before this and it was a real page turner. This is plain boring."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations has a few interesting characters. I'll give it that. Magwitch and Miss Havisham are definitely original and entertaining. But everyone else is pretty bland.Pip's love for Estella is rather pathetic. Why he would love such a despicable person is beyond me. This fact alone makes Pip difficult to relate to, and thus not a very good choice for the point-of-view character.But the one thing that absolutely ruins this book is the clutter of coincidences. One of the first rules of fiction writing is NO COINCIDENCES. And Dickens goes out of his way to break this rule. Over. And Over. And Over.Really, it is not a very good book.

I just wish I could ask the dead author some questions like Why didn't you let Pip grow the Hell up? That poor me, I'm a country peasant with no friends act got real tired real quick. Second question Where in his warped imagination did he get Ms. Havishom? News flash! Anyone who did so many terrible things because a man left her was mentally unstable before she met the jerk which explains why he left her.

I also had to read this book when I was in ninth grade and I had no clue what was going on. Those kids might not want to admit it, but it was above thier understanding, I am proof of that. I decided to read this again and even though I was indifferant to it the first time I read, and realized it to be the literary genuis that it truely is. It has an amusing story line of the events that surround a young boy's life and how he copes with his coming into fortunes and life in general. But Dicken's masterful writing makes more than just a story line, it is also a social critique of Industeralized Society. For existance, Joe represents how life was before the Industerial Revolution. He was kind, hard working, morally upstanding, and happy, amoung other desirable qualities. Whereas Estella, for example, represented how it was during the Industerial Revolution. She was greedy, self-centered, controlling, and unhappy. This is also evident in Pip. At first he had the traits of the former, but once he got his &quot;Expecations&quot;, he exhibited the traits of the latter. Another part of his critique was the differance between the rich and the poor. There are other important ways in which he portrays them, but for lack of time the poor people were happy, whereas the rich were unhappy. Dickens is also great at describing setting and characters, so as some might see that as boreing, I see that as giving more depth to the story. He makes it seem like the reader is actually in 19th century London and meeting such interresting characters as Jaggers, Mr. Pocket, and of course honorable Joe. Anyone concidering buying this that is in high school, I reccomend not buying this because you will not undersand it, hence dislike it. But anyone who is already out of high school, or someone who read it in high school I would reccomend this book. Dickens is well know in literary circles for his genuis, but for some reason I cannot explain, in popular culture he does not come close to the popularity of Shakesphere, even though he was writer and Social Critic."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"The way he describes everything from the eerie feeling he has in Ms. Havisham's room, to the smell of hay in the streets of London. Also the way everything connects together with the things you think are not important, an the way the book, sort of calms down at the end and explains everything that happens. This was a very hard book to read, so I would recomend Cliffs Notes with this, bot do NOT read the cliifs notes seperate! It ruins everything! Even if you hate classics, this is still one great book, I hate classics too, but still, it's very good. I had to read this for a freshman honor class exam, so not that I read this by choice, but i'm glad I did."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"It took me a little while to get into the story and get to know all the characters, but once I did I couldn't put the book down. Charles Dickens is a wonderful writer, and Great Expectations prooved it."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"A good read from start to finish, typically Dickens, one ofthe classics. A fine work."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is a novel of bitterly dashed hopes and people who still cling to their broken dreams, allowing them to rob the present of meaning. Pride and greed are shown to delude even the best of people, causing them to believe what they want, rather than the obvious facts. The characters are over-the-top, yet still drawn sympathetically, and are some of the most memorable figures in the whole of literature. This is Dickens' best work."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"One could not expect to get a decent review on this book from American youth who lack the culture, knowledge, and discipline to enjoy anything that is not a video game. Understanding Dickens, one must remember that he wrote his book in chapters which were printed as excerpts in popular magazines of the time. Compiling these excerpts together results in a lenghtier novel. Appreciate the author's ability to develop characters, to visually put the reader into 1800 Victorian England, and Dickens as a social justice advocate for the poor. If you're looking for extensive sex, violence, and meaningless dialogue and plot, watch American Television."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book was on my reading list for 9th grade, and it was my first Dickens novel ever. It took me about 3 days to read, and it was kind of a fluctuating thing. Some parts of it I couldn't put down, while other parts I dragged myself through. On the whole, I thought it was a good book, but not one I would read over again for a while. Dickens' use of figurative language is exquisite, but sometimes I found it hard to understand at first. The way almost every character described is tied some way into the tale is fantastic. You always have to pay attention, for you never know when that character might turn up again. This is such a tragic story already that I wish it would have ended a little better. I know it broke my heart. All in all, I would only recommend this book to someone who is in the mood for a complex tragedy."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Even though I'm only in High School, this book had a deep impact. This book was extrmely well written, Dickens use of figurative language and his descriptive language was fantastic!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is a great book, and if it's too 'complex' for you, you haven't read many good books, because it pioneered the layout of a novel. It is full of forgiveness, obsession, pride, disillusionment... rich and involving. I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"My previous experience with Dickens is that I picked up A Tale of Two Cities, got about five pages, and then returned it to the library, yawning.Well, I finally decided that I would will myself through a Dickens novel. And I enjoyed it immensely. I can't say that the plot was especially thrilling -- nor the ending particularly satisfying. And yes, it is long, and if you just want to find out what happens, you won't find it to be of much interest. But what I like about the books is the attention to characters and details -- even ones that are almost irrelevant to the story -- but which kept kept me smiling and reading. In particular, his friend who is a clerk who has made his house TRULY to be his castle, complete with moat and drawbridge -- and who has an Aged Parent that had me laughing like crazy. The unexpected irony -- when Pip describes things to be such and so, but when it is clear to the reader to be much different -- I found to be wonderful. I felt that Dicken's had painted very strong visual elements -- by the end of the novel, I had very strong visual images of most of the characters and settings. I'm pleased to say that I have read a Dicken's novel and I truly enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Of all the negative reviews I read, the common theme is &quot;I didn't understand it.&quot; Or, &quot;I was forced to read...&quot; Truth is, it is a very solid novel; not the greatest, but very good and insightful. For those of you who claim not to understand this work, may I suggest a return to Winnie the Pooh? Give the book a chance, think a little about it, and you may be surprised."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I remember having to read this book when I was a sophomore in high school. At the time I hated the book with a blue passion. Basically becuz I didn't understand it. Just recently, I decided to give it another chance (fifteen or so years later) and could not put it down. Although Pip is the main character, I found my sympathies lying with Estella. So young, so beautiful... so hardened. Ms. Havisham, in her greedy bitterness, deprives Estella the chance of real emotion, real love. Although I believe Ms. Havisham realizes what she has done near the end of the story, it is much too late for Estella. The re-written ending, although it pulled at my heart-strings, didn't work for me. The original ending is the only logical, perhaps realistic, ending in light of the events that occur within the story. For you kids who are forced to read it, try it again in a few years. I know your perception will have changed."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I had to read Great Expectations for a class project. I looked at how many pages it was and froze; &quot;How am I ever going to finish this book?&quot; I thought. After about 30 pages I was hooked and read it in a week. The language is old, so if you're young read it with a dictionary, it helps a lot! Dickens did a great job of tieing everything together at the end, and you know he must of had some master plan on what was going to happen!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great expectations is not only a great story filled with mystery, drama and action. Great expectations is a book that points out the personality flaws in all of us. It examines relationships and how they function between individuals. It is a great book and well worth the effort of reading."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is an excellent book. It boosted my vocabulary level up a great deal and contributed to my education. Thanks to Charles Dickens for writing this extrodinary book!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"An extremely beautiful novel that displays human conflicts throughout its length. No wonder it is described as a timeless classic! I loved this book because it had such a greta plot, with all the relations surfacing at the end. The relationship between Pip and Estella is particularily interesting, especially the change at the end. This is a treasurable addition to any collection."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"A book that captivates the ideals of entertainment, Great Expectations is a novel that cannot be put down. Having previously read &quot; A Tale Of Two Cities &quot; for an English topic, I was dissatified with the quality of work that Dickens produced and did not understand the hype surrounding his works and the popularity of sales. Great Expectations has changed my view entirely, as Pip, the protagonist will always be a person that can be related to and felt for. The life of the protagonist experiences many facets of human education, and the outcome is satisfing to himself and to the reader. Dickens has created a true exploration of people and how and who we are. Each chapter ends on a twist and torments the reader into further readings. The life of Pip and the events and characters that involve him work fluently and emphasis this theme. Dickens commonly gives subtle hints of information for the reader to use in working out the complexities of the novel, sometimes leading in the right direction, and other times, in a misleading direction. This keeps the reader informed and eager to process all the facts to conclude their own opinions. The ending is truely &quot; warm-hearted &quot; and acts ideally to conclude the novel. A splendid book not to be neglected from any book collection."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This may be Dickens' finest novel, for while it may lack some of the comic character that animates his other masterworks, it has a focus and coherence unseen elsewhere in his serial novels. Filled with memorable images and the pain of unrequited love and self-reproach, Dickens has invented a superb comment on wealth, on youth, and on life in general. (Youths forced to read it in high school may not understand the pain of looking back until later in life.)"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I, too, languished through this in High School. I, too, vowed never to pick up Dickens again. Then something happened. This is not bragging: it just happened. I grew up. Any intelligence I had mellowed into understanding, a very different faculty. Saddened, changed, I picked up Dickens again. And at last, I understood. Great Expectations isn't a classic for its language, plotting, style or wit. Like all Dickens' work, it is faulted in these areas. It's a classic because of Dicken's passion, which along with Bleak House pours onto the page and if you are at the right time of life, into your heart. So to all the reviewers here who find him problematic, wait a bit. Read a little about the nightmare world he lived in, the choked waterways slimey and poisonous with oil, feces and dye...the dangerous, airless shacks stacked up on each other, the rotten food...when it could be had at all. If you can, too, research a little into the social mores of the day, because what Dickens says about Victorian manners is quite true: virtue was often toggled to wealth in an absurd attempt to justify those unworthies clawing their way to the top of the &quot;Beehive&quot;. Try Dickens again later, when you have grown old. He's a ripping good yarn, but you must forgive him...he sees people as tiny valiant miracles amidst a roiling world of injustice, farcical posturing, physical danger, ignorance and want, and he needs to tell you about it. He often jokes about it, because the society he was writing for was very touchy and required its medicine to be sugar coated. It is only after you've put a Dickens book down that the images--minus the wit--pour over you and like the smoke curling through a Dickens novel it occurs to you you cannot breathe..."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Charles Dicken's novel, Great Expectations, teaches a lot to the reader. The best thing about the story is Dicken's development of plotting and characters. It is about a person who experiences grown and shattered expectations from childhood to teenagehood to adulthood. &quot;Great Expectations&quot; basically means what is &quot;expected&quot; in life: a job, a career, money, marriage, etc. Pip helps a convict, Magwitch, in the beginning, to escape by bringing him a file to file the convict's leg iron. In the second stage of Pip's expectations, Pip has always been thinking that his secret benefactor is a certain Miss Havisham (whom he met in childhood), because he thought that her daughter, Estella, was destined for him. At the end of this stage, the benefactor appears, and Pip finds that it is the convict whom he had helped so long ago!! He is filled with repugnance. And Estella also gets married to his most despised enemy. And he is deeply in debt. Pip's great expectations are shattered to pieces by all of this. Later, Pip has to deal with it in the third stage of his expectations, and the story ends with all the people around Pip married, but with Pip still single. But Estella's husband had done so much evil gambling, and he also died in a horse accident, leaving room for relief from Pip. So, the story isn't exactly a happy ending, but it's better than nothing. This is a GREAT book!!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Our book group decided to read a book by Charles Dickens in this the bicentenary of his birth.

It arrived promptly and also was in described condition."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I know for sure now why Charles Dickens is such a famous author for works other than A Christmas Carol. The reputation of the book and the author speak for themselves. I was overwhelmed with the quality of Dickens' writing, the intricate nuances of the plot and the many surprise twists. The illustrations in the book plus the alternate ending were also bonuses. I could not be more complimentary of this book and plan to read many more Dickens works starting with David Copperfield. Great Expectations is now one of my favorite books of all time."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book is classic Dickens. It's a winner. It lives up to my expectations. Anyone who loves Dickens will enjoy this book. Again we see a young person growing up on the \\"wrong side of the tracks\\" become a hero in his own right. Pip learns many things in his journey and comes to terms with the folks who shaped his understanding, even though they are simple folk."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Dicken's is clearly in a class of his own. Few authors have exhibited and illustrated the breadth and depth of story telling inherent and extant in a Dicken's novel. Dicken's ability to switch tenses and create tension through use of speech and idiom is unparalleled. This is a mature read that requires patience, intellect, and a formidable vocabulary to be fully realized and properly appreciated. Thank you Charles for your formidable and fine effort; well done good and faithful master."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I am amazed that it took me 61 years to get around to reading this book. I wish I had read it a long time ago. The Kindle version is great, though. Even though I am a trainer of English teachers, I found many vocabulary words that were unfamiliar. A right click gives an instant dictionary, and I had to use that feature more than I liked, along with a big font.The characters are amazingly well described, even as they develop chronologically, and although some aspects of the story are predictable (i.e Joseph the blacksmith and Biddy's romance) some are completly unanticipated and surprising.I like the ending in this version- it leaves hopeful possibilities!For free, this is the best bargain I ever purchased- hours of joy- so thank you Amazon..."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I read this book as a freelance. I really enjoyed this book, especially because it isn't cliche. The events that were portrayed in this book were events that a reader would not typically expect. The old english styled language at first was a bit difficult to comprehend the first few chapters, so it took me a while to read them. However, after a couple chapters, I became adapted to the use of language and sentence structure that it became easier to read and comprehend."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Of course, this is a wonderful book, but it is brought to life by the BBC audiobook. I don't know the reader/actor's name, but he is a master at providing individual, dynamic voices for every character - voices with personalities that match the character, as well. It added so much to the enjoyment when compared to other audiobooks read by lesser actors. A MASTERPIECE!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I had not read this book since I was at school many years ago. Enjoyed it just as much as then - some of Dickens books are very hard to get through but this one, along with several others such as a Tale of Two Cities, are easy to read and not outdated as a lot of older books are. I would recommend to any one wanting to read some of the old classics."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great story written by a great author!

Loved it this time (35 years later). I Read it on my Kindle."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Something I feared before reading this book was that it would be a terrific story, but full of cliches. Not so.

Not me. Granted, part of the reason I enjoyed this book so much was because I had expected it not to be (A Tale of Two Cities is still collecting dust on my bookshelf). The writing is flawless; characters, wonderfully varied; and plot, save an occasional feeling of contrivance at the almost uncanny character interconnections, spectacular.Pip, an orphan, lives with his 20 plus years older sister Georgiana \\"Mrs. Joe\\" Gargery, an unhappy woman who \\"rampages\\" on him and her blacksmith husband Joe, a simple, kind man. During an unexpected encounter with a shackled escaped convict, he is coerced into helping the man to prevent bodily injury to himself. It's not the last the boy will see of him. Pip is later asked to visit an eccentric woman (having been left at the altar by a scheming fianc&eacute;), where he encounters the beautiful but cold Estella, a future love interest, and several other central characters. Eventually an anonymous donor provides monetary help to Pip hoping that it will facilitate his becoming a gentleman and a scholar. But as his financial situation changes from meager but adequate to one of relative wealth, his personality transforms from kindhearted and unpretentious to inconsiderate and snobbish. Only through the adversity that follows his attempt to fulfill the expectations of his benefactor does Pip learn some important life lessons.Also good, Mr. Pip by Lloyd Jones (wish I hadn't read it before GE), An American Tragedy by Theodore Dreiser, and The Woman in White by Wilkie Collins."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"When I was a teenager, I loved Dickens. In later years, however, I abandoned Dickens for more overtly \\"intellectual\\" authors. The wonderful thing about great books is that they do not suffer from multiple readings. Returning to Great Expectations after maybe 20 years was a delight. It is simple, accessible, gently humorous and heartbreaking. Dickens' love of language is simply a joy to experience. The novel is beautiful, effusive and yet tinged with Pip's own discomfort of class and self. Dickens holds his own as the Master Storyteller of the 19th Century."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"All the standard Dickensian motifs are present in this book: deus ex machinae, factitious coincidences, longueurs, inventive names, an empathy towards children in a world of pompous adults, and sheer expository brilliance.Dickens paints a picture in your mind...you see the country, smell the air, and hear the voices of the characters as if they are actually speaking. This being Dickens, you must allow for some patness in the plot...grant that, and then you can enjoy the genius of his phrases, metaphors, characterizations, and recounting of the absurd.(Wopsle's go at Hamlet in London should have you laughing out loud.)This is an excellent book...a classic."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"A dark night. A pair of escaped convicts; a young boy named Pip who is seven years old. Pip helps the convict Magwitch with food and drink. Magwitch is sent in chains to banishment in distant Australia. Pip living at the forge of Joe Gargery and Pip's sister (Joe's wife) becomes an apprentice blacksmith. Pip also meets the enigmatic Miss Havisham who dresses in a yellow wedding dress lamenting her lost love. At Satis her estate he encounter Estella (star) who becomes the love of his life. Estella is as cold as an Eskimo and her heart as icy as Mt. Everest. He also meets Herbert Pocket who becomes his best friend.In part two we see Pip moving to London as he and Herbert become dissolute, fall into debt and live shallow lives.In part three secrets are revealed which make Pip a good man. We learn that it was the convict Magwitch who provided the funds needed to allow Pip to go to London and work for Mr. Jaggers the lawyer. We discover who is the father and who the mother of Estella. We learn what happened to Magwitch and all other mysteries are revealed. To give these secrets away in this review would ruin the pleasure of reading this classic novel.Great Expectations is a bildungsroman which is darker and more inttrospective that Dickens earlier David Copperfield of 1850. In it we see Pip grow from a selfish callow boy to a man who has suffered, helped others and been reunited with his lost love.Along the way we meet such immortal characters as Joe Gargery and his loving wife Biddy; the tragic Miss Haversham; the evil Orlick and Compeyson and the complex convict Magwith.The novel is cinematic in its ending as Magwitch returns to England to see how Pip is doing as a young man who has lived on the convicts benevolent financial bequest.Some critics believe that Estella is a representative of Dickens mistress Ellen Ternan. The novel is well plotted and moves quicker than many Dickens novels. This 1861 novel is narrated in the first person by Pip and was the last completed novel in the prolific Boz's illustrious career.Great Expectations should be read by everyone who loves English literature and Charles Dickens."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is a wonderful story that Everyman's Library has place in great binding."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"If you have a student who either hates to read or struggles to read I would highly recommend this audio book. This unabridged version brings the Dicken's story to life. There are 16 CD's to listen to, but it is an enjoyable experience."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Dickens's Great Expectations is a novel of exceeding quality with, perhaps, only a few minor flaws that fail to significantly detract from the overall greatness of the work. Were I able to, I would give the book four and a half stars, rather than the four I've assigned it. As other reviewers have already amply commented on the book's numerous merits, I should like only to point out , what I thought to be, its foremost shortcoming. Although intentional by Dickens, I found my extreme dislike of Pip for much of the book to be a nuisance, chiefly because, as narrator, Pip set the tone of the narrative. It can be difficult not to equate the loathing of the narrator with the book itself. Luckily enough this was not a particularly prominent failing, and did not heavily tax me. Besides this, I found the book to be splendid, particularly during the bits concerning Joe and Mr. Wemmick, who were, at times, heartwarming and emotionally evocative to an extreme degree. In short, Great Expectations is one of Dickens's greats, with only minor, easily overlooked flaws."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"It is impossible to exaggerate the satisfaction this book gives to its reader and the power of its deep human sympathy. If you were to read only ten books in your lifetime, Charles Dickens' GREAT EXPECTATIONS should be one of them.If you were to listen to just one audiobook in your life, Frank Muller's narration of Great Expectations should be it. One of the most complimentary things that can be said of such a performance is that it leaves you feeling that the work can be read only in that way. Muller accomplishes this, with the curious and endearing twist that Pip's own narration comes with an American accent, while all others speak in the unforgettable idiom of their place among the English classes and subclasses. Muller on Dickens is a triumph that even Dickens would have applauded.Now, for the book. The personae will stay with you forever. Pip himself. The deeply generous Joe Gargery. The immortally beautiful Estella, her heart in the end made soft through suffering. Miss Havisham, too terrible to believed but in the end redeemed from her lake of bitterness, if her cry, 'What have I done?!' is to be taken innocently. Wemmick and the Aged P, then - belatedly, Miss Skiffens the gloved. Herbert, then Herbert and Clara.Jaggers, about whom one is left to ponder, 'Who *is* this man?'Dickens and Muller are at their best with scoundrels. Expectations provides them no shortage of villains upon whom to practice. Pumblechook. Bentley Drummle. Old Orlick. Compeyson, about whom the best thing said is that he has drowned.Dickens' keen eye for the glory and the pathetic depths of humanity is almost unparalleled in English literature, with apologies to his critics. He knows that there are Gargeries and Biddies and Herberts. He understands this without for a moment denying the hell in human hearts that is comprised by the likes of Pumblechook with his false respectability and Orlick with his violent, drooling hatreds.He has comprehended that heaven - if he believed there is such a place - is likely populated by people surnamed Havisham, Jaggers, and Magwitch, who perhaps dance the more vigorously for having been much forgiven.Yet writing *about* Dickens and his worlds takes time that could be spend on reading Dickens and of his worlds.For that you'll need to pick up Great Expectations."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Michael Page gives a wonderful performance that brings \\"Great Expectations\\" to life. I have a minor complaint regarding the editing of the CD -- several of the chapters had the last word or two of narration cut off.Note that this is a MP3 CD which cannot be used in standard audio CD players."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book illustrates how we have great expectations when we're young. It tells how we get older, our expectations seldom materialize completely."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Don't waste the classics on kids. I remember having to read and write book reports on musty old classic books in school, dull and boring. Now I am ready to enjoy these books. Great Expectations shows how much of our lives are lived on incomplete information. The hero assumes that he knows who is guiding and helping him to live and grow beyound his simple beginnings, only to discover at the end that nothing he assumed was true. The hero does live up to the expectations of his benefactor, and beyond the expectations of many others. He also finds out what it is to be given a better future and how much you owe to those that believe in you. I enjoyed this story and recomend you read (reread) this enlighting story of growing up."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great book! Very deep reading - life lesson with so much meaning.

I am re-reading this book again after 12 years.What an amazing gift we have inherited from Charles Dickens. I am enjoying revisiting the Victorian society again."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I was compelled to read Dickens (\\"A Tale of Two Cities,\\" in my case) in eighth grade and decided that I didn't like his writing. I managed to avoid Dickens and the Victorian novelists for several years, even as an English major. It wasn't until I was in my mid-20s that I read \\"Great Expectations,\\" and I'm glad that was so, because I was finally ready to appreciate Dickens. If you've ever picked up a Dickens novel and put it back down with relief, you might try again in a few years. If you do, \\"Great Expectations\\" is an excellent choice for meeting, or for encountering again, this amazing author.Like \\"David Copperfield,\\" this novel is written throughout in the first person, and follows the title character from childhood to adulthood. The first-person point of view gives the story vividness and impact, as we see everything that unfolds through Pip's eyes. The difference between the perspective of Pip the boy and Pip the adult, looking back and writing, colors the plot and creates suspense.There are many possible reasons to read this book (other than having it assigned to you, of course).You could read it for its astonishing characters -- Miss Havisham, defiantly moldering away and shut up in her never-used wedding finery; Magwitch, the escaped convict with a backstory you'd never expect; Joe Gargery, the blacksmith whose external roughness is matched only by his inner tenderness; Estella, as self-divided and self-destructive as she is beautiful. You could read it for its settings -- the spooky marshes, the busy streets of London, the gothic horrors of Satis House. You could read it for the plot -- the hidden connections, unexpected reversals, and ambiguous endings. You could read it for its social criticism -- the comprehensive view of working-class, middle-class, and upwardly-aspriring characters; the insight into what people will do to themselves and others for money; the unsparing look at ideas of gentility versus actual nobility of character. You could read it for its language -- the idiosyncratic dialects, the indelible scenes, the variety of prose rhythms Dickens employs.In the end, there are two main reasons to read this novel: pleasure and wisdom. \\"Great Expectations\\" is of its time without being dated, and can be enjoyed as a satisfying story. The themes Dickens addresses are timeless, and speak to the 21st century as forcefully as they spoke to the 19th.This isn't my all time favorite Dickens novel -- that would be \\"Bleak House,\\" followed by \\"David Copperfield\\" -- but it's one of his best. If you've never tried it, or if it's been a while since you did, give it a try. You may well become a Dickens addict."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"The DK series of classics are great!

I loved the book then, and I love the book now. It is easily one of the best books that Dickens' has written and well worth the read for everyone.

Charles Dickens is one of my favorite authors of all time next to Sparks, Crichton, Irving, Brewer, and Bradbury. The story follows the inheritance into wealth of a fourteen year-old in 18th century England. Told with detail, finesse and a mystery that will keep you hooked, don't miss out on this first rate literary experience.The young orphaned Pip, the sensual Estella: the boy's love interest, the enigmatic and vengeful Miss Havisham in her bridal wear. These are images you will never forget. Pick up a copy (unabridged if you can) and loose yourself in this carefully and masterfully wroght world.I also recommend John Irving's works, mainstream fiction, and Dandilion Wine by Ray Bradbury. Also look for the edition with the forward by Irving and the original ending.Check them out and buy while prices are cheap!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations read by Michael Page, unabridged on 16 audio CDs, was a great listening experience. I've had my copy of the book on the shelf for years, but never got around to reading it. Unfortunately, I spend more time driving than reading. Michael Page did a fine job reading all the roles with distinctive voices for each character, male and female. The total listening time was about 20 hours. There were many tracks on each CD. So if your CD player only remembers which track was playing when you stopped it, then probably the most you will have to repeat when you re-start the disk would be about 40 seconds. The recording quality was good, but the duplication process less than perfect. There was 1 disk out of the 16 that had some \\"popping\\" sounds. I do not know if every copy of the audio book will have 1 disk with some static, but my copy did. It was a little annoying, but was not too bad. The audio book was produced by Brilliance Audio of Grand Haven, Michigan. The bio on the box says that Michael Page is a Professor of Theater at Calvin College. I was impressed and entertained by his reading. He did sound British!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"\`Great Expectations' is one of my favourite Charles Dickens', second only to A Tale of Two Cities. Those who are not habituated to his style of writing may find it a bit difficult, but eventually that hurdle too would be overcome and the reader can enjoy the work of one of the finest authors of all time to its fullest.Phillip Pirrip was an orphan living with his dominating elder sister with no great ambition for the future, other than to become a blacksmith like his brother-in-law, Joe Gargery. But that was before he inherited a large amount of money from a mysterious benefactor. Now, leaving behind his shallow ambitions and old acquaintances, Pip follows his dream of becoming a \`gentleman'. Then maybe the beautiful but cold-hearted, Estella, the ward of the eccentric Miss Havisham, would accept his love for her. But will the unsolved mysteries of his past hinder him from fulfilling his \`Great Expectations'?Though Great Expectations first appeared in Dickens' weekly magazine, All the Year Round, more than a century back the story and the characters of the book still live on. Like all other books by Charles Dickens \`Great Expectations' too, does not just tell a story but also gives a message to its readers. Pip after coming into his inheritance starts ignoring his old friends because he feels that they are inferior to him, little realizing that they were the ones who loved and cared for him when he had no money. This situation is not something unique or something that can be related to only by the people of that time. This happens with almost every one of us. Once we achieve our goals we conveniently forget about those who helped us reach that goal. The way Dickens' has woven this message in his unforgettable story makes the book all the more beautiful. One thing I liked about this book is how all the seemingly unconnected characters seemed to fit together like the missing piece of a jigsaw puzzle by the end. What makes this book truly unforgettable is its characters. Every character of the book has an eccentric side to them. The only character that I think is \\"normal\\" is Pip and I did not find him interesting at all (I like eccentric characters. Am I weird?). Maybe that's how the author wanted it to be. Though the book has only a few female leads, they are the ones who steal the limelight. The eccentric Miss Havisham who sits in a room with a rotting wedding cake, wearing her wedding dress seemed more alluring to me than any of the other characters. It was her eccentricity that truly attracted me to her. If she had been some old, moody spinster, I would not have liked her half as much.Though I have repeated the point more than once, but \`Great Expectations' is truly an unforgettable book. Combined with prolific writing and memorable characters, this book is something which should be read at least once by all.Favourite Quotes:\\"Suffering has been stronger than all other teaching, and has taught me to understand what your heart used to be.

Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"To say Great Expectation is \\"Classic\\" novel is an understatement! We were forced to read portions of this novel in the ninth grade. I can honestly say I hated it! I found it weird and difficult. I am now 55 and decided it was time to check out Charles Dickens and find out what all the fuss was about. Having completed two of his greatest novels, Great Expectations and David Copperfield, I am a Dicken's fan for life! As an author, I realize how much I have missed. I love the old-english style of writing, the great history of Britain, and the downhome stories of boys, which seems to be Mr. Dicken's love. I am sadly impressed of the mistreatment of children of that era and am surprised that any were able to rise to achievement. What was true then, is true now - if we are to achieve anything in life - no matter our past, we must pull ourselves up by the boostraps and become... Excellent read. I enjoyed watching Pip come full circle from a poor boy to wealth to realizing a simple, honest life is to be desired.

This is the worst, yet! I don't understand why students have to read classics that people rarely understand! I thought the book was pointless with nothing to look forward to while you're reading. Many books have a strong structure and basis where you want to know what will happen next, which keeps you reading on. This story has no meaning and Charles Dickens is going no where with this. Not to mention the characters are just plaing weird. Where in the world did Dickens get a bizarre lady like Miss Havisham, who is practically ill in the head? I would never recommend this book because it was boring, time consuming, and I can rarely consentrate on what I was reading. I'm glad I got over reading this. I'm sure the only people who read this book is the ones who are forced to, like myself. If I can give this book's rating as a no star, I would.

This ranks with Catch-22 and Huckleberry Fin as one of the worst novels yet published in the English language. Was there a plot? No. Don't kid yourself. The fool author made it up as he went along not caring if it made sense or if the characters had any meaning. I hate this novel with a passion so great it scares even me. I'd like to see all copies burned. Okay, not really. That's a little extreme. But, at least take this garbage out of school curriculums. Its' making us stupid, making us believe Pip's world is what the world really is. Pip if a fool that got dumped too many times and where's the sex. Was Dickens scared of it. I believe that all great novels should have sex in them. It brings some humanity to them . Great Expectations is a fantasy on level with the Bible but worse, tragicly worse."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations was a mediocre book. I was not impressed. I had to read this book for my 9th grade honors English class. It was too long and boring. I see were Dickens was trying to go with the suspense, but it just made the book monotonous and boring. The uncanny coincidences just did not seem real. It's ok to use a coincidence as a tool of suspense, but this was just overkill. Every chapter was boring. I got tired pretty quickly of pip wishing he were with Estella for the whole book. Also, the book seemed to stray away from the main point for chapters at a time. Who cares about Wemmick's stupid plays? This could all be summed up in a couple of page short story. In conclusion, this is another swing and a miss for Dickens. STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS BOOK!

I usually fly through novels within a few days, but getting through this one is likened to going through a maze in the dark. I give it two stars because I do think the plot was interesting, but the execution was abominably horrible. I actually had to have a dictionary next to me in order to understand all the weird words Dickens used, words such as 'peppercorny' and 'farinaceous.' Now, I usually pride myself on having quite an excellent English vocabulary, but I felt utterly lost when trying to read this book. Some of the dialogue was completely unfathomable and pointless, and about a quarter of the time I did not have a clue as to what he were talking about. Many of the characters were annoying, Mr. Pumblechook for example. I cringed during the chapter when he saw Pip, after Pip had become a gentleman, and the stupid man kept saying \\"May I? May I?\\" Ugh. There was so much this book could have done with out; the endless pointless descriptions, the useless minor characters, and the stupidity of some of them was unbearable. What I mean by that is Miss Havisham's voluntary reclusive existence; I mean, how can somebody live like that without going completely insane, just sitting in the dark day after day, wearing the same clothes, and throwing her life away for a man who was only after her money? Stupid and lame that was, if mildly noble (her behavior). I cannot understand why Dickens is so praised as a writer. His plot may be good in this book, but it is terribly written. I have made two attempts in my life to read this book. The first time, I got about halfway through and had to stop because it was about as enjoyable as plucking my eyebrows. A few years later, the second attempt got me to about the 42nd chapter, but again, my interest fizzled out. I do not think I will ever finish this book, and would only advise reading it if you have trouble sleeping, because it will knock you out fast. As a final note, I could not get through Oliver Twist either.

Nonetheless, I'll make two points about \\"Great Expectations\\", which is the first Dickens novel I've read since my adolescence. (Kennedy was President, alas.)First, I'll say that the characters in this book are affecting exaggerations and not quite real. For example, Joe Gargery, the blacksmith, is touching in his decency and saintly in his generosity. But Dickens gives him no rough emotional edges, and so he never rises beyond rustic sentimentality. Likewise, Hebert Pocket, Pip's friend, is a lovely young man but exists in friendship with out making any demands. And, there is the resolute and controlling Mrs. Havisham and her pathetic martyrdom. Yes, she was hurt by a man. But, it's hard to imagine a person living in the filth and disorder of her mansion, unless she is crazed, like a modern street person. To sum this up, I'd say that his characters are not really persuasive, even though they resonate emotionally.Second, I was surprised by the near total lack of visual effects in the writing. Early on, there's a moment of visual writing when young Pip is in the cemetery. But thereafter, this element is all but lacking in the book. Even after several re-readings, for example, I could never quite see Magwitch tumble into the river.Regardless, I enjoyed the read and did not find it discursive or too long. Go for it!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I liked this book even though sometimes I couldn't understand it. Charles Dickens used a lot of words he didn't need to, and he used a lot of big words that needed to be looked up. There was a lot of parts that I did not understand. Otherwise it was a pretty good story when I knew what was going on. I would recommend this book to other people because you learn about the lifestyles back then."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This novel was pretty good. I liked how everyone's lives in it were somehow connected. I also liked how Pip matures and learns the big lessons of life.One thing I didn't really like about it was that it was hard to understand. The English dialect was hard to follow, all the different names were hard to sort out, and there were manyold-time-ish and confusing words. But other than the confusion, the story line was great and Dickens wrote it really well and brought everything and everyone in the book together nicely. All of the characters were fun to read about and Dickens made them seem interesting and some very weird. I would recommend this book to anyone because it seems like anyone could connect with the characters in this book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book seems interesting as you would expect from Dickens, but I must admit that i found it boring. I only got past the first chapter, and found my self asleep. I think that the plot is a good structure that could be updated very well.

While not as emotionally satisfying as the earlier &quot;David Coppefield,&quot; it is nevertheless tighter, more compact, and displays a greater maturity and discipline of writing style on Dickens' part. Those who feel 'Copperfield' has all the characters, take note of the ensemble here-- Pip, Joe Gargery, Biddy, Mr. Jaggers, Uncle Pumblechook, Abel Magwitch, Estella, and the novel's haunting, living spectral figure, Miss Havisham. The intertwining of these lives, the playing out of these destinies, combined with its memorably Gothic beginning and unsettling ambiguous ending make &quot;Great Expectations&quot; a pleasure to read for both its narrative power and literary craftsmanship. Considered by many to be Dickens' &quot;best rounded&quot; story, I concur by offering this example. Having finished the novel, I craved a viewing of David Lean's brilliant 1947 film. I ended up by mistake with the Ethan Hawke Gwyneth Paltrow 1998 remake. I decided to give it a try, and was so enraptured by the look of the film and its grasp of the material I stayed with it. Not as satisfying as Lean's film, to be sure, but it works.

In classical Dickens style, Chuck makes a good social commentary or stirs some good emotions, yet does it way too slowly.

Dickens is accused of being &quot;wordy,&quot; and I see why: British authors were often paid by the word and length of their novels and short stories.

Both are wonderful."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations is a magnificent metaphor of humanity vs. life. It is the story of what each of us would probably do if placed in the situations Pip deals with. There are love, friendship, and warmth, which are nearly destroyed by obsession, discontent, and the desire to keep up appearances during the course of this powerful novel. These seemingly necessary emotions and acts of something near betrayal are finally exposed as cheap and worthless when the hero's true benefactor is known in the end. Pip, the main character, is something like all of us, and the people he encounters are very likely to be similar to those we encouter in our own lives."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I found that this novel was quite wonderful, really.

That convict has escaped with another, his enemy convict. They are captured in the end but the convict whom Pip aided gives Pip 2pounds and a shilling by his fellow convict later on.Then, Pip is taken to a rich lady, Miss Havisham&iexcl;s and meets proud and heartless Estella whom he falls in love with. Born in a quite a poor family in the country, he tries to be clever so that Estella does not call him common, and quite succeeds. And plus, fortune lays itself in his way by an unknown rich person. A lawyer, Mr. Jaggers knows the provider of the fortune but does not tell Pip who it is because the provider&iexcl;s wish is to let him/herself known when he/she is ready for it. And Pip goes off to London.In London, Pip is introduced to Mr. Matthew Pocket, a relation of Miss Havisham for Mr. Pocket is to be Pip&iexcl;s tutor. Pip lives with Mr. Pocket&iexcl;s son Mr. Herbert Pocket whom he had met before at Miss Havisham&iexcl;s when a child, and becomes very acquainted with him. His other acquaintance is Mr. Wemmick, who works for Mr. Jaggers. He has a different life at work and at home, that makes him peculiar. All this time Pip thinks that the &iexcl;unknown provider&iexcl; of his fortune is doubtlessly Miss Havisham and thinks that she wants Estella and him to be married. However, he finds out that in fact it is not Miss Havisham who gave him his fortune but the old convict he had helped! That convict had escaped again and fled to Australia where he had worked for Pip and had become an owner of quite some money which was given to Pip. And now he comes to Pip and tells him. So that convict is known to Herbert as well and they live together.Now, when Pip was young, his parents had died so he lived with his sister&iexcl;s family. Joe, his brother-in-law is a good friend of his, a blacksmith, but his own sister is not very nice to him. A man called Orlick, who was Joe&iexcl;s helper, thinks very ill of Pip&iexcl;s sister and one day, hits her on the head and makes her a simpleton and she dies after some years. That man Orlick, tries to murder Pip for false reasons but fails for Pip&iexcl;s friends save him.The convict, if captured, would be hanged, therefore, Pip decides that the convict should be out of England as soon as possible and that Pip should accompany him. They plan it, and it proceeds. Meanwhile, Estella is married to a quite rich man and Miss Havisham is dead. The other convict who had escaped with Pip&iexcl;s that long time ago, Pip&iexcl;s convict&iexcl;s foe, follows Pip and the convict on their way out of England and tries to capture them. There is a fight underwater, Pip&iexcl;s convict is alive but is soon captured by the police and his foe is dead underwater. Pip&iexcl;s convict, named Magwitch or Provis is deeply wounded, and dies in prison. Before he dies, Pip finds out that Estella was adopted by Miss Havisham and that her father is Provis, so tells Provis that and that Pip loves his daughter. After that, Provis dies.Pip has an old acquaintance in the country, his hometown, a lady named Biddy. He decides to propose to her, now that Estella is gone, and leaves to the country only to find that Biddy is already married to Joe! He congratulates them and thinks about another little Pip to be in that house, just like he was when he was young. He then departs abroad to where Herbert works, for when Pip was a possessor of a fortune, he had secretly found Herbert that job, and Herbert, not knowing the provider of such a job had invited Pip to be a clerk. Pip lives abroad for eleven years, meanwhile Herbert marries and Pip becomes their &iexcl;partner in the House&iexcl;.After those 11years, he returns to Joe and Biddy&iexcl;s abode where he finds himself there! Named Pip after Pip was a little boy! Pip is warmly greeted, and after dinner, Biddy, who knows all about Estella for Pip had told her when he was young, asks if he surely does not fret for her? Pip replies that he thinks not, but anyway, revisits Miss Havisham&iexcl;s old house. The buildings are taken down, but among the ruins, stands Estella! Her husband had died most unfortunately because of a horse but even before his death, her marriage was not led to be a happy one. For all Pip knew, she was married again, but she was not. Pip and Estella converse about their interests, and Pip says, &iexcl;We are friends.&iexcl; To which Estella continues, &iexcl;And will continue friends apart.&iexcl; Then there is a nice little paragraph, which, if I am not quite mistaken proves that they are married.When I was reading this fantastic novel, I saw a lot of things. On my reading of pre-20th century novels, I only encountered those which were in third person, or first person, but &iexcl;I&iexcl; as a girl, not a boy. Great Expectations was something new, for I had thought that a boy liking a girl is to be quite different from a girl liking a boy and a boy&iexcl;s thoughts about poverty and being ignorant is to be quite different from a girl but I found out that it&iexcl;s quite the same. I mean, it depends on one&iexcl;s character and personality of course, but I found out that some boys do not like telling lies or stealing as much as girls and adults do not. It is a fantastic novel, an excellent read, and although the ending is not originally Charles Dicken&iexcl;s idea, I think Dickens made a great decision to follow what his friend suggested. For the original ending was a sad one, which would have made the reader very unhappy for Pip, whereas the new ending gives some hope and happiness to the reader. I read from a book on Great Expectations that the title, Great Expectations, meant not only Pip&iexcl;s expectations but the reader&iexcl;s of Dickens&iexcl; novels&iexcl; expectations. I surely think that those expectations were rewarded to perfection."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I was forced to read Great Expectations in the ninth grade, and i am still in the ninth grade, so yeah.

Of course, the moral of the story is, even when you have everything you want, money still cannot buy you love nor necessarily happiness.Other than that, this is yet another one of Charles Dickens' reads, that is classical, and will help expand on your vocabulary, and build on reading comprehension. My opinion is if we can understand the story that Charles Dickens has created ever so descriptively here, and in other stories, then we will understand present day literature, as it appears much easier to comprehend (from my personal perspective)."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Really good book.

The book starts out when he is 8 years old and he is in a grave yard when an escaped convict comes up to him and demands that he get him some food and a file, so he can get out of his ankle cuffs. Pip does as he is asked and doesn't tell a sole like he had sworn too. The story then continues to follow Pips life as he gets older.This book is an English novel written by Charles Dickens. Charles Dickens wrote many books, of which a couple are required reading by English classes. Great Expectations is a well written book in which the surroundings, characters and noises are well described. Although Great Expectations is well written I feel that the story is a little slow to pick up and, it is hard to become engrossed into the book because it seems a little monotone. In later chapters you can also guess at what might be coming next.Great Expectations though slow to pick up, does have a good, solid story line and can be entertaining to read once you pass the first chapter. This would not be a good book for people who like action books or books with a lot of twists and turns that keep you reading to see what comes next. But if you like a slower paced book with maybe a hint of love in it with a less gripping more predictable out come then Great Expectations would be a good pick."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Well, unlike the multitudes in America, I was NOT forced to read \\"Great Expectations\\" in high school or at any other time. However, lately it seemed like it was time to pick up this old classic and to dig into its treasures.The story starts out with an unlikely scene in a graveyard in a small English village. There we meet a little boy named Pip, who is visiting the gravesites of both of his parents. There we also meet a desperate convict who is cowardly enough to scare the little boy half to death in order to get some food and other items. Pip - an earnest, battered little orphan being raised by his sister and brother-in-law - anxiously sets out to please this convict. And so starts the tale of Pip's life.After the convict scene, Dickens takes his time in setting up exactly what Pip's life was like as he was groomed to take his brother-in-laws place as the blacksmith in the town. Dickens' genius for wit, along with some very likeable characters, help pull the reader through the endless pages of details and slow action.Soon, however, Pip's fortunes change...and then they change again...and then yet again. Yet, while the storyline somewhat resembles a roller coaster, the pacing is so slow that one is never overwhelmed by the action. In fact, I was rather underwhelmed by the amount of action there was for the number of words I was reading.Even so, I would say that this book is worth the effort. Dickens explores human nature of an average man when beset by a number of unusual situations, each one building on the last. Pip is likeable in these scenarios because he is never obnoxiously perfect or unaffected by his changing fortunes. In some ways, he \\"learns his lesson\\" by the end. In others, he does not.While Dickens tackles some rather weighty issues in this book, he does so in his distinctive, chipper, witty manner. Thus, one never really understands the emotional depths that the characters experience due to either their oppressive or their opulent fortunes. But, of course, one does not go to Dickens for emotional depth. One reads Dickens for explorations of tough circumstances with happy endings. If that is what the reader wants, Dickens is probably as able to handle the issues as anyone."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"* * * * * * * * *&quot;Heaven knows we need never be ashamed of ourtears, for they are rain upon the blinding dustof earth, overlying our hard hearts.

However, Dickens was apparently paid by the word. Especially the silly ones, like &quot;prithee&quot; and &quot;vittles&quot;. It is time that we stopped attacking freshmen honors students with this pretentious book, which serves only to drive them away from English forever. Nowhere near the best of Dicken's work, the book reads like a 19th century soap opera, without bathroom breaks and Snuggle-bear commercials. By the time the first interesting character returns to the novel, the reader is lucky if he or she hasn't choked to death on tears of frustration. Why is Estelle such a b****? Why is Ms. Havisham such an old hag? Why is Pip so utterly slackjawed that he permits 20 years of idiocy to be perpetrated upon his stale English carcass? Why, after all, doesn't his benefactor take care of business, murder the lot, and turn this into something vaguely enjoyable? Never mind the fact that Dickens couldn't choose an end, he apparently couldn't even choose a plot, wavering wildly between romance and mystery and the sort of English politics that Michael Palin would love to throw his pasty-white Anglo-Saxon hands about and throttle. Especially the politics. Do we really care about how an English attorney carries himself when we're 15 years old? Not bleeding likely. Powdered wigs and leg stockings sum up the bizarre nature of the staying power of this novel. It's about time that High School English teachers stopped telling one another how *good* this book is, and read it themselves, without the Norton Critical Teacher's Edition beside them. Especially when they have the advantage of alcoholic beverages."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I'm an eighth grade student forced to read this book for English class. Most people would probably assume that the book sucks. Guess what? It does. I'm sorry, but Charles Dickens does not happen to be my cup of tea. He may be a master, but it's impossible to deny that his writing is dry and the story drags in many places. I counted numerous parts of the novel that could have easily been eliminated without affecting the rest of the book. And what the h*** is Pip thinking at the end when he decides to marry (person who I will not name)? Seems to me his only reason for doing this is that he's completely desperate and tired of chasing after Estella all that time. It totally came out of nowhere and wasn't very realistic. The book's really not that bad, but apart from the interesting episodes with Miss Havisham, it's pretty boring."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Some may call me a classic book snob, but here it goes.Great expectations may be at times tedious and I won't deny that, but it is worth it.Charles Dickens goes into great depth of detail and at times a bit overly detailed and I'm sure that is where many people get lost. But if you get the main plot, then you can get the jiff of it.The characters in this book transcend time.Pip, the poor boy who finds himself wondering if he can love old Joe know that he is rich.Estella who cannot love truly but yet brought up to love and destroy.Miss Havisham, the old rich woman who had her heartbroken and know is trying her best to seek revenge.Joe, Biddy and others also play a pivotal role.The story itself plays on the role of moral and also mercy. It shows a colorful and at times exaggerated array of feelings. From grief to greed, to deceit and happiness.Pip, a lonely orphan and living with his sister, finds and help a criminal. Although it was not completely of his own will.Then Pip is introduced to the sad and luxurious world of Miss Havisham where he met Estella, the girl he loved from then on.From then on he resents his meager living until one day he finds out that he had just inherited a large fortune.Then on Pip goes on a quest to truly become a gentleman and win Estella's heart.But how can he win Estella's heart when she doesn't have one?Can he really forsake his family for money?Who gave him that money?"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"The kindle text is fine, but please be alerted that the link provided to get the free audiobook takes you to some japanese website that has nothing to do with Great Expectations that I could find."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is a really good new book.

However, I find that while its messages are eternal, Dickens's style is very off-putting. Don't get me wrong, his prose is very, very beautiful, and his characters are layered in a way that many modern novelists seem to forget. Yet his descriptions are extraordinarily, unnecessarily lengthy. It's a novel, not a travel magazine. Considering that Dickens wrote this novel as chapters to be published weekly in a newspaper, it's unsurprising how drawn-out the descriptions are (higher word count = higher profit). Also, by compiling all of his entries into one novel, you find repetition creeping in as you realize he redoes all of the unpleasantly elaborate descriptions from the previous few chapters over again. It's disappointing to read a book that takes you for either a dunce, or someone with short-term memory loss."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Ordered Great Expectations because it has been many years since I originally read it as a requirement for a literature class.

While, admittedly, it took me roughly 150 pages to get any enjoyment out of the novel- once I was in- I was hooked. Pip's journey through life is a very refreshing look at how distorted we let our lives become by focusing on the unimportant. Dicken's ability to slowly alter Pip's views on life, without changing his essential character/morales (Ex. How Pip looks to help his friend in his business pursuits). Some have called &quot;Great Expecations&quot; his masterpiece... but in my opinion, it may be the &quot;Masterpiece&quot; of English Literature.I also wonder why this is required High School reading. While I loved this book at age 28, I think most 16 year-olds would find it unbearable. It seems like such a waist to ruin both the book and Dicken's name on minds that are not ready for such a reading task."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I am definately a fan of Great Expectations (although don't go see the movie made about it with Gweneth Paltrow). I've had to read this book about three times in high school but I enjoyed it every time. My recommendation will probably mean little because if your still in school you will probably have to read it anyways...but I still recommend it."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations was ok, but there were a few things that the author could have done better. First, in my opinion he shouldn't have changed certain characters names around, which can be confusing for some people. There is also illegal activities on the part of some of the characters. Also, even the abridged version of the book is a bit long. Perhaps Dickens could have wound things up in a tighter package for the reader. Dickens plot can be a bit confusing at times, and the reader sometimes is left to piece together the novel for himself.However, this is not a necessesarily a totally boring read. There are several good things about it. Lying is at least partially looked at in a negative light, and steadfast faithfulness among friends is evident among some of the book's main characters. Justice is done to an man for his wrongdoing.Overall, the book is readable but too long. Also, when considering this book, keep in mind that author's back then, are different from authors today. If you like Dicken's works, you might like this book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I was disappointed from the fact that I did not finish the whole book when I was in high school. The plot and the theme of this novel are amazing. I prefer Dickens to stick to his original ending versus the happy and romantic one."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I may be only a 6th grader, but you wouldn't believe how much I enjoyed this book. Charles Dickens having a poor childhood because of the little money his family earned, has written a miraculous book having to do with money. Charles Dickens makes his case for there being a potential for good and evil in everyone. I really enjoyed reading this book and if you are looking for a fabulous book to enjoy, I strongly reccomend you read this."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Charles Dickens has written extrodinary books such as Olivet Twist, David Cooperfield, A Christmas Carol, and of course Great Expectations. You have not read a novel until you have read Great Expectations. It is truly one of Charles Dickens best. In a dramatic story about adventures and drama, Pip faces his greatest adventure. He is trying to reach his goal in life - great expectation. This story has its ups and downs, but otherwise it is dazaling and spectatuliuar. That is why I give Great Expectations two thumbs up."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I haven't finished the entire book yet, but have wanted to read it for years. The modern movie adaption with Ethan Hawke is one of my favorite movies and I always thought it was a beautiful love story with a real human quality. The book is much different then the movie, but however I believe the modern adaption was incredibley well done considering the difference in time. The book is aslow start but once you are adjusted to the language its actually fast paced reading... especially when Estella returns. My first Dickens and won't be my last. I believe everyone should read the classics"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I got this book assigned to me near the first day of high school this year, and just got finished reading it about a week ago. Let me tell you something, if you know about Dicken's life, this story is kinda based on it. Let me also say this book is extremely boring in the beginning, because you are learning the peices of the puzzle, but the second half is excellent, and all the peices of the puzzle came together, which is why this is an excellent book. My favorite character was definetely Miss Havisham. Don't give up on this book!!! This is the kind of book I think needs a small sequel."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I think that the character development alone makes this novel stand out as one of the best novels of Charles Dickens. The plot summary is also well-crafted, with so many characters intertwining in the books final chapters. We see a personality change in not only Pip, but other major characters such as Estella and Miss Havisham, as we find out that they are all connected in some way.This book might be seen as a rather long and detailed book. Some of the details are probably overdone and unnecessary. This is definitely a book that takes some getting used to. However, I think that one of the morals of the book-- understanding your roots and accepting them-- make this a great book to read.The many characters contrast each other in so many ways, and there are so many good and bad characters, that it becomes a fun book to read. However, you must have patience to read a book this long and detailed.I think this book is well-written (some of the language is a little tough), and Dickens exposes his great writing ability and his abilty to deal with a complex plot and make it all come together in Great Expectations."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Charles Dickens was one of the most popular writers of all time, creating some of the best-known characters in English literature. In the book \\"Great Expectations\\", the protagonist and narrator, Pip begins the story as a young orphan boy being grown up by his sister. I like this book, because Charles Dickens takes you right inside the Pip's mind and you live through the events and discoveries of his life with him. Pip is passionate, romantic and somewhat unrealistic at heart. That makes the novel interesting. Of course, you cannot forget the great love story (Pip and Estella). The other characters Magwitch, Miss Havisham, Joe Gargery, Miss Joe, Estella, Mr Jaggers and Mr Wemmick are all unique and special in their way and they add to the novel's richness. Another thing I really liked was how all of the characters are interrelated to each other in ways that you may not discover until you get to the end of the novel. This novel will make you sometimes laugh and sometimes make you feel sad, but it is always entertaining. Latif Dose simplifies the texts. The language is very clear. There are not old English words and this gives the reader much pleasure while reading the novel. I think most young people would like this novel because it's not as hard to read as an other classic books. I recommend Great Expectations to anyone who wants to read a good, classic book because Great Expectations has a little bit of everything in it, mystery, romance and suspense. You cannot easily find all of these properties in other novels, which makes &quot;Great Expectations&quot; a special and a classic one.. That makes this novel very different. It is probably one of the top ten English novels of the 19th century. Some of the passages are beautiful. I cannot forget Pip's response to Estella when she says \\"You will get me out of thoughts in a week.\\""},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I appreciate this edition for its introduction (which is interesting for literature buffs and beneficial for serious students/readers), for the end notes (which are definitely helpful in explaining Victorian allusions and other references for readers who have little or no background or experience with such), for the inclusion of the original ending (which provokes a variety of options for discussion and examination), for the discussion questions, and for the presentation (easy to read pages). My students find this edition less intimidating than some others; overall, this edition seems user-friendly rather than overwhelming (which is often the case with such a long story)."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations is one of Charles Dickens most famous books. Even with Dickens' extremely long r&eacute;sum&eacute; of books Great Expectations maybe the only one read by younger readers because the other are usually mature plots or have extreme length. But, Great Expectations is a \\"great\\" exception.Charles Dickens used a very eloquent vocabulary. His absolute mastery of English makes his book interesting yet difficult to read. Terminology has changed since he wrote the novel, and, in addition to the evolution the language, Dickens was British. This fact changed his wording from typical American English and helped the book be more in character. Dickens also exercises his talent for manipulating words and creating vivid word pictures like these sentences, \\"Mrs. Joe was a very clean housekeeper, but had an exquisite art of making her cleanliness more uncomfortable and unacceptable than dirt itself,\\" and \\"It was one of those March days when the sun shines hot and the wind blows cold: when it is summer in the light, and winter in the shade.\\" These brilliant word pictures make the book a bear to read when quickly read but also makes it brilliantly fascinating when soaked in and read slowly. In short Dickens has the entire language in his hands and works it masterfully into a brilliant weaving of plot.Dickens also knew how to capture his audience. He used a fantastic plot that wove in and out. Even though his plot was almost cheesy, he managed to pull it off without to much \\"cheese\\" suspected. Though I thought this book had too many climaxes, if you think about its original form - serial - then you understand that he had to keep his readers interested. Dickens keeps the plot \\"writhing\\" until the very end where he had a most expected and cheesy ending. The ending seemed rushed and scrambled together. Out of the whole book spanning thirty some years the last eleven are on the last five pages. The plot as a whole was very good. The plot moved the characters along and changed them to be what they are at the end. The characters grew as you read it not only in age but in emotion and focus.Dickens characters are amazing. He captures a lot of emotions and kinds of people in one book. He grasps a boy's changing thoughts until he grows to be a man. The innocent, childish fears of Pip are so easily grasped, and Pip's relations with Miss Havisham completely change him into a self-centered man trying to woo and unlovable woman. He also shows the starkness of humanity when exploited by its own race. Even some of the lesser characters still show the variety of human expression like Joe's nobleness and Wemmick's eccentricism. In all the characters were amazing.As a whole the book is a masterpiece and classic for all generations. Great Expectations will always be close to my heart."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"First of all, in reference to the reviewer who seemed to think the title was inapropos, all I can say is that I hope that they didn't read the book, for such a lack of understanding would be pathetic. I digress. I am here to dispel some myths. Since this book is often assigned in school, and perceived as \\"important,\\" as another reviewer noted, I think a lot of people shy away from it and assume it will be boring or difficult to understand. Dickens' novels, however, work on multiple level. There certainly is important social criticism and a web of subtly laced motifs within this novel, but on the surface, it's just a good read. I read it on a whim and ended up staying up all night to finish it. So, don't dispel this novel and turn to the many vapid works available to you. One piece of advice, read the real ending before the changed ending (though the changed one will appear first). I felt that the original one was far better, more relevant, and sadly invalidated by the changed ending thrust upon me first. Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great expectation was a wonderful classic written by the author Charles dickens. The main character, Pip, grow up in the home of a blacksmith. With both of his parents dead, He lives with his older sister and her husband named Joe. Pip soon meets Miss Havisham and the beautiful Estella that live wish her Pip hoped that Miss Havisham intentions were to make his fortune, make him a gentleman and have Estella to wed. He was wrong, because the social class division leaves Pip a worker, and Estella was a lady. After disappointment, Pip hears news that a secrete benefactor want to make Pip a gentleman and give him a fortune and informs him that he is a man of great expectation. Pip has no idea of who is benefactor is, but heads to London to start his eventful life as a gentleman. Even if Pip work hard for his life but he is getting on well finally.It is a very powerful book that connects with people s live all over. Great expectation is an amazing book in many ways such as the themes, the Character and the writing Themes in this book are very important. They can easily relate to us today. The main point of the book is affection, loyalty and gratitude and friendship are more important than social class, wealth. The Character of Pip made me feel quit e sad. He had a very difficult life but he can improve him self and become a gentleman finally. There are many character of this book. That also made this book very interesting follow"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Probably one of the most memorable Dickens characters, Philip Pirrup is known to most readers as Pip, the 7-year-old boy whom his short-tempered sister raised by hand. Little Pip infers that he has sustained, from as early as his babyhood, a perpetual conflict with injustice. He has known, from the time when he can speak and discern his surrounding that his sister, in her fits of caprice and violent coercion, is unjust to him. It seems to poor Pip that all the endearments in life brushes by him or bypasses him altogether. Fate has ineluctably deprived him of the lightsome hours that make our childhood a time to be remembered like a happy dream through all our after life. The bright side of growing up with his sister's fits of spleen is Pip's friendship with his brother-in-law Joe, who not only has taken him into apprenticeship but sanctified the house Pip calls home that is otherwise sullied by his sister's temper.A chance but terrifying encounter with an escaped convict for whom he brings provisions pilfered from the kitchen cupboard changes the entire course Pip's life. But it is not until he meets the beautiful, cold-hearted and haughty Estella during a summon to a decaying Miss Havisham that he sets his mind to whittle away his coarseness and to become a gentleman, one on Estella's account. The sudden but timely generosity of a mysterious benefactor comes to assist his making of a gentleman and promises a handsome property. The prospect of great expectations not only immediately relieves him from his ordinary sphere of life and frees him from apprenticeship with Joe, but also concurs with his eagerness to abandon his humble origins.GREAT EXPECTATIONS thus follows Pip's new life under his fortune and depicts his education, new relationships, and development through adversity as he slowly dawns on the true nature of his great expectations. The new life does not come without a catch as he finds himself living in a state of chronic uneasiness respecting his perfidious behavior to Joe, whose interference in his life he now regards as disturbance. The more Pip basks in the favor, privilege, and conviviality that is concomitant of his fortune, the more his is convinced of a happier life derived from simplicity and fidelity that only Joe can offer. As he sidles closer to the truth about his benefactor's identity, a revelation for which he is not prepared struck him.GREAT EXPECTATIONS is a story of moral redemption with a prodigal son-like protagonist in the orphaned Pip. The tale is extremely straightforward but is woven with substantial issues he has to deal with. Eager to shred his humble roots, he promptly disavows family and friends at the prospect of a fortune. As the fortune loses its luster and eventually dissipates altogether, he confronts his own ingratitude and learns to love the man who both creates and destroys him, figuratively speaking. Dickens deftly validates Pip's redemption by showing that it produces good deeds as well as good works. This is especially worthy of merit because the novel is told in Pip's first person narrative. Mishandling of the narrative might render the whole tale unconvincing.The proof of Pip's redemption comes laden with good deeds rather than airy words: his clandestine acts of kindness in securing Herbert a partnership in business, and in securing Miss Havisham's respectable opinion of the long-suffering Matthew Pocket, and in his refusing to accept money from Miss Havisham, and most significantly in his love for the man whom has bequeathed him with the fortune."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book was reccomended to me by my mom for me to expand my reading tastes. I was maybe a little hesitant, but I began reading it, and was immediately pulled in by the compelling, quirky characters and the mind boggling plot. Each new character is equally amusing, and their names seem to depict their nature. When I first saw Uncle Pumblechook's name, I was immediately able to guess what sort of a person he was, same with Mr. Wopsle, Mr. Wemmick, Mrs. Joe Gargery, and more. The humor is subtle, but once you get the joke you'll be howling.However, Dickens is certainly not an author who says little when there is an opportunity to say more; in a nutshell, his writing is quite flourid. Ten pages can be a whole lot to get through, not because it is boring, but because it is full of complex words, sentences, and paragraphs, that you'll need a little bit of rest. I felt sometimes like reading it was like an excercise seminar for my mind. But don't let these few words discourage you, it's a great read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"...endless is the error of intimacy.Such is the story of &quot;Great Expectations.&quot; I have to say that Dickens totally floored me with this magical tale of love and pedestals. I don't even know what made me read it. I think I just found it in my mother's house amid throwaways in the attic. Oh no...this is NOT to be thrown away, this treasure of English literature. This is the reason why we read.Pip is an orphan with no prospects in sight. But one day, under the strangest of circumstances, he becomes the veritable ward of an unknown benefactor and hurtles toward the gentlemanly future of high living and culture. Along the way, he is placed in the almost daily charge of the bitter and rich shut-in Miss Havisham, guardian of the irresistable, yet bitchy Estella. Poor Pip spends a great deal of his days partaking in the education of a gentleman, doing the bidding of the witchy Havisham woman and pining after the girl who uses and abuses him. It sometimes seems like this high society training is a big freakin' mistake.Things heat up when he comes across the criminal Magwitch and doesn't turn him in to the authorities. From there on in the piece continues to fill the mind with limitless imagery. The writing style is a beaut and the characters continue to intrigue with every passing page, from the disgustingly prunish Miss Havisham to Pip's dim-witted, but thoroughly likeable father - a man he sadly comes to see as shameful as his education and training strengthens.This is a story of yearning and loss, guilt and foolish pride as one person after another gets a wish granted and regrets it or waits for a train that never comes in. Yet somehow the ending leaves behind a great feeling. This is among my favorite books ever."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I may be only a 6th grader, but you wouldn't believe how much I enjoyed this book.

The painting seems almost perfect for Dickens novel.But on to the novel itself. \\"Great Expectations\\" was the first of Dickens' novels that I read and I had to read several more before I found another I liked anywhere near as much. It is a small work compared to \\"David Copperfield\\" and his other massive English comic novels. It is a much darker work, too with less of the comedic touch.Dickens published and/or edited several magazines and some of his novels were first written as serials to bolster flagging circulation, \\"Great Expectations\\" is one and it shows. The novel grabs you fast and has a story with many surprises and twists along the way. The one drawback to the earlier serializaztion is that the book probably has too many small climaxes and cliffhangersLike many of the other great novels of the 18th and 19th century a modern reader may well find it a little too full of long descriptive passages. I personally feel that it travels along fast enough that you won't notice.I feel a word or two may be necessary about coincidence in the novel, certainly some other reviewers here at Amazon have felt there was too much. The first thing that should be said is that Dickens readers would not have criticised the coincidence, at the time they had a much firmer belief in \\"fate\\" and would have felt that the coincidence showed how much of Pip's tale was fated to be. The other thing worth mentioning is that the coincidence is no less than one can find in quite a lot of modern television if you just explain the plot. We need to ask if the number of coincidences seems unnatural within the book and if the book works. My answer would be that this tale runs along at a fine pace, well written and well worth the read. The coincidence does not detract from the novel.I'd recommend this book to anyone who wants a good, classic read. As one of Dickens shorter works it is also a fine place to start."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"As a student, I had to read this book as a requirement for my junior year summer reading. Being the largest book of them all, I reluctantly started on this one. However, after giving it the twenty-five page test, I found the book terribly addictive. Had I had a more generous time budget, I would have finished the book in two to three days. As it was, it took me over a month. The storyline, with Pip intertwined in a weird emotional triangle with one Miss Havisham and Estella, has the reader wondering &quot;Who is on Pip's side?&quot; and &quot;What the heck is going on with this Estella babe?&quot; The emotions Pip felt, the things he went through, and just the thought of actually having to go through what he did brings tears to the eyes (even mine, which had been dry for years). By reading this book, I even became more in-tune to my emotions. This novel is an excellent piece of literature for any language buff (Dickens is a sheer master of the English language), and for anyone who loves a good tearjerker. Happy reading!!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Another reviewer claims that you have to be at least 21 years old to read this book. Although I don't think it should be \\"forced\\" on schoolchildren (they will only hate it) I read this novel when I was a child and I loved it. I have just re-read it now and I enjoy it all the more. This is my favorite novel by Dickens. It is from his later period and is criticized for being too dark - which, however, makes it more perfect for today's sensibilities. Stephen King cites this work as one of his favorites: he believes that it is this book that brought the gothic novel mainstream.Was there ever a novelist who created more memorable characters than Dickens? Here, we meet perhaps his most intriguing - Miss Havisham. For anyone unfamiliar with the story, I will not spoil it by describing her. The story is similar to parable about the prodigal son - good Pip inexplicably comes into some money and goes off to the corrupting city.AN IMPORTANT THING TO NOTE: Dickens wrote two ending for this book. His friends thought that the original ending was too downbeat and they asked him to come up with a different one. It is the upbeat ending that is the official ending of the novel. However, most critics agree that the original unpublished ending is better. Most modern editions feature the unpublished ending in an appendix. MAKE SURE YOU BUY A COPY THAT CONTAINS THE ORIGINAL ENDING!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations is one of Dickens's later novels, a work of his artistic maturity. The narrative is symbolic rather than realistic. Although, as in most of Dickens and in Victorian literature in general, the plot relies heavily on coincidence, it is acceptable here because the events are true to the internal, psychological, logic of the story.After writing A Tale of Two Cities, which was unique among his novels in that it had none of his trademark humor, Dickens set out to make Great Expectations rich in comic elements. This despite, or perhaps because of, being in a depressed state of mind himself at the time. The conventional critical view is that he largely failed in this attempt, but I strongly disagree. The book is hilariously funny in parts and the main character, Pip, exhibits a characteristically British humour-in-adversity throughout his adventures. There is also the host of minor comic characters that we expect from Dickens. And he for once manages pathos without spilling over into bathos, so there are tears as well as laughter here, sometimes both at once.If you have not yet read any Dickens, this is not a bad book with which to start, although for younger readers (teens) I would recommend Hard Times or A Tale of Two Cities as their first. Great Expectations demands a mature sensibility to appreciate its symbolism and psychological depth. Perhaps because it chiefly concerns the childhood and youth of the protagonist, it is often given to young people to read and is a set text in some High School classes. This is a pity because, in its dark complexity, it is more likely to turn youngsters off, rather than onto, Dickens."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I've never read any Dickens of my own free will. I was forced to read &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; in high school and I thought that was enough for me. However, one day, on a whim, I bought a copy of Great Expectations. I'm not sure what I expected, but I certainly didn't expect to love it as much as I did.Dickens is not a writer to read at a swift pace. Indeed, this novel was written in weekly episodes from December 1860 to August 1861 and, as it was created to be a serial, each installment is full of varied characters, great descriptions and a lot of action which moves the plot along and leaves the reader yearning for more. Therefore, unlike some books which are easily forgotten if I put them down for a few days, Great Expectations seemed to stick around, absorbing my thoughts in a way that I looked forward to picking it up again. It took me more than a month to read and I savored every morsel.Basically the story is of the self-development of Pip, an orphan boy being raised by his sister and her blacksmith husband in the marshlands of England in 1820.Every one of the characters were so deeply developed that I felt I was personally acquainted with each one of them. There was Pip's roommate, Herbert Pocket, the lawyer, Mr. Jaggers, and his clerk, Mr. Wemmick. And then there was the wicked Orlick. The dialogues were wonderful. The characters often didn't actually say what they meant but spoke in a way that even though the words might be obtuse, there was no mistaking their meaning. I found myself smiling at all these verbal contortions.Dickens' work is richly detailed and he explores the nuances of human behavior. I enjoyed wallowing in the long sentences and letting myself travel backwards in time to a different world. However, even with the footnotes, I found myself sometimes confused by the British slang of 150 years ago, and there were several passages I had to read over several times in order to get the true meaning. Of course I was not in a particular rush. I didn't have to make a report to a class or take a exam about the book. This is certainly a pleasure.I heartily recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good read.ting from the secret wealth of Magwitch, who made a fortune in Australia after being transported. Moreover, Magwitch's unlawful return to England puts him and Pip in danger. Meanwhile, Estella has married another, a horrible man who Pip despises. Eventually, with Magwitch's recapture and death in prison and with his fortune gone, Pip ends up in debtors prison, but Joe redeems his debts and brings him home. Pip realizes that Magwitch was a more devoted friend to him than he ever was to Joe and with this realization Pip becomes, finally, a whole and decent human being.Originally, Dickens wrote a conclusion that made it clear that Pip and Estella will never be together, that Estella is finally too devoid of heart to love. But at the urging of others, he changed the ending and left it more open ended, with the possibility that Estella too has learned and grown from her experiences and her wretched marriages.This is the work of a mature novelist at the height of his powers. It has everything you could ask for in a novel: central characters who actually change and grow over the course of the story, becoming better people in the end; a plot laden with mystery and irony; amusing secondary characters; you name it, it's in here. I would rank it with A Tale of Two Cities, Oliver Twist and David Copperfield among the very best novels of the worlds greatest novelist.GRADE: A+"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This review refers to the audio(CD - Brilliance Audio) edition of \\"Great Expectations\\" by Charles Dickens, read by Michael PageThis unabridged audio edition of Dickens' classic superb chronology of \\"Pip's' journey through life going from a poor boy to becoming a man with \\"expectations\\" is simply marvelous.

Dickens has given us a wonderful story, with rich details of the setting and characters that grow and are among the most interesting and magnetic to be found in literature.I don't need to go on and on about the book itself(although I could easily go over my allotted word count here), if you haven't read it yet ,just know you are in for one heck of a literary treat. It is a story that will transport you to another time and place, and you may not want to come back. I will however, talk about this marvelous audio edition. Michael Page is the reader, and what a reading he gives. Just curl up and listen to this master storyteller. Every voice, every nuance is captured. There is no doubt who is speaking as he gives each character the personality and cultural characteristics as Dickens intended. He even does the women wonderfully, without going over the top. In my mind Miss Havisham has always sounded just the way Page portrayed her, Estella as uppity as ever,the humble Joe, along with all the rest.The book is an unabridged reading on 16 discs. each discs has 90 very short tracks(about 45 seconds each), I had no trouble starting up where I left off(when I absolutely had to leave off). I just made a mental note(or you could even write it down) of the track number and disc where I stopped it. The sound quality is excellent, and total running time is about 20 hours. Each disc is in it's own paper CD holder with a clear front so you can see the disc number you are looking for.If you are a fan of this book, this audio edition will give you a fresh read and new appreciation of this fascinating book. If you are experiencing it for the first time, you can't help but to become enthralled.

This is one of my all-time favorite books ever. I had to read it eons ago when I was in ninth grade, and now (14 years later) I am still enjoying it. Every few years I take this one down from my bookshelf to revisit. This is the story of Pip, a small orphaned boy living in poverty in the English countryside with his much older sister and her husband. Pip meets a convict in a graveyard one damp morning and helps him out in the form of some vittles and an iron file. Later in the story, Pip moves from poverty to being a &quot;gentleman&quot; due to the influence of a mysterious, anonymous benefactor. This book tells of his adventures and how Pip's expectations guide him through life. Towards the end of the story, Pip finds out that reality is sometimes very different from what we expect it to be. The characters are what really make this book stand out. Charles Dickens is a master of character development, and his descriptions of Miss Havisham, Wemmick, Joe, and the others is brilliant! The dialogue is great, with the words written the way a commoner would have spoken in England in the 1800's. Another thing I really liked was how all of the characters are inter-related to each other in ways that you may not discover until you get to the end of the novel.This novel will make you laugh and it might make you sad, but it is always entertaining. If you are in high school and reading this book for the first time for English class, keep at it! It may seem difficult at first if you are not used to Dickens, but this book is well worth it! It is truly a gem."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book is not the full version, despite the length. There's no indication of this until you get inside the book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Charles Dickens's acknowledged masterpiece, Great Expectations, is rightly considered one of the greatest novels of all-time. It depth and breadth are staggering, as it follows its protagonist, Pip, from his early childhood through his later life. During the course of his life, we encounter a vast catalog of raw human emotions: love, hate, jealousy, hope, sadness, despair, anger, pity, empathy, sympathy -- and on and on. The story is treasured and revered for many reasons. One of its main strengths is its plot: after a somewhat slow introductory section, Dickens puts his story in fifth gear and delivers a fast-paced and exciting story that gallops along without ever losing interest or clarity. The incredibly complex plotline, full of separate stories and incidents that seem totally unrelated to each other, but are then all harnessed together as the book heads straight toward its denouement, is also full of constant plot twists, which continue up until, literally, the last paragraph. But, of course, as with all of Dickens's major works, it is the characters that make the book. Like Shakespeare, Dickens preferred to have the story develop through the characters, rather than having the characters be mere set pieces inside of an overriding story. And what great characters they are: the perennially paradoxical but essentially human Pip; the bitter and mysterious Miss Havisham; the beautiful and haughty Estella; the simple and saint-like Joe; the kind and benevolent Herbert; the very human convict, Magwitch -- and all of the other wonderful characters. Dickens excelled in creating well-rounded, very human characters who harbored very real and very complex emotions -- that is, human emotions. We identify with Pip as he winds through his life, because we have been there, too -- the disappointments, the surprises, the loves, the anger, the sadness. In whatever way his story may differ from our own, it is still essentially human, as is ours. For all of his complex and paradoxical emotions and sentiments, Pip is a recognizably human character -- and that is why we love him and this book. A masterpiece for the ages, which will endure for years yet to come, Great Expectations is a great book that can be loved by one and all, for, at its heart, is that grain of simple truth that says so much about what is human in all of us -- whether we have great expectations or not."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"The description of Miss Havisham & her home alone is worth two to three stars. This is unlike any other book in the English language, with the possible exception of Emily Bronte's \\"Wuthering Heights?\\" Dickens tells us many things in the begining of the novel that appear out of place or irrelevant, but later those pieces fall into place so that the big picture is revealed.This story runs the gamut of emotions for the reader. Shock, empathy, joy, disappointment, & disdain are all there for the various characters at different times. Multiple plots, detailed descriptions, & ever mutable characters made this a long & entertaining read. This is the story of Phillip Pirrup or Pip. He is a true hardluck case that you root for. His family except for a brother & sister have all passed away. He lives with his sister{a husband beater} & brother in law Joe Gargery in a tiny English village. Oddly for this era, this is one of the few books where fear from a man's perspective is explored. That in itself was refreshing. Along the roller coaster life that Pip finds himself on he meets enigmatic people & gets an anonymous benefactor who helps him reach London to start a better life? Once there life & the nature of Pip himself is radically altered. This is when the title of my review becomes clear. Dickens asks & answers very poignant psychological questions long before Freud was ever heard of."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I chose to write a review of Great Expectations because I wanted to be able to rate a novel &quot;five-stars&quot; without an ounce of hesitation.Context: I'm not by any means some sort of an intellect. Like many people who have read Great Expectations, I was assigned this book in high school. I remember looking to the end of the book, first, to see how many pages there were. I cringed. Then I began to read that first chapter about a boy named Pip who meets the convict looking for vittles.I won't give anything away about the plot. I only want to say that this was the first book that I ever read that I had me truly absorbed. I remember a kid in my class who read ahead a few chapters and had us all in wonder as to what twists transpired. He just smiled and said, &quot;you won't believe how this thing turns out.&quot;After reading other Dickens books I realized that his greatest strengths was populating his books with amazing, odd, likeable, and despicable characters who found there way in and out of his stories.If you haven't read this book, do so."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I got the &quot;cover-to-cover&quot; book on tape for a long road trip, never having heard the story before. I loved every minute of it. The things that Dickens does with the English language is endlessly entertaining, the story he tells fascinating and fast-paced. The highly talented Martin Jarvis reads wonderfully, giving great characterization to the many people appearing in the story, allowing me to see them all as completely distinct.It's a shame that people feel such resentment when forced to read something. Most of the bad reviews this book gets are from young people who were forced to read it for a class. When taken at one's own leisure, and in one's own time, it is quite entertaining. I'm not sure that the teachers who assign the book are pointing out all the things that make the book great, such as Dickens's flair with the language, the point he's making about a society that places birth above worth, and his ability to make abstract arguments that enhance the story. I'd be interested in hearing from literature teachers to find out how they use the book in their classes.One of the best books ever written, this reading is one of the best investments of my time I've ever made."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"The book was a gift and really excited my 10 year old godchild. Good seller."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This audio version is phenomenal...full of lively interpretation all by one narrator. Yet the lack of a chapter guide makes it extremely difficult to use should you be interested in tracking down a particular chapter.

My 7th graders love to listen to it, so it has been worth the aggravation of trying to find which chapter is where."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I read Great Expectations back in high school, but had forgotten most of it. It was the selection for our book club, so I bought it to read again.Although it's very long, it's a wonderful book, rich with detail and timeless for it's social issues and examination of interpersonal relationships.I had forgotten (or perhaps didn't appreciate in high school) how funny Dickens is. His sense of humor, and ability to convey emotion and atmosphere are extraordinary.I got it too late to finish for the book club and had to consult Spark notes (which are great for summary), but I hope to finish it soon.

(6th graders) This copy is the novel but an adapted version. The print size, the text appearance are friendly. The authenticity and truth of the story are upheld. All my expectations have been met. There are questions at the end of the text. Wanted about 20 copies but did not want to pay the top price! Like usual Amazon came to the rescue. Can't wait to introduce the children to a classic but closer to their level. It is authentic to so many of the important quotes. Not too many authors have one of their novel's characters last the test of time, meaning Scrooge. Dickens created him and we know the symbolic Scrooge, one hundred years later...we need to acknowledge his greatness as a writer."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I agree this is a great car book. The only problem is I don't want to get out of my car.The reader does a fabulous job of bringing Dickens many wonderful characters to life. I heartily recommend."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"\\"Great Expectations\\" was Charles Dickens' third attempt at writing semi-autobiography, and his most successful. Poor Oliver Twist barely registers in his own book, while David Copperfield becomes a pasteboard figure after reaching adulthood. Pip only grows richer and more complex, and it's no wonder critics thus see \\"Great Expectations\\" as the best of the lot.We open with the finest sequence in the novel, along a swampy coastline in southern England where a small boy at his parent's grave is threatened by a desperate convict. The convict wants food and a file to help cut him free. The boy, Pip, must wrestle with some serious guilt, not to mention the threat of his sister and guardian's overzealous discipline. Social expectations cut one way, but a rogue feeling of sympathy for the convict guides him another. Which will win out?Pip's a bit of a prat, but he's meant to be. After coming into some mysterious money, the former blacksmith's apprentice abandons those who love him in a doomed attempt to win over Estella, the high-class, heart-challenged ward of balmy Miss Havisham. Estella bothers some people. How could Pip love her? Man, I've been there, and I reckon a lot of others have been, too. Estella is one of the great fictional representations of unrequited love, and in Dickens' hands, becomes something even more potent, a symbol of class division and status-scrambling folly.Dickens' handling of Pip is subtle and worth careful re-reading. By using the device of an older, unseen Pip as narrator, we sense where he fell astray without it being pointed out overmuch. Clashing with a snooty rival for Estella's affections, he sweats the possibility of being discovered as the friend of a guileless village blacksmith, Joe: \\"So throughout life our worst weaknesses and meannesses are usually committed for the sake of the people whom we most despise.\\"Whenever the focus is on Pip, particularly when dealing with Estella, Miss Havisham, or the mysterious, vaguely creepy lawyer Mr. Jaggers, \\"Great Expectations\\" is both high art and a great read. Dickens' descriptive powers remained in high beam in this, his penultimate novel (completed in 1861). The storyline takes its time, but in such a way that it often feels like a prototype for the stream-of-consciousness narrative authors would employ a century later.If only \\"Great Expectations\\" didn't suffer from one of Dickens' chief bte noires, compounding coincidences. Whether it's the identity of Estella's long-lost father or Miss Havisham's unworthy suitor, too many of the plot strands wind up twisted together to unwholesome effect.Other plot strings, like the tale of a blackguard named Orlick or the romances of Pip's pals Herbert Pocket and Wemmick, do little to merit the lengthy attention they receive. Most annoying is the story of Compeyson, built up as Pip's main adversary. Yet we hardly meet the guy before he vanishes in the black waters of Dickens' top-heavy plot machinations.Except for Jaggers, Estella, and Miss Havisham, \\"Great Expectations\\" suffers from an uninteresting cast of supporting characters. But when you have three such meaty characters, not to mention the noble yet shifting Pip at the center, you have one eminently worthy novel. Add to that Dickens' descriptive abilities, and that harrowing opening, and \\"Great Expectations\\" delivers most of the way on its title's promise."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"i enjoy these barnes and noble editions. pocket books make a nice addition to the library."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I do pretty much all my \\"reading\\" on audio books these days and Michael Page is probably my favorite narrator so far. He changes his voice for each character in a way that sounds so natural and undistracting, and his female voices are not annoying (I think the mark of a really great narrator is how undistracting their \\"opposite gender\\" voices are.)The story of Great Expectations deserves to be told by someone of Page's talent. I first read it by accident when I was a kid, not realizing it was a classic (always avoided books I was supposed to read.) I liked it well enough then, but I love it now. The characters are interesting, the morality of the book is not preachy and it's such a substantial book that you can listen to it several times and still pick up some new insight or pleasure. If you're an impatient reader, the book is probably not for you. If you need action on every page, you might get bored. But if you are a people person and you like getting to know the characters of a book, if you like to look for truth in fiction, it's a great story, very well told."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Well, I was looking through some of the reviews posted here on amazon just to get an idea of what to write because this is my first review, and saw that a few people said that you need to be an adult to read this book. I kind of understand what they mean because this is a pretty dense novel, as most of Dicken's writing is. However, I don't feel that an individual's determines his maturity as a reader, and so, I dont feel that people should be discouraging teenagers from reading this classic book.Having said that, let me discuss a few key points that are important to keep in mind when considering whether or not to buy the book. Firstly, this is a very difficult read, so unless you are accustomed to reading classical fiction, be prepared to devote more time to reading the book than you generally would to a novel of similar length (450ish pages). Furthermore, the book is a drag at times, especially in during the first part. Often times, I would get lost while reading the book because I couldn't focus on the descriptions which seemed to get in the way of the plot. However, I have to give Dickens credit on doing a remarkable job of writing the dialogue between characters which allows the reader to immerse into the story. Whenever I wasn't lost, I would often feel as if I was right in the center of the scene and could vividly visualize what was going on around the protagonist.As for the theme of the book, I felt that it tried to impart a good, however slightly shallow, message on the reader. By the end of the book, it is very clear what the message is as all of the characters get what they deserve. However, having read a lot of philosophical literature, I feel compelled on extracting deeper meaning from everything around me, which is kind of hard to do from this book.My recommendation of this book would depend on the reader, I feel that if you have read another book of a similar genre or time period, then you would really enjoy this book otherwise it might be very boring. If this is your first time reading a book by a classical writer, might I recommend visiting sparknotes after every couple of chapters to get a clearer understanding of the plot. Also, I would recommend to every single person to only buy this book if they can dedicate significant time to reading it. Don't think this is one of those books that you can just read anytime you have a few minutes here or there because you will be lost and won't understand it at all. I feel it would be best to sit down and just read for an hour or two (depending on your attention span) and delve deep into the world of the characters. Not only does this process make identifying character development easier, it also makes the book more enjoyable.Also, for anyone who finds Dicken's writing style interesting, I recommend looking at David Copperfeild (just read the first paragraph, and you will be hooked)."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations is one of the most absorbing novels I have ever read. It is also the best. The plot is complex and exciting, sometimes very funny and sometimes almost unbearably sad, with so many plot twists it is impossible to lose interest. The writing and descriptions are...well they're Dickens': always brilliant and powerful. And the characters in Great Expecations, Pip, Uncle Pumblechook, Miss Havisham, Mr. Jaggers, etc., are colorful and original, and complex and lively. Great Expectations has the suspense of any of today's thrillers (during the last fifty pages I could not put it down) and a wonderful message: that your social standing does not determine what kind of a person you are; aristocracy isn't all it's cracked up to be; what you really need in life are good friends and people that care about you. Great Expectations is a masterpiece of the first order. I cannot stress enough how much I enjoyed it. It is most assuredly a book I will keep reading again and again throughout my life."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"When reading this book in high school, I considered myself very fortunate that the copies we had contained the original ending. It was placed at the end, after the ending that was originally published. I much preferred the original ending from the momentI read it, and have since checked every copy I have come across to see if it is in them. Sadly, often it is not.The kindle edition does not contain the original ending. I did not see any reviews of this edition that mentioned it, so I thought I would post one for anyone else who finds that important, as I do."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"GREAT EXPECTATIONS is often the novel used in high schools to introduce students to Dickens. Due to it's length and fairly long and uneventful middle phase, I'm not sure it's the best text to introduce people to Dickens. Still, it is a pretty good story and contains some of the most memorable characters in Dickens' fiction.GREAT EXPECTATIONS is the story of Phillip Pirrip, otherwise known as Pip. Pip's parents die not long after he is born and he is raised &quot;by hand&quot; by his sister. His brother-in-law, Joe Gargery, is the town blacksmith and loves Pip. The two are best-of-friends. One night while looking at his parents' graves, Pip meets a convict and his life is forever changed by that meeting. As the novel progresses, Pip meets Miss Havisham (the wealthiest woman in town) and her beautiful ward, Estella. Pip immediately falls in love with Estella and is haunted by her all the days of his life. Eventually Pip is bond to Joe as his apprentice and sets to work in the blacksmith forge. Several years later, Pip's luck changes when he is informed by a lawyer from London, Mr. Jaggers, that he has become the recipient of &quot;great expectations&quot;. The book then follows Pip's life as he enters this new stage in life and as he develops and becomes a &quot;gentleman&quot;. Everything is brought full circle and just about everyone gets what they deserve by the time the novel ends.GREAT EXPECTATIONS isn't the easiest of books to read. What many writers can do in a sentence often takes Dickens two pages to tell. Also, the book is divided into three phases and the second phase is rather boring (except at the end) and really does nothing more than to fill in a few plot gaps and illustrate to us how much of a prig Pip becomes. Nevertheless, GREAT EXPECTATIONS is still a good story containing some very vivid characters: Pip, Estella, Joe, Miss Havisham, Magwitch, Jaggers, and Wemmick. The characters in GREAT EXPECTATIONS are as memorable as anyone in DAVID COPPERFIELD, OLIVER TWIST, or A CHRISTMAS CAROL. The first phase of the book is quite interesting and sets up everything that later occurs in the novel. The third part of the novel is full of excitement and contains Pip's repentance and reformation. Overall, it's a great book and even though it was written over a hundred years ago, it has a lot to say about the society in which we live today."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I first read this book when I was in eighth grade. Ever since then, I have been going back to it because even though I know how the events will eventually turn out, this book always retains the magic touch to entertain and keep one hoping that the main character Pip will live a happy life.Upon reading the first page, the reader is drawn into a world of mystery and suspense. The reader is whisked into an English cemetry from olden times and what draws the reader further is the presence of a little boy crying, afraid of the eerie atmosphere. To make matters worse, a very strange looking man appears to frighten the little boy even further. The suspense just begins.As if this wasn't enough for the little boy crying in the cemetry, Pip goes on to face even more difficulties in life. Pip meets with the strange Miss Havisham who forever wears her white wedding gownn. Pip feels forever alienated by the proud Estella, whom he has fallen in love with. The problem is --- Estella doesn't seem to care at all. To her, Pip is a poor, common boy.Excitement builds up as Pip is granted the chance to become a gentleman with prosperity. Will Estella care about him now? Will Pip remain the same kind-hearted young man he was when he was poor or will he change?Even though I have long found the &quot;answers&quot; (there are two different endings in the orginal) I am still amazed at how Dickens creates fascinating characters and fills his novels with mystery, suspense and romance."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"As an English teacher, I purchased the collection to use in my classroom. We had already started the novel when the cd's came in. Because the cd's were not marked according to chapter, it was difficult to find the starting point each time we used the cd's. I would have liked to have chapters to correspond with the tracks for easy listening. On the up side, it was easier for the kids to follow along once we did find the spot, and the animated voices brought the story to life."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I read this book in high school years ago and just recently read it for the second time. Dickens never disappoints."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is yet another great story by Dickens. Throughout the book I kept thinking, I know what will happen. How obvious. What was obvious was how wrong I was each time. Follow young Pip from boyhood to manhood. See how he goes to become a gentleman (make his fortune in our terms) and what comes of it. This is a story about growing up and learning what is important in life. It is full of Dickens' excellent descriptions and characters and their relationships.If you like any Dickens story you will like this one as well. If you have never read Dickens, you should.For Kindle owners. I only saw two errors. Both words probably had accents on characters as missing characters appeared as question marks (?), so I am not positive what the words actually were (one was French) and to be honest, I never bothered to look them up. But those were the only two. The book contains a table of contents that works fine. I did not see page numbers on this version. Overall, no reason to pay for a copy, this was excellent."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Excellent copy. Clean. New. thank you. Suggestion to reader: look for a copy with BOTH endings!

Dickens is brilliant and each read brings new insight."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This isnt merely a classic, it is a book that is dear to my heart and inspired me as both a writer and a person. Many of the free classic ebooks have poor formating or other problems but there are none here that I notice. I highly recommend this wonderful book andfor free you cant beat that price."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is a book worth reading, and it's a shame my first experience with it was having it force-fed to me 22 years ago as a high school sophomore or junior. I only wish I could find the crappy, soulless joke of a book report I regurgitated from Cliff's Notes to please my teacher and get that all-important \\"A.\\" Suffice to say that if I found it I would not post it here.Having re-read the book, I now can say with certainty that Dickens is a brilliant writer and storyteller. His use of language is phenomenal, and his characters tell a deep emotional tale. I suspect it is the tale of Dickens' own childhood dilemma: an emotionally abandoned boy seeking greatness and knowing at some level that he was born for it---and that fate somehow picked him out for it.Pip is a multidimensional character, with hopes and charm and honesty and flaws. He is utterly sympathetic, as I'm sure little Charles Dickens once was himself.Pip, an abused and undefended boy, is picked out rather randomly by a near stranger (seemingly the idealized parent for whom every child secretly hopes) to become a gentleman---to rise above the meagre expectations for which his limited birth has chosen him. Even his closest childhood ally, Joe the blacksmith, does nothing (read that: nothing) to defend him against Joe's abusive wife, Pip's older sister. To Dickens' discredit, I felt that he over-defended Joe's weakness as a non-defender. But, by the same token, Dickens' rendering of Joe's all-too-realistic weakness is quite honest and common: after all, so few adults really do stick their necks out to defend the child. I am only left to suspect that in Dickens' own childhood none did either. I would guess that like Pip, Dickens was surrounded entirely by adults who were weak, sadistic, self-centered, or manipulative. My guess is that only his talent, hard word, and patience allowed him to rise above.My only real criticism of the book (and it's not a big one) comes near the end, when Pip tries to help Magwitch escape England and thus find safety. Granted, Dickens' treatment of this situation does assist the flow of the novel, and does allow him to show just how much Pip has grown to care for his benefactor, but it still left me shaking my head. (And I'm not spoiling the plot, because in the version I read the editor's footnotes spoil the plot anyway early on in the reading, as clearly the editor assumes that the reader knows the story beforehand. Then again, maybe the editor is spoiling the plot to give himself some power. I felt some of his footnotes, which are otherwise quite helpful for background, suggest that he was in an annoying sort of competition with Dickens to show his own greatness.)So although the plot device works for Dickens' purpose, it just didn't strike me as sufficiently realistic to keep my disbelief suspended. My reason: Magwitch is a hardy, intelligent, cunning world traveler, who suddenly, for no good enough reason, puts all his trust for escape from England (and thus his life) into the hands of a complete novice, Pip, who creates a foolhardy plan for escape that ends up getting Magwitch captured and sentenced to death.In reality, given what Dickens' shows us about Magwitch's character, here's what I think would have really happened had Magwitch heard Pip's plan:Magwitch: \\"Pip, thank you for creating a plan to rescue me, but I think I'll pass. I'll go off into the night on my own, and leave England the same way I came to it: on my own.\\"Magwitch would have traveled onward with less hurrah, more stealth, and far more privacy. And as the result he would have likely left England safe and sound, and continued to keep up his benefactor relationship with Pip.But that wouldn't have suited Dickens' purposes for the plot, so the more realistic ending was avoided.That said, the book was still great. I couldn't put it down. Kudos to Dickens! And to hell with my high school teacher for nearly ruining my regard for this great writer."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This novel was my first taste of Dickens and I have to say I was fairly surprised, and that in a very positive sense. Not only I didn't find it overly \\"wordy\\" or else, but extremely well written. But that's details. This novel is very intense and has unforgettable characters in it, honestly. It's very emotional and it's a trip. A trip that lasted two weeks for me, and that I will not soon forget, if ever. I wholeheartedly recommend this book for those of you who love literature, and even for those of you who are not literature-buffs, because the novel is very readable so don't be afraid of its length if you're not used to reading classics and such.Dickens, I realised, can be surprisingly funny at times, and this without ever losing his capacity to create strongly emotional moments and images. As there seems to be tons of reviews for this book already I'll stop mine here and just tell you that if you're interested in this book, go for it!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I never wanted to read this book, but a friend convinced me when he learned that I loved Pip on South Park (I found the little nerd funny). This was the best advice I'd ever taken. Reading this not only made me love Charles Dickens, but gave me a late start on loving reading in general.Granted, it's a difficult book to read. Dickens packs his book with descriptions and long sentences (yet every word is important and helps with understanding) and he's not easy to get through. Yet Dickens still, with all his flaws, remains a masterful storyteller. His characters aren't deep, but they're relatable and memorable. I love Pip, Estella, Miss Havisham, Joe, Herbert Pocket, Magwitch, and Aged P, and even though I've read this book a long time ago, I love them just as much now as I did then.It's a shame that people have to read this for school (I did so for my second time). It's a wonderful story that should be enjoyed by itself. If you haven't been made to read it, do so now. Push yourself through it and take your time (it took me a month to finish the book myself). You'll be glad you did. Assignments make you rush and over-analyze stories, and Dickens should never be read that way."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations was a remarkable book. I really enjoyed it. I didn't really have great expectations before I read it. It was about a little English boy named Pip. Pip is a poor kid who suddenly inherits a bunch of money and becomes rich. When he was poor he hated the way rich people treated poor people, but he finds himself doing treating poor people horribly when rich. He finally learns that everyone deserves to be treated with the same respect, even those less fortunate. This was an interesting book, but a tough book to understand, I would probably recommend it only for adults."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"When I was assigned to present a novel for my English class at Mercy High School, I thought of Great Expectations because I had read it five years ago and remembered that I had liked it. I thought that it was rather straight forward and didn't remember having difficulty reading it. When I read it for a second time, however, I realized that it was alot more complex. The reading was simple and getting through the book was easy, but Dickens made his story one worth contemplating by expressing the many sides life with his characters. What made the people he wrote about so wonderful was his ability to make them unique and entertaining, yet so believable as human beings coping with ordinary problems that the reader had no problem sympathizing with them."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Charles Dickens develops the characters, the plot, and the conflicts in Great Expectations spectacularly. The characters Dickens develops throughout the story are human and easy to connect with. Pip is the most real to life character, because he exhibits the most human-like qualities. Pip is a very personable character that makes the reader feel sorrow and happiness along with him. As Pip looks to better himself and become a gentleman, he comes to realize a very important life lesson; money cannot buy happiness. As Pip goes through the story, he allows the reader to see and feel exactly what he feels and sees.Estella is described as a beautiful young woman that captures Pip's heart. Estella has a very insensitive personality, and enjoys making Pip cry; something everyone has encountered in a person some time in his/her life.Herbert is a young man with many dreams and aspirations. Herbert becomes Pip's best friend, and Pip realizes that this young man works very hard for what he believes in. This is the kind of friend that will push a person where they would not normally go by themselves.Abel Magwitch is the convict that Pip encounters at the beginning of the story. Magwitch gives Pip a large amount of money to start his life as a gentleman. Magwitch is the kind of person that would give the clothes off of his back to anyone in need. Magwitch is also a very personable character because he is not all good or all evil. He exhibits both of these; he is a convict and he devotes his life's earnings to Pip.Charles Dickens develops an outstanding plot as the novel unfolds. There are many life lessons throughout the novel. Pip realizes that all of the money in the world cannot buy happiness. Pip also finds out that true love is not just the woman he cannot obtain, because love has to be much more. The plot has many twists and turns throughout. There is always something new happening to Pip. It is almost like a soap opera, because there are so many people and events interacting with each other during the novel. When the plot becomes a little thin, Dickens begins to create suspense for the next big event about to occur. Dickens chooses to develop the plot through the character's actions. Not once did Dickens explain what was happening in the story, he let the characters take over, and within a few pages all questions were answered.The novel has many conflicts that develop throughout the plot. Pip and Estella have a love-hate relationship going on. Pip loves Estella, but she could care less about him. Pip and Joe have a conflict, too. Pip wants to see much less of Joe now that he is a gentleman, but Joe just wants to see Pip, period. Pip thinks he is too good for Joe, even though he is still just the same human as he was before. Money changes people's outlook on life. Pip was once a benevolent, caring, young man, but once he fell into money, he changed dramatically in the way he acted towards others. These conflicts provide for some pretty interesting facets in the story. Charles Dickens develops the characters, the plot, and the conflicts excellently throughout the novel."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Truly one of the best books I've read.

But unlike most of them I loved the book. It was with in my textbook which made it hard to read but other then that I could not put it down. The themes of the story are so inviting that you can't wait to read about what happens next. Dickens kept the tone inving and I kept going back to read more. I am now a junior and reading the book yet again for a history assignment and even though I know what is happening I still can't put it down.To all the freshman out there that have to read this book: Give it a chance. If you really hat eit and want to watch the movie go to the local library and get Disneys version of it. They did it exactly to the book and it is awesome. Its long but it does get rid of some of the unnecessary backgorund information. It comes in a series of 3 tapes.Other then that I love this book. I am not an avid reader but this one was awesome."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"the course of the year I try to read a few, \\"Important Novels\\" in order to get a fuller understanding of literature. Dicken's \\"Great Expectations\\" has been on my list for nearly a year. I completely dreaded reading what I thought would be a long and drawn out story about something I could careless about. Well, I was wrong.\\"Great Expectations\\" is now #1 on my all-time favorites list. While, admittedly, it took me roughly 150 pages to get any enjoyment out of the novel- once I was in- I was hooked. Pip's journey through life is a very refreshing look at how distorted we let our lives become by focusing on the unimportant. Dicken's ability to slowly alter Pip's views on life, without changing his essential character/morales (Ex. How Pip looks to help his friend in his business pursuits). Some have called \\"Great Expecations\\" his masterpiece... but in my opinion, it may be the \\"Masterpiece\\" of English Literature.I also wonder why this is required High School reading. While I loved this book at age 28, I think most 16 year-olds would find it unbearable. It seems like such a waist to ruin both the book and Dicken's name on minds that are not ready for such a reading task."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations is an exciting story dramatically done in this audio presentation."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Many people may find Charles Dicken's \\"Great Expectations,\\" dated, due to it's time period and its flowery 19th century language. True, the book is extremely wordy, and there are many words you'll be getting out a dictionary for reference, and yes it's very slow moving, but it's wonderful.The book focuses on a young boy, who becomes a young man, named Pip, raised by his over dominating sister, and a kind blacksmith, Joe Gargory. For awhile Pip has gratitude for living in the town, but, when he is spurned by the rich Estella and Miss Havisham, he wants to be something greater, someone richer. Being rich falls into his lap, but not without consequences. The book is about the follies of false vanities, of turning ones back on those who loved you, on trying to chase an uncatchable dream from those who don't reciprocate feelings, (in this case Pip's devotion to the haughty Estella) and for neglecting the good values of life for the ostentatious ones. Too often in todays society people (I'm guilty of this too) forget about what's truly important, family and good friends, and associate with only the proud and the, what they deem to be, the important. In the process they get too wrapped up by material wealth rather than the simple beauties around them.Aside from the basic story, the characterization in this novel is wonderful. Dicken's has really created some memorable characters, full of depth and complexity. The dull headed, but kind, Joe Gargory, and the haughty, but lonely, Estella, along with the mournful and bitter Miss Havisham will stay with the reader long after he/she finishes the book.Reading this book is a treat. Peruse it's pages and enjoy."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This novel by Charles Dickens is very well written, although very verbose. The novel has a good plot, but the writting is sometimes hard to follow. It took me one whole month to read the book and fully understand it. I recommend it to anyone who is interested in the classics, because it has a great story. Readers beware though, they must be ready to analyze everything in order to understand the novel"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I'm not a huge fan of Charles Dickens, but I have read a number of his books for reports and for reading. I've read Great Expectations for class and for personal reading. First of all the book is much easier to read then David Copperfield and others. The beginning is really riveting, and from there it keeps going. This book made me look to my personal life to see if I was finding happiness in the right things. I would read it at least once."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I loved this book. I have to admit in the beginning it was a bit of a chore to get &quot;into&quot; it but once I did I was just swept away. I especially loved the characters in it. I found myself putting the book down to tell my husband how mad I was at Pip. Joe, Estella, Abel Magwitch, Mr.Jaggers and of course Miss Haversham are unforgettable! A great book once you give it a fair chance. I am so glad that I stuck to it!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Before you reads this book, examine the title, and what great expectations do, so the events seem less shocking.This story is quite bittersweet and ironic, with a lot of interweaven and connected plots-not just of Pip's life. These plots make understanding this book, along with the rich dialect, quite difficult (where it lost the star) but amazing. ADVICE: read the Coles Notes (or other notes) chapter summaries.As I said, it's an extrodinary coming of age (rite of passage) which will not be as distant and farfetched as you might think. Comparable to your own rite of passage if you care to draw parallels with not only Pip, but all other characters too.I found that when you are forced to read this book and too much emphasis it placed on it, it loses it's 'interest', 'luster', and 'magic', (*wink* *wink* high school teachers!).Overall, I liked this book, but the language overwhelmed at times."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Dickens has a very vivid imagination. He express himself in a bizzare way in all of his works. In this novel, however, he out does himself. This book has a strange air about it. I was rather confused how Miss Havisham could be so confined. Why anyone would let a man upset them so much. They really aren't worth that much. The storyline was very interesting.

Great read from one of the most respected leaders in the technology/IT business. John's tone and approach make the book understandable to those without technology backgrounds and very enjoyable to read at the same time. So very many of the things John highlights in this book as experiences for him still ring true for all of us. If you own or participate in leading a business, you really owe it to yourself to add this perspective. It could be an eye-opening experience."},{"Title":"Net Attitude: What It Is, How To Get It, And Why Your Company Can't Survive Without It","review":"John Patrick's book makes significant points about the rising expectations of consumers and the sometimes slow response of business to meet those Internet expectations. He provides a good review of current and upcoming Internet technology. Although much of this review may not be original, he exploits this review to push ahead companies' internal expectations. He harps on, and rightly so, on websites which lack integration of data and still offer \\"print and fax this form\\" customer service. If there is a weakness in his argument, it is a more complete discussion of the backend databases and infrastructures required to make the \\"fast, always on, everywhere, easy, Next Generation Internet\\" possible.Patrick could have spent more time on technologies such as web services which industry has been slow to adopt. However, the technical details are more appropriate for other volumes. The strength of this book is its clear explanations of how Internet technologies are now available to meet the business strategies of pervasive, trusted, natural Internet. The book adequately addresses trust and secure technologies, yet the implementation of these technologies takes time. Once businesses and consumers are ready to accept and trust the technology and the people behind the technology, much of the Net Attitude can move forward.One final limitation of the book: many of the examples are from the airline and financial services sector. More could have been said about healthcare, non-profit and government services, which need this attitude as much.Overall, the book provides a current view which companies and consumers need to get. Whether the term \\"Next Generation Internet\\" will catch on remains to be seen but certainly the concepts need adoption now."},{"Title":"Net Attitude: What It Is, How To Get It, And Why Your Company Can't Survive Without It","review":"This is perhaps the best book I have read in a long time. Many tech-heads like myself will read it and say, &quot;That is already happening. Why would anybody say this book is good?&quot; Well, I have two things to say to answer that question. First is gimme a break. The book was published in 2001 and, obviously, there have been advancements in technology and some of the things Patrick mentions are already in place or are being put in place. That said, people should still read the book because a lot of what he writes about concerning the NGi (Next Generation Internet) is still not fulfilled yet.Secondly, and more importantly, is that people should read the book for what it is really about: Net Attitude. One of the most important parts of net attitude Patrick presents is the concept of &quot;outside-in thinking.&quot; Those of us in technology--whether we are code crunchers or CTO's--should be thinking about our customers and clients and what sorts of things they would want to be able to do over the Internet from our web sites. Read the book for more details. I am sure you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Net Attitude: What It Is, How To Get It, And Why Your Company Can't Survive Without It","review":"I loved this book! The Net's everything!

From all indications, John's presentation was electric so I had high hopes for the book. Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed. I found the content nothing new and there was little provided to answer the &quot;so what&quot; question. There are numerous analogies about the problems that John, and many of us, face in doing business today. Fax machines not working, email connection problems, hardware problems, etc, pages and pages of them. While what he said is true, after about 20 or 30 pages of this I thought, &quot;alright, you've made your point&quot;. I was expecting much more insight into the problems that the internet faces and the less obvious places that John sees it going. I got neither, I got what everyone already knows. The best part of the book was pages 215 to 225, the last chapter on what to do next. Again, nothing earth shattering, just sensible stuff. The key for companies will be to follow the strategy religously.The book would be good for a person who is new to the internet and is looking for ways of integrating it into their business. I suspect there aren't many people left in this boat but there might be a few."},{"Title":"Net Attitude: What It Is, How To Get It, And Why Your Company Can't Survive Without It","review":"I urge you to get a copy of John's book, it is very instructive.Those of you who think your firm has a terrific eCommerce strategy should pick up John's book.

The large book which has the same cover is great but this one is a waste of your time and money to return it."},{"Title":"Runner's World Complete Book of Running Everything You Need to Run for Weight Loss, Fitness, and Competition Revised and Updated","review":"As other reviewers have stated, this is a good book for beginning runners. The tone is positive--in the introduction, the author states that she wants to be your cheerleader--and presents a \\"you can do it!\\" attitude throughout. One of the book's strengths is its emphasis on starting out gradually if you're a beginning runner. The author is well aware of the pitfalls of beginning runners, one of which is getting discouraged and ultimately abandoning running because of unrealistic expectations. She presents a clear running program that just about anyone should be able to start with. Inspirational stories--including a now-dated piece about Oprah's first marathon--support the idea that pretty much anyone can train to run competitively (or just for fun). Well, at least if they're millionaires who can train for a total of four hours a day.Also included are the obligatory diet recommendations, including a curious plug for vegetarianism. This is where I think the book starts to lose its focus. I realize that many people reading about running are likely looking to lose weight and incorporate vigorous exercise into a healthier lifestyle, but how many times--and in how many publications--must we read about carbs and fats? We get a brief intro to healthy eating, and then the book jumps into diet choices of runners. The organization of the book suggests that you'll go from novice runner to carbo-loading marathoner in a matter of pages.I think that the injury section, perhaps incorporated into a larger chapter about running and its effects on various body systems and health generally, could be expanded. How to best deal with shin splints, which affect nearly all beginning runners at some point and to some degree, is barely touched on. Compartment syndrome (which is uncommon, grated) isn't mentioned at all. I think that more could be said about strength training as a complement to running, as well as detailed information about effective stretching and cool-down techniques.Major content gripe: An entire section in the Women's Running chapter (which constitutes about a quarter of the book, so male readers may want to keep this in mind!) is devoted to avoiding the various ways that you can become a crime victim if you're not careful. It's a tired rehashing of all the \\"safety and security\\" stuff that women are exposed to on a regular basis, usually in women's magazines or on freak-out local news reports. A cop's contribution to this section details how to avoid getting pulled into a car and ultimately murdered (his solution: don't get near the car). I'm not advocating a head-in-the-sand approach; any solo runner should be alert, particularly when running in an isolated area. But jeez, do we really need a whole section to remind us to run in well-lit, populated areas? The number of pages given to this subject suggests that you're more likely than not to be the victim of a bad-intentioned male at some point during your runs.My main problem with the book is its format. It is heavy (literally), with a glossy format consisting of giant margins, big text, and dozens of pointless photos. I understand that the book is attempting to be true to its roots: it is published by Runner's World, after all, and its page design is similar to a magazine. But it's a book and should look like a book. Even though it's paperback, it's printed on heavy stock paper and isn't the type of book you'd toss into a beach or vacation bag. And the vast majority of pictures are completely unnecessary. Page after page of very fit people in 1990s running garb (it appears that the images weren't updated for the 2004 edition) are meant to be inspiring but get really old after the first chapter: three young chicks running on a track, a fit middle-aged guy energetically moving along in front of a sunset backdrop, a forty-something gal lacing up in a park. Most of us know what fit runners look like. Do we need to see full-color photos of them on every other page? In the nutrition section, literally half a page is taken up with the image of a banana and something that looks like oats. In the footwear section, we see generic pictures of white leather running shoes with the laces undone. Zzzz....I realize that this review is a big negative, so you may be wondering why I've given the book three stars. There is a lot of good information for people new to running, and indeed fitness and nutrition. But I'm glad that I got this book out of the library--I'd be annoyed if I paid good money for this. The Complete Book of Running for Women by Claire Kowalchik, and the old standy, Jim Fixx's The Complete Book of Running, are better choices in my estimation."},{"Title":"Runner's World Complete Book of Running Everything You Need to Run for Weight Loss, Fitness, and Competition Revised and Updated","review":"This is a decent book. I nearly gave it four stars (see following), but it does many things well. Some may knock the book because it has few bells and whistles (i.e., gear and gizmos). However, anyone that has run for a long time will tell you most of the same things that this book does.I was slightly disappointed that all the photos were \\"eye pleasing\\". Looks more like a magazine of female models for TV spots than the typical healthy runner. In some ways, I prefer the old style of James Fixx in the original \\"Complete Book of Running\\" (not Runner's World).There are almost no shoes shown, which is the most important of equipment. This is good. What is shown is the proper way to size your shoes and reinforcing that a runner should stick with what works for that runner and not chase after fads.The nutritional and healthy lifestyle information is excellent. There are things that a more advanced runner may want to see, but this is an excellent start."},{"Title":"Runner's World Complete Book of Running Everything You Need to Run for Weight Loss, Fitness, and Competition Revised and Updated","review":"Despite what the title and subtitle suggests, this doesn'tprovide everything you need to run for fun, fitness andcompetition. While it probably a 3 1/2 *** to 4**** book,in terms of content, there are more comprehensive bookson the subject of running. This is a good book for gettinga base understanding of running, and it only offerstraining programs for one type of road race, namely themarathon. If you want something that covers training forshorter races, forget it. That doesn't mean the book is atotal loss for those who purchase it. If you are lookingfor a tome on the sport, look no further than Dr. TimothyNoakes' Lore of Running, which is nearly 1000 pages ofinformation from a physician who is also a runner. Itdoesn't discuss specific training exercises with regardsto weights like other running books, or it doesn't evenmention which exercises to do in terms of stretching/flexibility, nor is there any mention ofpylometrics, which is used by some competitive runners.The book is fairly narrow in scope, geared more forroad racers of the marathon persuasion mostly. If youwant to run some track race or cross country race, thisbook is probably of somewhat limited value to you. Anotherproblem is the book is fairly expensive consider the amountof information is provided in the pages, considering thisis basically a rehash of topics already discussed inRunners' World, along with other running magazines andbooks.The book is organized as follows:CONTENTSIntroduction.................................................xiPart 1.

To the editor's credit, it is evident that he has tried, with his comments, to thread all the chapters (read \\"articles\\") together, but there still seems to be something missing. If you are a newcomer to running and needs a good first book on running, \\"The Runner's Handbook\\" will be a better choice. If you are already a serious runner, you are better off subscribing (or re-subscribing) to the Runner's World monthly magazine."},{"Title":"Runner's World Complete Book of Running Everything You Need to Run for Weight Loss, Fitness, and Competition Revised and Updated","review":"I wanted a book that provides detailed information about things like running training programs, information about injuries, and information about nutrition. While the Runner's World Complete Book of Running mentions these topics, the information is so watered down that it is barely useful. If you want some serious information I suggest getting Tim Noakes &quot;The Lore of Running&quot; instead. If you simply want to read some warm fuzzy articles that don't really say anything, then buy this book."},{"Title":"Runner's World Complete Book of Running Everything You Need to Run for Weight Loss, Fitness, and Competition Revised and Updated","review":"\`Runner's World Complete Book of Running' is a compilation of different articles from Runners World magazine. It has 37 articles written by about 25 different authors. While the book has a lot of breath, it lacks a certain commonality between the chapters. Amby Burfoot. The editor, attempts to rectify this by writing introductions and postscripts after each chapter.With that, the book has a lot of valuable information and is an excellent overview for those that want an summary of the various aspects of running.On the other side, the book, notwithstanding its title is not \`Everything you need to know to run....'. There is a lot of information and details that are left out.But if you are looking for a good introductory text into running, this is it."},{"Title":"Runner's World Complete Book of Running Everything You Need to Run for Weight Loss, Fitness, and Competition Revised and Updated","review":"I often found myself turning back in the book to find places where it gave opposite advice. For a beginners willing to follow almost any tidbit at the promise of improvement, this can be frustrating.To those new to running who are just looking for more tips: Try a Runner's World subscription first. You'll get 12 months advice, information and motivation--so much that you'll probably realize you didn't need this book after all. (At least Runner's World rarely offers two pieces of conficting advice in the same issue. Month-to-month is another story.)That said, if you still feel the need to put a running book on the shelf, it'd be tough to top this one. As the title says, it is very complete, and for that reason, one of the best running books I own. Those looking for that one definitive book on general running and racing would probably be best served here."},{"Title":"Runner's World Complete Book of Running Everything You Need to Run for Weight Loss, Fitness, and Competition Revised and Updated","review":"Middle of the road, middle of the pack glimpse at what Runner's World magazine does best: steer the recreational and sometimes competitive runner with conflicting advice.

Not a bad resource tool, but you could probably look up the same or more current/detailed information faster and easier online.Essentially, this book is a collection of Runner's World magazine articles. You're better off in the long run (no pun intended) just picking up a copy of the latest issue at the newsstand."},{"Title":"Runner's World Complete Book of Running Everything You Need to Run for Weight Loss, Fitness, and Competition Revised and Updated","review":"Written by several different authors with Burfoot as a guide at the beginning and end of each chapter, this book is very enjoyable.I am a new runner this past summer and I have found this book to be a very helpful guide to getting started. It provides a good basic overview of the important parts of running--avoiding injury, nutrition, shoes, etc.Because of the format of using several different authors, there are places in which the book conflicts with itself. I did not find this troubling. In fact, I think it led me more to realize that running is not an exact science. Different training methods work for different people. Because of the variety in the book, readers will more likely be able to find what works best for them as they &quot;listen to what their body tells them.&quot;"},{"Title":"Runner's World Complete Book of Running Everything You Need to Run for Weight Loss, Fitness, and Competition Revised and Updated","review":"Love Love Love this book.

I knew this was a compilation of several articles from Runner's World which I actually prefer to a straight-through read. A majority of the information is really pertinent and helpful to a runner like myself. However, there are a few bits of info that seem outdated like maintaining a long stride as opposed to shortening your stride or increasing your cadence as is recommended now. It is also missing some references in the articles, for example it reads, \\"Physiologists have calculated that any and all running paces are fast enough to put you into the moderate-to-vigorous aerobic zone that delivers health benefits, (For more guidance on pacing, see \\"The Starting Line,\\" page xx)\\" It literally says \\"xx\\" instead of an actual page number. I've found a handful of these which is bothersome but not a deal breaker for me. It's more annoying than anything. Overall, this is a great book with helpful information as long as you also keep up with more recent running articles and studies."},{"Title":"Runner's World Complete Book of Running Everything You Need to Run for Weight Loss, Fitness, and Competition Revised and Updated","review":"This book is nothing more than a poorly structured potpourri of snippets and brief articles on running. The quality and content of each chapter is highly variable, with resultant poor applicability and usefulness in practice. Ms Burfoot's comments section at the end of each chapter are at times disconnected from the chapter content, and do not provide a good synopsis nor added value. I do not recommend this book at all."},{"Title":"Runner's World Complete Book of Running Everything You Need to Run for Weight Loss, Fitness, and Competition Revised and Updated","review":"This is an absolutely awesome read for beginning runners. I have used much of the advice/information provided and am succeeding in my goal to become a runner. I love how they break everything down to the simplest of terms for greater understanding. I do think if you are an intermediate runner this might not appeal to you. But, as a brand new runner who has never run EVER...it's my new bible. So, glad i purchased it."},{"Title":"Runner's World Complete Book of Running Everything You Need to Run for Weight Loss, Fitness, and Competition Revised and Updated","review":"This book has everything you are looking for. I was especially pleased with the chapter on women's safety.

I was a little suprised for instance to find that the author encourages the use of anti-imflammatories for injury-recovery, which are now known to slowdown healing of certain injuries (i.e. shin pain) rather than speed it up.Overall, the book is good, but each chapter is an oversimplified summary of a topic. While I appreciate any effort at sports writing, the title is a little over the top; an obvious attempt at making a buck with eyecathers but little content. For the intermediate runner interested in this sort of book, I'd recommended \\"The Runner's Body\\" by R. Tucker adn J. Dugas instead."},{"Title":"Runner's World Complete Book of Running Everything You Need to Run for Weight Loss, Fitness, and Competition Revised and Updated","review":"I am a beginning runner and thoroughly enjoyed this book. I found the broad range of topics and writers to be a well rounded overview of important aspects to running: training, injury prevention, diet, ..., etc. (see table of contents for all the topics).I agree with the reviewers who say this book is \\"just\\" a collection of articles, you can find all this same info on the Internet, and there is some contradictory advice. However, for the price, it is nice to have all these great articles in one place in hardcopy. Contradictory advice? Talk to experts in any field and you'll get contracting advice. This reflects that different advice is best for different people and that some experts disagree (e.g. 1 experts says train 6 days a week, another says train 3 days a week). (Experts here meaning trainers, sports doctors, and runners who break world records and win big races).I would give this 5 stars except for the title may be misleading. The title sounds more encyclopedic but the book is really a nicely organized collection of great articles written over the years by expert trainers, doctors and runners."},{"Title":"Runner's World Complete Book of Running Everything You Need to Run for Weight Loss, Fitness, and Competition Revised and Updated","review":"Very generic reading, nothing into any depth of any direction.

Delivery was on time and in great condition."},{"Title":"Runner's World Complete Book of Running Everything You Need to Run for Weight Loss, Fitness, and Competition Revised and Updated","review":"Contrary to what the title states, this is not &quot;Everything you need to know to run&quot;. The book shows painfully that it is just a collection of magazine articles. Like most magazine articles, the content has breadth but no depth. And even though there is an attempt at organizing the content in a structured way, whereever there were no articles there are holes. So if you are looking for just one complete book on running, you will do much better with either one of Bob Glover's books (depending on your level as a runner). This is a decent book with some interesting ideas and concepts (for example the article on embedded circuit training) that will complement nicely your other books."},{"Title":"Runner's World Complete Book of Running Everything You Need to Run for Weight Loss, Fitness, and Competition Revised and Updated","review":"I thought so highly of this book that I gave a friend my old paperback copy and bought the hardcover for my library. This is a compilation of lessons gleaned from every conceivable mistake made by beginning runners, into real wisdom that allows the new runner to bypass the cost of errors. This book should be air-dropped to all runners just starting out."},{"Title":"Runner's World Complete Book of Running Everything You Need to Run for Weight Loss, Fitness, and Competition Revised and Updated","review":"This book has nothing new to offer. It contains a mish mash of acticles from many different runners. If you are unsure about how to train before you read this, you will be totally confused after. Different people have different opions on how to train. I would not recommend this as a first book. You'd do better to take the money and subscribe to runners world."},{"Title":"Runner's World Complete Book of Running Everything You Need to Run for Weight Loss, Fitness, and Competition Revised and Updated","review":"When I started running about a year ago, this book was my only guide. The book is loaded with valuable information that helped make my running program much, much easier. The most helpful information for me included common mistakes beginners make, injury prevention, and the mental side of running. Some reviewers complain that Runner's World magazine is better, which may be true, but what first-time runner wants to subscribe to a year's worth of magazines that arrive once a month and may or may not contain what you need at the beginner level? Burfoot's book is a great place for any beginning runner to start."},{"Title":"Runner's World Complete Book of Running Everything You Need to Run for Weight Loss, Fitness, and Competition Revised and Updated","review":"Bought this book recently and enjoyed it. Although I am sold on low carbohydrates whereas this book preaches high carbs, I still found it very informative on everything from picking out the right shoes to stretching to the proper way to run/jog.The book is authored by an expert, Amby Burfooot, in the field. He is editor of Runner's World Magazine and has ran several dozen marathons, so I took his advice seriously and all of it made perfect sense.The book is very organized and easy to read for anyone and flows smoothly so putting it down was sometimes difficult. Highly recommended for anyone wanting to start running or has already been an avid runner."},{"Title":"Runner's World Complete Book of Running Everything You Need to Run for Weight Loss, Fitness, and Competition Revised and Updated","review":"An excellent book for those after a general overview of running. I like using it as a basic reference point for a simple answer to questions such as injurys, diet, mental preparation and training. More for the beginner rather than advanced athletes as it gives no information that you don't already know, but I have found the mental preparation and diet tips chapters quiet helpful.

His treatment of functional integrals is one of the best I've seem in a field theory textbook and he does a better job of deriving the Feynman rules for QCD than I have seen elsewhere. But somewhere around half-way to two-thirds into the book it seems as though the author starts to get a little lazy, applying a more descriptive approach to the material rather than careful derivations. More is left to the reader to work through and his discussions tend to give one a sense of knowing about the material more than the actual material itself.Its not that self contained. For instance scattering problems are presented without the development of a scattering formula and are very sketchy. Knowledge of group theory and spinors is required although they are discussed briefly in an appendix.For a book of this level it would have been nice to see some topics included that were not covered: a deeper treatment of renormalization, proof of Coleman's theorem, proof of BRS invariance, derivations for asymptotic freedom of QCD.Topics I thought were handled well are: the proofs of Goldstone's theorem and the treatment of spontaneous symmetry breaking in general, development of the non-abelian gauge theory, renormalization group and the general Ward identities."},{"Title":"Gauge Field Theories (Cambridge Monographs on Mathematical Physics)","review":"I learned from cheng and li, which isnt bad itself, but i found myself frequenting this book because of it's structure. If i ever taught field theory i think this would be an ideal second semester book, first semester something more mundane like mandl or ryder. It's got a strong QCD flavor (no pun intended) to the second half. There isnt any old-style operator approached presentation in the book, but basically ti makes sense to stress the path integral viewpoint because it makes gauge theories easier to deal with as well as more advanced topics.

Most importantly, it is the story of a man with the wisdom to understand that &quot;A man keeps nothing unless he gives it away&quot;. His gifts to the Boy Scouts of America, hospitals, universities, and the city of Tulsa stand as a testiment to his wisdom and love of people. I recommend this book more often than any other. It should be required reading for all."},{"Title":"Beyond the Hills: The Journey of Waite Phillips (Oklahoma Trackmaker Series)","review":"While my purpose for reading this book was to explore the history of Philmont Scout Ranch of which Waite Phillips was the benefactor, I found this book to also be adventurous and educational. The history of Waite Phillips and his generousity shows him to be a hard businessman with a heart of gold and his priorities in the right place. I can say that the Boy Scouts of America would not be the organization it is today without the life and generousity of Waite Phillips. A must read for anyone who loves Scouting."},{"Title":"Beyond the Hills: The Journey of Waite Phillips (Oklahoma Trackmaker Series)","review":"And I will admit, my interest in opening the book was being there when Mr.Wallis and &quot;Chope&quot; Phillips did their book signing at Philmont Scout Ranch, BSA's mecca for Scouting. I thought I would be bored by the sections related to Waite and his twin brother Wiatt and their adventures prior to the time Waite became the benefactor of the property we call Philmont. Instead I found myself interested in the details and events of their lives, of Wiatt's death, and the personal insights into the Phillips family. Anyone with any interest in the west, in Scouting, in the history of the development of the oil fields, or in the giving of a man who truly felt &quot;The only things we keep forever are those we give away&quot; would be glad they read this book.To the thousands who visit Philmont every year, for training, for a wilderness experience, or to serve on staff, this book should give you the information and attitude you need to truly appreciate the experience.And you'll realize you should be kind to any old &quot;cowboy&quot; you meet in the backcountry -- it could be Chope."},{"Title":"Beyond the Hills: The Journey of Waite Phillips (Oklahoma Trackmaker Series)","review":"This is the story of Waite Phillips, brother of Frank Phillips who started Phillips Petroleum. His life was the most interesting of anyone I have read about so far. This man really lived life to the fullest and seemed to enjoy it more then others. He was a great business man who said he never had a mortgage on any property that he ever owned even though he owned at one time around 700,000 acres of land and had millions invested in commercial properties and 7 homes.The book goes through his childhood and his traveling adventures as a young man to working for his brothers in the oil business and then venturing out on his own starting his own oil company. Later on in life he moved into Real Estate and seemed to make money at everything he did. He was also a great philanthropist who gave away his prized New Mexico ranch to the Boy Scouts and along with that an office building in Tulsa to provide income for it's upkeep. One of his epigrams was \\"The only things we really keep are those we give away.\\"The book has 39 chapters and is only 375 pages long. It has many pictures of family and some of the buildings that he owned. It also contains exerts from Waite's diary and many of his own epigrams which are very insightful and gives you a real perspective of who Waite was.It is the story that makes this book so great. Anyone I believe can appreciate the way Waite lived his life and will walk away with maybe a renewed perspective on life."},{"Title":"Beyond the Hills: The Journey of Waite Phillips (Oklahoma Trackmaker Series)","review":"This book is about the journey of life of a very special man.

I didn't want to just say it was stupid like the other reader did. The majority of this book covers nail and hair tips, none of which are anything more than common sense. There's one chapter on skin care, which I did find interesting and informative. The book references white women, so if you're a women of color, you might not find any useful information. Although I'm white, my skin is dark, so I felt that I was at a loss here. The book does dedicate one chapter to women with darker skin, but it really doesn't offer anything useful. What I hated most about this book was it's format. It's written as a question and answer guide. Some people do prefer that type of book, I don't because you don't really get explantions in detail.

Only the last 40% of the book is actually really about the story that is described on the back cover.If you like over-confident, domineering men who keep their women in harems and do not think they should be allowed to think for themselves, then you will like this book.As part of his parents' plot to make money, a young English boy, Alex, and his Aunt Catherine are kidnapped and put in a ship that is over taken by pirates. They end up in Algiers where the dey decides to keep Catherine in his harem and raise Alex as his son. Catherine tries to escape with Alex and get back to England, but fails.18 years later Alex, now known as Serad, has grown up to be a pirate and a man just like the dey, much to his aunt's distress. He raids a ship and finds a young woman on board. And, as history repeats itself, he takes her to Algiers and sticks her in his harem. The difference is that Catherine can't watch another woman face the same fate as her, so she helps the girl escape back to England.

Kind-of nice that all the loose ends get wrapped up in the end - maybe a little bit improbable. I wish the villains had suffered more. Someone as evil as Vivienne deserved a page or two with details about her comeuppance. I thought the heroine (Tori) could have been a little more likeable. It was a fast read."},{"Title":"Capture My Heart","review":"Why do romance novels have to be so full of cliche? I love a good romance (Especially if pirates are involved!), but it's always the writing that lets them down. Too many corny lines and overused descriptions. The editor of this book needed a sharper eye - at one point all of Tori and Jonesy's clothes are removed so Tori has to don a 'native' dress, yet on the next page Tori is back in the dress she's borrowed from Jonesy! I know I'm fussy, but it's these kind of things that throw me out of a story. I confess to skim reading parts of the book too ... The blurb led me to want to read about Serad-Alex and Tori's relationship, but Tori didn't even appear in the book until p195! I understand that all the backstory about Alex, Catherine et all was necessary, and I'll admit I enjoyed the Malik/Catherine romance, but I think the blurb miss-sold the book. Had I been told it was an 'epic' spanning twenty-odd years and involving more than one romance, I'd have been more ready to settle in for the duration. Having said all that, I liked the characters, the over-all epicness and the romance elements. The baddies weren't all bad and the goodies weren't all good. The plot wasn't bad either - just convoluted enough to intrigue, although I confess to having the ending all figured out fairly early on as the twists were signposted rather obviously."},{"Title":"Adventures in Immortality","review":"If you would like listen to the experiences of 25 million people who came close to the border of life, clean from the autdor's own feelings, you will be pleased with every page of this research by Gallup. Gallup neatly classifies similarities in these accounts and helps you form your own view or compare it with your own experiences. This is a book about near death and out-of-body experiences, that you do not have to ask yourself the common question &quot;is this fact or fiction&quot;, as you read through other people's experiences. I found it most valuable and interesting to read."},{"Title":"Adventures in Immortality","review":"There is not much survey done on the afterlife and this book has the merit of giving and idea of what people thought in the '80.

Many of these new instruments use market instruments in one way or another, so this book could provide a European perspective on a debate that tends to be dominated by American free-marketeers. Most of the contributors do not engage this American debate, however, so the reader will have to make her own connections.The kind of \\"new instruments\\" that the book addresses include issues such as eco-taxes, eco-labeling of products, cap-and-trade mechanisms for pollution, and other market-based mechanisms. The contributors provide good factual information about these instruments in various European countries. The country studies in the first half of the book also follow a common format in their reviews. The low countries are especially well represented in the chapters, though no reason is given for this bias.The book lacks any unifying theme, much less an argument. Almost all the chapters choose to recite facts instead of explaining or analyzing. While it will inform you, it will not really deepen your understanding of the issues."},{"Title":"Thuvia Maid of Mars","review":"In \\"Thuvia, Maid of Mars\\", the action in the series switches from the transplanted Earthman, John Carter, to his half red Martian son Carthoris. Thuvia, a princess from an allied city-state, was previously introduced into the series when she was rescued from the land of the dead by John Carter. Now Carthoris has fallen in love with her, as has a rival Prince with a decidedly dark plan on how to win Thuvia and dispense with his rival, Carthoris. Through a clever plot device, Carthoris is stranded in the Martian wilds, pursuing a green martian who has made off with Thuvia.Here is the reason for the missing star. At about this book in the series the plots start to become somewhat repetitive. After three books of John Carter chasing Deja Thoris around the planet to rescue her from this and that abductor, the very same plot is in play here, just with Carthoris and Thuvia instead.Still, the action is fast and furious, and Burroughs doesn't slack up on his ability to describe one action sequence after another, each with a fresh style that keeps each scene fresh, even if the over-arching plot is not. Jules Verne and H. G. Wells get a lot of credit for their inclusion of technologies that eventually came to pass, but don't overlook Burroughs in that regard. Here he does a good job of describing a device much like our current auto-pilots in airplanes.Overall, a fun read. However, if you are trying to read the entire series straight through, you risk burning out on the repetitive basic plot. Therefore I'd recommend that you take a break between reading the first three books before taking up this one, and take breaks every other book or so for the rest of the series. After all, when originally written some of these books were published months to years apart, and those who read them in that manner didn't have the similarities pushed quite so strongly in their faces as we who can finish one and instantly begin to read the next."},{"Title":"Thuvia Maid of Mars","review":"Thuvia, Princess of Ptarth is kidnapped by the minions of Dusar to start a war between Helium and Ptarth. Carthoris, son of John Carter, Warlord of Barsoom and Prince of Helium is the prime suspect, so he rushes headlong into harm's way to rescue the woman he loves, who is promised to another. They stumble onto the city of Lotar, inhabited by a new race of Martians, the fair-skinned, auburn haired people, who can call up armies of the imagination. Carthoris fights his way through beasts and men in his effort to rescue the woman he cannot have.Another great story from one of pulp fiction's founding fathers, Edgar Rice Burroughs. His flights of fantasy inspired a generation of authors. His vision and imagination still present a more vivid and fresh fantasy world than most contemporary authors are capable of. OK, so the morals and values are nineteenth century. That's not entirely bad. Honesty, honor, integrity, courage, self-restraint, commitment, and self-sacrifice are all values worth holding onto, despite the sulky, self-indulgent ramblings of many contemporary authors and most literary critics.Awesome stories from the best of yesteryear's pulp writers!E.

John Carter only has a cameo in this book. The real star of the book is Carter's son, Carthoris, along with his lady love, Thuvia. It's a typical example of early 20th Century science fiction, although better written than the average sci-fi story. Thuvia gets kidnapped, Carthoris goes off to rescue her. Along the way, they discover another lost city of Mars (things like that happen a lot in these books). If you are interested in early science fiction, this is an entertaining example of the genre."},{"Title":"Thuvia Maid of Mars","review":"\\"Thuvia, Maid of Mars\\" by Edgar Rice Burroughs is the fourth book in the Barsoom series, and it is quite a bit different than the previous books. The first three books focused on John Carter, and his love of Dejah Thoris, but they are barely mentioned in this book. Instead, the focus switches to focus on John Carter's son, Cathoris, prince of Helium, and the title character Thuvia, princess of Ptarth, both of which were introduced in the second book of the series \\"The Gods of Mars\\", but were fairly minor characters in both that and the third book of the series. This book was originally published in three parts in \\"All-Story Weekly\\" on April 8, 15, and 22 of 1916. It was later published in book form in October of 1920.Most of the book deals with things with which the readers of the series are already familiar, such as the different kingdoms of Red Martians, and the warlike Green Martians, but there is one very interesting new development and that is in the ancient city of Lothar, and in particular the phantom bowmen who defend that city. The entire Lothar sequence is certainly the highlight of the book, with the unusual Jav, who is the first Lotharian they meet, and Tario, Jeddak of Lothar. Also, the character Kar Komak who is one of the phantom bowmen is a good addition to the cast of characters.The story is rather simple. Cathoris is in love with Thuvia, as is Astok, Prince of Dusar, but Thuvia herself is already promised to Kulan Tith, the Jeddak of Kaol. Who Thuvia favors is kept somewhat secret, though the reader can pretty much guess. Astok is determined to have her, and so he kidnaps her and frames Cathoris in the process, hoping to start a war and prevent the truth from being learned. Cathoris falls into their trap, and he and Thuvia disappear from the known world. Cathoris does his best to protect Thuvia as she gets passed from captor to captor, while the circumstances of what is going on in their kingdoms is unknown to them.This book falls short of the first books of the series for a number of reasons. Many of the devices used here were used before. One would think that so many plots and deceptions had taken place in the past, that it would not automatically work so easily in making people believe that Cathoris was a kidnapper. The fact is, though, that these hokey devices worked in the earlier books, because Burroughs did a much better job of keeping the action going and telling a complete story. This book is much shorter than any of the prior three, and the ending feels like it is cut at least a chapter short as only some of the issues raised during the story end up being resolved. One never really gets to know Kulan Tith, and so his actions in the end feel empty of significance, a mistake which Burroughs did not make in the earlier books.For those who were content with the first three books, there isn't enough here to justify coming back to it, but for those who want more, it does add something to the series. I am only going to rate this one two stars, because I feel it is significantly weaker than its predecessors, but for those who are big fans of the series, you probably will still get something out of it."},{"Title":"Thuvia Maid of Mars","review":"I enjoyed this story as much as the other Barsoom books by Edgar Rice Burroughs. However I wouldn't recommend this non illustrated version. The typeface and spacing of the novel in the kindle edition made the book difficult to read. I was constantly tapping the button to go to the next page since there were few words on the page, almost like a children's book. If I would have purchased a different version I would give this book at least 4 stars."},{"Title":"Thuvia Maid of Mars","review":"Readers have to remember the age context of this book and the entire ERB series.

Edgar Rice B. has made me bored with his style. This story is LONG on description and SHORT on plot. There is so much description that I lost track of what I was reading. I realize he wrote during the last century and people did not realize Mars was what it was. I guess I will be very embarrassed if the Mars Rover proves Edgar Rice was right!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Thuvia Maid of Mars","review":"\\"Thuvia, Maid of Mars\\" is the 4th of 11 John Carter novels from the pen of Edgar Rice Burroughs. It first appeared in April 1916, as a three-part serial in the magazine \\"All Story Weekly.\\" This is the first Carter novel that does not feature John Carter himself as the central character; he only makes a brief cameo appearance early on. Instead, the action mantle is taken up by Carthoris, Carter's son, but fortunately, Carter Junior turns out to be just as good a swashbuckler as the old man. In this installment, Princess Thuvia of Ptarth has been kidnapped by the spineless Prince Astok of Dusar, which abduction almost causes a world war on Barsoom (Mars). Young Carthoris, in his quest to free his beloved princess, runs across deserted cities, a forgotten kingdom, banths (10-legged Barsoomian lions), ethereal warriors, mucho swordplay, giant white apes, and on and on. As is usual for these books, the amount of action that Burroughs packs into a small compass is quite surprising. Whereas previous Carter books seem to read more like fantasy/fairy tales than science fiction, this installment veers even more to the fantastic, mainly in the use of those phantom warriors just mentioned. These bowmen are called up from the minds of the remaining members of the lost city of Lothar, and have no \\"real\\" concrete existence. However, their arrows can still kill. In this book we also get, for the first time, a nice, detailed look at life in Helium; what the people do, how they live and the like. We also receive a biological explanation of how Carthoris, who was 10 years old but a seeming adult in the previous books, got to be that way. The worldwide peace that apparently prevails at the end of book 3, \\"The Warlord of Mars,\\" is shown in this volume to be not as widespread as was inferred, which makes for some nice tense situations. So this is a good, fast-moving, detailed entry in the series.There are some minor problems of inconsistency and fuzzy writing, however, although not as prevalent as in previous entries. For example, in one scene, Carthoris is said to be fighting a force of a dozen Dusarians; three of these are killed, and so three are left. Huh? Carthoris seems to know exactly where to find water in the dead city of Aaanthor, despite the fact that he has never been there before. Wha? Vas Kor, one of Carthoris' chief enemies, fails to recognize him merely because Carthoris is dirty, tired and covered with blood; this is just a bit hard to swallow. Perhaps worst of all, the book ends extremely abruptly, just as all of Barsoom is about to be plunged into that world war. We never learn the fate of several of the main villains, nor do we see the end of hostilities as the realization of the true facts becomes known. This is a short book, and would not have suffered by the addition of such scenes to make it more satisfying. Still, this is a fun entry in the John Carter series, one that all lovers of fast-moving fantasy should enjoy."},{"Title":"Thuvia Maid of Mars","review":"I first read this book and this series some 52 years ago...I recently dug them out and had another go. They are as fun now as they were then. Burroughs' style is absolutely great and needs to be savored. The books are action packed and certainly reflet a time in our society long past. I feel to understand current SiFi and S&S, you really need to start during this time period. We certainly have come along way, in may ways, but it is very evident that this writer and his contemporaries certainly had a profound influence on what we are getting today. This are books for little boys and girls and thank goodness I have enough of that little boy in me to still enjoy them."},{"Title":"Thuvia Maid of Mars","review":"Don't take the star rating wrong - this is as good as any of the other books in this series, but this edition (Quiet Vision Publishing - paperback, printed in 2000) is the cheapest printing of a book I've ever seen. Only about 20 pages into it, pages started falling out of the back. The type is huge and goes all the way to the edge of the page so your thumbs are constantly in the way while you're trying to read, and there are typographical errors like using two hyphens instead of em dashes. I know they make an electronic version of this book. As part of my job I convert a lot of print-intended content to digital publishing formats, and that's what usually happens to em dashes during that process, so I almost wonder if they just printed out their digital version and bound it. It looks like it was printed on a laser printer (especially the terrible cover illustration which looks like it was drawn by a 12-year old), and the fonts look like they're just PC-standard 'Times'. There are also several footnotes, which in the original edition that I read years ago were placed at the bottom of the page they were referenced from. In this edition they're in the back of the book."},{"Title":"Thuvia Maid of Mars","review":"It took the first three volumes of his Martian series for Edgar Rice Burroughs to get his hero John Carter, former cavalier of Virginia, and Dejah Thoris, princess of Helium to the point where they could live happily ever after. Satisfied with the combination of romance and pulp adventure, this fourth Martian novel turns to the next generation of Barsoomians. Cathoris, son of the Warlord of Mars and his beloved princess, is one of two princes and a Jeddak who are seeking the hand of the Thuvia of Ptarth. When she is kidnapped by the sinister Prince Astok of Dusar, the entire planet is about to be thrown into a bloody war and Cathoris has to follow in his father's footstep and deal with savage beasts and phantom armies as he rescues Thuvia and saves Barsoom from a costly war. Of course, by the time he catches up with his beloved, Cathoris finds the situation is slightly more complicated than he thought, mainly because ERB never provides a smooth ending for his couples.\\"Thuvia, Maid of Mars\\" was originally serialized in \\"All-Story Weekly\\" in April 1916, which explains the novel's subtext about world war, since one was going on in Europe at that point in time. The original title was \\"Cathoris,\\" but apparently when it was published as a novel in 1920 somebody wised up and changed it. Thuvia is not as great a name as Deja Thoris, but it is not bad. In many ways this is like the previous novel, \\"The Warlord of Mars,\\" where the hero chases his beloved across the landscape of Barsoom and has to deal with green men and white apes. Fortunately, unlike ERB's Tarzan series, \\"Thuvia, Maid of Mars\\" is really the only time that repeats himself like this in the Martian series, which stands out as his best as he proves in the next and most inventive volume in the series, \\"Chessmen of Mars.\\""},{"Title":"Thuvia Maid of Mars","review":"It's hard to describe the fulfillment one feels after reading anyone of the books in Burrough's series. The complete dominance of honor, and the constant heroism and adventure in these books is heart warming, as well as thrilling. In this part of the series, somewhat to my dissappointment, John Carter is no longer telling the story, but his son, Carthoris, is. Readers of the first three books don't be alarmed however! Carthoris is &quot;just as good a story teller as his father.&quot; And the story is just as exciting."},{"Title":"Thuvia Maid of Mars","review":"Sometimes I get the impression the John Carter books served as the blueprints for many Star Trek: The Original Series episodes. You have a hero, a girl, and a lost and ancient civilization which threatens to engulf all known space (er, Barsoom) if someone doesn't do something FAST.Thuvia, Maid of Mars, passes the torch from father to son as Carthoris, son of John Carter and Dejah Thoris, pursues the heart of the princess Thuvia. To her secret shame Thuvia returns Carthoris' love, but she is already promised to another. When a rival prince kidnaps Thuvia and frames Carthoris for the deed, the son of the Warlord of Mars sets out to rescue the woman he loves no matter what it will cost him.Undoubtedly the most disturbing but tense part of the story falls in the city of Lothar, where Carthoris and Thuvia must do battle with ancient Barsoomians who possess incredible powers of the mind. And the most unlikely hero of all turns out to be a fignment of a character's imagination. This book is a good demonstration of how Burroughs' world of Barsoom was filled with its own stories, and not just a convenient backdrop for John Carter's adventures."},{"Title":"Thuvia Maid of Mars","review":"More similar in its simplicity to a Princess of Mars than Gods/Warlord. John Carter's son engages in search for abducted Thuvia, while he remains the prime suspect in her abduction.

In this story, the son of the Warlord of Mars, Carthoris of Helium, searches for and finds the Princess of Ptarth, Thuvia. As if it is not enough to fight strange creatures, the reader is also introduced to several new characters.This story continues the fighting adventure and fantasy of the series. Although John Carter is not a prominent character throughout this book, Dejah Thoris and John Carter's son is. Since Carthoris has inherited much of the speed, strength, and intelligence of the earth man, the story loses none of its excitement.In my humble opinion, this book loses none of the excitement we saw in the first three books. I like the fantasy the author has created, and this volume adds to that. We are once again introduced to new areas of Barsoom, and new species and cultures. How wonderful to be able to find new life forms when traveling across your own planet. For all the advancement we see on Barsoom, we find the people are sometimes less informed than the average earth man.I am still amazed by the fact that the author had such an active imagination at the time he wrote this series. While rockets and airplanes were not yet usable, he puts us on a planet in the solar system with airplanes and lighter than air land vehicles. His explanations for life on Barsoom is almost plausible. Yet, his ability to show us how to have peace amongst tribes that have always warred could be an example even today. Is peace possible, in the midst of fighting and horrific weapons? I do not have the answer, but perhaps it is something else to think about while reading these fantastic books."},{"Title":"Thuvia Maid of Mars","review":"A very nice classic about adventures of John Carter in Mars.

Although Thuvia's emotions are discussed like a man's, she is a character in her own right. She is also given the tough choice between her life and embracing another ruler. The romance in this story also seems more enchanting than the rest of the Mars series, but perhaps it's because we see Burrough's attempt at the woman's point of view through her own thoughts instead of the abstractions he uses to describe previous character's desires, like those of Dejah Thoris. Granted, Burroughs isn't perfect in that his women think and react like slightly more feminine versions of his male characters and do what is expected of them, but the attempt makes his women certainly seem more human than before. In short, this novel is one I would recommend to anyone reading Burroughs for the first time, especially a female reader, because it has both the adventure and fighting his novels always have and realistic characters which they often lack."},{"Title":"Thuvia Maid of Mars","review":"As a long-time ERB fan, I have always favored the Mars series (right behind the Pellucidar series).

They turned out to fit into one, entitled John Carter of Mars; so, when Ballantine reprinted the series, they substituted this \\"number 12\\" for \\"Thuvia and Komal\\" that had been used on TMoM, volume four of the first printing.

Along the way the two wind up in a bizzare lost city where what is real and what is not real is disputed.It's an odd story with the old cliches. Thuvia is the classic damsial-in-distress, nearly being suduced by bad men three seperate times, rescued right before it's too late. Lots of epic sword fighting.

The first book written to promulgate an understanding of the Oxford Movement is R. W. Church's 1891 \\"The Oxford Movement: Twelve Years, 1833-1845. As the first book on the topic, Church's book has had a large influence on the literature of the Oxford Movement over the years. It continues to be a good introduction to the subject but is lacking in a few ways as well.Church was himself in an ideal situation from which to write such a book, being first a student and then a tutor at Oriel College, Oxford at the same time as John Henry Newman and John Keble. In fact, Church became a disciple and close friend of Newman, which helps explain in part why Church's view of the Oxford Movement is written largely through the lens of Newman and his dynamic, turbulent thought. This is at least one reason why Church considers the Oxford Movement as a twelve year period (from Keble's Assize Sermon in 1833 until Newman's joining the Roman Catholic Church in 1845). Until recently, most scholars of the Oxford Movement have joined Church in reading the Oxford Movement primarily through the lens of Newman. However, Church's work would have been more powerful and useful if it had dealt with the aftermath of Newman's departure and its effect on the Oxford Movement.Church writes with a terse, narrative style and focuses primarily on the principal players of the Oxford Movement. His first-hand knowledge of the people involved is one strength of the book, and his narrative style makes the book easy to read. However, the focus on people means that to some degree a more objective analysis of the meaning and import of the Oxford Movement was left to other writers. Church is clear in his Advertisement that he did not pretend to write a history of the movement or adequately to judge it but intended to preserve a contemporary memorial of a \\"true and noble effort which passed before my eyes, with all that was in it of self-devotion, affectionateness, and high and refined and varied character . . . .\\"In summary, Church's work is a good one but limited in a number of ways. Modern students of the Oxford Movement should especially read Nockles \\"The Oxford Movement in Context.\\""},{"Title":"Zen for Christians: A Beginner's Guide","review":"~This is a simple, direct, and trustworthy introduction to Zen thought and practice. It's really Zen -- not watered-down relaxation exercises -- and it's really for Christians, for serious, fully committed Christians. There is nothing vague or wishy-washy about Boykin, either as a Zen practitioner or as a Christian.Her meditation instructions are wonderful, and she spends plenty of time talking about the physical enterprise of meditation -- the mechanics of how to sit, where to sit, how long to sit, and so forth -- something I think many teachers neglect, forgetting maybe just how large that looms to a beginner. She corrects the most damaging misconceptions about meditation -- that it's a matter of trying not to have thoughts, for example, or that it's always a peaceful and calming occupation -- but she never lets the reader forget that meditation is a practice, not an idea: the only way to find out what meditation has offer is to meditate.She presents the theory of Zen -- if it can be said to have such a thing -- just as clearly. \\"In Zen,\\" writes Boykin, \\"the Buddha's teachings are not understood to be divine revelations or doctrines to be believed. Rather, they are understood to be observations about human experience -- observations made by a human being, the Buddha, that can be made by any human being.\\" She goes on to summarize the fundamental teachings of Buddhism, the Four Noble Truths, as clearly as I've ever seen them summarized. This part of the book alone would be worth the price of admissionWhen she considers parallels and analogs between Zen and Christianity, she does so without simplifying or compromising either. There's no nonsense about Zen \\"really\\" being Christianity or Christianity \\"really\\" being Zen. But there's a fascinating discussion of the Zen paradox that we are both already, and not yet, enlightened, in the light of the Christian question of justification by faith or by works; and a very sensitive exploration of what Zen and Christianity mean by \\"selflessness.\\"I came to this book with a great deal of skepticism. Mix-and-match approaches to religious traditions sometimes amount to keeping whatever is agreeable and discarding whatever is challenging -- reincarnation without karma, Christ without the crucifixion, Buddha-Nature without emptiness -- and it's all too possible, by carefully picking out every piece that reinforces your ego and leaving out every piece that subverts it, to construct an exact replica of your original confusion.So I was delighted to find nothing of the kind in \\"Zen for Christians.\\" Boykin is a serious Christian and a serious Zen practitioner, and she's written a serious -- though also wonderfully readable -- book about both. You couldn't find a better introduction to Buddhism; and really, though it was no part of her project, you'd be hard-pressed to find a better introduction to Christianity, either."},{"Title":"Zen for Christians: A Beginner's Guide","review":"While it is true that one could practice, say, yoga, and practice it well and fairly near completeness and still be a Christian, it is a bit of a stretch to fully immerse oneself in Zen Buddhism and remain a Christian. Or vice-versa.This is not and cannot be immediately apparent to casual and beginning practitioners of either Christianity or Zen. Certainly however it should be clear to Kim Boykin. And, after a fashion, I think it is. What she has done is reduce Zen to something close to a non-spiritual practice, a &quot;Zen for health,&quot; if you will, in particular Zen for mental and emotional health, and in that way make Zen compatible with Christianity.As Boykin points out, the central tenet of Christianity, that of salvation, is similar to the Buddhist tenet of right behavior. In Christianity all have sinned, but if we accept Christ, who died for our sins, as our savior we will enter the Kingdom of Heaven. In Buddhism we are not &quot;unsaved&quot; or in a state of mortal sin, rather we are in a state of pain and suffering, some of it psychological. We overcome that state through Right Living, Right Behavior--the famous Eightfold Path. (See especially page 91.)Boykin goes into the differences and similarities in her third chapter, &quot;Zen Teachings and Christian Teachings.&quot; Basically she resolves all apparent conflicts by stating that &quot;Zen teachings are not doctrines.&quot; This is precisely, exactly correct. Indeed, the central spirit in Zen is to laugh at all doctrines, to find enlightenment through &quot;killing the Buddha&quot; and &quot;no thought,&quot; which are ways to get away from the limitations of the so-called rational mind. Typically a Zen koan presents the student with a logical paradox and demands an answer, an answer that can only be found by transcending the rational mind and all doctrines. So, by this method Boykin can accept any facet of Christianity including the most literal and fundamental and find no conflict with Zen.So be it.However, there is no &quot;God&quot; in Buddhism. Consequently for God to have a &quot;son&quot; can only be understood in a symbolic sense. The acceptance of Christ as a personal savior, again can only be done in a symbolic sense. To go even deeper into Buddhist &quot;theology,&quot; if you will, or &quot;psychology&quot; (which I think is the best way to understand these things, at least in the beginning) it is necessary to realize that for the Buddhist we do not even exist in the same way we do in Christianity. In Buddhism the self is an illusion. In Christianity the self is very real and transcends death. Furthermore, there is no concept of karma or reincarnation in Christian theology. Boykin does not discuss either idea, possibly because neither idea is logically compatible with Christianity.What Boykin does well here is to show how Zen meditation can enrich one's life, how &quot;being here now&quot; and other Zen practices can lead to a fuller spiritual experience, as they have for her. From a Christian point of view, prayer is the most powerful meditation. From another point of view, prayer is simply one type of meditation. Prayer and meditation are both practices, or techniques, if you will, for finding God or nirvana--which to some people amounts to the same thing. Zazen (&quot;just sitting,&quot; i.e., sitting meditation) is certainly a practice that would be compatible with any religion.So what Zen for Christians is about is using Zen techniques to further one's Christianity. This is fine, but theological speaking, Zen and Christianity are different ways to God and cannot be held as truths simultaneously without some strenuous mental gymnastics. (Or actually in the impish spirit of Zen, they can be held simultaneously in the mind with the greatest of ease!) A striking example of this discordance can be seen on page 40 where Boykin recites a prayer learned from Karl Rahner. It ends with the words, &quot;I am powerless, blind, dead, but you are mighty, light, and life and have conquered me long ago with the deadly impotence of your Son.&quot; Prayer is surrender to a power greater than oneself. But words like &quot;the deadly impotence of your Son&quot; have no meaning in Zen.More in concert with the spirit of Zen would be the 46th Psalm as quoted on the next page: &quot;Be still, and know that I am God.&quot; However, the use of the word &quot;God&quot; and the sense that &quot;God&quot; would actually demand something of someone is foreign to Zen. In Zen one does not speak of God partly because traditionally the Buddha turned aside all such questions. (It takes some study to understand why he did.) But theologically speaking, to mention God would be to immediately identify God in some manner, and that would be meaningless since what stands for God in Buddhism is beyond any human designation--indeed beyond human comprehension. On the other hand, in Christianity God is made personal. Moreover, in fundamentalist Christianity, humans are said to be made in the image of God.Boykin's style is engaging and her recollection of her Zen training and how she came to the Catholic Church make for interesting reading. I had the sense that one of the commonalities shared by Zen and Christianity that Boykin discovered, perhaps in a subconscious way, is in the practices of Zen and the rituals of the Catholic Church. Although they are very different in structure and event, they serve some of the same purposes, that of helping the aspirant find spirituality. And of course the monastic tradition in Zen has some similarities with that of the Catholic Church.Bottom line: While this is a good introduction to Zen, if you want to read about how Zen and Christianity can and cannot be reconciled, I recommend Thomas Merton or Alan Watts."},{"Title":"Zen for Christians: A Beginner's Guide","review":"I'm glad these sorts of work are becoming more and more popular in the literary world, because we have them coming from both the Christian and Buddhist community. Kim Bokyin is a teacher of contemplative prayer (a subject Merton always wrote extensively about) to both Christians and non Christians. This books' more like a beginners guide for people who don't have any idea what Zen Buddhism is actually about. Like a nice lure giving the fish just enough that, with any luck, they will come begging for more.She's a very concise instructor in here, pouring over the fundamentals with a sort of ease and conviction. She explains meditation, koan work, non duality, The Four Noble Truths here; and what's more, Christians don't need to feel they need to give up Christianity to practice Zen. It may be true on a deeper level that in order to truly devote yourself, this might be so. But you can enhance your current religious traditions and spiritual practice with zazen (Zen meditation) at any time. Even contemplating scripture as though they are koans, is a beneficial practice. Christianity has a lot to benefit from Zen, allowing people to place aside desires for achievements (I dare say even heaven) and simply realize your life as this moment. There is no \\"goal.\\" Only this.This was an excellent book, and for those with interest in further reading on the matter I recommend Ruben Habito's book \\"Living Zen, Loving God.\\" He has studied Zen and Christianity for decades, and provides further illuminating insights for Christians on reconciling Zen with Christianity. Anyway, get this book. It's an invaluable tool on the spiritual path."},{"Title":"Zen for Christians: A Beginner's Guide","review":"Zen for Christians contains practical meditation instructions, interspersed with personal stories as well as more theological chapters. Boykin does a great job addressing theological questions about doing Zen practice without compromising one's Christian faith. Her explanation of the Buddha's Four Noble Truths is one of the clearest I've ever read. She takes complex philosophical concepts and makes them very easy to understand, but without \\"watering them down.\\" Zen for Christians is a welcome addition to the growing number of books on interfaith dialogue between Christianity and Buddhism."},{"Title":"Zen for Christians: A Beginner's Guide","review":"I have read ABOUT Zen for the past 10 or 15 years. This is the first book that has motivated me to actually practice! What an outstanding tool to help Christians like myself fearlessly begin to delve into zazen.The writer approaches the subject from a very human point of view. She is \\"one of us,\\" battling with fickleness and human nature. And yet, with simple language, practical examples and personal experiences, she helps us to smell the aroma of the spiritual feast that awaits us in Zen practice.While this book probably won't add much to the knowledge or practice of those who are Buddhists or are already practicing Zen regularly, it will be very helpful for Christians who may have an interest in meditation. This book is Hands-On and How-To for those who want to do more than just know ABOUT Zen."},{"Title":"Zen for Christians: A Beginner's Guide","review":"Zen for Christians is a fantastic book for those wishing to learn more on the basics of zen meditation. This is a step by step guide to getting the most out of your meditation. I would recommend this book to any christian who is hesitant about the merger of another religion. It really is simply a christians guide to better meditation and not a guide to merge any religions."},{"Title":"Zen for Christians: A Beginner's Guide","review":"I liked this for it's simplicity. It went in to the reasons why they can work together in plain language. I learned more about both than I knew before and it clarified the differences between the 2, ie Christianity is a religion and Zen is not.I loaned it to my preacher to help me define where I am without an argument."},{"Title":"Zen for Christians: A Beginner's Guide","review":"If you are interested in zen meditation, and have no experience ,this is a good start, but there are many nonchristian meditation books out there that do a better job. If you want an analysis of christian and zen beliefs this does a decent job, but is very redundant at times and is mostly an account of the author's personal experiences. All in all the book is just OK, not good and not bad."},{"Title":"Wall At Edge Of World","review":"This is probably one of my favorite 'after-the-apocalypse' novels (and I've read *many*) of the past 10 years. It's been a few years since I've read it, so I forget some of the details, but it's very original, and it stands above many of its contemporaries. The feel of the highly oppressive religious-based society is very real, as is the telepathic element. If you can find a used copy, I would definitely recommend it. A friend of mine loved it too."},{"Title":"Wall At Edge Of World","review":"This is one of those books that you hope to find but seldom do. It is creative science fiction, not hard science fiction. The excellent writing accompanies a well-developed story that becomes hypnotic at the end. The book is something of a messiah tale. It is not a romping read, but it will return to the patient reader a reward far in excess of the effort put in. I loved this book. I wish it and Aiken's other books were more readily available. The fact that they are hard to find probably reflects on their literary appeal in a not-often-literary genre."},{"Title":"Wall At Edge Of World","review":"The Wall at the Edge of the World is a dynamic piece of work.

It's a unique, highly evocative, extremely well written \\"after the apocalypse\\" type of book.

This book deserves to be in print."},{"Title":"Wall At Edge Of World","review":"Jim Aikin's \\"Wall at the Edge of the World\\" is highly imaginative, and has some interesting things to say, but unfortunely, the ending left something to be desired, and the writing could get a bit tedious. In this novel, a telepath named Danlo Ree discovers that his society is built upon a genocidal lie. Basically, his society is all telepaths, and a \\"hive mentality\\" is encouraged. Non-telepaths who are called \\"nulls\\" are ritually killed by beheading. Danlo is kidnapped by a group of wild women who escaped a mass slaughter centuries ago. Then, Danlo meets up with a few other telepaths, including a girl with an extraordinary ability, who agree with his viewpoint, and they try to save the \\"nulls\\" from destruction."},{"Title":"Wall At Edge Of World","review":"This is one of the best books that I have read.

It is interesting and edgy and keeps you guessing until the end."},{"Title":"The Road Not Taken (Alias)","review":"Many books which stem from series are not very good but this one manages to catch the atmosphere quite well. Most of the characters from the series are involved in the story which is a self-contained mission outside the story arcs of the series. Sidney goes undercover as a teacher to the difficult daughter of the Mexican Ambassador to the US in order to investigate possible links between an assassin and someone in the embassy. There are plenty of suspects and a lot of action, which is all within the spirit of the series and as a result is a useful reminder of how good the Alias series was and what made it so good."},{"Title":"The Road Not Taken (Alias)","review":"I give this book 3 stars because it's really only worth reading if you're an Alias fan. I got it for a dollar at a thrift store, and that was a good deal.It's a very short and easy read, and while there are some twists, it's nothing that you'll have to try to wrap your head around - especially if you've watched Alias at all. I'm sure there were some strict editing guidelines the author had to follow to maintain continuity, but he often relies on what you already know about the characters to fill in where a lot of what an original fiction book would have to explain. The characterization of Weiss is well done, but Sydney feels a little thin, and Vaughn is overdone.I'd give the book 4 stars for people who like Alias, but I'm not one to give a book a good review for a specific audience (as Roger Ebert tends to do with his movie reviews)."},{"Title":"Power of An Hour: Business and Life Mastery in One Hour A Week","review":"Intense writing, with a perfect blueprint for making a better life.Helped me FINALLY get organized!!!

In each area, Lakhani challenges you to pinpoint what needs to be fine tuned, developed, improved or taken to the next level. Once you've identified the \\"problem areas,\\" the author gives you suggestions to kick things up a notch, or get into stride.\\"Power of an Hour\\" is a straightforward book that is compellingly readable. The book starts with the premise of \\"fearsome focus,\\" which involves focusing on task for 45 minutes, followed by 15 minutes for free time (answering emails, phone calls, restroom breaks, etc.) Lakhani draws from his background in martial arts, NLP, and being an undercover narcotics agent. Yes, it's a real treat learning firsthand from this multi-talented \\"insider\\" who has \\"been there, done that\\" and now lays it all on the table for you. By reading this book, you'll learn techniques and strategies to become self-disciplined, tune out distractions, and get the most out of your day.Written primarily for brick-and-mortar businesses (owners, employees and managers) this book doesn't say much about Internet marketers, but with a little thought and reflection, you can easily apply Lakhani's principles to your online business.Occasionally, Lakhani cuts back and shows his playful, fun-loving side. The author takes mental vacations by visualizing himself scuba diving, for instance. Lakhani also mentions his wife's \\"special look.\\" One look, says Lakhani, and he instantly knows that Stephanie loves him, without saying a word. (Is that cool, or what?)Perhaps the book's most entertaining chapter deals with \\"Envisioneering,\\" or imagining something so clearly that you manifest it. Lakhani's concept is so electrically charged and secret-esque that it sizzles. Anyone in possession of Rhonda Byrne's book (or dvd) needs to read this chapter instead. But be prepared, you'll need a cold shower after reading it!Another excellent chapter deals with reinventing yourself, and how to prepare yourself for this change. Lakhani explains why \\"fake it until you make it\\" doesn't work, neither does \\"Sink or Swim.\\" In each case, the real answer is to believe that change is possible, take stock of your current skills, assess what you need to learn, and take action. Want to know more? Get yourself a copy of this book.Seriously, Lakhani's \\"Power of an Hour\\" is a page-turner from start to finish. My favorite chapters were ch.15-19 which \\"bring down the house\\" and get you all fired up and ready to make changes, without overwhelm or procrastination. The powerhouse tips and techniques from Lakhani's friend, MSG Dennis Stockwell, add even more spark and sizzle.

It is a tremendous resource for business consultants and coaches as well as the business owner. Dave Lakhani offers an effective system to implement not just change, but mastery in your business and personal life.That being said, this book is not for everyone. In some ways, this is a difficult book. The exercises that Dave leads you through are thorough and and you will end up asking yourself some hard questions. Fortunately, you only have to tackle it an hour at a time. Dave doesn't do things half-way; his attitude seems to be \\"Why wouldn't you want to be the best in whatever you do?\\" The man is ferocious.In that regard, I think this book is brutal and will weed out all but the people most determined to get their businesses and their lives to a level of excellence. And maybe that is okay. Too many people are happy comparing themselves favorably to mediocre competition. Let the slackers read the feel-good, warm-fuzzy books. This book is designed for people who work on a level of excellence and demand more from themselves and their lives."},{"Title":"Power of An Hour: Business and Life Mastery in One Hour A Week","review":"I bought the book at the suggestion of Harv Eker, whom I respect. However, I found this book to be dogmatic and lacking the inspiration that I expected. I found that many of the chapters were dry, brief, and did not connect with me. I had the sensation of having someone who had heard \\"this is how to be productive with your time\\" from someone else and was passing on the cliff notes. Instead of this book, I would recommend Brian Tracy's Goals! - which gave me much more inspiration and practical exercises."},{"Title":"Power of An Hour: Business and Life Mastery in One Hour A Week","review":"I've read Dave Lakhani's book on influence and persuasion and, when I saw this title, I thought, \\"OK another author who sold a bunch of books and the publisher said - do you have another idea so we can bleed your market.\\" Just being honest here. But boy was I surprised. I really enjoyed the book.I have been teaching a model we call \\"The Foundations of Effectiveness\\" for more than four years. This book is a great resource for all those who've heard me talk about the importance of DISCIPLINE, which is one of the four knowledge areas within the SELF-MANAGEMENT Foundation. This book provides a set of simple techniques that can be used to form new habits and life patterns. This is in line with the definition we use for DISCIPLINE: the sum total of your habits.In addition, Power of An Hour, will help you in the other two foundations: Relational and Technical abilities.

Alas, it was a disappointment. There are a few good nuggets of wisdom here, but maybe a magazine article's worth, certainly not a complete book. It's barely 200 pages long and this number was padded through the liberal use of wide white space breaks between paragraphs and a huge number of dot-point lists. It is also poorly written, full of redundant phrasing, non-sequiturs, and improper use of language.

I've always known that I should be spending a set amount of time each week to focus on the things I need to do to become more successful. Well, this book gives you the blueprint to do just that.

Few of his instructions are revolutionary, but Lakhani's energy and enthusiasm propel his common-sense message to new heights of can-do optimism. The bulk of the book is composed of 18 chapters that focus on specific hour-long business or personal tasks, but these chapters simply extrapolate the essential idea of learning the skill of focus described in the first 35 pages.

Powerful is too tame of a word to describe Dave's persona. He's 6'3, 300lbs of warrior and brilliant.I met Dave through some Internet marketing friends. Many of whom are always telling me what I \\"need\\" to be doing. There are so many things that \\"I need to be doing\\" that I wind up not taking action. When I meet many experts I'm overwhelmed because they give me too much to do and I don't start.Lakhani's book won't overwhelm you. Dave makes focus easy because he's only requesting one hour a week. Monday nights I now spend an hour learning, following Dave's system. You can too. This isn't like learning Japanese from CDs where I got frustrated very quickly. I'm seeing differences. Dave encourages some basics like articulating specific measurable results, but he has some new premises as well like in the role of our narrative in terms of reinforcing productive behavior and learning.Have you ever seen trade-show magician Joel Bauer perform for 4 hours straight without repeating material? Impressive barely begins to describe this feat. How did Joel learn so much material? He spent an hour a day learning magic, or comedy, or whatever he needed. Dave's system is similar in approach...first you get his help identifying what will have the greatest impact to learn or improve, then Dave gives you a better system for learning. You don't need to only sleep 4 hours a night like Joel Bauer reportedly sleeps.This book is for mere mortals like me. Sometimes when I read Bandler or other transformational authors I wonder which students are able to master some of the techniques so quickly from a book. I know some do and I've been frustrated I wasn't among them. After only two weeks I feel Dave's approach increasing my confidence. I needed to start with my packaging, my clothing and how I present myself. What I've found is that spending a structured hour on this idea once a week makes me a better student for the course of the week.As a 23 year old I read a rare book that encouraged meto account for my marginal time. I never had the disciplineof a Dave Lakhani or a Joel Bauer, I was raised by liberalparents.What I'm trying to communicate is that Dave's course isaccessible and doable and I'm digging it. I'm laughing more and having more fun. It may appear weird from the outside, but being more serious about some things actually allows me to be less serious about others and is helping me have more fun.No, bisexual 19 year-olds aren't bringing their girlfriends over to meet me...not that kind of male delusional fun, but sustainable confidence. And this confidence is palatable. And women are introducing themselves to me in situations that surprise me.What's my difference? I'm more focused. I'm more intentional. I'm faster to let go of negative thoughts because I know they aren't serving me well in a way in which I hadn't known this before.Dave Lakhani's coaching has helped me get to the next level.Having better focus with more intelligent lists of things to do, including play, relaxes me. I'm more relaxed than I've been since I was 14.Sincerely,Ben"},{"Title":"Power of An Hour: Business and Life Mastery in One Hour A Week","review":"This is a very well written book. The basic subject matter has been touched on before, but this is a very in deapth approach to the subject."},{"Title":"Almost a Lifetime: A True Story","review":"Eva Vary begins her compelling memoir ALMOST A LIFETIME by recalling the old Chinese proverb, \\"May you live in interesting times.\\" She knows whereof she speaks. Vary was a newly married, newly graduated chemical engineer living outside of Budapest when Russian tanks rolled into Hungary to quell the short but exhilarating uprising known to the world as the Hungarian Revolution. Having had a taste of freedom from Russian oppression, Eva Vary joined other Hungarians determined not to let the ideals and hope of the Revolution fade away to nothing. If the country could not get free of Soviet rule, they would free themselves by fleeing across the Hungarian borders into freedom. By the time she made arrangements to get herself and her husband over the Austrian border, Eva was in the early months of pregnancy. Her husband had second thoughts about leaving his native land, and did not show up for the rendezvous. Undeterred, Eva fled by herself into Austria and began the arduous process of starting a new life for herself and her unborn child.The story of Eva's flight from Hungary, her determination to have her child born in the US, and her successful immigration would in itself have made an exciting memoir. Eva Vary lived in interesting times indeed. But once in America, Eva began to climb the corporate ladder, getting jobs in chemical engineering that had been filled almost exclusively by men. Taking more classes, getting additional degrees, bringing her mother over from Hungary to live with her and help raise her daughter Susan, Eva Vary overcame one obstacle after another, coming to be accepted and respected by the very men who had and doubted her abilities and stood in her way in getting the positions for which she was more than qualified.Reading Eva's memoirs, I came to a new understanding of how difficult it was for independent women to live and work in a man's world in the early part of the twentieth century. My own mother was a pilot, a member of the Women Airforce Service Pilots or WASP, in the 30's and 40's and during WWII. My mother never put the story of her life into a coherent whole, but the stories she told over the years resonate amazingly with the stories found in Eva Vary's memoirs. I recommend this book to anyone who would like to hear a first-hand account of a strong woman of faith who set a course and followed it, achieving success in management of chemical plants as well as success as a single parent.

Yet there is really nothing sublime about this poetry; it is merely a very, very clever stunt. If you set aside the fact that Bok uses only one vowel in each section, and examine the work for other poetic merits, it has few. It is little more than a tongue twister or a very high class form of doggerel. I was unable to finish the work."},{"Title":"Eunoia: The CD","review":"Although the Philistines among us will surely condemn this masterpiece, we must remember Andy Warhol's exhortation that the truly great things are things misunderstood. This brings us to &quot;Eunoia&quot;, a work of sublime mysticism and truly poetic lyricism. The project, shortly described and encapsulated is thus: To divide, into five chapters, words, forming sentences, containing only one vowel. The author, who will no doubt be considered pretentious by those unwilling to invest the time involved in appreciating his masterpiece, has placed additional restrictions on this composition.Did you find the dictionary a good read, but a bit dry in spots? Eunoia is the book for you. Designed to make a mockery of those who insist that a book must be intelligible, poetic, or at the very least worth the pulp it's printed on, Eunoia is a paean to the kind of people who attend Warhol's &quot;Empire&quot;, and claim to be deeply moved by it. That's right, the best use for Eunoia is bumph, doubly so if you've read it first. If you're reading the electronic edition, print out a copy for this purpose.Bok has taken pretense to new levels, nay to dimensions of superciliousness that defy the comprehension of your humble reviewer. Like a two-dimensional man attempting to describe a cube, I find this work to be offensive in more dimensions than I can clearly classify. My mind cannot readily assign depth to Bok's bottomless sense of his own accomplishment.In reality, this (apparently) seven year project reads as little more than a drunken bet between two pretentious authors carried to a degree that surpasses all reason or sense of proportion. This man has been eating, drinking, and breathing while good people starve and suffocate the world over. And what has he made from all this eating, drinking, and breathing? Carbon dioxide, fecula and other waste products -- including this book.If you've gotten tired of Dr. Seuss, and would like to see something that is less creative and less intelligible, help yourself. Otherwise, share in my repulsion that this was the book for which Bok was awarded the $40 000 Griffith Poetry Prize in 2002."},{"Title":"Eunoia: The CD","review":"I was prompted to buy a copy of Eunoia after hearing Christian Bok reading excerpts on the radio. I devoured the book in one sitting, turning each page with greater anticipation, relishing each example of verbal ingenuity. To me, that's what Eunoia is essentially about - sheer brilliance. This book is the result of a titanic cerebral initiative and it comes off flawlessly.I've lent this book to dozens of people, and to be honest, not everyone has appreciated it in the same way I have. Some people have read the first page and handed it back saying &quot;I don't get it&quot; or &quot;it makes my head hurt&quot;. Clearly, this book is not for everyone.If you have a passion for language you will love this book. If you like word-play, you will love this book. If you appreciate &quot;cleverness&quot; you will love this book. I smiled the whole way through it out of sheer amazement and disbelief. By far the best thing I've read this year, and something that I will continue to revisit over the years to come."},{"Title":"Eunoia: The CD","review":"Christian B&ouml;k's Eunoia is becoming a fast hit among those with actual &quot;colored-letter&quot; synesthesia.Christian B&ouml;k based part of his ideas for Eunoia off the concept of synesthesia, mainly borrowing from Arthur Rimbaud's poem &quot;Voyelles&quot; (the strangely-colored cover design for the book is also based upon the same). In &quot;Voyelles&quot;, Rimbaud creates correspondences between colors and letters of the alphabet (or, more specifically, the written symbols - the graphemes) for vowels.Synesthesia is an actually existing, albeit rare, set of benign neurological conditions. Overwhelmingly, the most common (perhaps as common as existing in 1 out of every 750 people) form of synesthesia involves involuntary, automatic correspondences made between colors and graphemes (letter and number characters). This type of synesthesia is apparently genetically-based (that is, organic, and not psychologically based upon childhood associations), and usually emerges around the age of six or seven years of age. Those with &quot;colored-letter&quot; synesthesia generally maintain it throughout life, with virtually no variations in the color-letter correspondences. They have no choice as to which colors are associated with which letters and are stuck with the links throughout life. Also, each individual synesthete's total set of color-letter correspondences is unique, although there are certain trends to be found world-wide with certain graphemes, such as &quot;A&quot; being red and &quot;O&quot; being white or clear amongst about two-thirds of all such synesthetes.Rimbaud was not a colored-letter synesthete; he admits that he made up the correspondences in his (in-)famous poem.However, now, true colored-letter synesthetes are finding B&ouml;k's book either an overwhelming thrill or nightmare. To those without this form of synesthesia, the pages of B&ouml;k's book - each page using one and only one vowel for all words - glare with the profusion of the particular vowel. For the actual colored-letter synesthete, each particular page tends to totally overwhelm with a particular color. I have received letters from synesthetes writing in rapturous awe of how a certain chapter of Eunoia sweep them with the &quot;icy whiteness of O&quot;, or how it is a nightmare with simply too much red &quot;A&quot; (even though, to Rimbaud, &quot;A&quot; was supposed to be black) distracting from everything else.Sean A. Day, President, American Synesthesia Association"},{"Title":"Eunoia: The CD","review":"As its author weaves his stories out of single vowels, Eunoia is imminently delightful but also rapidly tiring and gimmicky. It is more of a curiosity than a readable work. Its novelty wears thin after a few minutes, and while this oeuvre never strays from being a remarkable undertaking, my practical side also questions whether the effort on its creator's part was worth the finished product. Perhaps the biggest surprise to come from Eunoia was the sheer difficulty in reading through it. I found myself backing up and re-reading sentences for content, something I haven't done as often since elementary school. How nostalgic, huh? Eunoia is a curiosity but little more. I salute Christian Bok for his labor of love (or was it a labor of madness?) but I can't see Eunoia as a work of genius, merely a work composed of....a lot of work.That said, my five-minute poem of tribute to Bok:Alas, all day a lad's art lacks a fan's handclap andEnters the sleep these restless westerners she reveres here need---I find it icky, writings inWorn schoolbooks, known to hold good old story of:Sunup!

It demonstrates that a brainy game with language can be amusing to lots of people."},{"Title":"Eunoia: The CD","review":"Eunoia is an amazing book - it is, to my mind, a book of poems in that the beauty of language is the focus more than the story.The first five chapters are each dedicated to a vowel (in alphabetical order), and each chapter only contains words containing that voewl and no other. What is more, the author has constrained the stories in other ways and used the majority of all words that he could use in the writing.After these five chapters there are other random experiments in language, such as the poem written only with the letters in the word \\"vowels\\".I am very glad I read this book. It was an amazing feat of language that took the author 7 years to write (and the only surprise was that he could complete it at all). On the downside it is not an easy read! The constraints of the book make the language hard going. There were words there I had to look up (and I generally don't have that problem).The mixture of words that in other works would be clearly pretentious with occasional gutter language also felt odd. Particularly in the \\"u\\" chapter, I was both impressed and dissapointed that the writer could describe sexual intercourse using just words with the \\"u\\" vowel - but imaginations will not run far as to which words he used. That rather sullied the beauty of the book in my opinion.Hard going it might be, but this was not a long book and it was very much worth the read. Anyone who loves language cannot help but be impressed by what is achieved here."},{"Title":"Eunoia: The CD","review":"I substituted at a middle school a little while ago, and the teacher had left a lesson that involved reading and discussing a poem (it was \\"The First Book\\", by Rita Dove:Selected Poems) and then writing a \\"found poem\\", based on words that the students found around the room. I knew that I would have to sell it well for the lesson to have any chance. After we established, with only little confusion and resistance, the poem's message, I steered the discussion to the poem's poetic qualities. I tried to emphasize what made the poem a poem, which is hard sometimes when so much that is called \\"poetry\\" is simple fancy prose with irregular line breaks. So we talked about image, figurative language and double meanings, and I suggested, as I suggest with every class on the subject, that poetry is essentially playing with language.(I had had difficulty with a previous definition that had confounded a class of sophomores, that poetry \\"is words doing more that just meaning what they mean.\\" Try as they might some students couldn't repeat that sentence back to me. One was convinced that I had said that poetry \\"doesn't mean anything\\".)When it came time for the assignment to write a \\"found poem\\", I anticipated some resistance. They would certainly ask why they couldn't just write about anything they wanted. So I told them about Christian B&ouml;k, and I reminded them about \\"playing with language\\". Christian B&ouml;k wrote the book Eunoia, in which each of five chapters uses only one vowel, each in turn. The first page goes thus:Awkward grammar appalls a craftsman. A Dada bardas daft as Tzara damns stagnant art and scrawls analpha (a splapdash arc and a backward zag) that marsall stanzas and jams all ballads (what a scandal). Amadcap vandal crafts a small black ankh -- a hand-stamp that can stamp a wax pad and at last plant amark that sparks an ars magna (an abstract art thatcharts a phrasal anagram). A pagan skald chants a darksaga (a Mahabharata), as a papal cabal blackballs allannals and tracts, all dramas and psalms: Kant andKafka, Marx and Marat. A law as harsh as a fatwa bansall paragraphs that lack an A as a standard hallmark.In addition to that constraint, B&ouml;k requires that each chapter must refer to writing, a banquet, a \\"prurient debauch\\", a \\"pastoral tableau\\", and a \\"nautical voyage\\". Each must \\"accent internal rhyme through the use of syntactical parallelism\\", exhaust as much of the available lexicon as possible with minimal repetition, and avoid the letter y. To top it off, the E chapter is a retelling of the Iliad:The Iliad (Penguin Classics).The effect is fascinating. Far from limiting interest, B&ouml;k's syntactic limits heighten our fascination. We wonder how he will pull it off, and what the result will be. Furthermore, B&ouml;k does not ignore the importance of sound. Although he does indeed accent internal rhyme, the fact of the vowels themselves creates a distinct articulatory mood in each chapter. One would never think that somehow the letter u was so linked to the letter s in the English language, but try reading this out loud. The combination creates a phonetic pattern that reminds me somehow of a washing machine:Kultur spurns Ubu - thus Ubu pulls stunts. Ubu shunsSkulptur: Uruk urns (plus busts), Zulu jugs (plustusks). Ubu sculpts junk f&uuml;r Kunst und Gl&uuml;ck. Ububusks. Ubu drums drums, plus Ubu strums cruths(such hubbub, such ruckus): thump, thump; thrum,thrum. Ubu puns puns. Ubu blurts untruth: muchbunkum (plus bull), much humbug (plus bunk) - buttrustful schmucks trust such untruthful stuff; thusUbu (cult guru) must bluff dumbstruck numbskulls(such chumps). Ubu mulcts surplus funds (trustfunds plus slush funds). Ubu usurps much usufruct.Ubu sums up lump sums. Ubu trumps dumb luck.So, back to the middle school class. I asked who liked to do puzzles, and got a few hands. Some mentioned sudoku or crossword puzzles. I told them that what they were about to do was much the same thing, and much the same as Christian B&ouml;k had done: they were going to try to solve a puzzle and write a poem. They were going to play with words.They had five minutes to look around the room and write down any word they saw. I encouraged them to plan ahead, and consider what words might be useful. After that, they were limited to what they had written down (after the time expired, a few students who had been watching their peers run around the classroom and write down words found themselves in a bind because they \\"didn't realize that they were supposed to write down words\\"; this was middle school, after all). Once seated, many found that they couldn't write a \\"poem\\" with the words they had. It turned out that they were defining a poem as \\"something about how you feel, or about love or something.\\" I encouraged them to remember the sole criterion: playing with language. In the end, few students got beyond a sentence. One came up with something quite interesting, because she hadn't bound herself, as most had for some reason, to using each word only once. The repetition and inversion she employed was actually pretty novel and engaging. One small boy was very excited to read his poem to me--a freestyle rap the length of the page. He was disappointed to find out that that wasn't what he was actually supposed to be writing, but hey, at least he was writing.The innovation of new restrictions purely for their own sake, or if you would rather, for the sake of pushing poetic innovation to its limits, intrigues me. Writing in a form often feels much like doing a sudoku puzzle or a crossword, and is satisfying for the same reason, with the added result of--hopefully--a new image, phrase or idea that never would have been arrived at without the self-imposed restriction. I sometimes wonder what extremes could be attempted, like alpinists who having heard of a climber summiting Mt. Everest without oxygen bottles, feels the need to do the same backwards on a pogo stick. What if you wrote a poem using only adjectives? Or a sonnet in which each line could only have a specific number of words? Or a poem in which reduced its available letters by one every line? Or all of the above.John Fuller did something interesting along these lines. In response to a contest to write a poem using only three-letter words, Fuller decided to also write only in lines of three words and stanzas of three lines. Here is the result:\\"The Kiss\\"Who are youYou who mayDie one day?Who saw theFat bee andThe owl flyAnd the sadIvy put outOne sly arm?Not the eyeNor the earCan say Yes:One eye hasIts lid andCan get shy;One ear canRun out andOff the map.One eye canAim too lowAnd not hit;One ear canHug the air,Get too hot.But lip andRed lip areTwo and two,His lip andHer lip mixAnd are wed,Lip and lipCan now say:\\"You may dieBut not yet.Yes you dieBut not yet.\\"The old lie.Critic Jonathan Barker calls it a \\"metric invention in search of a subject\\". Poet James Fenton calls it \\"extremely beautiful\\". I would simply like to insist that a beautiful metric invention is in no way an oxymoron. And what do you know--Fuller's poem is even \\"about love or something\\", as the middle schoolers would have it.Note: John Fullers Collect Works from Chatto and Windus is not available from Amazon.
