I read it, and I couldn't wait to finish it. I would have flipped it in the trash can except I had to read it for school. The characters are pathetic, there is no grasp of dialogue, and the author admits that it is the same thing as an F. Scott Fitzgerald book that was already written. How it became a Newberry winner I will never know."},{"Title":"The Twenty-One Balloons","review":"I had a wonderful time imagining myself with Professor Sherman on the volcanic island of Krakatoa, playing with the fantastic inventions of the people who lived there. I thought the electric chairs, the kids' beds that went right through the ceiling, and the beds that had self-laundering sheets were terrific. But best of all was the balloon merry-go-round that went around a pole and up into the air. There were boats attached to the balloons so the kids could come down into the ocean and sail back to the island. I definitely recommend this book for anyone who loves imagination, science and adventures."},{"Title":"The Twenty-One Balloons","review":"Professor William Waterman Sherman leaves San Franciso and takes off in a journey to fly around the world in a hot-air balloon. But he doesn't know what adventures he will find...He crashes into the Pacific Ocean and is washed ashore the mysterious island of Krakatoa, where people dress like millionaires. They have exotic houses from all over the world and amazing inventions. But best of all there a millions of dollars of diamonds laying in the mines.The professor is told he can't leave the island for the rest of his life for numerous reasons. A man called Mr.F tells Professor Sherman all about the intereseting history of the Krakatoans and all about the diamonds.Basically this book is about the island Krakatoa. William Pene du Bois must have had a very big imagination. The book was very creative and original, at least a lot different from all of the other books I've read. The only reason this doesn't get five stars is because the plot was too rushed and it should have been a bit longer.I reccomend this book to everyone who wants to read a very fun and imaginative book. Luckily he includes some pictures about certain things (some complex)."},{"Title":"The Twenty-One Balloons","review":"Before i bought the book, i wanted it to be an enjoyable book, one that is a hard read, and has a deep meaning.

A couple of decades had passed since the last time I read it, when last year I chanced upon it -- and was startled at the degree to which so many peculiarities of my adult life owe their origin to this Utopian novel that I chanced upon at age 13. Amazed, I asked a friend to read it and tell me whether she noticed anything of me in it. She read the whole book in one sitting, and took extensive notes on what was to her (too) a stunning likeness. We both agreed that I owe so very much to this one volume. (By the way, like the key hero of this book, I went on to become a professor.)"},{"Title":"The Twenty-One Balloons","review":"The 21 Balloons,By William Pene Du BoisA man wants to stay up in the air a year in a balloon, but he crash lands on the island Krakatoa where he meets nice and civilized people. This is a very good book that is very unpredictableWilliam Waterman Sherman wants to stay up in the air a year in a balloon. The wind blows him in to a flock of seagulls and sadly for him one of the seagulls pops his balloon and he comes crash landing down on to the Island Krakatoa. Professor Sherman meets odd civilized people. The main person that helps him is called Mr. F. Mr. F, shows him around the island, where there is a diamond mine. Professor Sherman is astonished by what he sees, diamonds everywhere, in the size of even a human. However, through out the Island there were a few shakings, kind of like an earthquake, but no damage done. The island also has incredible technology considering they have been on the island for over 5 years. Professor Sherman enjoys many good dinners. One day, there was a huge rumbling in the island. The volcano had started to erupt! They narrowly escape.This book is very good. It has many examples of foreshadowing, like when he landed on the island you could tell that something bad was going to happen. The 21 Balloons is also very unpredictable. Something that you think will happen will most likely not, such as the diamond mine in the middle of the island. One of the bad things in this book is that it takes a few chapters until the exciting parts come.I would say that this is one of the best books that I have ever read. Hope you enjoy! =D"},{"Title":"The Twenty-One Balloons","review":"I read this book over 30 years ago, as a teenager- read it over and over, enchanted with the inventiveness and wonder of the book.

The illustrations are some of the best I have ever seen in this genre. The story was so facinating, the exotic setting of Krakatoa and the enormous wealth of all the people, it was like nothing I had ever read up to that point. The main character is so much fun to go along with that the book just flys by, before you know it you are through. When someone asks me to recommend a childrens book I alway place this in my top five, it's that good. We are so lucky to have so many many wonderful childrens books, but this one is special, it is one of the classics."},{"Title":"The Twenty-One Balloons","review":"This book is about Professor William Waterman Sherman, who is part of the Western Explorer's Club. He is a former math teacher who has a love for balloons. He plans a balloon ride across the Pacific Ocean to get away from society. The book starts out when the Professor is found in the Atlantic Ocean. They eventually calculate that it took him 40 days to go across the world, breaking the old record in half. He crosses America to tell the Western Explorer's Club about his findings. He tells the people of San Francisco (where the club is) about his amazing voyage. He started out fine in the balloon trip until a flock of birds popped a hole in his balloon. He stumbles upon the island of Krakatoa. This is a legendary island of unimaginable wealth, eccentric inhabitants, and fantastic balloon inventions. Once he finds the secrets he must stay there forever.The main character, William Waterman Sherman, is a pretty old man with a moustache and a beard. He wants to get away from society in a balloon ride. He wears 18th century clothes, typical of his time. It took place around the turn of the century. The only way I resemble him is that I sometimes want to get away too.I particularly liked the book because it has action and adventure. My favorite part would be him going around the island. He also met everybody. This book is very well written. I would definitely recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"The Twenty-One Balloons","review":"Professor William Waterman Sherman is a burned out teacher who wants to get away from it all. So he builds a giant balloon that can hold him and a years supply of food. Then one day he sets off from San Francisco across the Pacific Ocean. 5 weeks later a ship finds him out in the mid-Atlantic surrounded by wreckage & 20 large balloons. How did he get there? Where did he get the other balloons? The answers to these questions are the subject of this book.Written in 1948, the story takes place at the end of the 19th century when balloonists were on the cutting edge of science, this book captures the wonder and adventure of lighter than air flight at that time. It is illustrated with delightful drawings by the author and won the Newberry Award."},{"Title":"The Twenty-One Balloons","review":"The 21 Balloons is the coolest story ever!!

It was for a class project. I had never heard of the book prior to this. It really turned out to be an enjoyable read. I certainly will give to my daughter to read (she's 8). I think the age range is 9-12, but the vocabulary is pretty generic. I am in education, and my mind was racing at the number of uses that this book could represent."},{"Title":"The Twenty-One Balloons","review":"I thought that The Twenty-One Balloons was a great book! I liked the author's writing style, and how he isn't content to merely label the story as fiction. He said it \\"might very well have happened.\\" Also, I though that the explosions at the end were very cool, and who knew that they actually happened? I had a great time reading this at school in our literature circles. We made a project covered in balloons, with a volcano and \\"basket house.\\" I hope Professor Sherman has a wonderful year in a balloon on his second attempt."},{"Title":"The Twenty-One Balloons","review":"Oh man, was this book fun!This is one of the greatest classics ever told. The story is adventurous and filled with mystery and suspense.Read it!"},{"Title":"The Twenty-One Balloons","review":"My brain is like the bench in my shop. The debris from my present project gets shoved aside to make a bit of workspace...this ratchets everything else left on the bench toward the inactive end, where periodically, things fall off.I am an obsessive reader. Not a roadsign or cereal-box gets by me. The Twenty-One Balloons, fortunately did not evade me 45 years ago, as I busily brain-OCR'd Everything-Dr.-Seuss-ever-put-out.But in time things fall off. During my kids' generation, Amelia Bedelia was the present project...finding Waldo was the urgent job at hand. Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle, and 21 Balloons, fell off.Well, not this time around.

Unlike many books from that time of my childhood, however, this one has remained with me. Perhaps it is in part because of the vividness of the illustrations. Perhaps it is because of the audacity of the story itself, which in some ways might seem more appealing to adults than to children. In any event, I'm glad to see that a new edition is available.The world here is a sort of mixture of Jules Verne and Indiana Jones. The new color cover seems to suggest Henri Rousseau, but the original b/w illustrations are more in the tradition of Dore.By the way, those who have seen the movie \\"UP\\" might know if there's any influence of this book upon that film.

Even though the introduction tells you the outcome of the story, you still have no idea what's going to happen next. To me, this is the true characteristic of what makes a good novel. You want to read it, even though you already know how it's going to end.Some Newbery winners I love and some I can't stand. Take a guess as to my opinion of this particular one. There are some parts that I would consider slow, but the emphasis on the importance of leisure actually heightens the slow-moving experience. All in all, the Twenty-One Balloons is definitly worthty of respect and preservation, and I'm glad I was able to make room in my life to experience the fine literary and artistic craftsmanship of William Pene Du Bois."},{"Title":"The Twenty-One Balloons","review":"I think this book is really good book and i give it a four, it about a man flying on an air ballon and love to stay alone. he fly's off to this island and stay there for a long time. i don't really like the book that much because it left with lots of things to be answer and the book make sense to me. i think become of 13 to 22 would love this book, and if you love adventure this book will be the one for you and does who don't love adventure no to read this book if they do they will burn it.By exodus bakwa"},{"Title":"The Twenty-One Balloons","review":"I'm a graduate student in literature, and I still get my copy of The Twenty-One Balloons off the shelf every so often.

It takes place at San Francisco in September 1883. The main characters are Professor Sherman and the Mayor. The professor goes on a trip with twenty-one balloons and when he leaves something exciting happens. I liked it when Professor Sherman went to see the new house that he was going to buy, a house all controlled by electricity. At that moment Professor Sherman said,\\" It leaves me speechless,\\" but then he starts talking again. There are lots of great illustrations in this book and it was a 1947 Newbery Award Book.

His balloons name is the Globe and instead of a basket to hold him, he has a small house attatched to the balloon. To go higher he throws his trash overboard. To wash his clothes he hooks them onto a fishing line and throws them into the sea. He does the same thing to wash his dishes. Anyway he crashes on a iland he thought to be inhabited after a seagull pierced a hole in his balloon. The seagull was caught inside the balloon and he had to throw everything he had to not fall into the ocean. He managed to land on Kratakoa and that is where his adventure really begins.

He is set down to tell his story. This is how it goes. He Built a small one room house and had huge silk balloons tied on. He set out in his balloon house and was pleased with the quiet. He found different ways of doing things. Soon he crashed on an island. Krakatau. He met a man, Mr. F, who greeted him. There was a big volcano that made the ground shake.

The premise held promise: a turn-of-the-century balloonist lands on Krakatoa and finds a fanciful civilization.

He also left from San Francisco and went over the Pacific Ocean not the Atlantic. This book includes the mystery of Krakotoa, where in this story it is populated. Also, it is loaded with diamonds, and when the Proffesor lands on the island he saw amazing things, like self cleaning sheets, a balloon merry-go-round, and more.

In that book Wellman relates the story of the various villains who were the scourge of the Ohio and Mississippi valleys after the Revolutionary period, especially the psychopathic Harpe brothers.

Many of the new tunes in this collection are catchy and stand up nicely against the old standards. The lyrics (all new) are unfailingly silly and often quite clever, giving even the old familiar songs a new twist. In general, the difficulty level seems perfectly tuned to middle-school capabilities. The songs in the final section (\\"Songs for More than One Person\\"), for example, range in complexity from the simple eight-bar round, \\"M&Ms;,\\" to the more intricate and jazzy 4-part piece, \\"Doo-Be-Dop.\\"Thurston and Stenner supplement each song with a brief comment, sometimes just for fun, sometimes suggesting changes to the lyrics or other ways to make the song more challenging. Beyond the successful blend of tongue-twisting lyrics and memorable melodies, what makes this book so fun and accessible is its thoughtful design: both music and text are easy to read; each song appears twice, once with melody only and again with accompaniment; the lyrics are reproduced at the end of the book for easy photocopying; and the entire collection is spiral bound, so it lies flat -- all smart choices that make for a great, usable songbook for pre- and early-teen kids.,"},{"Title":"SINGuini: Noodling Around with Silly Songs","review":"I have three children, ages 6, 5 and 2.

In trying to solve that, he became involved in a second one and fell in love for the first time in his 56 years.Most of the story centered around his fellow academics and their activities in the close-knit college community during the annual Christmas Illuminations Carnival.

If Shandy's going to survive at Balaclava College and stay peacefully in the neighborhood, he has to solve the mystery of his neighbor's murder without offending anyone else or getting himself killed in the process! Some parts of this light-hearted mystery are hilarious! I laugh out loud every time I read the end of the first chapter. Lots of fun and a good mystery!

I recommend it highly (especially in the third week of December)."},{"Title":"Rest You Merry","review":"If you like eccentric, crazy characters, and good mystery, this is a great book!"},{"Title":"Rest You Merry","review":"I love Rest You Merry and I was thrilled to see a hardcover edition advertised, but this edition is awful. It is actually a paperback, not a hardcover edition. Probably a reprint of a hardcover without resetting the text for a paperback sized book. The font size is tiny, like foot notes and hard to read. While a normal paperback has 32-35 rows of text, this has 44 in the same size book! I hope there will be a new edition with a better layout at some point in the future. This is a gloriously funny book worth re-reading for the pleasure of escaping to Balaclava with its eccentric inhabitants and the reindeer on Peter Shandy's roof! Five points for the book, one point for the edition."},{"Title":"Rest You Merry","review":"One of my favorite things during the Christmas season is to curl up with a good mystery set during the holidays. This year, I was holding on to my copy of \\"Rest You Merry\\" until December rolled around and it was the first book of its type I picked up this month. Originally published in 1978, the entire series has recently been released on the Kindle and I was quite enthused since people I trust had strongly recommended it. Within the first few pages, I knew they hadn't steered me wrong.Peter Shandy is the main character and sleuth in this series. With this first installment, it's Christmas time and the agricultural college where Shandy is a professor has a tradition of going all-out in their celebration. The Grand Illumination involves every house on the Crescent, except for Professor Shandy. Definitely a fly in the soup, his lack of involvement frustrates many of the townsfolk and he is regularly besieged to participate. Finally having enough, he hires a firm to put up some of the tackiest, most outrageous decorations imaginable and then locks his door and leaves town before the lights come on that night. When he later returns, one of the most insistent, pro-event organizers is discovered dead in his home and, with that, the mystery is off and running.A fun romp through academia with off-beat characters, atmospheric setting, a good mystery, and a bit of romance sprinkled throughout. I truly enjoyed this book from beginning to end and will be reading the next one in the series when January rolls around. Not quite a 5-star book in my opinion, but that isn't unusual in the first installment of any series. It usually takes a while for the author to set up the characters and setting --- I can see the potential for the next ones to be that good.Well worth a read and especially good during the holiday season."},{"Title":"Rest You Merry","review":"Coming home to find that your neighbor has died under one of your tacky yuletide decorations -- that's got to be the worst Christmas surprise ever.Unfortunately it's just the beginning of a very unpleasant holiday season for Peter Shandy, with murder popping up all over the place in a pleasant little agricultural college. Charlotte MacLeod adds a touch of gentle, humorous screwball to a solidly-written whodunnit in \\"Rest You Merry,\\" and deftly creates a lovable cast of characters that are just eccentric enough without being weird.After years of being harassed by his best friend's busybody wife Jemima Ames, Peter Shandy decides to take part in the Grand Illumination... by having the biggest, loudest, tackiest Christmas display ever. Unfortunately when he gets home, he finds Jemima dead on his living room floor, apparently having fallen while trying to de-decorate his house. But a few clues -- including a fried marble -- just don't seem to add up.So Peter starts snooping for who would have loathed Jemima enough to kill her -- sure, she was intensely annoying to everyone around him, but not somebody you would actually kill.During this time, a distant relative of the newly widowed Timothy Ames shows up: the ladylike librarian Helen, who assists Peter in his investigation. Unfortunately, the Vikingesque head of the college is not too thrilled about Peter insisting that this is murder.... until another corpse shows up, and this one was definitely murdered.I have to admit, most cozy mysteries don't take place on the campus of an agricultural campus, and most detectives aren't middle-aged professors best known for breeding a superturnip. But that oddness just adds to the charm of \\"Rest You Merry\\" -- Charlotte MacLeod's first Peter Shandy mystery is a pleasantly warm, slightly screwball murder mystery with lots of clues and significant items sprinkled through the story. Marbles, books, knitted masks, sleds and a plastic Santa all take part in the story.Fortunately, MacLeod is extremely good at juggling all the various subplots, and exploring all the twisted personal politics of various campus-dwelling professors. But there's also an undercurrent of deliciously weird humor that never becomes too odd, both in the dialogue (\\"Shandy just told me to go to hell.\\" \\"Can you not go quietly? You'll frighten our guests\\") and the action (Shandy arranging the most horrendous yuletide display EVER, complete with music and purple lights).Peter makes a delightfully laid-back sleuth: he's a comfortable middle-aged man who likes to count things, and refuses to let anyone shove him around (no matter how important, imposing or obnoxious they are). He's also a perfect match for the Helen, and their low-key love story is a sweet diversion from all the death -- they both love counting things, they're intelligent and literate, and they have weird conversations about nailing hides to chapels.And MacLeod sprinkles Balaclava College with plenty of odd, eccentric and rather plausible characters -- lusty amazonian students, local busybodies, deaf professors, elderly ex-socialites, a promiscuous security chief, and especially Thorkjeld Svenson and his wife Sieglinde, an imposing pair who look like a mighty Viking king and a serene Valkyrie.\\"Rest You Merry\\" is the sort of Christmas story you'd expect from Charlotte MacLeod -- not only does it have a perplexing mystery, but a gently sly sense of humor and a wonderfully weird cast."},{"Title":"Rest You Merry","review":"Welcome to Balaclava Agricultural College, the setting of one of the funniest mystery series in existence. REST YOU MERRY is the debut appearance of Professor Peter Shandy and all of his colleagues who will tickle your funny bone until you've collected them all. Then read them twice and return for more.Best medicine for the holiday hassle is an annual dose of Peter when he finally gives in and decorates for the season, complete with \\"All I Want for Christmas is My Two Front Teeth,\\" turns the sound up full blast and takes an ocean voyage. Peter is ship wrecked and returns home to find a body in his living room, irritate neighbors and mayhem.I have no idea how many times I've seen THE NUTCRACKER, or A CHRISTMAS CAROL, but REST YE MERRY will always cleanse the palate.Nash Black, author of TRAVELERS and SINS OF THE FATHERS."},{"Title":"Rest You Merry","review":"There is so much one can recommend about Charlotte MacLeod writings. She was very good at plotting, has zany but not over the top characters, and was a good story teller. The book \\"Rest You Merry\\" had me laughing out loud at times. This is the first book in the Peter Shandy cozy mystery series. Peter is a professor at a agricultural college. The college has a fund raiser at Christmas time called Grand Illumination where decorations are put up and tourists come to see the decorations. Unrelenting pressure has been put on Peter for several years to decorate like everyone else. Peter snaps and hires a company to come in and over decorate his house. The decorations are quite extreme. He then leaves, locks his door and goes on a vacation. It is a scene that will stay with me.Upon early return from vacation, he finds the main event planner dead in his house. The police and the doctor think it is an accident but Peter believes it is murder. There are many suspects and I had to read to the end to find out who the murderer was. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. If you like seasonal cozy mysteries, I think this one excels. This book at this time is out of print and not in Kindle form yet. I was able to get it at the library. If you like cozy mysteries and haven't read any of Charlotte MacLeod books, it is worth finding one to read. I recently read both of the first books in Charlotte's two series and enjoyed them very much."},{"Title":"Rest You Merry","review":"I love Christmas mysteries and this one is one of my absolute favorites. In fact, I often lend it as an introduction to Charlotte MacLeod's books."},{"Title":"Rest You Merry","review":"I read this book many years ago (back when the earth was new) and I got such a kick out of it. I love tongue in cheek mysteries to begin with and no one does it better than Charlotte MacLeod with her Peter Shandy and Sarah and Max Bittersohn, I am so glad they are now available on Kindle. Rest You Merry is one that I often recommend to those who hate Christmas for the revenge tactics Professor Shady takes. As one who loves Christmas but can see how it can be over done I love this part too. This is the first of a series of stories at Balaclava Agricultural College where there is a large Nordic influence and the staff get-togethers include a smorgasbord and several different dishes of herring."},{"Title":"Rest You Merry","review":"A delightful read.

He captures the crazy charm of the place without falling victim to the romantic haze that falls over most first-time visitors. He still loves it - the street food, the elephants, the women, the bars, the temples, the gentle people and sharp operators, the jungles, cities, and beaches and the all-round intensity and color of the place - but also sees many of its failings. Might very well make you consider retiring there."},{"Title":"Thailand Confidential","review":"I bought this book before moving to Thailand and found it to be very informative. I also like Mr. Hopkins style of writing which made this book even more enjoyable. Most of what is written between these pages rings true although some of my own personal experiences differ from Mr.Hopkins. One is the Thais preference when cooking. I find more gas tanks wherever I go wheather it be a street vendor or someones home. I, like the author have a home in Issan and every house I have ever been in (incuding mine) has a gas set up for cooking (as well as coal for grilling). The only other difference of opinion is what Thai beer is the best to drink. I do agree that Thailand does not produce a \\"world class beer\\" and I am not a big fan of Thai beer in general but Chang over Singha? I prefer neither and if planning a trip to Thailand stick with the international staple beers Hieneken or Kloster or a very good Thai beer is \\"Leo\\" which is made by the Singha corp. and unlike Singha which is rather acidic Leo is very smooth and drinkable. Thailand Confidential makes for a very good introduction for anyone planning a trip to Thailand."},{"Title":"Thailand Confidential","review":"I found this work to be much better written than BANGKOK BABYLON as well as very informative.

Reading his book, helped me move into my mindset for a trip to Thailand, without me realizing it. Thailand is a place of contradiction, like the US, like the Buddha, like people's internal struggle. This book, along with several others, helped me to go to that place, in an honest way, and be myself, and respect those that were being themselves. At the same time, it helped me to keep up a background of vigilance, in the sense, that people are always looking out for themselves, no matter where you go, and it's good to know the rules of a culture that you have never visited. It offered me the freedom to be me, an American, to be me, respectful, to be me, curious, and it was one of the books I read before going to Thailand.Sincerley,T (tgsnydermd@yahoo.com)PS: I tore the cover off of the book, because it was a little creepy in an 80s sort of way."},{"Title":"Thailand Confidential","review":"The first thing that grips you in this book is Jerry Hopkins' style. With lots of self-deprecating humour, Hopkins takes us on an educational tour around the land of smiles, bars, beer wars, spirits, amulets, body snatchers, sex change operations, aphrodisiacs, sticky rice and fiery soups.The good thing about this book, is that there is no particular order or sequence with which you should read it. Skip the chapters that bore you. Pick out the chapters that interest you. There is no central theme. Some chapters sound like confessions. Some sound like serious journalism and some even sound like history lessons. Nevertheless, humour and a reader-friendly approach are the main selling points here. Compared toBizarre Thailand : Tales of Crime, Sex and Black Magic, this is a lighter and slightly easier read, so I won't list the chapters.Like many books in this genre, there are also attempts to highlight some mind-boggling aspects of Thai culture, customs and practices. Hopkins did a marvellous job here.

But there's also some gentle humor and some sharp observations and the tone overall is one of steady, cool detachment. No extremes, no heady flights of imagination, no rants, no raves, no prose poetry. Just a steady flow of information in a calm, confident, slightly bemused voice. Sometimes the author crosses the line into pedantry, and lectures his reader. But in much larger measure \\"Thailand Confidential\\" is a thoughtful, gentle, and ultimately charming collection of meditations. It would be a good choice for somebody making their first trip to Thailand and looking for something to read on the plane."},{"Title":"Thailand Confidential","review":"This book was informative. It gives you a basic outline of the place. You can read this book, as well as look for pics and videos of Thailand on the internet. Especially videos on youtube. A pic is worth a 1000 words, and a video is worth 1,000,000 words. You really don't know until you see a video of the place, how it is going to feel, and then you still don't know exactly, but you have a much better idea. One thing that has helped me decide where to go, and where not to go, is a software app called TubeSucker. Do a google on TubeSucker to find it. The turbo version lets you do a \\"Download All\\" for a given search, and then you can quickly scan through 100s of Thailand videos on your hard drive with no delays.

She starts off with an often overlooked component of the abuser/victim cycle -- getting into the mind and thought pattern of the abuser. It is *essential* to thorougly understand this, for it is only then that the competent therapist can truly help the victim. The abusers are masters of introjecting their sick thought patterns into the victim's mind, and any help at recovery must begin with teasing out that subtle &quot;other voice&quot; -- so subtle, the victim might not even recognize that he/she has heard it ever since the abuse.Even therapists who have experience in this area would do well to read this book. It goes into some typical pitfalls in which well-meaning therapists-- unwittingly -- fail their clientele. A particularly good section deals with how to help the client move from victim to survivor and beyond -- to thriving person. It is powerful, direct, readable even from a non-clinical point of view.Some political questions are raised about so-called &quot;false memory&quot; syndrome, statutes of limitations, prison/rehabilitation for perpetrators, and an excellent section regarding apologies from perps--and how they can go wrong.I can't rate this highly enough.

I began reading this book after I read her book entitled, \\"Predators\\". Dr. Anna Salter has a unique understanding of the victims because she has taken the time and energy to interview the predators. She has interviewed rapists, murderers, and child molesters who are in prison. The offenders do not even consider what the victim is feeling. They think only of themselves. The victims think of what the person who did this to them might be feeling. They also tend to blame themselves.Dr. Salter has many years experience treating victims of sexual abuse. She has also attempted to understand the thinking pattern of the predators.One of the most enlightening thoughts included in this book would be that victims spend the rest of their lives trying to feel safe.I would recommend this book to anyone who has experienced sexual abuse and to all of the people who counsel sexual abuse victims.Dr. Salter references many sources for her book.

I am a survivor of mother-daughter incest. My mother was a pillar of her community who won awards for her volunteer work. She was also sadistic abuser who took great pleasure in causing pain.I sought treatment from mental health professionals for my PTSD symptoms for years. Most were not helpful, although some were certainly a sympathetic presence in my life. Many were actually harmful. I worked in human services so I got to see what was going on from both sides of the desk.The professionals I saw treated me in ways that would have been helpful to the victim of a seductive abuser. They totally missed the boat with me and I often ended up trashed by my \\"helpers\\" when they failed to understand what I was trying to tell them about my life. Eventually I found this book, understood the impact of the sadistic abuse I'd endured and was able to at least explain this to my therapist. Finally we were on the right track.I recommend this book to any therapist, survivor or friend/partner of a survivor--actually, with one out of four women in the US having been molested by the age of 18 (cf.

Gordis starts by going on (and on and on) about how if only Jews were different from everyone else they'd assimilate less and survive more - not necessarily a bad point, but one unlikely to change anyone's mind and one which has been made with more verve elsewhere. People who already agree with him are likely to learn nothing new and the people who don't are likely to say to themselves, \\"So what?\\"But in the second half of this book Gordis goes from blandly asserting Jews should be \\"different\\" in some unspecified way, to explaining how modern Jews can use Jewish tradition to analyze specific issues like abortion - and when he does, this book comes to life (though I wish his treatment of social issues was a bit more detailed; for example, his treatment of capital punishment could be a bit more balanced).And I especially liked his discussion of relations between the Diaspora and Israel; Gordis gives a balanced discussion both of traditional commentators who unequivocally assert that Jews belong in and those of who are more skeptical."},{"Title":"Does the world need the Jews?: Rethinking chosenness and American Jewish identity","review":"Not Gordis' very best book, but important and timely just the same.

It tells the triumph and tragedy of Oliver Alden, a youth born into a strict, &quot;Progressive&quot; Unitarian family in late 19th Century Boston. As his life progesses, he struggles to reconcile the harsh idealism in which he was raised with the beautifully chaotic nature of the real world. This conflict gives Santayana the ability to discuss God, love, morality, politics and the permanence of human nature all without ever losing sight of one man's heroic and tragic attempt to find his place in a world not meant for him. The Last Puritan remains the only book that has ever driven me to tears, and the only novel that has ever truly changed my life. If you've ever counted yourself a &quot;lost soul&quot; in the world, this book will hit home like nothing you've ever read."},{"Title":"The last Puritan: A memoir in the form of a novel","review":"Our hero has everything - intelligence, beauty, wealth, education, wisdom, steadfastness, imagination, an athlete's grace and strength - but somehow that is not enough and this is the story of his unfolding consciousness and gradual recognition of fatal spiritual strengths and weaknesses. This sounds very dull, but one is wonderfully swept along from an overprotected childhood in New England, to his father's yacht and to English student life at Oxford. Oliver cannot be called a wit, a social lion or a womanizer; but he admires those who are, and two of his close friends are merry, sophisticated men of the world. A thoughtful, well-endowed young man with time on his hands, he seeks the meaning of life from a certain distance, and we explore this theme with him from many fascinating angles. He does suffer. His father considers him weak and indecisive and his mother thinks him heartless and inconsiderate; he fights to gain his independence from them both and succeeds. He despairs and agonizes over his course of action, scrutinizes his motives for hypocrisy, dishonesty and self-delusion. Aesthetic beauty, ethics, the spiritual life and poetry are centrally recurring themes. Love also is explored. Our poor hero who has everything turns out to be the most awkward, ungainly, pathetic wooer imaginable. But Oliver is worth it all, and you emerge heartened and profoundly enriched by having known him and survived the various turns of his exacting life."},{"Title":"The last Puritan: A memoir in the form of a novel","review":"This is the finest coming of age novel in the known and unknown universe.

The yellowed pages of the edition are a perfect touch for a book written about time gone by.GREAT"},{"Title":"The last Puritan: A memoir in the form of a novel","review":"In The Last Puritan we are given a rare chance to see how a world-renowned philosopher attempts to bring ideas to life in a work of realistic fiction. The milieu of this story is the world of an extremely rich New England family from the late 19th to early 20th century, which might cause it to seem quite removed from the modern-day reality of most of us. The wealth of the protagonist, however, removes the distracting issue of competing for a living and thrusts upon him a fundamental problem which we, too, would be faced with in similar circumstances. That is: Now that my existence is secured, what is the meaning of it? And how do I use it in a worthy manner? To Oliver Alden these questions transcend any doctrinal creeds or religions, in which he has no faith. He is a puritan in the purest sense; he desires to consecrate himself wholly to the highest truth of his inmost spirit. Oliver is a fabulously wealthy holy fool who has inwardly rejected all the worldly pleasures his riches could procure for him. Though held in high regard and even loved by some for his nobility of character, the world seems to view him with mistrust and some degree of condescension. Not believing in Christ, there are several symbolical allusions to Oliver being a Christ figure himself. Santayana relates this story at great length, describing thoroughly Oliver's heritage and formative influences. The world he was born into was very prim and puritanical. The irony is that he, a puritan to the last degree, saw through the hypocrisy of this society. He recognized that it was a guilt-ridden, cramped defense against a wrathful Deity rather than a free and honest expression of the spirit. It is a parallel to Christ and the Pharisees. So, what was Santayana up to in this epic-length novel of an early 20th century incredibly wealthy Christ? When we have sifted through all the philosophical musings and discussions of this highly-refined, erudite book we see that once again the world rejects Christ(Oliver); misunderstands and abuses him; and finally requires his life as a sacrifice. Santayana seems to be saying that though Oliver's life was noble and his fate was tragic, the world doesn't want or need another earnest, humorless Christ. The author created his protagonist in such a way that he was set up to fail in order to give weight to Santayana's philosophical conclusions. Of course, whoever tells the story can set up the parameters to please himself. Even so, Oliver comes across as a very real character with whom you can sympathize, not just a cardboard symbol. Because he is so believable as a truly good and likable person, Santayana's disposition of him as an illustration of a failed way of life may seem somewhat high-handed. Whatever your opinion of that matter, you will find woven into this novel an incredible amount of stimulating presentation of ideas on philosophy, science, religion, aesthetics, poetry and literature. For someone interested in these subjects, The Last Puritan should be a treasure trove. The language is quite elevated and elegant, which may take some getting used to. After some initial difficulty adjusting to its style, I was immersed in the book to the end."},{"Title":"The last Puritan: A memoir in the form of a novel","review":"THE LAST PURITAN is a sort of education of Oliver Alden. The atmosphere of the work is that of a Henry James novel. Initially the chief subject is Nathaniel Alden. Unitarianism has replaced prayers at breakfast with wholesome food. The book is cool and funny. Nathaniel Alden is an awful snob and is supernaturally quiet and unengaged. He has vowed to abstain from carriage travel and so must walk. He lives in Boston in the Back Bay.His younger brother Peter is being sent to camp in the west prior to beginning preparation for Harvard at Exeter. The camp life in Wyoming is to Peter a godsend after living under the dictates of Nathaniel. Genuine cowboys would sometimes ride into the camp. Peter grows up to attend Harvard and to acquire a medical degree. He never practices medicine. His son Oliver is born. His wife is from Great Falls, Connecticut. Oliver manages to escape almost all the ills of childhood. He has a foreign governess, a German woman.While boating with his father, Oliver is given THE LEAVES OF GRASSS to read. Oliver and his father visit an old kinsman, Caleb Wetherbee. During the winter Caleb resides on Mount Vernon Street on Beacon Hill. He is a cripple and has adopted the Catholic religion and has become highly knowledgeable about European matters. He invites Oliver to to participate in his Sunday evening parties when Oliver attends Harvard. Observers find Caleb's deep religious interests to be a clear case of sublimation.Olivers's mother is apt to take no notice of genius or style, she is concerned with social propriety. Oliver, invited by his father to spend a year abroad, makes a decision to stay at his day school in Connecticut and live with his mother for the final year before college. He also decides that Williams College is good enough for him. He fears that universities are filled with snobs. Football more than anything else restores Oliver's conventional tone after spending time with his father and his father's companion Jim.Oliver does spend the summer with his father and learns that his will has been ripped up and that the older man fears he is dying. Oliver promises Jim he will take care of him notwithstanding the fact that some of Jim's conduct shocks him. Oliver learns to punt. He meets his cousin Mario at Eton. Mario's grandmother is Peter Alden's sister. Oliver and Peter are detained at Eton when Peter falls ill. Peter is pleased to see that his son is so wide awake intellectually. Oliver feels a need to justify his natural sympathies theoretically. Peter dies.Two years later Mario and Oliver see each other in Manhattan and in Cambridge. Both of the cousins are attending Harvard. Oliver, spending three years at Williams, suffers a football injury and decides to rededicate himself to his studies in the wider academic setting of Harvard. Oliver never flinches in his determination to pursue higher things. At Harvard through chance Oliver occupies the room occupied previously by Ralph Waldo Emerson.Santayana himself is a character in this tale, a member of the philosophy department at Harvard.

It has a few funny points and was enjoyable to read."},{"Title":"The Completely Useless Star Trek Encyclopedia (Virgin)","review":"Ok, first of all, this is not anything that a true trekkie would like. It is filled with british $hit comedy, and references to horrible shows like dr. who and red dwarf. DO NOT BUY!"},{"Title":"The Completely Useless Star Trek Encyclopedia (Virgin)","review":"If you are a Star Trek fan, you will either love this book, or hate it. This should be obvious from the reviews already posted, which seem to almost invariably give the book either 1 or 5 stars. The reason for this is that the book is hilariously funny, but has a wickedly mean sense of humor. Therefor, if you take your fandom very seriously, DO NOT READ THIS, as it will cause irreparable psychological dammage! If, on the other hand, you are able to laugh at Trek as well as your own geekdom, then by all means DO READ IT! But procede with caution, as you may find yourself incapacitated with laughter."},{"Title":"The Completely Useless Star Trek Encyclopedia (Virgin)","review":"I'll start this review by saying up front that I'm a big fan of the TV show &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; so I was bound to at least look favorably on any sort of parody of Americana such as this one. Which is odd, because the two authors are English and writing for audiences in England (thus the references to such things as TV 21, Doctor Who, personalities of whom us Yankees have never heard, etc.) Even so, I found this to be a notably enjoyable book; a good stocking-stuffer for the sci-fi fan in your life (as long as he's not the sort who thinks all things Roddenbury are holy.) It takes the form of the ubiquitous &quot;Guide to Star Trek&quot; books available today, which are generally little more than glorified episode guides with some fandom tidbits thrown in and still shots from the movie or TV show in question. However, this book is meant to parody of these sorts of publications, and does so with admirable skill (you can tell that the writers did their homework.) Topics covered range from 'Auto-Destruct' (what if someone sneezes while giving the cancel command four seconds before the ship explodes?), through 'The Love Boat' (certain early scenes with overblown romantic tension made some fans complain that 'TNG' was starting to resemble this show. See also 'GET A LIFE'), up to 'Yangs' (enemies of the 'Kohms' in the less-than-subtle allegory that was 'The Omega Glory'). Numerous Star Trek &quot;tales&quot; are brought up, and many are given an entirely new spin (i.e. &quot;beam me up Scotty&quot; as a fanboy creation, so they could have something to be smug at non-fans for attributing to the series.) You will find yourself laughing out loud at many points, or at least snickering. Of course, it's not a perfect book. Many of the parodies are simply the standard &quot;cheap shots&quot; we've all come to know and...recognize (not exactly _love_.) And the humor _does_ wear thin after a while...reading the whole book in one or two sittings is a no-no. In fact, this might make a good &quot;bathroom book&quot;--go in, sit down, pick it up, read a few entries, and leave in a cheerier mood than you entered. All in all, though, a good pick for a Trekkie near you."},{"Title":"The Completely Useless Star Trek Encyclopedia (Virgin)","review":"I read this &quot;encyclopedia&quot; in one rush. Roaring with laughter every now and then. The more episodes and films you have seen, the more you can appreciate the somewhat wicked sense of understated humor in this book. And yes, they have opinions on Trekkies too, buy hey, who could write an &quot;encyclopida&quot; without mentioning Trekkies? Go read this. It's fun."},{"Title":"The Completely Useless Star Trek Encyclopedia (Virgin)","review":"When I first saw this book I thought; 'Oh, no, another boring Star Trek encyclopedia full of uninteresting 'facts'; I'm not giving good money for this useless...' And that's when the title hit me. The book has the format of your average boring Trek trivia compilation, but the entries are treated with well-aimed humor and sometimes biting sarcasm, which makes for a frank laugh if you enjoy good-natured parody. Personally, I almost strangled myself trying to keep from laughing out loud in the aisle of the respectable bookshop I was in; eventually I failed in my attempt to maintain any shred of dignity and collapsed in a fit of mad laughter. But then I'm a shameless Trekkie. You can feel the authors are british, as is their sense of humor (with a Monty Python touch to it); but I don't see that as a problem, being Belgian myself. All in all, resistance (against hilarious parodies) is futile."},{"Title":"The Completely Useless Star Trek Encyclopedia (Virgin)","review":"You need to know the series fairly well to get some of the jokes, and the humor and many references are decidedly British, but I had a lot of fun with this book.Some folk who take Star Trek a mite too seriously take offense to this book, so if you have no stomach for a) irreverence and b) the Brits, you might not enjoy this.Otherwise, I found it a gentle jab at the \\"revered science fiction cash cow\\" we've come to love (until Voyager)."},{"Title":"The Completely Useless Star Trek Encyclopedia (Virgin)","review":"I am a trekkie/er in my own right, and I seriously disagree with anything bad that has been said about this book. This is a fantastic romp through the trek universe with a whole bunch of brits willing to make fun of themselves and others for something they like a whole hell of a lot. The stories of how things were cancelled and naysayed and how people act about star trek in general are spoofed wonderfully here. All of you who didn't find it funny, surely don't have a sense of humor about yourselves and the show and should lighten up. But if you like to laugh, or get a good chuckle from turning a phrase, this is a fun book. enjoy it!"},{"Title":"The Completely Useless Star Trek Encyclopedia (Virgin)","review":"This is the best Star Trek book ever.

This book is by far the lamest Trek-related book ever to hit the shelves. Lots of Voyager-bashing, lame jokes, swearing. British black humor at its worst.

I would have rated it zero stars if possible."},{"Title":"The Completely Useless Star Trek Encyclopedia (Virgin)","review":"The authors of this book seem to hate Star Trek (don't ask me why they know so much about it) and think its fans are idiots.

The main character is a girl by the name of Dale whose grandmother has just died. Right in the middle of her grief, several of her relatives arrive. Rather than caring about her, these rude, obnoxious and unfeeling people have no reason for being there except to get money that was supposedly left to them. At this same time, Dale's beloved leaves to go to war, and this is one of the things that carries her through the trying times ahead. No matter what her family says or does to her, she has the memory of her beloved across the sea, who is waiting patiently to be allowed to return to her. And through it all, her Savior carries her through all of her trials, so that she never returns hurt for hurt, even when her heart seems to be breaking. Maybe, when its all through, her selfish family will actually see something in her that they don't have, and maybe they'll change because of it."},{"Title":"All Through The Night (F3681) (A Bantam Romance)","review":"I have read this book several times, and I enjoy it more every time. The story is about a girl whose grandmother has just died, and in the midst of her grief, unwelcome relatives arrive. As unfeeling, rude, and obnoxious as they act, the girl does not return wrong for wrong. Through it all, she has the memory of her Savior who will bring her through every trial that comes along, and also, that there is a young man somewhere who loves her. Knowing that her beloved is across the ocean, at war, and waiting to return to her, and that her Savior loves and cares for her is just what she needs to carry her through it all.

I guess it is definitely a matter of taste because I loved the Gold Shoe, while some disliked it for the obnoxious relative that came to stay, I found that book delightful and skillfully woven with the Mother's growth as she sought the Lord in it.

The story makes a wonderful impromptu play to do with a group of children, some stuffed animals and a big sheet or blanket. I always share this story with children at Christmas time."},{"Title":"The mitten: An old Ukrainian folktale","review":"Even though I buy them for my daughter, I try not to review items that I owned or remember from my childhood as I feel I am biased towards them simply because of the nostalgic factor. However, I do think I would still love this book even if I had just recently come upon it. For starters it has such vibrant colors with the alternating turquoise background and the bright red and gold Ukrainian clothing. And what child wouldn't love the thought of woodland creatures taking refuge from the snow in his or her lost mitten, although the story is just folklore and the product of a child's imagination...or is it?"},{"Title":"The mitten: An old Ukrainian folktale","review":"What a treasure: the illustrations and the story go hand in hand so wonderfully, quiet and witty and authentic. If you have Slavic roots, the Ukrainian illustrator's work may have extra resonance for you. Yaroslava drew the animals wearing Ukrainian costume, but with subtle touches of real life; this one's boots have creases, see the wrinkles in that one's heavy coat. I always wondered if there was an anti-Soviet subtext to the characters all insisting on sharing one living-space until it bursts at the seams (literally)..."},{"Title":"The mitten: An old Ukrainian folktale","review":"Now, let me say from the start that, having read Jan Brett's version first, I prefer it. And unless your home library is enormous, you probably don't need both books. However, as the comments here show, many people prefer this version, which predates Brett's version by quite a while. If you can get your hands on both, do so - keep one for yourself and donate the other to a local school!This story is a great classic. A boy loses his mitten in the woods, a series of progressively larger animals climb in, culminating in a bear. When one teeny animal tries to be the last to just squeeeeeze in (in this version, a cricket), that proves too much for the old mitten and it bursts all over the place.In contrast to Jan Brett's signature style of very intricate pictures, the artwork in this book is very simple... and like many books of that time period, it alternates between full-color spreads and one-color spreads. (In this case, that one color is turquoise, as you can see on the cover.) I like the detail more, but there's a real charm in the simpler pictures of this edition.Jan Brett has the animals looking and acting like animals. They don't wear clothes, and they don't explicitly talk to each other... and the prey animals move over for the predators only because they're intimidated by the talons, claws, and teeth (this detail is skipped in the board book version of Brett's book). In this edition, the animals speak politely to each other and act generally like humans. Some people prefer the lack of outright intimidation in this book.I'm going to donate this book to my niece's school. They probably do have a copy of Brett's edition, but this would be a good thing for them to compare and contrast - and really, it stands on its own as a lovely book. It's just SO similar to the other, more well-known version (or, I should say, Brett's version is so similar to this one!) that I don't see the point in keeping both editions."},{"Title":"The mitten: An old Ukrainian folktale","review":"This used to be one of my top 5 books as a little girl.

I highly recommend this story to all parents as a read-aloud book!"},{"Title":"The mitten: An old Ukrainian folktale","review":"Recommended by the School Library Journal, and described by The Horn Book as \\"a lovely picture book,\\" The Mitten continues to delight the young and the young at heart worldwide with its story, which is based on an ancient, popular Ukrainian classic folktale, and continues to be handed down generation to generation not only in Ukraine, but also worldwide. Retold by award-winning children's author Alvin Tresselt and co-authored and illustrated by renown Ukrainian art designer/illustrator Yaroslava, aka Yaroslava Surmach-Mills, this edition of The Mitten remains high on everyone's favorite list despite the decades since publication.This much-sought-after 1964 edition with charming illustrations by Ukrainian art designer/illustrator Yaroslava is an artistic adaptation which depicts not only the distinctive Ukrainian colorful costumes and artistic motifs, but tells the story adhering to the style of the Ukrainian version. This edition of The Mitten places the reader in a uniquely Ukrainian environ while retelling the enchanting, enthralling, enjoyable tale to today's toddlers, who are sure to enjoy it as much as toddlers did in days of yore. The large pages are colorful, the artwork in its simplicity of line appeals to both the reader and the youngster listening to the story, and the text is comprised of short words sure to capture the interest and imagination of the young.Recommended for ages 4-8, The Mitten is a picture book which teaches about friendship and sharing. This Ukrainian folktale is so popular, in fact, that not only various versions of the book are sold, but finger puppets, and interactive CD-ROMs are also available.Author Alvin Tresselt was born in New Jersey and was a pioneering children's book author and graphic designer. Creator of the \\"mood\\" picture book, which relied on setting and description rather than on plot and character, many of his books were popular with teachers wishing to teach about the environment. He began writing children's books while he worked in advertising and display graphics from 1946 to 1952. He was awarded the Newbery Medal in 1948 for his book White Snow, Bright Snow, which was illustrated by Roger Duvoisin. Editor of Humpty Dumpty magazine in 1952, he later was Executive Editor at Parent's Magazine Press and Chief Editor of their book imprint. In 1974, he became an instructor and later Dean of Faculty at the Institute of Children's Literature in Redding, Connecticut. His most popular book was The Mitten, this book. He passed away in Vermont in 2000.The illustrator of The Mitten, Yaroslava, aka Yaroslava Surmach-Mills, is very well known in the Ukrainian community for her artistic greeting cards, especially Christmas cards. Her varied work included glass paintings, book illustrations, and stained glass window designs. She was the Art Director/Editor for the children's magazine, \\"Humpty Dumpty.\\" Born in Queens, New York, she died in September, 2008.Award-winning author Alvin Tresselt uses the adaptation by E. (Evgenii) Rachev (an illustrator and published author of The Mitten: An Old Ukrainian Folktale [A Blue Ribbon Book] and over 200 other books) to retell the story of The Mitten. The events scripted in The Mitten open with the narrator of the story retelling the story as told to him by his grandfather. This time, the mitten's owner is a nameless young Ukrainian boy who, at the request of his grandmother who is knitting mittens, goes into the forest on the coldest day of winter to gather firewood. He works diligently all morning loading the sticks of wood into his sled, and as he picks up the last stick, he doesn't notice that he's dropped in a snowdrift one of his mittens with its feathery fur cuff and red wool lining.As soon as the small Ukrainian lad is out of sight, the first animal to discover the warmth of the mitten is a little mouse, followed by a green frog in a colorful Ukrainian outfit, who is told to come in quickly from the cold. An owl is the next occupant, followed by a rabbit in a colorful Ukrainian coat, carrying something wrapped in a colorful scarf. Not long after, a uniquely Ukrainian fox joins them, followed shortly thereafter by a big gray wolf.By then, needless to say, it's very crowded, but at least it's warm. As if it weren't crowded enough, along comes a wild boar, who, albeit dressed in his Ukrainian coat with its hood, is, nonetheless, also cold on this coldest day of winter. And, the big boar squinches himself into the mitten--how do we know that all this is true? Why, because the narrator's grandfather told him so! Thinking that the mitten might surely not have any more room, the occupants are, indeed, dismayed to see a very big and very cold bear appear and attempt to enter their warm mitten. \\"No room! No room!\\" cry the animals in unison. \\"Nonsense!; there's always room for one more,\\" says the bear as he paws his way in. As all of this is going on, along comes a very old little black cricket who, too, decides to squeeze into the mitten. Well, as soon as the cricket puts her first scratchy foot inside, with a rip and a snap, the stitches come apart, the leather cracks, and the soft red lining splits in half, popping all the animals into the snow.At that moment, the young Ukrainian boy notices that one of his warm mittens is missing, and he retraces his steps in search of it. But, alas, all he can find are the ripped-apart pieces and what he thought was a small mouse hurrying away with a bit of red wool on her head. Not worried, he thinks that his grandmother will surely have his new mittens finished by the time he arrives home. And, the narrator's grandfather tells him that he never did learn what really happened to his mitten.Sundry variations of this story prevail with myriad illustrations standing the test of time on the hallowed shelves saturated with literature enjoyed by toddlers worldwide as authors retell the tale of the mitten with harmonious animals and satisfying storylines that vary with each retelling.Not only is this 1964 excellent edition, published by Lothrop, Lee & Shepard as a First Mulberry Edition in 1989, very nicely retold and interestingly illustrated by Yaroslava, but the words, short and to the point, are sure to appeal to the young reader.The front and back jacket art by Yaroslava depicts the characters from the folktale. A special touch throughout is the embroidery on the costumes worn by the animals, which embellish the story with the enchantment inherent in Ukrainian folklore.A very hearty five stars plus for a delightful picture book, which is illustrated artistically and delivers excellently the ethnicity of Ukrainians. The Mitten is sure to be a continued favorite of not only toddlers, but also adults who are young at heart, as well.Addendum: Children may enjoy other books on Ukrainian topics, which I've reviewed--many of them have images taken by me in Ukraine.

The book covers many areas of aquaculture and has an extensive bibliography for more detailed reading on any subject.

This one has it all and then some! First, it is an excellent, user friendly cookbook. No sticky-fingered turning of pages - all recipes are complete on facing pages. And it lies flat to preserve the spine. The photos are beautiful and mouth watering. Then ... the fun part. The writer, Adele Novelli Crady, has created great sidebars and editorials about the food, eating, and enjoyment of life in general. These alone make the book worth reading! A great book - make sure to also buy one for a best friend - like the great food, it is best shared."},{"Title":"Bay Wolf Restaurant Cookbook","review":"I am not an advanced cook, and found most, if not all, of the recipes to be manageable. And the best part is that there are numerous pictures which will help you visualize the dish (important for plating). I compared this with my chez panisse book and found that I consulted the Bay Wolf recipe book again and again. I love Alice Waters and Chez Panisse but her book is just too hard to use (not enough photographs, recipes run over onto the next page, directions not clear or allow for multiple interpretations - very scary for a novice cook). I got the Bay Wolf recipe book from my Mother in Law and I love it! It is a great find and I highly recommend it. All the ingredients can be found at your local supermarket, so even though the end product may look exotic, the recipes are not too difficult. This book is very meat-driven (pork, fish, poultry), so I wouldn't get this for the vegetarian. Over all, though, well done! One of my favorite cookbooks to date."},{"Title":"Bay Wolf Restaurant Cookbook","review":"The book is informative as well as easy reading and, even at age 82, I am interested in trying the recipes because they look and sound so good and emphasize fresh ingredients such as the fruits and vegetables (tomatoes, quince, figs, beets and fava beans) that we grow in our own Bay Area backyard."},{"Title":"Bay Wolf Restaurant Cookbook","review":"The Bay Wolf Restaurant Cookbook reads less like an ordinary cookbook and more like a well-written letter from a dear friend. The reader is, in essence, invited into the charming and interesting world of Michael Wild and The Bay Wolf.

After reading The Bay Wolf Restaurant Cookbook I was inspired to hop the metro nearest my little Parisian apartment, buy a bottle of Californian wine from the local Wine Bar, and make a Duck Cassoulet. . .in the middle of August.Bravo to Michael Wild, Lauren Lyle, G.

The photography is appetite whetting. My favorite part was the short, charming, italicized prose rapture which introduces each recipe. It is astounding that such a lush production can sell for such a small price."},{"Title":"Bay Wolf Restaurant Cookbook","review":"Surprising though it may be for one living in Ireland, I have known of the Bay Wolf Restaurant for many years - though friends in the Berkeley / Oakland Area. I must confess, however, to never having partaken of its cuisine. I acquired the book through said friends who undoubtedly are trying to tempt me, knowing my passion for good food.The book has a flavour all its own, metaphorically speaking. It tells the tale of the restaurant in a very personal manner that paints a picture not only of recipes, but the art and philosophy of cooking as seen through the eyes of those seeking to express it. The flavour is what? Friendly, inviting, tempting, tantalising and definitely Californian with the marketplace at its fingertips. Where else would a colege lecturer seek to express his inner creativity through cooking? Not that it mightn't be done, but such things are expected in California. The inspiration for recipes and foods might have had its grounding in Europe, but it was in California that the creative expression emerged.As history appeals to me, I enjoyed the background of the restaurant and its owners which allowed me to imagine the atmosphere. I also like the seasonal aspect which helps in discovering what is available throughout the year. Much in Ireland is now imported, but the concept of expermentation appeals to me and makes me want to be more creative with Irish produce.Having my own herb garden where I also grow some vegetables, I am slightly envious of the variety available in the marketplaces in California. In Ireland the only place one can consistently get duck is at the local Chinese takeaway. That does not mean to say that ingredients are not available in Ireland - it just takes rather longer to locate a source.To deal with the somewhat complex recipes - or at least the availability of ingredients, I have organised a Bay Wolf dinner party whereby each dinner guest will select a recipe to cook and bring and thereby reduce the burden of searching for ingredients required. As I am doing the duck, I am fortunate to be only a block away from the local takeaway.The photography and graphics were tastefully done (that pun just slipped out) and allowed a smile - almost a sign of satisfaction. The menus were an added touch, though being from Ireland, I noted those with Irish connotations. I puzzled over the one for 18th March 1984 - presumably in honour of St. Patrick's Day - though with James Joyce tones. For some reason I do not associate the two. In Ireland Jocean scholars have chosen 16th June, Bloomsday, to honour their guru. I am sure Michael Wild will understand why.I would like to say &quot;well done&quot; to the group that produced it. My only real complaint is that the format is too large and awkward for comfortable bedtime reading."},{"Title":"Bay Wolf Restaurant Cookbook","review":"This book is so sumptuously photographed that it is inspiring to cook from, to look at, and to read.

I remember that there was mild critical disappointment when these collections first appeared. The problem was not with the quality of the stories-- which were quite good-- but over the fact that most of them were \\"recycled Bradbury\\". That is, they were tales that had been previously published in other collections. Nowadays, this doesn't seem to be an issue of great importance.\\"The Pedestrian\\" is here, one of Bradbury's best. It's the short, tight little gem about the last pedestrian who one night encounters the last police car. The world of this story, with shadowy figures glued to their television sets, is the world of _Fahrenheit 451_ (1953). The story was first published in _The Reporter_, a news weekly that deserved a longer life than it had.\\"Pillar of Fire\\" is a novelette length manic tribute to Edgar Alan Poe and fantastic Romanticism. A hate-filled madman rises from the dead and wreaks havoc on a rational, ordered, emotionless society. Ask yourself with whom you identify.\\"The Man\\" is the one about the spaceship captain searching from planet to planet for the second coming of Christ. James Blish (1964) pointed out a theological flaw in the story. An omnipotent God could arrange for a second coming simultaneously on all planets without requiring His Messiah to travel from one planet to another by rocket. But I think that Bradbury's main point still stands: There will always be people who are looking for a grail over the next horizon.There are two stories from _The Martian Chronicles_ (1950): \\"Dark They Were, and Golden-Eyed,\\" about the Earth colonists who go native; and \\"The Million Year Picnic,\\" about a family's encounter with the \\"new Martians\\" that closes the chronicles.Bradbury has a love-hate relationship with flying machines, and this is demonstrated in two fables: \\"Icarus Montgolfier Wright\\" and \\"The Flying Machine\\". The first was made into an excellent short movie animated by Joseph Mugnaini and narrated by Ross Martin.When I was in high school, a classmate of mine was nicknamed (for reasons that I have long since forgotten) The Fungus. When he entered a room, he would cheerfully say, \\"There's a fungus amungus\\". \\"Come Into My Cellar\\" is a story about fungi. They may be among us even now.Other stories include \\"Crysalis,\\" one of Bradbury's earliest solo stories (his very earliest pieces were colaborations); \\"Time in Thy Flight,\\" a reflection of Bradbury's love of Halloween; \\"The Smile,\\" a nod to Leonardo da Vinci and a savage attack against American anti-intellectualism; and \\"The Trolley,\\" an exercise in nostalgia. Here in Chattanooga, there are still places where we have tracks where the old trolley cars used to run. Every so often, somebody talks about bringing them back. But so far, nothing much has come of it. Too expensive. The economy won't allow it. We'd have to raise taxes. Maybe next year, you betcha.These are stories representing Bradbury at his best. Many of his later tales would have the style and the sentiment as these-- but not quite the same substance or sparkle._Reference_: Blish, James. \\"Cathedrals in Space\\". In _The Issue at Hand_. Chicago: Advent, 1964, 57-58."},{"Title":"S Is for Space","review":"I'll start with mentioning a couple forms of reading I sometimes do NOT like. I sometimes don't like short story collections that are written in a fashion requiring excessive reader \\"work\\" in constructing the environment. You figure out what's going on . . . and it's over and time to start the next story (I know this sounds lazy, but I do often read for relaxation). And, I sometimes do not enjoy science-fiction that is overly technical, or overwhelms me with bizarre foreign names, terms, and political systems. This book is none of the above.This is a wonderful collection of easy reading and imaginative sci-fi short stories. Fit for readers of any age, it is the kind of stuff that makes one hunger for more science fiction (or more Ray Bradbury, anyway).I found myself looking forward to the world to be found in each successive story, and certainly was saddened to reach the end of the short book.There is a sister work, \\"R is for Rocket\\", which is more of the same good stuff.I promise you'll enjoy this."},{"Title":"S Is for Space","review":"I believe that S is for Space is THE best book I have ever read.

This particular copy arrived in very good condition; I would say better than as described, considering the age of this edition. This is a copy from the 1970's, and apparently it inhabited a bookshelf, because the spine wasn't even cracked (as tends to happen with trade paperbacks).

They are so important and brilliant and fundamental that they've acquired the strength and power of fairy tales: something so central to the future development of narrative fiction that they MUST be reckoned with. \\"S is for Space\\" is my favorite of his collections, but they all have stories to make you smack your forehead from feelings of inadequacy."},{"Title":"S Is for Space","review":"\\"S is for Space\\" by Ray Bradbury, 1966This is a nice collection of stories. Like \\"Dandelion Wine,\\" these are not 'science fiction' stories herein, or rather some are, some are not. It is interesting how he seems to use phrases that sound so elegant, but after reading different ones for the third or fourth time in different stories, you get to expect them and are not so interesting, more, \\"ho, hum, here's another.\\"'Chrysalis' - Poor Smith has become a chrysalis. Rockwell has been taking care of him and dimly understands what is happening. Hartley has been around, but is not happy about it. Smith scares him as some sort of unknown, or just something that could take over the world with out much trouble. In the end they are both right and Smith just goes somewhere else.'Pillar of Fire' - This is the oddest story in this book. A fellow come back to life and goes on a killing spree because he can and it just makes him mad that in the future world he has come to, death is not a problem. Seemingly, people in this future world, are not bothered by dieing, nor by others dieing. No one gets upset that Lantry is killing any number of people for no good reason and wholesale at that. In the end he is barely found out, and reasonably, there being not much a society can do to punish a dead man, they just put back to being dead.'Zero Hour' - The invasion is coming. The children are playing at something they do not understand. The parents get the idea too late.'The Man' - Christ has come again to some other world. Captain Hart has landed on a new planet, looking for some business for his profit. He gets confused with who has been here before him, by a few days. He thought it was some competitor or other, but as they land later on dead or hurt, it could not have been them, so who had been there? He aims to find out somehow or other. Some of his crew decide to stay and he goes off. The oddest part is the civilized way he tries to get the information he wants, no torture or beatings, just questions and answers, and wailing that he is not getting anywhere. Than, when his crew abandons his ship, he just says, \\"Okay, bye.\\"'Time in Thy Flight' - A school trip gone bad. The kids travel back in time to 1928 and do not want to leave. Maybe improvement is not really an improvement.'The Pedestrian' - Mr. Leonard Mead likes to go for walks, but he is the only one in this future world who does. He gets picked up by the automated cops for not being normal.'Hail and Farewell' - Willie is an odd boy of twelve or so. He does not age. After staying for a couple, three years, folks start to talk and wonder about him. He moves on to another town, to another pair, or person, for parents who would like to have him as their own. He gives comfort and love to those who have not had their own children. They give him a place to stay.'Invisible Boy' - Old Lady is a witch who can not do any tricks. Charlie is a little boy she would like to keep her company, but he wants to go home. He does get away, and she is sad.'Come Into My Cellar' - An odd fungus is going to take over the world, maybe.'The Million Year Picnic' - A fantasy of living on Mars. A young family takes a trip, actually the last trip made to Mars from Earth, for a picnic. But in the first couple of days there, the Earth becomes unreachable because of some war or cataclysm. They are stuck on Mars for the foreseeable future. This is no surprise to the parents. The children are amenable to staying, though they do wonder about what has happened to Earth. This is an odd story of hope and moving on and the destruction of the world.'The Screaming Woman' - This is a detective story. A little girl hears a woman screaming from under ground. Apparently her father and anyone else around there does not hear the screaming as well, wrong time to be listening or something. She goes around to find out whose wife is missing and finds that out, but still no one is trying to help her get this screaming woman out of the ground. The last thing is the woman sings a song only this little girls dad knows. Finally, he goes to help her dig up the woman and solve the mystery.'The Smile' - In the future, people will be mad about how the past has bought them to such a poor present and they take it out on remnants and artifacts from the past. They destroy what reminds them of a glorious past.'Dark They Were, and Golden-Eyed' - Another Mars settlement story. The settlers explore and live and become Martians. Eventually they 'channel' old Martian knowledge: names of places and things; and grow to look like Martians.'The Trolley' - A nostalgic story of a trolley that was being replaced. The trolley picks up kids on the way to a picnic, to relive the days of old glory when people used the trolley to get to the park for holidays or weekend outings, on last time.'The Flying Machine' - Military fear of new innovations in old China.'Icarus Montgolfier Wright' - It is amazing what some people can get published. This is something that seems to be about flying, but it gets all wrapped up in one person who gives the story it's name."},{"Title":"Oracle8i for Dummies","review":"I was reviewing Oracle texts for a high-school database class, and I had the misfortune to stumble upon this text.

The book is divided into three main areas: food, money, sex, and a shorter section entitle rest.Rabbi Waskow does a lot of heavy lifting in this book, and does not shy away from difficult topics in modern Jewish life. He takes on the enormous complexity of Jewish practice and identity, and carefully explains their problems, suggests solutions, and offers more avenues of study.Along with a few other rabbis, Rabbi Waskow is trying to find new pathways in Jewish experience; new pathways, but also connected to the old. He realizes that a Jewishess separated from its heritage of practice and study would be something else entirely. So he tries to move Judaism in yet another direction in its historical development.Many may not like some of his conclusions or suggestions, but as he repeatedly points out, there is more than one path within Judaism."},{"Title":"Down-To-earth Judaism: Food, Money, Sex, And The Rest Of Life","review":"Waskow's a founder of the Jewish Renewal movement, an antiwar activist who turned his concern for social justice into his faith and his action. Waskow writes with a predictable mix of insight and utopianism. He's not a skilled synthesist of the many strands from three thousand years of the tradition, nor could he be. He simply adds his voice to those preceding him, if with an emphasis upon raising at least as many questions as he answers. This is a compendium of his thoughts more than a blueprint for particular remedies to what Waskow diagnoses as the malaise afflicting many Jews today. Modernity, from Columbus to the Holocaust has faded; we live in a gap between what was for Judaism and what will be, perhaps not shown fully until three centuries or so from now.Meanwhile, Jews must reconstruct what works for them from the previous centuries. The Biblical period he characterizes as body-centered in ritual, gesture, agriculture, herding, and the land of Israel. The Rabbinical period brought a shift forcing the Jews into the diaspora, into money rather than land as their source of livelihood, and into a word-based reliance upon debate, exegesis, and Talmud that expanded upon Torah. Modernity moved Jews into confrontation and incorporation with the wider Christian ethos and capitalist hegemony, into political, social, and economic actions that assimilated many of the tribe, forced others into retreat, and left many caught between giving in and holding out.Where are Jews perched today? At the cusp of a new age, one that Waskow suggests can finally provide women a role that they have been not allowed before, sexual practitioners a variety of commitments and expressions denied them by a Leviticus-centered, primitively male-based system of control over women's bodies, and one that asserts an eco-kosher awareness of the ties between labor, ecology, and what we eat, wear, and consume. He offers level-headed proposals for sanctifying sexual relationships outside of marriage that he labels \\"zug.\\" He's confident when he examines how kosher should be based on much more than the rules governing slaughter; the effects of his model can be seen bearing fruit thirteen years later in the current widening in the Jewish Conservative movement of kosher certification into moral corporate policies and adherence to ethical treatment of workers.Mixing food, money, sex, and the necessity for \\"the rest of life\\" modelled on Shabbat as a mirror of the divine day of recuperation after work, Waskow raises hundreds of possibilities that we may, or may not, consider in integrating these aspects of Judaism. By studying the biblical and rabbinical texts, peppering them with contemporary scholarship and interpretation, Waskow presents what would be a valuable resource for study groups, philanthropists, havurot, and those who wish less formal and more energetic ways to make their Jewish identity matter in the microcosm of their ethnic and religious realms as well as the global macrocosm.However, these goals being set, does Waskow, as Jews consider when translating \\"sin\\" as \\"missing the mark,\\" always hit his target? He does score some bullseyes. His discussion of the interpenetration of the Shekinah feminine with the masculine \\"sky-god\\" presence, his explanation of how Lurianic kabbalah conceives the primordial fall from purity into shadow, and his pithy metaphor show his rapport at his best. Speaking of disenchanted Jews tired of institutions but still partaking of its ceremonies in hope for a rebirth of wonder, he notes how: \\"They are startled to hear that what tastes dry and empty may be freeze-dried food-- delicious, once some living juice, some heat, a pinch of spice are added.\\" (2-3) This revigoration he tries to spark.Yet, I sensed often he may be preaching not only to the converted but the coddled in a cocoon of petit-bourgeoisie liberal comfort in some gentrifying urban district. Speaking of cutting back on our toil so as to open up space for \\"the loving, murmuring, sacred kitchen,\\" he suggests how \\"we may need to explore some wider social changes: shorter workdays, less commuter time, a four-day workweek (what a delight for making Shabbat holy!), less overtime-- one or more of these life-style modifications, with little drop in salary, or a broad rescaling of how much money each household needs to make.\\" (87)Part of me agrees completely, and I understand how so much of what we consume comes from the excuses that it will make our lives of toil easier, even as we work harder and longer to pay for such luxuries away from home and family. He's right. But another part of me wonders how many people practically will be able to make these modifications given parlous financial situations.Waskow and those whom he addresses appear more than once here to be rather removed in their comfort zones from the rest of us. At another representative point, he provides an example that I suspect many will find unrealistic in reordering what we spend our money on vs. the advantages gained for our spirit: \\"Are you considering spending the next six months at a Zen retreat?\\" He brings up thoughtful advice, and this is admittedly one of hundreds of scenarios-- still, I wonder about the alternatives he invents: \\"What will be the comparative advantages for [others] and for you if you play the sax in a nightclub jazz quartet, if you give every cent you have to an AIDS hospice, if you spend every Shabbat in a neighborhood 'shtiebl'?\\" (236-37) I doubt if many \\"down-to-earth\\" folks have choices quite like these to agonize over a decade later. As an aside, many such Yiddish terms aren't explained, and despite the everydayness, such as it is, of much of his spiel, he does appear to be writing this for quite an educated audience of his peers.On the balance, the previous reactions posted to this book have been sharply negative or uncritically positive. Mine's appropriately in the middle. It's all over the scriptural map and cultural record. Much gets raised without closure, but those familiar with how Jewish thinkers and doers wrestle with Torah should be encouraged. I wearied of him dancing in earthquakes and mooning over rainbows, but it may be a generation gap and an understandable indulgence. He certainly highlights many recondite passages, erotic poems, and academic findings you'd never hear at the usual Yom Kippur sermon.Many readers may find their own prejudices against such counterculturally- inspired experimentation with the rabbinic and biblical precedents reconfirmed. And, many others may delight in how Waskow in true yeshiva fashion keeps asking away whatever comes to mind. He's boldly plowing on without waiting for solutions, striving to continue a vigorous and unpredictable conversation that's lasted three thousand years."},{"Title":"Down-To-earth Judaism: Food, Money, Sex, And The Rest Of Life","review":"Rabbi Waskow provides historical insite and warmth to a newer vision of Judaism.

Judaism has changed significantly, he points out, over the ages; Biblical Judaism differed from Rabbinic Judaism, and it's possible that we're approaching a new turn of the spiral, a \\"post-Rabbinic\\" age in which Judaism may grow into new forms. Those forms, whatever they may be, will be shaped by how Jews of today and tomorrow address food (eating, kashrut, and also other kinds of \\"consumption\\"), money (cash, class, tzedakah/righteous giving), sex (the whole matrix of sexual and erotic relationships, between and among the genders), and rest (work, play, and Shabbat) .Waskow's trademark warmth, scholarship, and wry humor are apparent throughout \\"Down-to-Earth Judaism.\\" I recommend this book highly."},{"Title":"Down-To-earth Judaism: Food, Money, Sex, And The Rest Of Life","review":"I'm sorry, but this isn't down-to-Earth Judaism, or any form of Judaism at all.

Moses Maimonides would have had him for lunch.For balance, read David Horowitz's _The Politics of Bad Faith_.

Then check out some Jewish thinkers who aren't trapped in the Woodstock Era."},{"Title":"Down-To-earth Judaism: Food, Money, Sex, And The Rest Of Life","review":"In this book Rabbi Arthur Waskow continues his project of redefining \\"Judaism\\" as leftist politics couched in the language of New Age eco-spirituality.One example will have to suffice to show the depths of his misunderstanding: his treatment of the Jubilee Year, an ancient Israelite practice in which land was returned every fifty years to the family/tribe to which it had been assigned by lot upon entry into the Holy Land.Rabbi Waskow insists that the purpose of the Jubilee was the equalization of wealth. It was no such thing; its purpose, as expressly stated in Torah, was the prevention of grinding poverty among Israelites.Judaism did not then, and does not now, place any _upper_ limit on the accumulation of wealth by honest means. The Jubilee was a specific solution to a specific problem: the extremely limited supply of land in an ancient agrarian society whose national borders had been set, as it was thought, by God. In effect, it limited land transfers to _rental contracts_ for specified periods; prices were calculated accordingly, and (in today's language) no one's property rights were violated. There is no basis for regarding the Jubilee as a \\"redistribution\\" scheme, and none for extending its provisions to goods that are not in similarly limited supply.Rabbi Waskow's other discussions of Judaism and economics are similarly divorced from any responsible understanding of either. Anyone interested in either topic is advised to look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Spitfire a Complete Fighting History","review":"Just as \\"HMS Victory\\" was never decommissioned and has become the longest serving warship in any country's navy!, so there is a fully serviceable RAF Spitfire still operational with the Royal Air Force in the UK.Anyone who has an interest in aircraft cannot fail to admire the Spitfire. There is something about that combination of genius of design coupled with the simplest of names which spells out legend. In this book, author Alfred Price has done the Spitfire justice and no reader could possibly be disappointed with the resultant work.About the same size as a telephone directory - and just about as thick, we are treated to page after page of fact and photograph. Each section adds it's own part to a story which slowly unfolds from the very beginning of this aircraft - an aircraft, incidentally which was originally designed purely to win the Schneider Trophy!, right through World War Two and beyond.With important contributions made by not only those who flew them in wartime, but also from those who were on the receiving end as well, I consider this to be an outstanding record of a single type of aircraft which is probably unmatched anywhere.Five stars are not enough for this excellent work.NM"},{"Title":"Sugar and its wartime controls, 1941-1947","review":"Since its publication, Earl Wilson's \\"Sugar and Its Wartime Controls\\" has represented the pinnacle of serious academic sugar studies. No less an eminence grise than Sir Alfred Whitecomb, the head of Oxford's Sweet Granular Additives Department, has called the book \\"an excellent, unsurpassed study of the day to day regulations of earth's most saccharine resource.\\" Whitecomb ranks Wilson's tome above Eliot K. Herrington's \\"The Life and Times of Sugar,\\" P.P. Knot's \\"Sugar in Eight Hundred and Eighty Six Thousand Words,\\" and Carson Smuthers-Carlson's \\"An Extremely Thorough Digest of the Varieties of Sugar Manufacturers.\\" It is for good reason that the world's most renowned sugar experts turn to \\"Sugar and Its Wartime Controls\\" as the definite authority on all matters sucrose: It is, and will always remain, the best of its kind.The wonderful thing about Wilson's work, however, is its accessibility. For the amateur sugar lover such as myself, the book offers a trove of exciting facts and fancies. Did you know, for instance, that on September 23, 1947, an ounce of sugar cost more than it did on June 2, 1946? One of the great pleasures of reading \\"Sugar and Its Wartime Controls\\" is losing oneself in such exquisite details. If one may judge a book about sugar purely on its propensity for flatly stating statistical data, then Wilson's masterpiece, which is nothing if not many words strung together, wins over the reader with its seemingly endless conveyance of hard, stultifying fact. The reader will find \\"Sugar and Its Wartime Controls\\" accompanying him to picnics, jaunts to the beach, and long waits at the dentist's office. It is a book that one can hardly put down, if only because it comprises four volumes.Read Earl Wilson's \\"Sugar and Its Wartime Controls\\" and see if you don't prefer it to perusing long passages of random numbers or reading aloud a neighbor's grocery list.

Mei Lu Ling has just been promoted to lieutenant, and her current assignment is to work with an insurance investigator on missing ancient Chinese antiques. It doesn't help that her family has been in the Chinese antique business for quite some time, and in the back of her mind she is worried that one of her family members may be involved with the thefts, as well as two murders tied to the missing items. Mei Lu is a no-nonsense cop, and will have to involve her family in this investigation. However, she is not sure she will be able to do a good job, knowing how disappointed her parents are that she did not stay in the antique business. She wishes that they will take her off the case and replace her with someone impartial.When Mei Lu gets to know Cullen Archer, the insurance investigator assigned to this project and who is also a patron in the Houston art world, she finds herself attracted to him. Does she let business and pleasure mix, or will she shut him out in order to solve her case? Mei Lu's other friends in the academy have all met their significant others, but she seems to be married to her job. She refuses to let Cullen distract her, feeling that this is very unprofessional on her part. However, their feelings are mutual, and Mei Lu does her best to keep him at bay, while Cullen does his best to convince her that they need to give each other a chance.As always, Roz Denny Fox does not fail to write a romance with something more. She tends to create characters that are fun to read about and get to know, and this reviewer was especially pleased to find that she included an Asian as her main character. As an Asian American, this reviewer was able to relate to Mei Lu's attitudes and her relationship with her family. The ending may catch most readers by surprise, which is the reason why this romance can be called a \\"romance with something more\\". This is not your standard romantic novel, but that is what the Superromance line is all about. They are romance books that go beyond the category.Readers who enjoy this book should definitely seek out the rest of the series, Women in Blue: THE PARTNER by Kay David, THE CHILDREN'S COP by Sherry Lewis, THE WITNESS by Linda Style, and HER LITTLE SECRET by Anna Adams. The final entry to this series will be published in March and is entitled A MOTHER'S VOW, by K.N.

Cullen's convinced that her family's business has something to do with the thefts, but Mei Lu is positive of her father's integrity but she's not so sure about her brother who heads up the Hong Kong branch of the business.There are a few twists and turns to this story that were a surprise. Keeping her suspicions of her brother from Cullen nearly costs Mei Lu their growing relationship. Trust to Cullen is everything.

She is working undercover when her boss Chief Tanner (see next month's \\"Women in Blue\\" for her tale) reassigns her to work a smuggling case involving stolen Asian artifacts, which worries her because her father and brother sell high end Asian art.Her first assignment is to translate a note from Chinese to English for insurance investigator Cullen Archer, a divorced father raising two fraternal eight year old twins, Belinda and Bobby. Upon first meeting, Cullen and Mei are attracted to one another, but he becomes wary when she tells him who her father is as he is the prime suspect. As they work together, they fall in love, but her family remains in the forefront of their investigation though their alibis seem airtight.The fifth Women in Blue police procedural romance is a terrific insightful look at the Houston based American-Chinese community that along with a strong investigation filled with red herrings and one gigantic final twist will please sub-genre readers. The story line grips the audience as Cullen and Mei fall in love, but he wonders if she is in cahoots with her father and brother as he believes they head the smuggling ring. His twins add chaos while her family and the other Blue Knightettes provide depth to a fine tale although the final spin occurs too abruptly and seemingly out of character for the mastermind.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"What Are People for","review":"Berry is a highly-respected environmental writer who advocates a move back to smaller communities more closely tied to the land.

Was very pleased with the arrival time, just what was promised and the book is in really good condition, just as anticipated."},{"Title":"What Are People for","review":"Berry hits another homerun in this collection. This Jeffersonian throwback offers us a vision of life far removed from the shopping mall mania that is stripping much of our countryside of its natural beauty. Berry, instead, suggests that a return to basics is the best way to ensure our independence, freedom and quality of life. Berry argues, as did T.S. Eliot, that a wrong attitude toward nature suggests a wrong attitude toward God. He introduces us to men whose greatness lies in being themselves -- a black farmer named Nate Shaw, a Kentucky environmentalist named Harry Caudill, and writer Edward Abby. He explores Huck Finn and A River Runs Through It, he suggests that an education that does not prepare us to take care of ourselves cannot be complete and argues that our educational system prepares us mainly to function as cogs in an industrial society. In short, Berry sustains his claim, made in most of his books, that we need to slow down our lives, rebuild human connections, value the land around us for its intrinsic worth, and cultivate our souls by cultivating our garden, if you will. As a previous reviewer points out, Berry does not fit easily into any political movement of today -- that is because there is no Jeffersonian movement to speak of, the democrats having abandoned local empowerment, the conservatives, too many of them, having embraced corporate power. Berry's is a voice that needs to be heard."},{"Title":"What Are People for","review":"Wendell Berry is a farmer, poet, novelist and literary critic. It is as an essayist of enormous acuity, however, that he has become best known. What Are People For? is an important collection of essays (and two 'poem essays') written between 1975 and 1989. The pieces here range from the literary and reflective - meditations on the work of writers such as Edward Abbey and Wallace Stegner, to the empassioned and urgent. 'Why I am not going to buy a computer' is as cogent a rallying call for the neo-luddite movement as could be imagined! Berry is an advocate of the local, the real, the humane, that which is connected to the earth and which knows and loves its place. Essays such as 'Writer and Region', 'The Work of Local Culture' and 'Nature as Measure' display a deep-felt commitment eloquently argued. While Berry writes of the politics of farming, Hemmingway, Twain and Blake are never far away. Berry's aim is to recall his readers to the wasteland corporate, industrialised America is becoming and to offer an alternative vision, one of considerable hope. Too critical to be co-opted into the ranks of the acceptable voices, too contrary and complex to be labelled simply an 'environmentalist', Berry's writing is essential."},{"Title":"What Are People for","review":"I do not agree with everything Berry says in this book, but I must confess that he changed the way I see the world. His lucid dissections of American culture and economical practices, his bottom-up solutions to the problems facing us today, and his unselfish, honest prose convinced me of most of his points. Here is a writer not in it for fame or awards or prestige.

It's full of inspiring quotes, e.g. \\"The more coherent one becomes within oneself as a creature, the more fully one enters into the communion of all creatures.\\" The author is a philosopher, and his unique voice of exhortation is not overly preachy.Mr. Berry touches on many far-ranging topics of quotidian life: the real values of education; the merits of decentralized control; the inherent biases toward, and the effects of, centralized control; the idea that language and writing should involve all senses; the concept that the future is faith based on all that we do now. The author delves into the most fundamental human motivations, and why we should be stewards of the Earth.This book was a joy to read, and in these times of economic crisis it left me inspired that we can adapt and improve, and I feel sustained warm thoughts for the author.

It is an event that swiftly has him arrested by the police, ably represented by the \\"fat, complacent, slug\\" Beghin, and coerced into returning to the R&eacute;serve as a reluctant sleuth to assist in the unmasking of a spy. He has a list of suspects: the four Swiss - Herr Vogel and his wife, and the owners K&ouml;che and his wife; the young carefree Americans Mary and Warren Skelton; the three French: Monsieur Duclos, Mademoiselle Martin and her beau, Roux; the English Major Clandon-Hartley and his wife, Maria; and finally the German, Herr Schimler. A more diverse bunch of holiday-makers you couldn't imagine.Our hero and first person narrator tries hard to think and act on the enforced commands of the police, growing angrier and more desperate by the hour as he only has a few days to solve the case. What he fails to realise is that there is not just one spy he must discover, but everyone has a skeleton in their closet and, as Roux beautifully puts it: \\"All men are liars. Women sometimes speak the truth.\\" As such, the author has Vadassy uncovers many unpalatable truths about everyone in the hotel, realises that no one speaks the truth, wrestles with his own poor attempts at sleuthing, being assaulted, and understanding, finally, he is the pawn in a much larger game. The irony is that he is the most honest of all the guests, and doesn't possess an ability to judge people's characters. A less opportune spy doesn't exist.Come the d&eacute;nouement, the unmasking of a spy, the exhilarating chase through the night to uncover a politically-motivated circle of treason, Ambler keeps his narrative tightly focused. The cast of characters is set early, the story told in the first person, the mind of Vadassy providing us with both action and emotion. The action is straightforward, episodic. Vadassy sets out his theories in his mind, acts on them with both fumbling \\"interrogations\\" of the guests and half-baked attempts to raid people's rooms, then finds they implode. He learns much, but not the truth. It is a final lending hand from the police that make him realise he has been set up to witness, simply, the epitaph for a spy was all about \\"he needed the money.\\"Ambler style is short, punchy. His sentences follow the short bursts of an anxious mind - something vital for us to believe in the agitation of Vadassy. The novel, time and time again, deals with conflict: intellectual, emotional, at times physical. His stages are restricted to the hotel, the beach, the police station; his actors project characters they wish to show the world; their palpable \\"artificiality\\" to the reader is the lure to keep the pages turning. Ambler shows his ability to delve into intellectualism, lengthier \\"soliloquies\\" limited to two or three discourses on philosophy, on the crumbling politics of pre-WWII Europe. As he has Schimler declare: \\"nothing stinks quite so much as dead philosophies\\" - an apparently direct view of the author, something this reader found in stark contrast to that other great spy novelist - Le Carr&eacute;.At the end this is a multi-layered novel. On its surface, we have a sleepy town, a hotel and guests with a mystery to solve. At its core we have a commentary on the nature of people's secrets, their fears, the motivations for the ugliness each can manifest. \\"An Epitaph for a Spy\\" is acclaimed as a classic of its genre. Rightly so. This two hundred page novel is a fitting introduction to an author who understands that neatness of language, plot, and stage can easily grip us as much as the opulence of someone like Marcel Proust."},{"Title":"Epitaph for a Spy","review":"Josef Vadassy is a Hungarian refugee living in France earning a living as a language teacher.While on holiday on the Riviera he innocently takes a roll of film of his holiday into be developed and as a result he is arrested as a Gestapo Agent.What follows is an intriguing tale of espionage with Josef trying to uncover the real spy prior to his world being destroyed.It's very Agatha Christie in that it has a cast of characters all in one place at one time with the spy being one of them.

A mix-up with his camera has him in jail and set for extradition unless he helps the police capture the real spy, who must be one of the guests at his hotel. With this as the set-up, this is very much a mystery of the type set on an English country manor with a houseful of guests. Here, the guests are of varying nationalities, and may not be what they seem. The hero manages to bungle a number of situations, which gets annoying but certainly raises the tension. Some of the plot is rather forced, but it's still good old-fashioned fun."},{"Title":"Epitaph for a Spy","review":"Although Ambler is known for his spy thrillers of the 1930s, he stands the genre on its head in this one-of-a-kind gem that is so enjoyable it's probably illegal. It's definitely his best book.A bumbling young British schoolmaster takes a vacation in a picturesque European inn located near some miltary fortifications. Unknowlingly he photographs said fortif. and the next thing he knows he is being grilled like a trout by the local gendarmes. Athough the start of the new term is looming, he is forced by the police to stay at the inn and \\"make inquiries\\" for them regarding the identity of a clever spy. If he attempts to sneak away, the teacher will be detained and arrested.Although quite put out at first, the teacher begins to enjoy spying on his fellow inn-mates and comes up with some inventive tricks of his own (to the despair of the chief of police). There is real danger and plenty of suspense but more than that, there is a delightful character who reveals his \\"inner spy\\" and takes the reader on a throughly enjoyable romp."},{"Title":"Epitaph for a Spy","review":"I have seen many old movies based on Ambler books but for some reason, despite my interest in espionage fiction, never read him. You'd think given its pre-war vintage that the book might be creaky and dated. It is as fresh and intriguing a read as if it had been written yesterday. The characters are great, the flawd, scared but redoubtable protagonist carries the plot forward powerfully and the assortment of pre-ww2 character stypes, although understandably a little sepia-tinted with time, are terrific.A great read. Ambler proves why he was leader of the pack and why so many writers who came after him strived to learn the tricks of the trade from him,"},{"Title":"Epitaph for a Spy","review":"Imagine scrimping and saving for that special vacation. Someplace you have always wanted to go. You arrive and things are splenid, that is until suddenly you are arrested for being a spy. Thats the case here, and to make matters worse, your told you can't leave the country unless you help in finding the real spy and if you refuse then it's off to jail.Josef Vadassy is the main character in this book. A language teacher who gets arrested in France and is arrested for a crime he hasn't committed.This was a good book with many twists and turns. You find yourself laughing at some of the situations that Vadassy finds himself in and feeling sorry for him at the same time.Though this is an older book,it sort of reminds you of an old movie or radio program.If you are looking for something light hearted then I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Epitaph for a Spy","review":"I consider this book not as one of the best of Amblers's works but still very exciting and good book to read. The plot does not seem very convincing. And unless the French police is that stupid I can not imagine why they think he can be guilty or even helpful."},{"Title":"Epitaph for a Spy","review":"I won't summarize the book again, because others have done so. Let me just say that parts of it were good, but many parts were not, and I found myself skipping whole paragraphs and skimming pages-- Ambler writes in the old style, and reading him now, after reading modern writers, is like watching Egyptian paintings with sidelined figures, after seeing more up to date techniques of perspective and shadowing and direction of light. In short, he tells the story but the impact (on me) was weak, and exposition was, for lack of better word, primary. When you compare Ambler to modern masters like Le Carre, or even modern craftsmen like Elmore Leonard, or even minor modern spy writers like Littell, his flaws of technique sand out. There is no hypnotic description, no broken up or parsed exposition-- characters tell about themselves and their personal history in long arias, as if this were a Sam Sheppard play, and even the simplest devices for impacting the reader-- by showing the impact of actions on various characters on an ongoing basis, is used very parsimoniously.Now, I don't want to knock either Ambler or the book: They are both good, for their time. But reading Ambler today is like reading Elinor Glyn-- it's dated, and the story telling method is too simplistic for today. Unlike, for example, Agatha Christie, a master (mistress?) of technique, who is as good today as she was then.By all means, read Ambler, but then go re-read Le Carre's The Honorable Schoolboy, and see the difference. It's like the difference between good muzak and good music."},{"Title":"Epitaph for a Spy","review":"Long before le Carre's George Smiley and Len Deighton's Harry Palmer there were Eric Ambler's accidental spies. In the late 1930's the loosely defined adventure/spy genre was not much advanced from the earlier works of Erskine Childers (Riddle of the Sands) and John Buchan (Thirty Nine Steps). Ambler set out to write a book that added a small bit of realism to the good guy v. bad guy model. The result was a series of highly entertaining and satisfying books that many believe set the stage for the likes of le Carre, Deighton, and, most recently, Alan Furst. Epitaph for a Spy is an excellent representative sample of Ambler's work.In a footnote written in 1951 Ambler states that he \\"wrote Epitaph for a Spy in 1937 and it was a mild attempt at realism\\". 1937 was certainly a good year for realism in Europe and Ambler does an excellent job setting a realistic mood for a continent on the brink of another major war.The story begins with an itinerant language teacher, Josef Vadassy, returning to Paris from his summer holidays. Vadassy stops off at a little town, St. Gatien, on his return journey. An amateur photographer, Vadassy drops off a roll of film at the local chemists for development. When he goes to pick up the photographs he finds himself under arrest by the French authorities. His film contains photos of a top secret French naval installation. Vadassy has no idea how the photos got there. One of the French agents, recognizing that he did not take the pictures advises Vadassy that he will be free to leave town if he goes back to the hotel and finds out which of the guests is the actual photo-taking spy. Vadassy, a stateless Hungarian traveling on a Yugoslav passport has no choice but to play along.The rest of the book is devoted to Vadassy's efforts to uncover the spy. In rather traditional fashion, Vadassy hotel is peopled by a diverse but limited group of\`suspects'. There is the couple that runs the hotel, an American brother and sister, an English major and his Italian-born wife, a couple enjoying a romantic getaway with someone other than their spouses, a German businessman and a Swiss couple. Vadassy is not a particularly good spy. He has been thrust into a situation for which he is woefully unprepared. In fact he is rather inept. I thought of Vadassy as Hercule Poirot as played by Inspector Clousseau of Pink Panther fame.As the story progresses, Ambler does a very nice job of fleshing out the underlying personalities of his cast of characters. Not every is quite as it seems of course and Vadassy stumbles from one suspect to the next. By the time the book has reached its conclusion the reader has had an opportunity to assess each character enough to make a guess as to who the real spy is. It is to Ambler's credit that the spy is not readily apparent, at least not to this reader.Epitaph for a Spy was an excellent read and I look forward to reading more of Ambler's work.L. Fleisig"},{"Title":"Epitaph for a Spy","review":"To read or not to read the great spy novels of Eric Ambler? That is the question most people ignore because they are not familiar with Mr. Ambler and his particularly talent.Mr. Ambler has always had this problem. As Alfred Hitchcock noted in his introduction to Intrigue (an omnibus volume containing Journey into Fear, A Coffin for Dimitrios, Cause for Alarm and Background to Danger), &quot;Perhaps this was the volume that brought Mr. Ambler to the attention of the public that make best-sellers. They had been singularly inattentive until its appearance -- I suppose only God knows why.&quot; He goes on to say, &quot;They had not even heeded the critics, who had said, from the very first, that Mr. Ambler had given new life and fresh viewpoint to the art of the spy novel -- an art supposedly threadbare and certainly clich&eacute;-infested.&quot;So what's new and different about Eric Ambler writing? His heroes are ordinary people with whom almost any reader can identify, which puts you in the middle of a turmoil of emotions. His bad guys are characteristic of those who did the type of dirty deeds described in the book. His angels on the sidelines are equally realistic to the historical context. The backgrounds, histories and plot lines are finely nuanced into the actual evolution of the areas and events described during that time. In a way, these books are like historical fiction, except they describe deceit and betrayal rather than love and affection. From a distance of over 60 years, we read these books today as a way to step back into the darkest days of the past and relive them vividly. You can almost see and feel a dark hand raised to strike you in the back as you read one of his book's later pages. In a way, these stories are like a more realistic version of what Dashiell Hammett wrote as applied to European espionage.Since Mr. Ambler wrote, the thrillers have gotten much bigger in scope . . . and moved beyond reality. Usually, the future of the human race is at stake. The heroes make Superman look like a wimp in terms of their prowess and knowledge. There's usually a love interest who exceeds your vision of the ideal woman. Fast-paced violence and killing dominate most pages. There are lots of toys to describe and use in imaginative ways. The villains combine the worst faults of the 45 most undesirable people in world history and have gained enormous wealth and power while being totally crazy. The plot twists and turns like cruise missile every few seconds in unexpected directions. If you want a book like that, please do not read Mr. Ambler's work. You won't like it.If you want to taste, touch, smell, see and hear evil from close range and move through fear to defeat it, Mr. Ambler's your man.On to Epitaph for a Spy. During the pre-World War II era, it was common for ordinary citizens to be pressed into espionage activities, whether knowingly or not. These were often wealthy yachtsmen, newspaper reporters and industrialists with connections. Mr. Ambler deliberately makes a joke of that practice by making his &quot;spy&quot; be one of the biggest bunglers you can imagine . . . a predecessor to Inspector Clouseau. In fact, this book is one of the few humorous spy stories. Yet the humor is like that of Shakespeare's clowns . . . to relief the tension from the horrible events happening elsewhere in the story.To me, Epitaph for a Spy is one of Ambler's greatest accomplishments. He convincingly and appealingly combines elements that I have never seen put together in another espionage story.It's just before the start of World War II in the south of France, not far from Toulon where the French Mediterranean fleet was docked. Josef Vadassy, a stateless &quot;Hungarian&quot; who works as a language teacher in Paris, is taking for him a luxurious vacation at the shore for two weeks. His only valuable possession is a wonderful camera that he is using to make artistic photographs of lizards. Usually he does his own developing, but being on vacation he wants to see how the effects of his experiments work out so he takes the film to a local chemist. When he returns to pick up the film, he's unexpectedly arrested!The police commissaire shows him the films and asks, &quot;Was it the lighting, Vadassy, or was it the massing of shadows that so interested you in the new fortifications outside the naval harbor of Toulon?&quot; Shocked by the question, Vadassy looks at the prints. &quot;Lizards, lizards, lizards. Then came a photo from what looked like one end of a concrete gallery . . . I was looking at the long, sleek barrels of siege guns.&quot;The police soon become convinced that he did not take the photographs, but it is a question of national security to find out who did. Surely, it is someone at Vadassy's hotel. He's given the choice of being deported or helping unmask the real spy.From there, the fun begins. Vadassy is supposed to interrogate the guests, create all kinds of excitement . . . and wander down to the public telephone where all can hear to report his progress every morning. Naturally, he's no match for the spy. The complications will keep you enjoyably mystified as you learn all about the secrets that the guests are hiding.More seriously, you realize that the police see Vadassy as an expendable pawn in a mortal battle. Ambler wants you to see the dangers of dehumanizing enemies, friends and foes. You'll come away convinced that such &quot;strategic&quot; thinking makes us less secure in ways that we don't appreciate.After you finish the book, think about parallels to today's world and how we may sometimes compromise our human compassion and spiritual dimensions by first serving &quot;strategic&quot; national interests. I found the issue timely."},{"Title":"Epitaph for a Spy","review":"Many people who have heard of the legendary Eric Ambler think of him as a mystery writer, whereas he is actually a writer of novels of intrique and suspense. The exception is Epitaph for a Spy which, while amply full of intrique and suspense, is also a mystery story -- the only true whodunit that Ambler wrote. However it is a mystery story of great integrity with none of the sleight-of-hand used by lesser authors to turn the least plausible person in the book into the guilty party in the last chapter. If you think of Ambler as a mystery writer, read Epitaph for a Spy and you won't be disappointed. But you will probably want to read Ambler's other intriguing novels as well, even if they are not mysteries per se."},{"Title":"Epitaph for a Spy","review":"Reading Epitaph for a Spy made me realize how much better popular/mass-oriented fiction was in the old days. Unlike most of the bestselling writers today, who merely put out glorified screenplays, Ambler (like Ian Fleming) uses style as well as plot to entertain. Epitaph for a Spy is an excellent book, with the southern French setting and characters very vividly described, though it's more of a mystery/detective story than spy fiction in the usual sense."},{"Title":"Epitaph for a Spy","review":"Eric Ambler has always been a favored author. This drama is still a page-turner. The only fault I found, and which surprised me, is the number of typos in the Kindle-version text. I assume they happened in the coding for Kindle. I could understand it if done by volunteers working on a no-cost public domain work, but this is a $9.99 commercial product."},{"Title":"Epitaph for a Spy","review":"Eric Ambler was one of the great writers of spy novels, in a league with John Le Carre, Ian Fleming, Len Deighton, Graham Greene, and Alan Furst. He began writing in 1936, and this rather tame outing was written in 1937 when Ambler was still searching for his voice and his plots. It is certainly not top drawer Ambler. Until the end it has very little action, little suspense, and the denouement is not particularly clever.As is often the case in this genre, an amateur has to come up with answers. Ambler is a good stylist and writes vivid descriptive passages that remind me of Joseph Conrad. There's an old-fashioned feel to the book in tone and attitude, but it hasn't aged awfully well, and I wouldn't keep it for a future rereadingRecruited against his will by the secret police, the lay spy Josef Vadassy has to find the real spy among a group of hotel guests. Vadassy's camera is the focal point of the story. He has to probe into the hotel people looking for motivations and secrets. He discovers a number of secrets, and we learn about the political undercurrents of Europe before WWII. Because the narrator is a novice, he does a lot of dumb things which make him relate to the ordinary reader untrained in detection or spycraft.The technique is to find an ordinary guy, put him under pressure, in a sense blackmail him into cooperating, place him under time restraints, and set him loose to do the dirty work of uncovering the culprit. Ambler gets his readers on board because he gives the narrator and each suspect a personality. \\"You could never get at the whole man any more than you could see four faces of a cube.\\" A man's mind was \\"unfathomable, unaccountable.\\""},{"Title":"Epitaph for a Spy","review":"Josef Vadassy teaches languages in Paris. He takes a vacation on the French Riviera, and brings his Zeiss Contax camera to take photographs. When his roll is finished he brings it in for development. There is a problem when he comes to pick it up: it has pictures of a restricted naval base at Toulon. The police question him, and discover that another camera had been switched for his. Vadassy is stateless; he was born in a part of Hungary that was turned over to Jugoslavia. While a student at the University of Buda-Pesth his elder brother and father were shot by the Jugoslav police for their involvement in politics. The French police demand his cooperation, or he will be deported back to Jugoslavia. Vadassy must inquire among his fellow guests to find the person who also has a Zeiss Contax.The rest of the book tells of his experiences with the other 12 guests at the small hotel. Vadassy must report his findings to the police each day about the cameras and other events. Vadassy talks to these guests and learns more about them, at least what they tell him. Chapter 13 has the story of Herr Heinberger, more realistic that the story of \\"Victor Laszlo\\" of \\"Casablanca\\". The plan of the police works, and the real spy is traced to his employer. Vadassy will become a French citizen, and discovers some truths about the other guests. They were not what they seemed.This was Eric Ambler's first successful novel. Like his other novels, it shows the struggle of one person against the power of a state, and his survival. The 'Footnote' for the 1951 edition says the Sumerian rulers of Mesopotamia were using undercover operators thousands of years before Moses sent spies into Canaan. Yet spy stories were only published in the early twentieth century. Detective stories were first published in the mid-nineteenth century. I suspect that society was mostly rural or in small town, and did not have the big cities that need detectives, or the imperialism that needed spies."},{"Title":"Epitaph for a Spy","review":"This is the book that first got me into spy stories years ago. It is old fashioned in that the sex is subtle and the violence limited, but its plot, persona, and sense of place are unbeatable. The Sherlock Holmes of spy stories. More lively than Lecarre. Furst is perhaps a rival."},{"Title":"Epitaph for a Spy","review":"Josef Vadassy, an unassuming Hungarian emigre, checks into an equally unassuming resort in the south of France for a quiet break from his job as a language instructor in Paris. Out of the blue, he is called upon by the French authorities to help apprehend a dangerous spy.Written by Eric Ambler in 1937, Epitaph for a Spy is a classic \\"fish out of water\\" story. Though fluent in five languages, Vadassy is otherwise woefully unsuited for his new found role as amateur spycatcher. A bit of a bumbler sometimes given to flights of fantasy, Vadassy is no James Bond to be sure. In fact, he's so unlikely a protagonist, the book takes on a sustained comedic edge that greatly adds to its overall appeal.What's more, Ambler cleverly usurps the well worn British drawing room murder mystery format and ingeniously applies it to the espionage genre. As the narrative unfolds, both Vadassy and the reader get to know an interesting assortment of hotel guests, all of whom are potential suspects and none of whom are exactly what they present themselves to be.Epitaph for a Spy is well crafted, fast paced and very amusing. Well worth reading."},{"Title":"Epitaph for a Spy","review":"A hapless school teacher vacationing among a cosmopolitan gathering of travelers seems an unlikely setting for a spy novel, but the ordinariness of this whodunit story makes it fun. Although a bit slow out the gate, Epitaph for a Spy picks up speed through a series of entertaining foibles, takes a serious turn with a peek into Nazi Germany, and rounds out the adventure with some high flying action among the rooftops. Like other Ambler tales, this one is in many ways improbable. But by casting an ordinary character in an extraordinary series of events, its appeal is inescapable to those looking for a temporary escape."},{"Title":"Groucho Marx, Master Detective","review":"Everyone knows Groucho was the master of the somewhat leering, slightly suggestive non sequitur. As a comic he was a master of stage and screen with his equally masterful brothers. And on his own he mastered radio and television with his You Bet Your Life quiz show. But could you ever imagine him as a master detective?Well, that's the premise of this book. Set in the thirties, the story opens with Groucho getting ready to go solo and star in a new radio show to be called GROUCHO MARX, MASTER DETECTIVE. The show is being written by Frank Denby, a former police reporter turned wannabe scriptwriter. Suddenly, a budding movie starlet commits suicide. Groucho, who admits to sleeping with the woman, is convinced she would never kill herself and he asks Denby to help him investigate the matter.Denby's investigation uncovers the possibility of murder, blackmail, police corruption, organized crime and a sinister Hollywood cover-up. And to top it off, he and Groucho seem to have been added to the hit list.Although the author has a parade of thirties era celebrities (or their names) dropping in on the action, his writing does not really have a convincing feel for the era. And while Groucho's constant quips are often quite funny, he comes across more as a caricature than a real character. The book was alright, but in the end take a bit of Groucho's advice ... don't shoot elephants in your pajamas and if you want to read about celebrity sleuths stick to Kaminsky and Baxt. I was also bothered by the dust jacket illustration which seems to be closely based on the classic and highly superior Hirshfield drawing of Groucho."},{"Title":"Groucho Marx, Master Detective","review":"I'm both a Groucho fan and a mystery reader, so this book just had to be good--right? Wrong. It is filled with a great many Groucho-like wisecracks, but the ambience of Hollywood and the story fell too far short to make this worthwhile reading. The plot and characters were just a wee bit hard to follow, and I ended up not caring much one way or another who dunnit. Readers who like the Marx Brothers and mysteries would be better served by Stuart Kaminsky's &quot;You Bet Your Life.&quot;"},{"Title":"Groucho Marx, Master Detective","review":"Ron Goulart has managed to capture the spirit of Groucho Marx in wit and dialogue.

A must for Marx fans and a good mystery for fans of the genre."},{"Title":"Groucho Marx, Master Detective","review":"A clever idea--a ham actor and consummate comedian as the detective! Ron Goulart's amusing (what would you expect with a Marx brother?) fictional accounting of a zany murder chase is not so farsical as it seems. Actually, the author, wisecracks aside, has a good case here--and this is the beginning of a series,too! A young actress (could Groucho be involved with any other!) is dead; the police are calling it a suicide; but Groucho is uneasy about all this. Somehow, the lines aren't straight and the cues are out of sync! Before the curtain falls, however, our Groucho has brought the house down in this SRO episode. Bravo, Groucho (and Goulart).

I am going back at starting at the very beginning. &quot;Groucho Marx, Master Detective&quot; is not a compelling mystery in which you try to figure out the clues one step ahead of the sleuth, but it is fun to have Groucho alive and kicking. Aided and abetted by the narrator, a former police reporter and current writer for Groucho's fledgling radio show named, surprise, &quot;Groucho Marx, Master Detective,&quot; Groucho is investigating the &quot;suicide&quot; of a young starlet with whom he was once involved. Of course, it was really murder and Groucho feels compelled to find out whodunit.Ron Goulart's novel is a pleasant diversion. If you are a hardcore mystery fan there is really not much here, so it may well be this book is going to tickle the fancy of devoted Marxists such as myself. With this Groucho Marx you get both the blazing and constant sarcastic abuse (one of the running gags is people thinking they recognize Groucho without his mustache) and the &quot;real&quot; Julius Marx (on those rare occasions when he forces himself to drop all of the pretenses). The parade of Hollywood stars in the background seems a bit forced at this point, but it becomes more refined down the road. The main thing is that we get another chance to hear Groucho speak. Ever since I heard about &quot;A Day in Hollywood/A Night in the Ukraine,&quot; a play in which the second act is the Marx Brothers doing Chekov (sort of), I have been open to the idea of reviving Groucho and his siblings in new and creative ways. In that regard, Ron Goulart's books are a pleasant way to spend an afternoon."},{"Title":"Groucho Marx, Master Detective","review":"...how he got into my pajamas I'll never know. This is a short, sweet book, under 300 pages, and the main appeal has to be the idea of Groucho Marx solving a mystery. To add a touch of poignancy, the murder seems to be modeled after the death of Thelma Todd (an actress who died in a similar manner to this novel's victim, not to mention a Groucho co-star). Goulart writes despicable villains and likable heroes. I wouldn't mind reading another of Groucho's case files."},{"Title":"Groucho Marx, Master Detective","review":"Hard to say.....I wanted to like this book, but five pages into it I could tell what was to come. Celebrity detectives are popular nowadays, Teddy Roosevelt, Ben Franklin have strutted thier stuff. But the Groucho book never got off the ground. The plot itself is a fine one--a young actress is murdered, there exist blackmail-worthy photographs of a producer*s wife. Gangsters, crooked cops, kidnapping, all these ingredients would do fine in the late-show world of Film Noir. But the story needs the dry wit of a Bogart, not Groucho*s wise-cracks, and none of it really delivers. It is difficult enough to imagine Groucho *unmasked*, as neither the zany vaudevillian of film, nor the charming wisecraker or TV. The intrusion of four-letter words, of the police chief*s smug anti-Semitsm come off as almost anachronistic, the Hollywood namedropping gets phony. Too many details have Sequelitis written across them. What this reader wanted, what we could have had, is revealed in the beginning of the chapter describing Groucho*s (purposed) radio show, called (naturally) GrouchoMarxMasterDetective. The radio script crackles and zings with fervor, too bad the rest of the book just plays by the numbers."},{"Title":"Groucho Marx, Master Detective","review":"I loved this book and hope to eventually see more Groucho Marx/Master Detective stories. From page one you find yourself swept up in the story and characters and wish the book lasted even longer. Especially fun for fans of Groucho Marx and the Golden Age of Hollywood. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Groucho Marx, Master Detective","review":"When Groucho died in the summer of 1977, we were greatly saddened by the loss of one of the world's greatest comedians. Of course, we can still enjoy all the film, television and radio appearances he left behind, but the possibility of anything new coming across has been pretty slim...Until now, that is.In his latest novel, Ron Goulart takes us back to Hollywood in 1937. Groucho Marx is embarking on his latest venture, a radio program titled, aptly enough, Groucho Marx, Master Detective. In this book we are introduced to Frank Denby, an ex-crime reporter who has been hired to script Groucho's new show. The story begins with Denby trying to make a ten o'clock appointment at an ad agency in Beverly Hills. While driving down Ocean Boulevard, he finds traffic tied up because of some police activity in front of a small cottage. Trying to avoid a collision with a police car, Denby inadvertantly runs down a bicyclist by the name of Jane Danner. Miss Danner is not injured, but the bike is totalled and Denby offers her a ride to work.After a somewhat depressingmeeting with Groucho and some ad agents, sponsors, and radio execs, Denby and his recent traffic victim get together for a quiet dinner. On returning to Denby's digs, the two find Groucho waiting on the steps. Groucho produces a newspaper story announcing the death of up-and-coming actress, Peg McMorrow who, coincidentally, turns out not only to have been an acquaintance of his from the recent past, but also the reason for all the police activity that caused Denby and Danner's &quot;meeting&quot; earlier in the day. The story in the paper calls the death a suicide, but Groucho knows better. And, begging the help of his new sidekick/writer, he decides to embark on a quest to prove that the cause of death was, in fact, murder.Theplot takes us through a number of twists and turns involving irate sponsors, crooked cops, movie moguls, and a fair number of Hollywood's more sinister characters. With all this running around and getting shot at, not to mention the fact that he has a brand new radio show to get on the air, Groucho certainly has his hands full!I came away from this book totally satisfied. While a few factual matters involving Groucho's life are a bit distorted here and there, this is after all a novel, and a most enjoyable one at that. Goulart presents an intriguing mystery in which he has managed to capture Groucho's comic spirit wonderfully. Complete with just the sort of wisecracks and non-sequitur we've all come to know and love from Groucho's lengthy career, this novel caused me to chuckle openly and often; I can easily imagine Groucho delivering the lines Goulart has written for him (the interplay between Denby and Danner is pretty entertaining as well). Groucho Marx, Master Detective is a fun read, and a novel that I think will appeal to Marxists (not to mention mystery fans) everywhere. Personally, I'm looking forward to a sequel!"},{"Title":"Encyclopedia of Exploration","review":"College-level library collections seeking a comprehensive reference to exploration would do well to consider the Encyclopedia Of Exploration: a 2-volume set developed and co-authored by the team of Carl Waldman, Alan Wexler, and Jon Cunningham, devoted to the world history of exploration from biographies of major and lesser-known explorers to histories, chronologies, and national interests. Volume 1, The Explorers, packs in biographical references - almost a thousand entries - with indexes organized chronologically and by relevant occupation, country of nationality, and more. Each explorer receives about six paragraphs of detail ranging from early life to exploration achievement and motivation. Volume 2, Places, Technologies And Cultural Trends, surveys the technical, social, culture and geographic aspects of world exploration, providing A-Z entries emphasizing factors determining mission success or failure, and including maps, charts, discussions of exploration companies and societies, geographical barriers and more.

This book develops the concept in a rational manner through chapters detailing the predator, the prey, the flies to imitate the prey and aggressive presentation techniques based both on biology, and the accumulated wisdom of successful Fly Fishermen. I found the chapter on reading the water especially helpful. Some of the flies are a bit tricky to tie, and the recipes are quite basic--more detail can be found at the Troutsman's website."},{"Title":"Modern Streamers for Trophy Trout: New Techniques, Tactics, and Patterns","review":"Galloup &amp; Linsenman make a good case for big, ugly non-traditional streamers if you want to catch bigger than average fish.

Until we find a trout that can talk and we tie him up to a chair, in a room with a light bulb hanging from the ceiling, and proceed to beat the truth out of him, we will only have to guess that Kelly and Bob are correct about why their flies work, but work they do!It gives a novice angler some real insight in what to do to catch big fish, and it makes the experienced fisherman just want to go fishing. Good job Kelly and Bob!"},{"Title":"Modern Streamers for Trophy Trout: New Techniques, Tactics, and Patterns","review":"For many of us, catching a truly monster trout is rare if not once in a lifetime experience. However with Linsenmann and Galloup's book \\"Modern Streamers for Trophy Trout: New Techniques, Tactics, and Patterns\\" this no longer needs to be the case.This concise and inspiring body of knowledge will arm you with the information you need to target the biggest trout in the river with large streamers. Linsenmann and Galloup make their case by describing the meat eating habits of big trout. These bruisers no longer depend on gorging on insects but have made the transition to consuming larger prey. This just makes good sense. They present ample scientific and on-stream evidence to support their theories. While some of these methods or similar methods have been employed by others in the past and present, this book is the first to package a complete system. In the end what the angler/reader is given is manageable and attainable system for fly fishing for trophy trout.The book is complete with various streamer retrieve techniques, specialized tackle, and fly tying recipes.

L&amp;G explain the techniques of streamer fishing comprehensively, yet succinctly. The up-and-across, dredge, and swing techniques of streamer fishing are each analyzed and explained. The descriptions are clear, actionable, and you'll come away with a pretty clear understanding of what you'll need to do on the water.The discussion of techniques for LANDING a large fish is worth the price of the book, and can be applied to any form of fishing. The brief description of tackle (really a tackle SYSTEM: Rod, Reel, Line, Leader)is also extremely useful.Streamers should be part of every fly fisher's repertoire, even if you don't buy into the authors' contention that it should be the primary method.

The first 4 chapters were very informative as to the history of streamers, large trout behavior and technique. If any part of this book failed me it would have been the chapter on Patterns. More attention could have been spent on technique and tying tips here. A comment that Bob made rubbed me the wrong way when he categorized many fly tyers as &quot;loose handed, casual tyers&quot; when he said that this type of person rarely creates lasting fly patterns. This type of attitude runs rampant enough in the local fly shops without being critical of the majority of tyers out there. After all, it's the &quot;loose handed&quot; tyer that purchase these types of books and make the tying industry what it is."},{"Title":"Modern Streamers for Trophy Trout: New Techniques, Tactics, and Patterns","review":"I've been fishing trout for 30 years in Norwegian waters, (sa well as abroad) and found this book extremely usefull.

Only where larger amonuts of smaller prey are available, you will find them on traditional dry-fly streams.A have several times been surprised by monster-trouts outmanouvering too light equipment, on unexpected places. I rarely see them where I normally fish dry-fly.These guys confirmed several of my own experiences-they know what they are talking about.I love my dry-flies, but if you like it or not, this way of fishing streamer will give you far more success than traditional methods.The book is highly recommended!

What those books supplied were engrossing characters, interesting legal maneuvers and mysteries that kept the reader guessing until the end.Unfortunately, Martini's latest novel, &quot;The Jury,&quot; supplies none of these elements, and as a legal thriller, it is a dud.The victim in this book is a gorgeous African-American woman named Kalista Jordan, who is also a brilliant research scientist. She is brutally murdered after exiting her hot tub. Paul Madriani is hired to defend the accused killer--Jordan's boss, David Crone. Jordan and Crone have worked together on some cutting-edge research involving genetics, and their working relationship was marred by serious disagreements that may have led to murder.&quot;The Jury&quot; has numerous flaws. Martini brings none of his characters to life. Crone and Jordan are little more than cardboard cutouts, and Madriani has very little to do in this novel, other than stand up in court and parry with witnesses. The mystery itself is not compelling in the least. Even the title is problematical, since it implies that the book has something to do with jury deliberations. It doesn't. &quot;The Jury&quot; has very little action and the conclusion is out of left field and unsatisfying. This novel is a real disappointment to those of us who have enjoyed Steve Martini's legal thrillers in the past."},{"Title":"The Jury (Paul Madriani Novels)","review":"Normally a huge fan of Steve Martini's legal thrillers, I found &quot;The Jury&quot; a huge disappointment. Like the other reviewers, I am bewildered by the title because the jury plays little to no role in the story. Martini doesn't even describe the voir dire, he just launches right into the trial. It takes the reader a couple of chapters to catch up with what happened, which is very annoying. Even then, it's still not clear why Paul Madriani would take on such a sullen, uncooperative client like Dr. Crone, who is on trial for the murder of one of his colleagues. Even after it's revealed that Dr. Crone used his genius to try and save a dying child, his character is still unlikeable and weird. The reader doesn't care whether he's the killer or not, and at times it seems like Martini doesn't either. I have never read a book in this series where Madriani was as listless and uninvolved as he appeared in this book. Even Harry Hinds, Madriani's law partner, who is usually wise-cracking and brilliant, is mouthy and blustery here. Although red herrings are strewn throughout the novel, the killer's identity only comes as a mild surprise. After reaching suspense pinnacles in &quot;Undue Influence&quot; and &quot;The Judge&quot;, this book is a real let down.

Kalista had filed a sexual harassment charge against Crone after she stole some of research papers out of his office. The two were then seen arguing publicly with each other before she was found washed up on a beach dead. There was heavy evidence against Dr. Crone, such as items in his garbage that were linked to the murder. On top of all this Dr. Crone refuses to cooperat with his own defense. He refuses to give Madriani, his lawyer, valuable information that could help him to win the case. Dr. Crone will not discuss the research that he was working on. He also will not say what role Kalista had in his research. The only reason Mr. Madriani was defending Dr. Crone was because he was the only doctor that would help his daughters friend, Penny Boyd. She was suffering from a disease called Huntington Chorea. This was a rare hereditary disease attacks the brain and central nervous system. This is a very fatal disease. Dr. Crone was attempting to get Penny into a special drug trial program when he was arrested for the murder.I enjoyed this book very much.

Just your run-of-the mill kind of stuff.To complicate matters just a little more, the dead woman was an african-american, who had accused Dr. Crone of sexual harrassment. It also turns out that twenty-five years ago, her mother was part of a group that accused Dr. Crone of racially motivated genetics testing. Then a second researcher (also Black) turns up dead, a supposed suicide.Of course there is a lot of evidence that points to Madriani's client and it doesn't look good for him. The climax is totally unexpected, but the epilogue is a little to pollyanna for my taste.All in all a good outing."},{"Title":"The Jury (Paul Madriani Novels)","review":"If you've kept up with Martini and his courtroom hero, Paul Madriani, this story will surprise you, based on pace. However, the twist of the tale, described in the last two chapters, makes the book worth a read.Madriani's sidekick, Harry, is well-drawn in the story, and is impatient with the goings-on, much like the reader. Many have commented on Martini's play on words with the title - it is evident that his point here was how little a jury might influence the outcome of a trial, and how much vests on just what the legal representation does outside the courtroom.Very few of the characters catch your eye or your sympathies in the book, least of all Madriani's client, the unsympathetic Crone.Be patient with this book, the ending is worth the read!"},{"Title":"The Jury (Paul Madriani Novels)","review":"This is a great book. Martini, writing in the first person through his attorney narrator, Paul Madriani, is engaging and colloquial. Paul is a likable person, even though he is an attorney, and so is his sidekick, Harry Hinds. In fact, there really are not any despicable people here in this novel, and that is what is so great, for a novel. Most novels have to ride on the back of some villain. Martini has not done that. There are no real villains in this story.The perpetrator is a sick man, but he is not evil. In fact, he is an artist, of a sort, a carpentry artist. That is somewhat unusual, too, because usually artists are intropunitive, like Van Gogh (cutting off his own ear, and all that), not extropunitive and murderous, blaming others for their problems. It makes you think.Anyway, Frank Boyd, the killer in question, is not evil. He is deeply troubled, by the life-threatening illness of his own daughter. Who can't relate to this paternal love?There are no villainous people here. Tannery, the prosecutor, and his boss, Tate, the head D.A., are somewhat misguided in their goals and objectives, and that's where the real conflict comes into Martini's story. Tannery is prosecuting the wrong man, and is doing so for what appear to be partially self-serving reasons, to further his own career.Martini has done a lot with a little here, and he therein shows himself to be above the rest of the crowd of novelists, but about at the same level as some of his attorney-novelist cohorts. Attorneys do seem to make good novelists, now that they have seen fit to pass through that gate, following Grisham, Turow, et al.I highly recommend this book. You'll enjoy it and learn some things at the same time (for instance, what is molecular computing?).Diximus."},{"Title":"The Jury (Paul Madriani Novels)","review":"Easy reading, light weight, inoffensive. I read this book while on a pack trip in the Sierras and did not regret taking it along. However, the suspect Dr. Crone was never credible. The plot twist (there is only one) is not very satisfying or believable. Like others, I still cannot figure out how he came up with the title. I suppose the publisher pulled the name out of a hat looking to make a set with the other Martini books. If you don't expect a lot you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Jury (Paul Madriani Novels)","review":"This audiobook is a great 4 hour mindless bit of candy. Steve doesn't pretend to be a great wordsmith. He only gives us a decent fast-paced legal thriller with a character we like and a mildly spooky and mysterious plot line. It zaps you with a surprise ending. Do you need to listen to every word to get the essence of the audiobook? No. You unabridged purists would do well to adjust your attitude and enjoy the show! You could listen to more stuff by-the-way!!"},{"Title":"The Jury (Paul Madriani Novels)","review":"Mr. Martini owes me .... This book didn't make any sense at all. I have read and enjoyed all of his books until this bomb. The only interesting thing about the book was why he would title it \\"The Jury\\" when he only mentions the jury a couple of times. He must have been bored and needed some money because his heart wasn't into it."},{"Title":"The Jury (Paul Madriani Novels)","review":"I have read many of Martini's books and really like the &quot;can't put it down&quot; style along with them usually being quick reads. I never really got into this book, even though I finished it (and I don't know why I bothered). It was boring!"},{"Title":"The Jury (Paul Madriani Novels)","review":"The Jury is another solid effort from Martini featuring Paul Mandriani. This book should be enjoyable to those who have enjoyed other novels with the Mandriani character. It is, however, on the short side, coming in at less than 300 pages versus the 450 pages indicated in advance of publication. This book was originally supposed to be out in February so one is left to wonder what happened to it in the interim. In general, Martini has again pulled together an intriguing cast of characters and an interesting story line. The story starts with the murder of a young, attractive, aggressive research scientist. Paul Mandriani and his partner Harry find themselves defending a brilliant, yet aloof, research scientist who has been accused of the murder. The sub-plots cover issues such genetic engineering, racial prejudice, and the politics of the research business. As the book progresses, the reader is consistently treated to Mandriani's quick wit, sharp mind, and keen sense of reality in the world. It is not too hard, however, to discover the killer's true identity before reaching the end of the book."},{"Title":"The Jury (Paul Madriani Novels)","review":"I have always loved Martini's Madriani character. I was looking forward to reading The Jury and was very pleased by it. Although I have a bit of a problem with the title (the Jury wasn't a big part of the book) Martini can tell a courtroom story with the best of them. Of course, the fact that my favorite actor Chris Noth portrayed Madriani in a recent TV mini series just increased my love for this character.A must read if you are a fan of the legal thriller."},{"Title":"The Jury (Paul Madriani Novels)","review":"Paul Madriani is back, facing his most challenging case yet.When the body of Kalista Jordan is found mutilated floating in a bay, all fingers point to well respected researcher, Dr. David Crone.Crone, who was working with Kalista on a project involving the mapping of the human genome, claims he is innocent, even after the police have found crucial evidence in his garage, and several co-workers witnessed him and Kalista arguing.Madriani steps up to the plate to defend Dr. Crone, but this will prove to be a difficult task, as information about a sexual harassment suit, filed by Kalista, surfaces.

The master of legal thrillers. This latest Paul Madriani novel is another great succes in the Madriani series. It is a mystery to the end, and also brings in a tear jerking ending that you never will expect. Great Job!"},{"Title":"The Jury (Paul Madriani Novels)","review":"Yes, this is a very good read, and a nice mystery. The characters are interesting and keep our attention, and there isa bit of nice twist at the end.One negative aspect of it, however, is that it is not quitebelieveable that a man on trial for murder would keep so quiet,and be so uncooperative with his attorneys, as this accused is.At least not after a few weeks in a high-security jail, eatingprison food, going to court, manacled, in a cheap, ill-fittingorange jumpsuit, while associating only with thugs and psychotics. So the author stretches our imagination a bit toomuch.However, the victims are interesting and keep the story together, so we do want to go forward, and that makes the storyenjoyable.A nice read, and it is recommended."},{"Title":"The Jury (Paul Madriani Novels)","review":"I am a Martini fan and have enjoyed his previous books, but this one is not up to his usual standards. First of all, the title is very misleading. The jury had no impact on this book at all. Secondly, there were a lot of loose ends and missing details. It's the details that usually make the Martini books most interesting. Were he did put the details, such as with the testimony of the expert witness, it was boring. Although I finished the book, I didn't really enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Jury (Paul Madriani Novels)","review":"A research scientist, in the field of genetics, is put on trial for the gruesome murder of a fellow researcher. Dr. David Crone, an academic type who is clueless about the real world and the realities of his trial, seems to have had the motive and means to have killed his fellow associate, the very bright and attractive Dr. Kalista Jordan. The murder occurred after Dr. Jordan filed a sexual harassment complaint against Dr. Crone; and similar materials used to choke Dr. Jordan were found hidden in Dr. Crone's home. It seems all but certain that Dr. Crone is about to get a new address and a lifetime supply of orange jumpsuits.Enter book series attorney Paul Madriani, and his blunt sidekick Harry Hinds, who do everything, including the courtroom two-step, to get their client freed. Although a conviction seems certain, Madriani is conflicted and confused over the guilt and mental state of his client, Dr. Crone. Madriani actually knew his client before the trial started, during a time when Madriani was trying to get help from Dr. Crone for a little girl who is dying of an insidious genetic disease. Could the good professor really be a proverbial Dr. Jekle and Mr. Hyde?The story pace and depth is not up to the very high book series standard of intricate plot development and complex characters racing at thrilling speeds. And THE JURY, for some inexplicable reason, is actually missing the jury. Descriptions of the jury, their reactions to the testimony, their dynamics among themselves and with the courtroom players, are all under developed to a point of being grossly missing from the courtroom action. We get to know the defendant, the prosecutor and the cantankerous judge, but what happened to the book namesake? Steve Martini and his editors needed more time deliberating this one."},{"Title":"The Jury (Paul Madriani Novels)","review":"Far from the best from Martini. Why it is called &quot;The Jury&quot; is certainly questionable. I have some thoughts, but that might give away the ending which was good and unpredictable. The story of Dr. Crone was slow and tiresome. The trial wasn't particularly interesting either."},{"Title":"The Jury (Paul Madriani Novels)","review":"As a mystery author with my debut novel in its initial release, I work hard to provide unexpected plot twists at the end of my mysteries. Steve Martini certainly provides a brilliant final twist to his plot in THE JURY. THE JURY is Mr. Martini's latest legal thriller featuring Paul Mandriani. The San Francisco attorney has relocated to the other spectacular California waterfront metropolis--San Diego (America's Finest City, by its own admission). Mandriani is tasked with defending Dr. David Crone, a medical researcher involved in cutting edge human genome mapping. Kalista Jordan, a fellow researcher, is murdered. She was a professional rival, and Crone becomes the prime suspect. A suicide and confession changes things unexpectedly, and then comes the ultimate O'Henry twist. THE JURY is a terrific book."},{"Title":"The Jury (Paul Madriani Novels)","review":"I was excited to discover another \\"Madriani\\" book was coming out from Steve Martini. But when I got the book, I was a little surprised to see it was only about 290 pages long. After the murder occurs at the beginning, the book jumps right into the trial. The trial was slightly interesting, but overall I really didn't find any new characters that I liked or that held my interest. The resolution was uninspired, and near the ending, the book got downright silly.I expected better from Steve Martini."},{"Title":"The Jury (Paul Madriani Novels)","review":"Well written as uasual for Martini. Characters are believable and genuine. Madriani's partner is a hoot . Good plot and sub plot as well. Thoroughly entertaining."},{"Title":"The Jury (Paul Madriani Novels)","review":"Other reviewers have pointed out that the title has only a tenuous connection to the plot. Or maybe the connection is so subtle that ordinary minds cannot grasp it. Problems with the characters and their development and the stilted writing have also been pointed out.My biggest beef with the book was that even with an utterly improbable ending, it left so many gaps unfilled. For example, why are Madriani and his partner followed by a key witness, why is that witness is referred to as a day-trading addict, how exactly were the two murders committed, etc. If a thriller cannot even fulfill the basic job of tying obvious loose ends together, it's not worthy of the time that was spent on it. Terrible editing, and lousy storytelling.The first Madriani novel that I read was \\"The Attorney.\\" I thought that was a decent read, but both the narrative style and especially the ending left me with a sense that Martini is trying too hard to be Scott Turow (esp. the \\"Presumed Innocent\\"-style ending) but does not quite pull it off successfully. This books fails even more miserably."},{"Title":"The Jury (Paul Madriani Novels)","review":"The oddly titled The Jury (it's not about the jury at all - they are barely mentioned) is a sharp, tight legal thriller that hums right along until the neat little twist at the end.Paul Madriani and his law partner Harry Hinds have are defending a murder suspect, a genetic researcher named David Crone. The book joins the trial already in progress. Madriani and Hinds have one big problem, though. The unflappable Crone keeps so many secrets - trade secrets, research secrets and vital information that he just didn't think was important enough to mention to his attorneys that they don't really know where they stand in any of this.Throw in a family friend with a genetic disorder that may be cured by Crone's research, you get a solid mixture of urgency, ambiguity and frustration that kept me glued until the end."},{"Title":"The Jury (Paul Madriani Novels)","review":"This installment in the series just seems to lack any vigor. Read COMPELLING EVIDENCE first to see how good the author and his character can be. This book seems to have been written just to keep the series alive. The title seems to have been just slapped on because the jury in this case hardly has a role in it. And while the climax is a surprise, the characterization just isn't strong enough to leave the reader really caring. Not a bad book, just not a very good one."},{"Title":"The Jury (Paul Madriani Novels)","review":"I like Steve Martini's books, but I don't love them. He's a very capable writer, but his books are a bit too old-fashioned for my taste. His Paul Madriani novels are essentially updated versions of the old Perry Mason mysteries. The characterization pretty much takes a back seat to the plot, and Martini devotes a great deal of space to courtroom strategy and manuevering.THE JURY is pretty typical of Martini's work. The plot is interesting enough, but the characters aren't particularly vivid or compelling. I enjoyed this novel enough to finish it, and also because I wanted to know who the killer was. This novel is relatively slow-paced, but it picks up dramatically toward the end.If you like courtroom thrillers, THE JURY is a good choice, because Martini clearly knows his subject matter (he's a former criminal defense attorney). But if you're looking for a great crime novel, you should look elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Jury (Paul Madriani Novels)","review":"If you're looking for a good fix on a cross-country airplane flight this book will just barely tide you over. The Courtroom dialog is exciting and well-written. The rest of the book, however, is difficult to believe and the final plot twist is too silly to take seriously.From a technology perspective, Martini does get into an interesting area of science, but he never develops it.It's not that this is a bad read, it's just that it's not a great read."},{"Title":"The Jury (Paul Madriani Novels)","review":"Clearly not Steve Martini's finest hour. Midling suspense, cardboard characters, and some banal diologue might indicate attorney Madriani is in need of a breather. While I thoroughly enjoyed the other entries in the series, I really had to hang in to finish this one and barely cared &quot;who dunnit&quot; when the denoument arrived. I'm still puzzled by the title."},{"Title":"The Jury (Paul Madriani Novels)","review":"I liked this book - I like all of his books - but like other reviewers, please Mr. Martini and editor, tell me where in the world you got the title for this book? There is a jury, I think, but they are not major players in this novel... not even minor players.... It's pretty comical, actually - that the title has nothing to do with the novel. Anyone have any ideas about this?"},{"Title":"The Jury (Paul Madriani Novels)","review":"I hesitated prior to buying this book because of the relatively poor reviews I read. But, being a true Steve Martini fan I went ahead and bought the book anyway. I'm quite glad I did.While this is not his best work, it is a great mystery that is very well written. It contains the cynacism and biting humor found in his earlier work and continues his practice of poking fun at the legal community.Overall, well worth reading."},{"Title":"The Jury (Paul Madriani Novels)","review":"I was drawn to the promise of a legal thriller by the title and reviews of this book. Although the book was not about the jury, the legal manueverings of the attorneys during the murder trial of Dr. David Crone, a respected medical researcher, proved to be the basis for the story. I was interested to see why Martini would write about a controvserial issue such as genetic racial profiling. It seems evident as described in Crone's basis for his research into racial graying. &quot;The petri dish growing the culture for modern American society is not the schools, or the corporations or even the family. It's the prisons...The tribes that are growing there aren't going to stay there. We can't lock them up fast enough or hold them long enough to isolate the problems and to fix them.&quot; And all clothed in the guise of the legal thriller! Quite clever and thought-provoking!"},{"Title":"The Jury (Paul Madriani Novels)","review":"Overall, I have liked the Paul Madriani books for the most part, but this one becomes more depressing with every page. This is one that I personally could have done without.As the novel opens, Madriani is attempting to defend Dr. David Crone, a highly respected genetic researcher from murder charges. He is charged with killing coworker Kalista Jordan, a twenty six year old research physician and colleague, who worked under him at the lab funded by the local university. Kalista was skilled at office politics and played hard. She had filed a sexual harassment claim against him after stealing some of his research papers. He wanted them back and she wanted more funding for her portion of the project. After being seen publicly arguing with her, her dismembered body washes up out of the ocean. Not only does he seem to have motive for killing her, Forensics links items in his garage to the killing.With such evidence against him, Dr. Crone won't cooperate with his own defense. Many avenues of investigation remain closed, as Dr. Crone won't discuss the highly technical research he was working on or what Kalista's role in the research was. All he knows is that it was something at the forefront of genetics research and implications could be staggering. Madriani becomes increasingly frustrated as the case goes against him and the Doctor remains oblivious to the situation.The only reason he is defending the Doctor is that the Doctor was the only person helping the ill friend of his daughter. Penny Boyd has Huntington Chorea, a rare hereditary disease that attacks the brain and central nervous system. Over time, it destroys brain tissue, causes the loss of the ability to control the muscles and finally, death. While it rarely attacks children, Penny has it and is wasting away before her family and Madriani's eyes. Madriani tried everyone and everything to help her and the only one that helped in anyway, was Dr. Crone. As part of his research, Dr. Crone was trying to get Penny into a drug trial program when he was arrested for murder. Now on leave from the university, and removed from heading the program, his life is at stake as well as Penny's.I admit that my review maybe somewhat biased against this book. After dealing with a lifetime of my own children's medical problems, I don't really want to read something about terminally ill children. While this book is well written and the characters are interesting, I found the illness of a child terribly upsetting. While there are no easy answers in life, one of the reasons I read is to escape reality, and to the last depressing page, there was no escape. Considering the ultimate subject matter, this is not a book I would recommend lightly to any parent."},{"Title":"The Jury (Paul Madriani Novels)","review":"Someone explain to me why it is called The Jury. I looked at the cover and wondered if my book's insides had been exchanged leaving the title? I can't see a connection. This book is a too-drawn-out legal story that really drags in the last fourth."},{"Title":"The Jury (Paul Madriani Novels)","review":"Shame on you. Fool me about 100 times shame on me. Guess I should have seen the 3 and half star reviews before me. A 3.5 on a best seller like Martini usually means no better than 2 which is right on. I buy these can't miss bestsellers, then read the dreck, figure out the ending after 50 pages or so and wait for the next one to buy. I'm an idiot. Long live Richard Russo and John Irving."},{"Title":"The Jury (Paul Madriani Novels)","review":"Paul Madriani is back with a trial lawyer's worst nightmare: a murder defendant he believes to be innocent who refuses to cooperate in his own defense. Dr. David Crane, accused of strangling his bright, black and beautiful assistant, Dr. Kalista Jordan, hides behind his top-secret genetic research when asked to explain his well known differences with the deceased. As always, Mr. Martini does the best job in the business of showing us the legal strategy of a contentious trial without talking down and gives us examples of cross-examination that should be studied in a law schol. The dialogue is perhaps his best, the mystery is up to his usual standards - although I've come to care for his daughter Jennifer and would have liked to see more of her as she continues to grow up without a mother - there is a possibility of racism to complicate things and the surprise ending is indeed a brilliantly conceived (and fairly hinted at) surprise.Perhaps it is a bit longer than necessary despite it's twists and needed technical explanations, but it's so good I missed half a night's sleep to finish it."},{"Title":"The Jury (Paul Madriani Novels)","review":"My father-in-law recommended this book for summer reading while I take a break from law school. At first I was skeptical because I didn't know how &quot;legally&quot; accurate it would be but it was a fantastic book all-around! The plot was excellent and it wasn't a typical long, drawn out courtroom account of a trial. As a matter of fact, I'm not really sure why the title of the book is &quot;The Jury.&quot; It is much more exciting than the title sounds! I would definitely recommend it to anyone!"},{"Title":"The Jury (Paul Madriani Novels)","review":"Another exciting murder charge defended by Paul Madriani. This time its a brilliant genetic scientist from the University charged with a gruesome murder. As usual Martini makes the legal procedural rules really interesting to read, and Madriani works his magic on cross examinations.Unfortunately, Martini brings in the key turn in the story before Madriani even begins the brilliant defence we have come to expect. Gone, too, are the warm personal and social relationships of Madriani - no current romance, Sarah, his daughter now a teenager, is barely mentioned. I missed them.However, Martini keeps it interesting and gives you his typical surprise ending that only the audience, Paul Madriani and his partner Harry Hinds ever will know."},{"Title":"The Jury (Paul Madriani Novels)","review":"This was a fun novel overall, mainly because I love the dry wit and comaraderie between Madriani and Harry. The plot was pretty easy to guess from about 1/3 through the book, from motive to the actual murderer. There was a lot introduced that never amounted to anything at the end (the disposal of Jordan's body, the mother's shocking testimony), serving only as detours that go nowhere. A lot of &quot;physical evidence&quot; was never explained either, and forgotten by the end of the book. There is one particularly dreadful chapter about nylon ties that will cause even the most helpful Ace hardwareman to fall asleep. A fun and quick read, but don't get too hung up in the details, Martini sure didn't."},{"Title":"The Jury (Paul Madriani Novels)","review":"If this had been my first Martini book, I would give it 3 or 4 stars, but given the Martini standard, this falls far short. The title has no relevance, other than it gives the book buyer the illusion that the jury itself holds significance to the story, as the attorney the judge did in earlier books. But rest assured, the jury makes no impact on this story. We never even learn who they are. The motivation of the killer was weak, and the action was tenuous in this entry to the Madriani series. I never understood about the mystery van - it followed our hero, but why? All in all, it was a quick read, and evidently, too quick of a write for Martini."},{"Title":"The Jury (Paul Madriani Novels)","review":"I think Steve Martini has joined Patricia Cornwell as authors who have gotten lazy. This book is by far the weakest in the Paul Madriani series. There is no plot tension and by the time the killer is revealed you've stopped caring. Previous novels explored his personal life; this book says virtually nothing about it. Dull plot and poor character development summarize this book."},{"Title":"The Jury (Paul Madriani Novels)","review":"the title amounts to false advertising of a pallid tale that gets bogged down in pseudo-science. a minor effort by an author usually known for his uniquely outlandish imagery and irreverent wit. a very talented writer of legal fiction seems to have succumbed to rank commercial packaging. his loyal fans are in for a disappointment."},{"Title":"The Jury (Paul Madriani Novels)","review":"This time around Paul Madriani and Harry Hinds are defending Dr. David Crone, a research scientist accused of murdering a young African-American colleague named Kalista Jordan.

Or was it a combination of both; Racial genetics?Madriani and Hinds do what they can in this rather lackluster effort by Steve Martini. A fairly slow-paced, very average legal novel like this is not what I expected from Martini. This was a dry Martini. It also seems to me that the title was chosen before the book was written.

In this case, the trial never reached its conclusion, but in fact a verdict was reached based on the killer's confession in the last few pages. Madraini and his assistant Harry in essence become the jury as they listen to the confession, contemplate how this would play out and determine their own concluding verdict. They could have reported the &quot;truth&quot; and cleared up all loose ends to this trial but they choose a different kind of verdict ending based on their own personal and professional morals."},{"Title":"The Jury (Paul Madriani Novels)","review":"While floating in the water near San Diego, research scientist Kalista Jordan contemplates what she can do next to get ahead in her profession. The intelligent African-American physicist knows all the angles and is setting in motion her plan to replace her boss Dr. David Crone. However, she runs into her apartment when she hears a frightening noise only to have someone choke her to death.Attorney Paul Madriani feels frustrated as his stubborn client David, on trial for Kalista's murder, refuses to cooperate in his own defense. Wondering if he represents a guilty person, Paul concludes that he will do his job in spite of his brilliant clients' efforts to stubbornly block him and try to win an acquittal from the jury.THE JURY reads like a modernized and updated Stanley Erle Gardner Perry Mason legal thriller. The novel treats the readers to a daily account of the trial and when court is not in session readers get an insider's look into hard to enter legal circles. The story line is very vivid, especially when Steve Martini describes the courtroom scenes. They feel so authentic the audience will feel they sit in the docket. Clearly, this novel is in the running for best legal procedural of the year, sending readers seeking running for more Martinis.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Jury (Paul Madriani Novels)","review":"Having read and enjoyed all of Martini's earlier efforts, I have to say, this one let me down. The plot is boring and predictable, there is no real interaction between the characters, and absolutely no subplot to maintain interest. As has been mentioned earlier, there is also no &quot;Jury&quot;.I had been looking forward to this one, and noticed that the release date was delayed several times. Now I see why. It seems time to give this character a rest."},{"Title":"The Jury (Paul Madriani Novels)","review":"If there was any doubt that Steve Martini was King of the legal thrillers, 'The Jury' should make that status firm and concrete.While I still believe 'The Judge' to be Martini's best Paul Madriani novel-to-date, this story is yet another fantastic example of the legal thriller genre.As you may remember, Paul Madriani, whom we first met in Martini's fantastic 'Compelling Evidence', has moved from Capitol City to San Diego to kinda start over after the death of his wife -- not so much for him, but for their daughter, too. Of all the Madriani novels so far, I believe 'The Jury' to be the quickest starting. You begin the novel quite literally in the middle of the murder trial which is the basis for this captivating story. You can really see Martini's research in this story, maybe more so than usual. The topic is a hot button for a good part of the country, and rightfully so: Racial Profiling. But this story takes on a different angle when you add in genetics, micro-biological-robotics and more -- and no, this isn't anything science fiction. No matter how sophisticated and technical the story gets, Martini handles the explanations in such a way that helps you understand without making you feel he had to 'dumb it down'.I never really thought about this (maybe that's because I'm not a lawyer) but how would you defend your client against a charge of murder when they refuse to reveal critical information that can only serve to help their case? This is the situation that Paul and Harry (his associate) find themselves in within the pages of 'The Jury'. Dr. Crone is accused of murdering one of his employees, Kalista Jordan. Did he do it? What part does race play in this particular murder, or does it at all? Why does Crone refuse to reveal to his lawyers what exactly his laboratory is working on? Is it morally wrong? Did someone else murder Kalista? And the big question: WHY was Kalista killed? Just when you are almost as frustrated at Crone as Harry and Paul are, Martini throws you a twist that could very well provide Crone with a free get out of jail card...but trust me, when you reach this point, just remember this story is far from over. Yet another great example of why I personally believe Steve Martini to be the best legal thriller author published today. Grisham is good, but this guy is simply GREAT.I must admit, that the title, 'The Jury' IS a bit misleading... but it in no-way made the story any less entertaining... but where exactly IS this 'Jury'? Other than in a few scenes in the book, I don't really know. But I DO know that if you enjoy well-crafted murder-mysteries with sharp legal twists intricately weaved within, than you will be most pleased with this latest trip to the courtroom from Martini. Oh, and if you enjoyed this one, look up his other Paul Madriani novels, 'Compelling Evidence', 'Prime Witness', 'Undue Influence', 'The Judge' and 'The Attorney'. Not just good examples of the legal thriller genre, but some of the best ever (at least to me)."},{"Title":"The Jury (Paul Madriani Novels)","review":"Paul Madriani and his partner, Harry Hinds may have finally met their match. Their client, Dr David Crone, is very secretive and seems to be doing everything he can to stonewall his own defense. When the strangled and dismembered body of Crone's colleague, Kalista Jordan, is found washed up on a Southern California beach, the police zero in on Dr Crone, immediately. He had means, opportunity and most of all a strong motive. It seems the very ambitious Kalista was after his job as head of a top-secret genetics research project, had filed a sexual harrassment complaint and was seen arguing publicly with Crone only hours before her death. But when the prosecution's star witness is found dead the day before he's to testify, leaving behind evidence that Crone is innocent, Paul Madriani isn't satisfied with his client's probable acquittal and goes looking for the whole truth..... Though the premise of The Jury is promising and provocative, Steve Martini doesn't deliver. The plot has a few good moments, but for the most part just plods along very deliberately and is neither tense, nor compelling. You're always waiting for something exciting to happen to get the story moving along. Mr Martini's writing is uninspired and awkward, at times and his characters, usually so well drawn and developed, are flat, lifeless and one dimensional this time out. For those who are fans of the Paul Madriani series, there isn't much to recommend in this book. For those new to author Steve Martini, skip this one and read some of his great earlier thrillers, Compelling Evidence, Prime Witness or Undue Influence. The Jury is disappointing and a legal thriller without the thrills."},{"Title":"The Jury (Paul Madriani Novels)","review":"A good story but some facts aren't explained, a genetics physician is accused of killing an associate professor, a brilliant younger black attractive lady, Paul Madriani, Steve Martini's alter ego I assume is the lead player in this story along with his faithful companion Harry Hinds. The courtroom action or rather inaction at times is really hard not just scan over and go on to a more interesting part something like beating a dead horse, its hard to be critical without revealing too many spoilers, another good novel from Mr. Martini but far from his best."},{"Title":"The Jury (Paul Madriani Novels)","review":"We liked Martini's first novel (\\"Simeon Chamber\\"), but found another of his non-series books, \\"The List\\", as well as \\"The Attorney\\", a Paul Madriani story, to be pretty dry going. Before we gave up on the author, we thought we'd try one more in the defense attorney Madriani series. Defending Dr. David Crone, a geneticist, charged with murdering a colleague, the trial scenes which dominate much of the book held our attention reasonably well while further clues and developments unfolded outside the courtroom. The interludes with Madriani and his sidekick Harry Hinds are also mildly entertaining. Finally, when a key witness apparently commits suicide, the prosecution's case is in jeopardy, leading to a rather surprising outcome near the end. (We also agree with numerous other reviewers that the title is a misnomer...)We wish we could put a finger on what's wrong with Martini's books. While he crafts a good enough plot, either he just can't handle 300+ pages without going bone-dry or he just doesn't have the knack for sustaining suspense for more than few chapters at a time. Compared to others in this genre, we would be hard pressed to label Martini's books \\"thrillers\\"; decent mysteries is about the highest praise we can muster. As our closing argument, we feel we just might be better off uncovering some new lawyers turned writers, and suggest Martini go back to court in real life."},{"Title":"The Jury (Paul Madriani Novels)","review":"If you can't solve it before the end then its good!"},{"Title":"The Jury (Paul Madriani Novels)","review":"I have usually enjoyed the Paul Madriani character and the cases he gets involved in. Somehow this particular story kind of mills around without much energy and has some trouble keeping the reader's interest. No one ever represented anyone charged with murder that was clearly more guilty, so you know he is innocent. After that you wait for the onion to get peeled down to the answer. There is not enough courtroom action here and one learns a bit more about genetics than we really want to. This isn't a bad book. Just not up to his usual standard...which is wha the verdict from &quot;this jury of one&quot; at least is three stars."},{"Title":"The Jury (Paul Madriani Novels)","review":"Having read and thoroughly enjoyed all the Paul Madriani books, I looked forward to The Jury as another tight, well-written legal thriller. In addition, what has always separated the Madriani character from the rest of the fictional lawyer crowd was his connection to his family and struggle to win the case and not lose the family. In The Jury, there is a strong element of the personal side of his life with the commitment to the young girl Penny Boyd, which is a compelling storyline. The courtroom and legal battles are only OK, with not much extraordinary happening, always a Martini trademark. Overall a good story, with Harry and Paul clicking as a team. However, I am still left to wonder, why in the world is this book called The Jury? (The Judge, The Attorney and now this...?)"},{"Title":"The Jury (Paul Madriani Novels)","review":"I have read all of martini's books and enjoyed all of them. This one left me waiting for something to happen. The title, &quot;The Jury&quot;, oh well, where did that come from. The books was indeed about a murder trial, but the jury was definitely NOT in the plot. they never appeared except to enter and leave the jury box maybe twice in the whole book. It was short, predictable and not worth the money. will be careful before I purchase another one of his."},{"Title":"The Jury (Paul Madriani Novels)","review":"What happened to the first 150 pages. Martini tells you 3 times who the killer is. Just like his last book, the killer is given away in the first 30 pages. I thought I got a book that had lost the first 150 pages. It's listed at 448 pages, and it comes out with 291. One must wonder if Martini has gotten bored with the Madriani character."},{"Title":"William 01 Just William","review":"I own 12 of these titles, and scour secondhand bookshops for any others I can find. The stories, especially the earlier ones (written from about 1920 to just after WW2), are sidesplittingly funny. Yes, they are that old. The author was a former school teacher who quit because of health issues, and had a natural understanding of boys. William, the eternal 11 year old the stories revolve around is incorrigible, and gets into hilarious situations in which he (mostly) means well. The books are divided into chapters, each of which are self contained stories. If you have a sense of humour you'll love William."},{"Title":"Entangled","review":"THIS WAS BY FAR ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS THAT I HAVE READ SINCE THE COLDEST WINTER EVER, IT IS SO REAL AND MAKES YOU THINK THAT IT CAN ACTUALLY HAPPEN TO YOU. GREAT JOB MR.ELLIOTT LOOKING FORWARD TO YOUR NEXT PROJECT."},{"Title":"Entangled","review":"I must say this was a good book. Even though I felt Dream was rather clueless to be an educated school teacher. However the other main character Jamal was reckless and made some pretty ridiculous choices aswell, however, the author still made you feel like you could identify with him in some way and you actually felt some empathy for him at times. I love ghetto street hardcore fiction such as this so overall i was pleased.."},{"Title":"Entangled","review":"If you like fast paste books you should go and cop a copy of this book.

Your characters were profound and I felt every emotion that each one possessed. You took us inside the minds of those effected by the streets. You gave it to us straight without a chaser.

Take Care!!!"},{"Title":"Entangled","review":"The story was amazing and would recommend this book to teenagers."},{"Title":"Entangled","review":"K-Elliot's debut, appropriately titled Entangled, leaves you feeling just that.... caught up in the lives of the characters, hoping their hopes, feeling their doubts and experiencing their highs and lows. It's a story that draws you in, that provokes suspense, emotion and drama and makes you think about the role of choice and how it intersects with the social structures that shape our lives. How much of what the characters are entangled in is choice and how much of it is circumstance? The characters are real and the internal and external conflicts they face will resonate with many. READ IT, you won't regret it! The images will stick in your head like you just saw it on the big screen.I look forward to more stories from this rising new writer."},{"Title":"Entangled","review":"BRAVO!!!!! Mr. Elliott you have out done yourself! Entangled is one of the hottest books on the shelf right now. This debut novel by K.

I got schooled! Entangled plays with every emotion you have one minute the characters are getting on your nerves the next minute you're praying nothing happens to them. K.

For .99 cent great book! Save you spending $15 at the bookstore!"},{"Title":"Entangled","review":"I enjoyed the book. The author took you on a visual trip, where you found yourself looking at the world from the character's point of view. There were times when I sympathized with all of the main characters and other times when I wanted to cuss them out for being stupid.My only issue with the editing is when a character would make a comment to someone and the other person would respond but the author would not state their name.For example. John saw Pam and said \\"Hi Pam, do you have the time?\\" \\"Hi, it's 7 pm.\\" \\"OK, Thanks.\\" \\"No problem.\\" Almost every paragraphh was like that.I'm used to books that would have read as follows. John saw Pam and said \\"Hi Pam, do you have the time?\\" Pam responded \\"Hi, it's 7 pm.\\" John thanked her for giving him the time. \\"No problem\\" Pam replied.After a while I got used to the writing style and I was able to guess who was saying what but I found myself confused a few times.I would highly recommend reading the book. Especially considering the cost. I also purchased the other two books in the series and hope to start those soon."},{"Title":"Entangled","review":"This was the first book i read on my kindle thanks to a girl friend of mine that recommneded it.

K. Elliott has entered that realm with ENTANGLED. For those who haven't read the story, I won't ruin it for you here, but I will say that he gets us into the mindset of the main characters and helps us to understand the struggles that they---and we--- face daily.We have the same ability as Jamaal: evil rears its ugly head at us daily. It is up to us how we face it.Congrats to Kevin for a powerful right, and a book that is brave enough to tackle difficult social issues and personal demons while at the same time entertaining us along the way."},{"Title":"Entangled","review":"I heard about this book two months ago and finally got it today and finished it with a WHOA!! I feel everything you are expressing and looking forward to meeting you in the writers den. It drew me in like a magnet and I could not let go until I revealed the last line on the second to the last page. The website. The book is provocatve, what's real everywhere and the price you pay to be in love with thugs. I know about that far to well. I felt at home inside the book. This is one you buy and tell others to go get their own, no borrowing. Keep up the good work my brother."},{"Title":"Entangled","review":"I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was hard for me to put it down once I began reading it. K. Elliott really did his thing and I look forward to reading his future work."},{"Title":"Entangled","review":"What is it with good girls falling head over heels for the \\"bad guy\\" or the \\"roughneck\\" these days? K. Elliot has captured this phenomenon quite accurately in Entangled, and aptly named his work so, because Dream certainly finds herself swallowed up in a mess concerning her love interest, Jamal.Dream is portrayed as coming from a good family whose parents have high hopes for her life. She is a history and although her name sounds a bit ghetto to me, she's not really a ghetto girl. She isn't satisfied with her life or the choice of men to share her life with. In the past she hasn't exactly chosen ones that her parents thought were suitable for her, but there is something that she finds attractive in the thug. As a history teacher, she should know that if a lesson isn't learned from previous mistakes, history is destined to repeat itself. Her relationship with Jamal, a drug trafficker fresh out of prison who said he didn't want to return to the life, is such an example. She's captivated by Jamal. However, her parents aren't as taken.As the story becomes more entangled, Dream is drawn into some things that she didn't bargain for. I grew upset with Dream and the notion of a woman so enamored with a man that she would do anything for him, even when she knows it's wrong. She realizes that he's dealing high stake drugs and fails to leave this man alone.Best classified as urban or street fiction, Entangled had an interesting hook that drew me in. The subplot of a DEA agent who has mixed feelings about his job makes the story interesting. Could there really be people who care about the subjects they are arresting? I could have jumped through the pages on several occasions and handled a little business but alas, it's a novel. The technicalities of writing were met, which is a highlight to urban fiction these days, so kudos are extended to Mr. K. Elliott on shining a positive light on grammar. I would have liked to see a more positive portrayal of a strong woman, rather than an easily controlled puppet, but I can't have it all. I'm interested in seeing what Mr. Elliott will put out in the future. Will he stick with this genre or move on to more mainstream fiction?"},{"Title":"Entangled","review":"I LOOOOVED this book. It took me on a emotional roller coaster, and a few times I caught myself yelling out loud at Dream and her foolishness. To all the true readers out there, if you love E. Lynn Harris, Eric Jerome Dickey and the other new voice in Urban fiction Hallema, then you'll definitely love ENTANGLED!!!!"},{"Title":"Entangled","review":"My boy K. Elliott really put it down!

Dream being a faithful girlfriend visited DeVon faithfully until he found out one of his cellmates was Dream's high school boyfriend.

Looking forward to reading more of your work."},{"Title":"Entangled","review":"So many times in life we see people who become a product of their environment. This was the case with Jamal Stewart. He could never manage to break from the circumstances that lead him down a road to a no good end. Dream Nelson, on the other hand was raised in a loving home with both her parents and yet she found herself caught up in a situation that she should have never been in because of being in love and bad decisions. Both their stories were ones that many can identify with and learn from. I thought this was a very good book that gave you a real look at life, the choices you make and the consequences of those choices."},{"Title":"Entangled","review":"This was a very good book. I could relate to the characters and know a few ppl that do crazy and wild things for love. This book was interesting from beginning to end.

I'M GOING TO SEE WHAT ELSE K.ELLIOTT HAS OUT. GOOD JOB"},{"Title":"Entangled","review":"I enjoyed this book. I have been known to stray from one book to another if I am not engrossed. Well, I kept returning to the book every chance I got. The ending where the authors makes the statement that they are not condoning the behavior I thought that was good. This book took two people from different sides of \\"the track\\" and put them together. This book shows that one decision can change your life forever, good, bad, indifferent..nevertheless changed. I enjoyed this book and will recommend it. I would have paid more than $.99 for it, but thanks to Kindle I didn't have to. Again it was an interest book about the streets, prison, the game, and the reprocussions."},{"Title":"Entangled","review":"This story left the reader not only entertained, but it also left a message. I wasn't expecting to like a book I only paid .99 cents for, but it was definitely worth the .99 cents, and so much more. I couldn't put the story down. There were so many twists and turns, and it was very well written. Jamal and Dreams relationship was like so many girls I've seen getting involved with the wrong guy. But the ending really surprised me, which says a lot. I will definitely be looking forward to more from K.

Good Job K I look forward to more from you."},{"Title":"Entangled","review":"This book Entangled is the best book I read in 2003. It is very suspensful and it flows like water. Although I don't read a lot of the street stuff this book will appeal to any reader because it is so well written I would reccomend it to teenage girls and young girls because of the Lessons learned. The writer takes you on a journey so hold on and fasten your seat belts. K Elliott is a hot new talent that is just getting started. I look foward to more of her novels"},{"Title":"Entangled","review":"Urban Hip Hop is one of my favorite genres. K-Elliott's debut weaves a fast paced tale of drugs, street life and a quest for Diamonds and Pearls. After serving five years for drug conspiracy Jamal vows never again to go back to jail. After being released he realizes gainful employment is a difficult task.In the meantime he connects with his childhood friend Dawg, who entices Jamal to contact his cocaine connection, Angelo in Florida. On a flight from Charlotte to Florida Jamal and Dawg meet Keisha Ferguson who is traveling with her girlfriend Dream Nelson. Jamal meets Dream and becomes mesmerized not only by her looks but her name.Dream is a middle school history teacher at Spaugh, and Jamal is a drug dealer. The contrast between the two lives is fascinating especially when Dream attempts to keep Jamal from his life of crime. As well as watching the transformation Dream goes through to help her thuggish man. I enjoyed reading the romance mixed amongst the violence and drug dealing that became a part of both their lives.When two worlds begin to collide there is no telling where the pieces will fall. Dream got so tangled in Jamal's world she almost lost her own. The undertone references to God were truly a welcomed sight amidst the violence and drugs and mistaken glamour of the streets. One message I walked away with after reading this book was He is always in the midst, working it out. No MATTER WHAT(Originally read and reviewed Dec 2003)"},{"Title":"Entangled","review":"It's been five years and Jamal Stewart was leaving Coleman, Florida heading to Charlotte, North Carolina. Jamal's stretch was spent looking at lavish mansions and luxury cars. The only plan he had was to live his life with an ordinary job. Imagine Jamal, big time hustler accustomed to having everything, now being apart of the working class.Dream Nelson, a 24 year old opted to follow her parents footsteps as an educator. An only child, from a good neighborhood and a loving two parent household found that she was enticed by that notorious bad boy brand. Her current man was actually on lock serving time for vehicular homicide. Dating straight laced academic types just didn't work for her.Agent Mark Pratt joined the Drug Enforcement Agency instead of the church like his father and father's father. His goal was to have a career that would impact other people lives. His lifelong dream was to rid the streets of drug dealers, get addicts into treatment and all would be good in the hood. Conflicted by his religion and job, Mark hated that his thoroughness usually targeted black men that lead to their jailing.As shocking as it is to believe a black man who happens to be an ex-con is unable to find a job. And people wonder why prisons seem to have the revolving door affect. Forced to jump back to his reign on the streets Jamal is just trying to get some major money and then live legitimately. Yeah, that's how it works.A trip to Miami to boast his freedom and a much needed vacation from visiting jail and teaching children Dream and Jamal lives become ENTANGLED.Dress him up and take him out on a night with the folks and he comes dressed like an infamous pimp. Take her out and she's on her first official drug run. My days are cold without you, while I'm hurting while I'm with you. And though my heart can't take no more, I keep on running back to you.At best I'd say the story was choppy. The impending shock factor was ruined by contradicting characters. The potential for a strong story with complex characters is there, but somehow it gets buried.

After reading these reviews, I thought the book would blow me away. Needless to say, I didn't not enjoy the book. The book wasn't poorly written, but the plot was on a below average level. I was disappointed at the main characters stupidity and how the leading male was more focused on himself. I am not thrilled that I even spent $0.99 on this book, as it was not worth the change. So disappointed!"},{"Title":"Entangled","review":"Though I love to watch movies surrounding street urban drama, rarely do I venture into this genre with books, but with Entangled, I'm glad that I did. With every paragraph, every chapter, I had to know what would happen next. I literally became angry when I had to put it down! The description of the characters instantly gave me a mental representation of each of them and the action within the plot was just enough to make the reader want to finish it in one read. I think the thing I enjoyed the most about this book was the fusion of romance and urban lit genres. I may be \\"discovering\\" K. Elliot late, but I plan to explore the other novels he wrote and edited.The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I (speaking only for myself) am not accustomed to so much cussing.

While I've got some good references on hand, sometimes when I come across some bizarre abuse of the language, there is just no substitute for the ANSI standard to help me understand why something is wrong.Unfortunately, this is the content I want, but, like the C++ Standard book which also recently became available, the binding is one of the poorest I've ever seen in a hardback book. The cover is thin, there is no cloth in the binding, and the gluing is very flimsly. Just flipping through some pages in the bookstore, I was afraid they were going to start falling out. A sturdy well-bound paperback edition would be much more welcome than this flimsy hardcover.This is inexcusable for a book that lists at $65 and for one that is designed as a reference. The standard is available for download for $18, although you won't get the extra introductions. You'd be better off downloading it, then taking it to a Kinko's or other print shop to have it printed on sturdy paper and bound with a coil. It won't be as pretty, and it might cost you just about as much, but it will certainly last longer.I just can't bear paying so much for such a poorly made book. The C standard should be in the hands of every serious C programmer, and this is the only authorized edition, but I'm sure no one involved with the standardization effort \\"authorized\\" Wiley to rip off buyers with this flimsy, overpriced effort."},{"Title":"The Undying Monster","review":"The plot is good, but the writing is difficult to follow.

I was fortunate enough to attend a course taught by the author in graduate school. In reading this book I learned some rather disturbing information about our governments environmental policies (a.k.a ignorance), and their effects on the global community. The most interesting information, however, related to the effects of numerous pesticides and industrial biproducts on human health and development.

Ultimately, he was dismissed as a professor from the Institut Catholique de Paris, his books were condemned by the Vatican, and he was excommunicated. (But of course, that simply whets our appetite even MORE to read what he wrote, eh?) He then taught the history of religion at the College de France until his retirement in 1931.Loisy wrote this book in 1902, and it contains his most famous statement, \\"Jesus foretold the kingdom, and it was the church that came; she came, enlarging the form of the gospel, which it was impossible to preserve as it was, as soon as the Passion closed the ministry of Jesus.\\"Loisy's disputes with the Catholic Church don't mean that he had Protestant sympathies, however; he wrote, \\"Jesus was the first to give his disciples a formula of prayer; He observed the practices of Jewish worship; He never recommended to His followers a worship without external forms, and never intended to establish such a worship.\\" He also concludes, \\"every advance is explained by a necessity of fact ... so that the historian cannot say that the total extent of the movement is outside of the gospel. The fact is, it proceeds from it and continues it.\\"This historically-significant book remains of interest to those interested in the life of Jesus, the Catholic Church, Catholic theology, and Modernism."},{"Title":"Sex & Sensibility (Harlequin Blaze)","review":"In Santa Rita, California, software millionaire Jay Singleton, over the objection of his chief of security Griffin Knox hires a psychic to help find his missing daughter, Christina, who he believes has been kidnapped. Griffin, a former cop, is skeptical that a psychic can help though he reluctantly finds himself attracted to Tessa Nichols. Instead Griffin wants to follow the law enforcement handbook on handling abductions with the goal to bring Christina home safely instead of mumbo jumbo. Adding to his doubts is that he knows Tessa from a previous confrontation (make that collaboration) and believes she is a fake.However, Tessa is looking forward to this assignment and not just because she feels she can help with the rescue, make a large sum of money, and enhance her reputation. She knows that Griff is her soulmate and plans to lure him into a relationship whether he wants one or not.SEX AND SENSIBILITY is a fine investigative paranormal romance that hooks the audience the moment that Griff learns that the \\"Princesa\\" appears to have been kidnapped and never slows down until Tessa confronts Griff. Fans of off beat suspense thrillers will appreciate this strong tale as the sensitive persuades the Skeptic (and readers) that she is real and that they make a great team.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Expediente X: ruinas","review":"Ya hab&iacute;a leido otros libros de la serie Expedientes Secretos X, pero, creo que este es el mejor.

Previous books havn't been as good as the early ones such as &quot;Dragonquest&quot; or &quot;The White Dragon&quot;. &quot;Moreta&quot; had a lame ending; &quot;Drangonseye&quot; left too many plots open and &quot;Dolphins&quot; would have been much better as an epilogue to &quot;Renegades&quot;. Still, the series isn't finished- a book about post-Thread Pern is badly needed (Toric needs sorting out if nothing else, preferably by Jaxom), as well as some background about the rest of the universe, both pre- and post- &quot;Dragonsdawn&quot;. The series also would be good as a CD-ROM game (who wouldn't like the chance to control a few hundred dragons). Anyway, &quot;Dolphins&quot; doesn't do the overall story any good at all. Aramina is vilified for for trying to protect her child, we learn nothing new about any of the main characters, except Menolly, and the jumping about in the text doesn't work as well as in &quot;Renegades&quot; as we miss years of Readis' development. The series needs finishing off, but with something better and more general than this. ..."},{"Title":"The Dolphins of Pern","review":"Just reliving my reading the Pern books. Been over 38 years ago When I first read my first Pern Book."},{"Title":"The Dolphins of Pern","review":"much less for those who are not.There is a message from the author at the front of the book that states that she \\"...respectfully suggests that books in the Pern series be read in the order in which they were published....\\". There are twelve books in the series that precede this one so those new to the series begin with DRAGONFLIGHT not here, the more of the earlier novels a reader has missed the less they will enjoy this one.This novel covers roughly the same time period as ALL THE WEYRS OF PERN and shares many of the same characters. The original landing site of the colonists has been discovered, including the computer, known as AIVAIS, which has supplied the Pernese with a wealth of information. One of the questions AIVAIS has raised was about the dolphins who had migrated to Pern with the original colonists. Over the intervening 2500 years the two sets of colonists, human and dolphin had lost contact despite the dolphins efforts. Contact was re-established though when a sudden storm caught a sailor and his passenger, the young son and heir to the local hold, by surprise and capsized their small craft. They were rescued by the dolphins, who were delighted to realize that the boy was willing to converse with them. When the boy, Readis, insisted that the dolphins spoke he was generally dismissed as a fanciful child even though the Pernese were quite familiar with human/dragon interaction. Over the years though Readis continued his relationship with the dolphins who came to have a dramatic impact on his life and the life of his planet.This is a wonderful addition to the Pern saga but it is definitely not a 'stand alone' story. Anyone attempting to begin with this one will be completely lost. Even if certain novels have been missed, or read some time earlier certain points will not make much sense. Part of the attraction of this series is the depth and complexity of the plots and characters. McCaffrey has created an entire new world and society here, one that needs to be savored in it's entirety."},{"Title":"The Dolphins of Pern","review":"I loved this book. Anne McCaffrey did it again.

Even though I like the more traditional Pern-style books, which I define as the ones in the 'old' Pern, this is better than some. It revolves around the 'Ship-fish', which are smarter than the Pernese gave them credit for. Timewise, it occurs around and during 'All the Weyrs of Pern', and several references are made to events happening in that book. ATWOP, however, doesn't, so reading it first might make more sense. Still, this is a wonderful book, and continues the wonderful legacy and history of Pern."},{"Title":"The Dolphins of Pern","review":"The dolphins of Pern brings the entire Pern series back around to its beginning.

And I did like how a handful of humans tried to re-establish relations with the marine mammals. Interesting to see the dolphins butcher the English language, which led to some problems of understanding between the two species. But then the story ground to a halt. Everything went swimmingly between man and dolphin and there was hardly any conflict I could see. The efforts to stop Thread just got breezed over, and the problem Readis' mother had with him communicating with dolphins could have been expanded on a lot more. To be honest, I did not even get to the end of the book. I just couldn't see any goals that needed to be achieved or conflicts that needed to be resolved and did not see the need to continue on to the end."},{"Title":"The Dolphins of Pern","review":"I enjoy all of Anne McCaffrey''s PERN books to the point where I've researched all she's written, keying on the PERN novels.

It introduces the dolphins back into the lives of the Pernese people"},{"Title":"The Dolphins of Pern","review":"Hmm - how to describe 'The Dolphins of Pern'. Well, I've read nearly all Anne McCaffrey's dragon works (except 'Red Star Rising' and 'The Girl who Heard Dragons'), spent hours browsing bookshops, libraries, wearing out copies etc and I must admit that the earlier works (especially the Harper Hall books) are a much better read. I'm not sure if ideas are starting to run out or the concept is becoming a shade jaded, but this latest offering didn't light my fire much. I knew all the characters almost too well, more drama next time please! It seems like, after all the fuss surrounding the Oldtimers and AIVAS, Pern is all happy n content with no more fuss. Aramina's character development seemed a bit confused. Why she suddenly became harder seemed a bit of a mystery to me. Surely, dragon contact hadn't affected her that much. Her antipathy towards the dolphins seemed to be unexplained as well. Not quite sure where the saga goes from here - the book left that very cloudy. Perhaps a recontact with the original explorers (even though they interdicted Pern). The alteration of the Red Star could be enough to bring em back. But I am of the old school, who prefer the earlier tales (Dragonsong + Dragonsinger particular faves) so this latest tale isn't up to par. Sorry to any I may offend!"},{"Title":"The Dolphins of Pern","review":"I think the Dolphins of Pern was a wonderful book. The Dragonriders of Pern is probaly one of the best book series that I've read. I felt so sorry for Readis and T'lion when everyone said the &quot;shipfish&quot; were a bad influence and should be avoided. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who likes Anne McCaffrey books. If I could give more than 5 stars, I would."},{"Title":"The Dolphins of Pern","review":"This is a pretty good book; enjoyable, certainly, but not very cohesive. Likeable (enough) characters, but not focused enough. Anne McCaffrey needs to pick one or two characters and focus the whole book on them instead of picking three and switching back and forth. Also, this book does not have much of a plot or much of a problem. As always, southern holders are greedy, but this problem hardly occupies the whole book. It does make you want to read the previous books, though, giving you the history of Aramina and Jayge.Not to bash this book, though. I really did enjoy it. It's a nice read, and the doll-fins certainly are engaging. The book that occurs simultaneously with it is All the Weyrs of Pern. Some good background reading for this book is Dragonsdawn, the story of the settlers of Pern, and The Chronicles of Pern: First Fall. This book is also better for younger children, as it has no sex.I'd recommend getting it. I liked it, for all its flaws, and the style is interesting."},{"Title":"The Dolphins of Pern","review":"A good read, typical of most of Anne McCaffrey's books, for those with a soft spot for Dolphins I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"The Dolphins of Pern","review":"I love the books, I love thier setting, the action, the realism (c'mon! you can't tell me you don't think about what it would be like if the place really existed and if it did could someone come and bring you there! =) ). The stories feed the imagination, and keep you wanting to read the next page.. then the next chapter... just one..more..page....... then the next book. When the book ended with-- heheh, won't finish that thought, I'm not about to spoil it for you =)-- I searched and searched for the next book chronilogicaly, only to find that she hadn't made one, hopefuly, yet. To think of what is to happen next brings me shivers. I admit that she shouldn't have made Aramina so... witchy (will refrain from saying that other word that rymes with it). I can see how she begrudged the dolphins, but you can see, at the very end, that she may come to. I hope this helped, I truly do recomend it. As for those who don't like it- people are entitled to thier opinions, I know I give mine, but don't scare people away from a book. As you can see, some people liked this book, others didn't, so you, as the reader, can only see for yourself if this book is for you."},{"Title":"The Dolphins of Pern","review":"This book was a bore. A lot of things happen oh so convientently on Pern, but this really takes the cake. All the people have to do is ring the bell and suddenly all the dolphins pop up and talk? And speak intelligable English? And NO one ever tried this before? Despite all the references to dolphin rescues? And don't even get me started on the incredulous population who deny the talking dolphins even after hearing the damn things talk.The conflict between Readis and Armina was identical to the conflict between Robinton and Petiron, Menolly and Yanus and Debera and her dad... not to mention Sean and his father. Child wants one thing, parents want the other blah blah blah. This went no where ands it didn't even get there very fast."},{"Title":"The Dolphins of Pern","review":"A lot of people have said that Anne McCaffrey lost something with the Dolphins of Pern, but I disagree. I think that the book ties together a lot of loose ends from throughout the series. It adds on to The Renegades of Pern, and lets us know what happened to some of the charachters that were forgotten in All the Weyrs of Pern. The Dolphins of Pern occurs (mostly)in the same time period as All the Weyrs of Pern, so that it does get slightly boring at times hearing things we already know. I think that it's worth reading through whatever boring parts there are though. In my opinion one of the best parts of the book is seeing the main charachters(and the leaders of Pern) through the eyes of some of Pern's lesser residents. We also finally get to know F'lessan (F'lar and Lessa's only son), who we don't hear too much from in the other books. This book is a must read for all those dedicated to the series, but it definitely isn't the place for someone new to the series to start reading. You should really to start with one of the other books if you want to fully appreciate this one."},{"Title":"The Dolphins of Pern","review":"This book is a wonderful addition to the Pern series of stories. Who wouldn't love dolphins? After the voyagers from Earth landed on Pern, they had brought many animals with them. The oceans of Pern are wonderful and perfect for marine mammals. They could communicate easily with the people.Everything was peaceful until thread fell out of the sky and killed anything it touched.In the horror the dolphins were forgotton and swam wild for many, many years.Finally someone realized that there were on Pern for a purpose.This story has a great ending and everything turns out well.If you love Anne McCaffrey's books on Pern, you will love this one."},{"Title":"The Dolphins of Pern","review":"This is one of my favorite Pern novels. I love this story; it is much more cheerful than the books centered around illness. The only black mark is the editing on the Kindle edition -- not enough time was taken - there are too many misspellings and wrong words."},{"Title":"The Dolphins of Pern","review":"If, like me, you've read several of the other books in the \\"Pern\\" series, this book provides a pleasant return to an engaging scifi world. Names and places are familiar and that makes it an easy book to get into. The downside to THE DOLPHINS OF PERN, however, is twofold. First, there are a great many references to characters and events from previous books that, because it's been a while since my last visit to Pern, I had only vague recollections of. It would have been nice if people and events from previous stories were brought in with more background to refresh the reader's memory.Second, and more importantly, the story has almost no plot. It reads as a chronicle of events that are, in some cases, almost unrelated. The issue between Lord Toric and the other Holders and the Dragonriders, for instance, is straightforward and has no direct connection with the developing relationship between humans and dolphins. Further, the growth of that relationship is very linear, with little that would qualify as a significant complication. Toric simply steps out of line gets his wrists slapped. Additionally, the notion of a \\"normally\\" social teenage boy who is so obsessed with dolphins that he is elated with the opportunity to isolate himself from other humans (including girls) for a long period of time is difficult to accept.THE DOLPHINS OF PERN qualifies as little more than a casual return to the intriguing world of Pern. It's OK as an update of events on Pern, but if you're looking for an actual story, you won't find it here. In my opinion, this is the least intersting book of those I've read in the Pern series, so far. If you're a fan, you might enjoy the revisit, but I don't recommend this installment for casual readers."},{"Title":"The Dolphins of Pern","review":"I didn't think I would like this book. I loved it. By the time I got finished, I wished that there were more books about the dolphins."},{"Title":"The Dolphins of Pern","review":"After reading the other Pern-books, I felt let down by this one. The overall plot was good, but there were just too many questions left unanswered to my liking, and it was far to longwinded at some parts. The idea of the dolphins was overall fantastic, but the way it was presented was not.I'm waiting for a sequel of &quot;what happened next&quot;, in hopefully a little more capturing style. And if you haven't read other McCaffrey's books, this is NOT the one you should start with."},{"Title":"The Dolphins of Pern","review":"I thought as a whole that it was a very good read only a few problems with it but no author is perfect and I do enjoy Anne's books, I have now read them all and am sorry to see the series end but there really isn't much more she could write about Pern. I think that this book was needed to make the saga complete, now that thread is going to be no more, or is it? Might be more novels here, sorry just had to slip that in. Read this book!"},{"Title":"The Dolphins of Pern","review":"I enjoyed &quot;Dolphins&quot;, just as I have enjoyed all of Ms. McCaffrey's Pern books. However, the plot similarities to some of the previous books in the series (Menolly, anyone?) made it hard for me to get really thrilled about this book. I could predict what was going to happen within two chapters. It really reads like a last-ditch, I've-run-out-of-inspiration-but-I-have-to-write-this-book-anyway effort.Reread the old books. You'll have more fun."},{"Title":"The Dolphins of Pern","review":"First I have to admit that I'm a big fan of McCaffrey's Pern series. I've followed most of the books in the series from the Dragonriders of Pern to the Harper Hall Trilogy, with Renegades of Pern, All the Weyrs of Pern, and (of course) the Dolphins of Pern. However, I feel compelled to give the book only 2 stars on the fact that her standards seemed to have sliped with this plot. I have nothing against dolphins, but as I was reading I alway had this impression that she (McCaffrey) is trying to salvage what's left of the series to create this story. Also, the \\"weaving\\" of the story with various scenes in \\"All the Wyers\\" left me the impression that some dialogue resurfaced that wasn't mentioned in one or the other. I wouldn't be so harsh, if not for the fact that she did a good job of linking scenes between \\"The Renegades of Pern\\" and with \\"The White Dragon\\" from different perspectives with no change in dialogue (ie Toric @ ! Landing) unlike \\"The Dolphins of Pern.\\" But the biggest problem that I can not swallow and am surprised that it passed the editors is the fact that Lord Oterel of Tillek Hold seemed to have a surprising resurrection for \\"The Dolphins of Pern\\" when supposedly he passed away, thus the contention for Tillek Hold in a chapter in \\"All the Weyrs of Pern.\\" That error cannot be \\"smoothed over\\" since a man could be either dead or not dead. Unfortunatly, this shows to me that the author did not put much serious effort in keeping with the chronology of Pern."},{"Title":"The Dolphins of Pern","review":"I'll start by saying that I realy like the Pern series and I've read most of them at least two times . However, I WILL NOT read this one again and I am tring to forget I ever read it! I seems to me that Anne McCaffrey has run out of ideas and realy dosen't cair much about what she writes any more. I don't like this book because:1 It dosn't follow with events. The dolphins weren't mentioned in the books about early Pern and as it was said before, wasn't Lord Oterel suposed to have died?2 Aramina was basicly a kind cairing person in 'Renegades of Pern', so how come she was so meen in this book? And what did she have against dolphins? It seemed like Anne just made her like that so we could have a recreation of the 'Dragonsong'(which I realy liked) theem.3 Ever herd of a world being to perfict? Well, this one is. Now that thred is gone and people can't be killed by storms or helth problems,at the end of the pass, all pernese people will have left to do is multiply!I'm sorry if I have offended anyone, but I realy liked the old ones and I think Anne shuold have just left it at that!"},{"Title":"The Dolphins of Pern","review":"This book will always have a special place in my heart. It was my first introduction to Anne McCaffrey, probably when I was about 12 or 13. According to my mom, my grandpa called asking what I wanted for my birthday, and she said \\"Oh, any book with dragons or dolphins will make her happy.\\" How right she was! I didn't get much out of it on my first read through, as you really need to have read the rest of the series first, but it stuck with me long enough that I picked up Dragonflight not too long afterward, and the rest, as they say, is history. I was pretty devastated last year when she passed :(Not too long ago, I decided I wanted to start from the beginning and read the entire Pern series, picking up all the books I had missed in high school. This time I made sure to read them in the proper order - publication order is the recommended way to read them from the McCaffrey estate. Every subsequent novel references the one directly before it so I highly recommend this order as well. No wonder The Dolphins of Pern made so little sense to me the first time through. I had no idea about impressions or fire lizards or harpers or any of that. Definitely do NOT accidentally start here like I did. Dragonflight is an amazing novel, start there.The story of Readis being rescued by dolphins is briefly mentioned in a predecessor, I believe All the Weyrs of Pern, but it is much more fleshed out here. The dolphins are engaging and hilarious and plastered a big dumb smile on my face whenever they appeared. Unfortunately, the title belies their actual involvement in the story - there wasn't nearly enough dolphin! But we had to get some good ol' Pern politicking out of the way, and Menolly showing up is always a pleasure. The dragons are mostly in the background throughout this story, with a few exceptions. I think this is the first Pern installation without a hatching of any sort.Anne McCaffrey's Pern novels unfortunately start showing a tendency towards sexism. The lady hated women I guess! The Dolphins of Pern is the worst yet. There's not a single main character in this book who is a woman. Menolly shows up, but all we hear about is her pregnancy and how she really wants it to be a boy. There are a couple other pregnant women in Paradise River Hold, and THEY all want boys too. Aramina is a gigantic bitch for no apparent reason other than \\"motherly worry.\\" I seriously wanted to punch her, and I wanted Readis to run away and be with his damn dolphins. This really detracted from the novel for me.For the first half, I thought this was going to be my first 4-star Pern review since The White Dragon (Dragonriders of Pern #6). There was a lot of Alemi, Readis, and T'lion for the first part, and it kept my avid interest. Pretty soon however, it got back to the exhausting Lord Toric, and boring councils with the weyrleaders. Sadly, it dropped back to 3-stars for me, as I really just wanted more dolphins! I enjoyed it more than some of the Pern books before this, namely, The Renegades of Pern. Yuck! Definitely read it if you love Pern and you want a complete history, but only lovers of the world would enjoy it, and it does not hold up on its own."},{"Title":"The Dolphins of Pern","review":"The first portion of the book is about the recontact between the humans & the dolphins of Pern. However soon it becomes a place to put stray stories about Pern at this time period that weren't used in other books. It reminded me of one of those movies that people see only to see the guest appearances by various actors."},{"Title":"The Dolphins of Pern","review":"I read this long ago. I recently picked up a large collection of McCaffrey hardback (many first edition) novels. I felt somehow in Her presence as I was about halfway through this book when she passed to 'between.'This is not my favorite book of the Pern novels, but it ranks very high. I am passionate about dolphins and swimming... and dragons. But at times I wished for more of Readis's life than the life of the 'politicians' of the planet. I wished for more science discovery. There was a lot of that, but I wanted more. But I know these are the threads of the next books and the evolving of Pern, so I shouldn't complain.Though I have the hardback, I now prefer to read on Kindle where it doesn't hurt my eyes. And at times I need the audio version to listen to when my eyes get tired. Since the text to speech tool didn't work on this novel I downloaded the Audible version. Hearing a human voice narrating is always preferable to the computerized versions, anyway.Mel Foster's interpretation was different than what I expected. I think, knowing that Anne McCaffrey is of Irish descent, I expected a brogue to come from the sea holds rather than what sounded a southern drawl. But that was Mel's interpretation and I soon adjusted. He did a decent job keeping the character's voices dissimilar enough to know who was talking when.I look forward to 'worming' my way through all of Anne's books, those I have read and those I haven't yet. I hope I can afford to use Audible/Kindle help to do this.

They're rescued by \\"shipfish,\\" the dolphins who accompanied their human ancestors from Earth to this new world in a time beyond memory. What happened in Pern's early days is coming to light now, though, with the re-discovery of the colonists' original landing site and the computer entity Avivas. Readis learns that the dolphins still faithfully observe their ancient agreement with humans, despite the humans' having forgotten all about it. They also retain their ability to use human language in a limited way, and the boy quickly realizes just how intelligent these creatures are. But his mother blames the dolphins for the danger to which Readis has been exposed.T'Lion, a very young dragonrider, transports holders from place to place as he waits to grow old enough to fight Thread. When he's introduced to the dolphins who rescued Readis and his uncle Alemi, and bronze Gadareth immediately takes to these intelligent sea creatures, T'Lion and Readis become friends. Many of Pern's leaders, though, share Aramina's fear and scorn where the \\"shipfish\\" are concerned. Among those leaders is Toric, Lord of Southern Hold, who has his own ideas about how the great Southern Continent's vast vacant lands should be distributed - especially after the last Threadfall, when the Dragonriders will finally be able to move to lands of their own and never again depend on the tithes provided by those whose holds they protect.I started reading the Pern series about the time its first paperback came out, but I have taken a break from it in recent years. Picking up this 1994 installment in the saga surprised me pleasantly. I enjoyed it as I might a visit with old friends, and as usual McCaffrey's writing pulled me in and held my attention. I may have to sample the Pern books that McCaffrey and her son now co-author.--Reviewed by Nina M.

I have read the whole series, except for the books written by Todd McCaffrey, twice and some of the books three times.I just bought my new toy, the Kindle, and I thought it would be a good idea to have the series on my Kindle. This the third I've read and I was very disappointed by the lack of proofreading involved in this book. There were typos all throughout the book and some so blatent as to be laughable!I always give all McCaffrey books a 5 star rating, but I had to give this one 4 stars because fot the typos.I hope the people that input the books take care to do a better job from now on!"},{"Title":"The Dolphins of Pern","review":"Anne McCaffrey is the quintessential writer of fantasy books pertaining to dragons.

My only complaint is that it left me wanting to know more about the Dolphin Hall. There must be a book to finish the story.

Maybe another book would also clear that up."},{"Title":"The Dolphins of Pern","review":"Pern through the eyes of dolphins. This is a charming and worthy addition to the Pern library. It has all of Anne McCaffrey's usual great style and story telling ability in it. It isn't quite on the same level with &quot;The Dragonriders of Pern&quot;, but it's hard to equal a previous classic by writing on the same subject. All in all, this book is a satisfying read."},{"Title":"The Dolphins of Pern","review":"This was the first book in the Pern series that I read and the best. The dolphins of pern that were brought by the original colinists have continued to be loyal to the humans, altough the humans have forgotten their part of the contract. The adventures of Readis are followed in his efforts to learn more about the &quot;shipfish&quot;. I very much enjoyed how the dolphins were portrayed as playfull, carefree creatures that see life as a game. McCaffrey is wonderful at prtraying her creatures, I was captivated by dragons, and the dolphins are written with the same insight and personality that makes them seem real.

Always I reply with the same answer:&quot;Anne Mc Caffrey's books are so real that when I read them I can feel the wind cooling my face as I fly a dragon, I can feel the emotions pulsing through me as clear as if I WAS fighting, frustrated, joyous, or distressed.&quot;Unfortunately I could not reply like this for the 'Dolphins of Pern'.I would have to reply that, &quot;I feel the warm water flowing around my body as I swim, hear the squeky voices of the Dolphins, laugh as I see their games, feel the unpredictable storms accumulate infront of me, clinging to my boat as . . &quot;This carried me away with it, and only when I finished could I think clearly. Although even then the emotions, sights sounds, smells and feelings echoed through my mind like the echoes of a bell across the water. A dolphin bell.I was never a great reader, but something in this book speaks to me to the very core of my being. Everyone I know who has read the book echoes my feelings. I have come to the conclusion that if you don't live with this book then your mind is like a desert, empty of imagination except for the harsh hot wind that kills.I have but one complaint; the book is not binded well enough.

However, when Master Fishman Alemi takes young Readis out on an ill-fated fishing trip, and are actually rescued by the dolphins, young Readis' life takes an unexpected course. Did the Shipfish actually speak to him? Or was the lasting impression left by the stress of a near-fatal accident?And why, when the great bell is tolled do the Shipfish congregate in such amazing numbers on the Southern Continent? If it all sounds too fishy for you, remember that like us the Shipfish are mammals and capable of deep thinking. Do the Dragons and the dolphins communicate too?Find out in this splendid example of Anne McCaffery's adventure on Pern"},{"Title":"The Dolphins of Pern","review":"I agree with many others that this book seems like it was &quot;just tossed off,&quot; with much of the freshness of the original books gone. It suffers from Series Syndrome. I won't rehash the plot (the dolphins were &quot;Island of the Blue Dolphins&quot;, but cuter), but I did think it deserved mention that her AIVAS (artificial intelligence voice address system) is totally a homage to/steal from Philip K. Dick, who wrote VALIS (Vast Active Living Intelligence System) after several mystical visions of a pink light visited him in real life. VALIS is worth your attention if you have any interest in the concept of religion+science. But here it just seems stuck on. It's disappointing to think that lots of people will think that the VALIS-type idea is original to McCaffrey, but oh well. Anyhow, I would categorize this as science fantasy, because the science is overtaking the fantasy elements. It's more like &quot;technology meets the Middle Ages.&quot; It wasn't a book that set me on fire, obviously. And that was a disappointment. I wish we could have another book like _The White Dragon_."},{"Title":"The Dolphins of Pern","review":"After reading at least 5, maybe 10, Pern books, I think I need a break. The Dolphins of Pern isn't quite as enthralling and exciting as the others. Latter parts of the book basically retell the events of All the Weyrs of Pern.One thing that really bugs me about Anne McCaffrey's books is the subtle but overall feeling that men are superior to women. Men make all the decisions. Only men can be lord holders (basically the rulers, much like medieval lords). Only men can ride dragons that can actually fight thread. (Queen dragons, which only women ride, and which are the only dragons that breed, fight thread, but only with puny flamethrowers--they can't chew the rock that allows them to breath fire because that makes female dragons sterile.) Yes, women do some things--some of them are even brilliant. But in the end, they all wind up sitting at home, pumping out children for their beloved husband. The only woman so far who wanted to be a Lady Holder (remember, usually only men can be rulers) ended up going renegade and being a heartless robber and killer. The main purpose of the riders of queen dragons is to keep their dragon healthy so it can spawn, and sleep around so they can pop out some more potential dragonriders.Anne McCaffrey's books are very good. I do recommend you read them. I do think there is an undertone of male superiority, but, well, most of the books are enjoyable enough that you can get over that. Like I said, they are good books. You (probably) won't be wasting your money."},{"Title":"The Dolphins of Pern","review":"I was reading all the critical reviews, and I gotta say, I don't see any of you writing novels! Anne McCaffrey is a master at her craft, and anyone who thinks they can criticize is tripping over their own feet. The Dolphins of Pern is not my favorite of her novels, but it is still certainly well-worth reading. It contains likable characters, connects story plots from previous novels, and gives us new wonderful characters (the dolphins) to love! One suggestion to new readers: read the earlier novels first in the series to appreciate this one better. (Moreta and DragonQuest -- awesome!)"},{"Title":"The Dolphins of Pern","review":"Honestly, I can't see why people don't like this novel. The dolphins were included in earlier books, but were barely mentioned and always known as shipfish. I suggest reading this and all other McCaffrey novels--this is one of my personal favorites. And come on--if you haven't read it, how do you know if you'll like it? Re-read the series in order and you'll see how it all fits in. I have no personal favorite McCaffrey novel; they're all top-grade. Read and enjoy: don't criticize everything you see! And, by the way, Aramina was ticked at the dolphins because she thought they had something to do with Readis's injury. In truth, we all like to blame someone or something else now and then."},{"Title":"The Dolphins of Pern","review":"I started the series years ago and never finished it-I am now and have enjoyed every book, including this one."},{"Title":"The Dolphins of Pern","review":"This is one of my top 3 favorites of the PERN stories. Dragonquest and Dragonsdawn being the other two.To have the complete story of Jayge, Aramina and Readis you must also read: Renegades of Pern, Dragondrums and The Girl Who Heard Dragons!To have the whole story of the Dolphins you must also read: The Chronicles of Pern and Dragonsdawn.Read them all - it's a blast!The young Readis is a loyal and loving child (not a whiner) and his conflicts with his mother are a result of her own traumatic youth and her obsessive desire that he become what she could not.Her character does get a bit over protective and it bothered me that the sweet little girl &quot;Mina&quot; has grown up to be so overbearing.The ends justify the means and as is a constant theme in Ms.M's stories a downtrodden young person triumphs over oppression to reach a noble and respected maturity."},{"Title":"The Dolphins of Pern","review":"What a terrible book; I can hardly believe this is the same author who wrote Dragonflight/Dragonquest/The White dragon.

What a terrible disappointment."},{"Title":"The Dolphins of Pern","review":"It's OK, I suppose. Frankly I think her writing style is flagging, and I do believe she is running out of things to write about. I think it's time we lose the books for awhile and focus on the TV show(which I EAGERLY anticipate!) It was nice to hear about Mirrim and T'gellan again, though.

However in this book she really hit gold. Now at this point you readers are probably thinking whoppee, sounds just like all the other reviews. Well it probably is but I am going to keep writing anyway. Most of Anne's books are all happy and joyous. They make me want to hurl. In this book someone finally dies. This probably sounds weird but since I love tocry it makes sense to me. Robinton, the beloved Masterharperof Pern, dies. Mccaffrey kills him off tastfully though and that makes the book all the more sad.The fact that his firelizard and AVAIS also die made me burst into tears. AlsoI enjoyed the growing up of the young boy Readis. His motherwas just evil enough( though not kill everyone evil but moreof a I will make your life hell evil) to make you think of the times your own dear mum wuoldn't let you follow your dream of being a tightrope walker. Or was that just my mom?Anyway over all the Dolphins of Pern was a gem. I got it from the library but I liked it enough to go out and buy it.For me, when I see fit to buy a book my friends know its good. (They have all borrowed my copy numerous times.

But I've been burned by &quot;later day&quot; Pern books, so I am secure in telling people not to read this or anything made recently except All the Weyrs of Pern (it's a must, all the rest of poorly written unimportant crap).I really DO NOT like McCaffrey writing the story of the first settlement, or the first fall, or the founding of this or that place or weyr, since a) it takes the magic and legendary quality out of the Pern, and b) exposes us to her later-day writing, which is far less in quality than the Dragonwing/Harperhall trilogies and Moreta (gotta read Moreta!). Do yourself a favor, and don't read any of the &quot;early Pern&quot; books. Get what you need to know about the founders from Moreta and avoid the rest.P.S.

I would like to see more of the dolphins on Pern."},{"Title":"The Dolphins of Pern","review":"I think The Dolphins of Pern is a fantastic book. Sure in the beginning of the Pern series the dolphins did not talk, but they were most assuredly there on the ships coming to Pern. The dolphins, like the fire lizards are a wonderful addition to Pern. They can diagnose health problems before they get too bad, and they make a little boy into a wonderful, helpful person. Read this book. It is a MUST in the Pern series for true fans of Anne McCaffrey."},{"Title":"The Dolphins of Pern","review":"The Dolphins of Pern was the first Pern book I read. It's very good and I like it more than the other Pern books I've read (The White Dragon, Moreta). About a young boy who likes the water and discovers the intelligent enhanced dolphins when he and his uncle, Alemi, are caught in a storm at sea. No one belives him at first, until they meet the happy, talking dolphins themselves. A very good book and I recommend it for the Pern lovers who aren't too attached to the dragons because there is only one in the book, Ruth, and he's not there much."},{"Title":"The Dolphins of Pern","review":"This is one of the better books in the Pern series. It is definately worth reading. I would only recommend this book to people that have read other Pern books before and enjoyed them."},{"Title":"The Dolphins of Pern","review":"I'm not one for fantasy and far out ideas, but the incredible way that McCaffrey displayed her talents in this book took my breath away!! She has amazed me and forever bound me to the incredible tales of the weyrs, holds and crafts of Pern in her &quot;highly believable society&quot;. I have now read 7 of the books in the series and was captivated equally by each one. I'm not stopping there................."},{"Title":"The Dolphins of Pern","review":"One of the most &quot;true&quot; qualities of McCaffrey's on-going &quot;Pern&quot; saga is the astute way in which she ties in events from other books in the series. Readis becomes another human person in a series of so many memorable characters. How unassumingly he is tied in with the appearance of Menolly, the grieving scene accompanying the news of the Masterharpers's death, the return of the dolphins - the lost friends of the early colonists - to the the Permese and Aivas, and the fulfillment of its purpose, the end of thread. To praise the many wonders of the books is to rewrite it. As one reviewer commented, I hope Anne McCaffrey sees some of these reviews just to know that her work is appreciated and that she brings so much joy to so many. Sometimes I think I live in the suburbs of Dragonhold-Underhill. What a great visit that would be!"},{"Title":"The Dolphins of Pern","review":"This book has its good points which don't make up for Aramura turning into a total jerk! She was so cool in 'the girl who heard dragons' and now she's an ----- on a level with Menolly's parents!"},{"Title":"The Dolphins of Pern","review":"I liked the way this book ran parallel to the events in &quot;All the Weyrs of Pern&quot;. A good read, despite the fact that I thought the ending was a bit rushed."},{"Title":"The Dolphins of Pern","review":"I recommend reading all the Pern books in order... as this one was a bit confusing with information I hadn't read before and slots of time missing and unaccounted for in this book (although accounted for in the books prior to this that I had not yet read).All of the Dragons of Pern series books are outstanding reads and I would recommend them for both the young and the old."},{"Title":"The Dolphins of Pern","review":"&quot;The Dolphins of Pern&quot; is one in author Anne McCaffrey's series of novels that take place on Pern: a world where the descendants of human colonists live together with huge, winged creatures called &quot;dragons.&quot; The dragons of Pern have some similarities to the mythical creatures of ancient Earth, but McCaffrey throws in some science fiction twists. &quot;Dolphins,&quot; as the title suggests, adds a new element to the culture and history of Pern.As McCaffrey explains in the book's prologue, the spacefaring humans who first settled Pern brought with them dolphins who had been endowed with the ability to speak human language. But over the course of time, the hostile environment of Pern caused the dolphin and human communities to gradually lose touch with each other. This book is the story of the attempts to rediscover and reestablish the ancient ties between the two species.To the cynical, the concept of this book might seem like a &quot;gimmick&quot; to bring a new element to the Pern series. But believe me, &quot;Dolphins&quot; is no gimmick: this is one of the best in the entire series. McCaffrey creates a rich and moving portrait of the dolphin community -- a community with a compelling culture and history. This is also a beautiful &quot;coming of age&quot; story that focuses on Readis, a boy of Pern who has a remarkable bond to the dolphins. McCaffrey superbly weaves the dolphins' history and Readis' very personal story into the epic story of Pern's humans and dragons. I recommend this book to both Pern fans as well as to newcomers to the series."},{"Title":"The Dolphins of Pern","review":"I love the Pern books! Ever since I was a young girl in school and found Dragonsong in the 1970's.I really enjoyed this book I love how Anne is filling in the gaps for us about folks from other books like Jayge, Aramina and Readis as well a the Dolphins from Dragonsdawn.But here is what I think would help folks a lot in their enjoyment of this book and some of the other books.I think some of these later books don't work as well on their own because they truely aren't stand alone novels like Dragonflight, Dragonquest etc.. You absolutly HAVE to have read Renegades of Pern, All the Weyrs of Pern and Drangonsdawn for this book to make sense to you!I think it would be a smart decision to integrate this book and possibly some of the other later books into the novels they companion.Take Dolphins for example: I think the plot would have been better recieved had it been combined with &quot;All the Weyrs&quot;, yes it would have added another subplot but they also could have eliminated all the parellel &quot;All the Weyrs&quot; plot synopsis. And it would have prevented any major errors such as the Lord Holder death issue someone mentions here. I have to check my books at home I don't know if that reveiwer is correct or not.The timeline jumps around but I have no problem with that it happened in Dragonsdawn and other Pern books so what's the big deal?In the end I enjoyed this book but I believe it would have been better received as part of the &quot;All the Weyrs&quot; story than a separate novel."},{"Title":"The Dolphins of Pern","review":". . . but certainly not the best of the Pern series.The concept of dolphins who could communicate with humans was introduced in \\"Dragonsdawn\\" and the notion of seemingly intelligent \\"shipfish\\" have been seen in several Pern stories.Now, in \\"The Dolphins of Pern\\", the relationship between humans, dragons, and dolphins on Pern is re-established. The book could be viewed as a sequel to \\"The Renegades of Pern\\", as much of the action surrounds Jayge, his wife Aramina (the girl who heard dragons) and their son Readis. The book also runs concurrent with many of the events in \\"All the Weyrs of Pern\\".Why only three stars? Because, frankly, the character development is, frankly, unbelievable. Jayge, Aramina, and Readis have all, at different times, been rescued from probable death by dolphins. Readis -- probably twice. Why then are his parents (especially his mother) so against the boy's interest in them? This seems forced to me. (Especially since most of the rest of the Pernese leadership -- including persons whom Jayge and Aramina greatly respect -- and owe much to -- are inclined to permit Readis to pursue his interest to the benefit of all Pern?Also, once the Oldtimers, the Renegades, the Red Star, etc. have all been dealt with, where do we go for a villain? We've got to invent one, of course! Toric, now Lord Toric of Southern Hold -- who has in other novels been a character on the fringe of trouble -- is now the new designated \\"bad guy\\".Overall, the story seemed too contrived. NOT the best book in the series -- NOT by a long way."},{"Title":"The Dolphins of Pern","review":"I have to agree with several of the reviews that noted how Anne McCaffrey's later works about Pern seem to have lost something that she did so well in her earlier ones. I am a loyal McCaffrey fan, so please don't take this as some kind of &quot;Anne-bashing&quot;--but, The Dolphins of Pern just wasn't up to par with the first two trilogies. While the concept of the friendly, talking dolphins is appealing, the storyline goes all over the place, jumping over years in Readis' and other characters' lives, losing focus and generally feeling less like a plot than an ongoing report on the amazing new dolphins. I hope Anne isn't just writing in response to pressures from fans and her publisher, but I have a bad feeling that she became bored with Pern years ago. Read this book only if you are a Pern fanatic."},{"Title":"The Dolphins of Pern","review":"This is an interesting part of the Pern series that focuses mainly on the Dolphins of Pern. The Dolphins are an important part of the history of Pern. The Humans and Dolphins lost touch along the way. Now the old bonds are being reforged. However, not everyone treats the dolphin's with the respect they deserve. Hardly anyone does in fact. Most view them as having less value than dragons, and certainly less than humans. Even though the dolphin's intelligence is equal to human's. But one young man does not feel this way. In fact he is willing to risk everything (including his overprotective mother's rage) to be with the dolphins. This is mainly their tale."},{"Title":"The Dolphins of Pern","review":"So how do you follow up the fabulousAll the Weyrs of Pern (Dragonriders of Pern Series), which told of the concerted, all-out efforts of Weyr, Hold, and Craft to finally, irrevocably eradicate Thread from the planet of Pern? THE DOLPHINS OF PERN is the next novel to catch us up with the folks of the present Pass (the 9th one), and, sucks to say, it just can't live up to the level of excitement, thrills, and just plain dazzle brought about by ALL THE WEYRS OF PERN. It certainly doesn't satisfy as much. But it's not bad, either. It's still written, after all, by one of the all-time storytelling greats in fantasy/science-fiction.In THE DOLPHINS OF PERN, Anne McCaffrey chronicles the reconnecting of man and dolphin on Pern. As told inDragonsdawn (Dragonriders of Pern Series), dolphins, genetically enhanced with the gift of speech, had numbered among the original colonists from Earth. In the early days of Pern's settlement, dolphin and man had formed a partnership and had begun to explore and map the oceans of Pern. But then the skies unexpectedly began to rain deadly silvery spores (called Thread), which devoured everything organic in their path.Instantly, man's progress on Pern is halted, as Earth's descendants find themselves frantically fighting for survival against the onslaught of Thread. Vast chunks of time elapse. Down the centuries, technology falls on the wayside. And mankind forgets the dolphins. What remains are vague but countless myths of sea creatures called \\"shipfish\\" who rescue people from a watery grave. But no one really believes these tall tales.But the dolphins haven't forgotten. And, more than 2500 years later, their unwavering vigil and faithfulness are rewarded, as man at last re-establishes contact with them. THE DOLPHINS OF PERN centers on three characters - Masterfisher Alemi (also Menolly's brother), the youthful and untested dragonrider T'lion, and Readis, the young son of Paradise River Holder Jayge and his wife Aramina. This novel focuses mostly on their momentous encounters with the intelligent, talking dolphins of Perns. The actions of these three people would have wide-ranging repercussions for the seafaring communities, both human and cetacean. Initially, Alemi and T'lion are the predominantly featured characters. Then, somewhere halfway thru the book, Readis, in his teenhood, takes over as the central figure.But, as per usual, McCaffrey affectionately finds spots to guest star several of her most beloved characters. There are welcome sightings of Menolly, Masterharper Robinton, Jaxom & the white dragon Ruth, F'lar and Lessa, and even of Aivas. And, if you're a fan of Jayge and Aramina fromThe Renegades of Pern (Dragonriders of Pern Series)(I'm not), well, they're here, too. Be warned, however, that Aramina comes off as unlikeable here. THE DOLPHINS OF PERN at first runs concurrent with the historic events in ALL THE WEYRS OF PERN, but then eventually moves three years beyond. So, for those who've wondered at the immediate impact of the Aivas years, this book does the job. In fact, one benefit of the overlapping of stories is that we get to see the stunned reactions of the Paradise River residents toward a tragedy which happens in the final pages of ALL THE WEYRS OF PERN.There's also an annoying subplot involving Lord Toric, a recurring character throughout the Pern series who forever is conniving up ways to snap up more land and more power. Here, he's up to his old tricks and the Dragonriders of Pern have to once again stomp on him good and hard. Betcha Toric doesn't learn his lesson...THE DOLPHINS OF PERN is a good read, and, if you're into dolphins, it's a damn good read. McCaffrey portrays them as intelligent and playful and cute as hell. If these sea creatures don't win you over, then you just may be dead inside. McCaffrey also does well to show the doubts and even dismissal felt by the humans regarding the \\"shipfish\\" and their status as a legitimate intelligent life. The telling moment may have been the healer Persellan's cranky conversion as he comes from regarding dolphins as waste-of-time nuisances to finally accepting them as viable patients. It isn't too long before the sea-going folk learn that the dolphins can be summoned via a bell (reviving an old tradition) and thus avail themselves of reports on weather, sea hazards, and the best fishing sites. Dolphins also have sonar, which allows them x-ray capability with which to assist the healer halls. But just as man can now again depend on the dolphins for aid and information, it's a reciprocal deal. The dolphins also have their needs and, thru the same bell, can now also call on man.The book has a natural, episodic feel. Even though the reader is aware of the all consuming project to rid Pern of Thread, it's a plot that isn't central to the main storyline. So, with regards to the dolphins, there isn't one specific, overwhelming jeopardy to get your juices flowing. There is, however, a monster of a storm which disastrously affects the coasts of Pern and inadvertently puts Readis on a life-changing path.Anne McCaffrey knows how to entertain you, knows how to warm your heart. The plight of the dolphins and the sheer span with which they've kept faith and went about their duties to man - if that doesn't smack you in your emotional core, well, again, I'm pulling the \\"dead inside\\" card. McCaffrey is such a natural storyteller that I ate up even her description of the characters' day-to-day minutiae. The leading characters are ones we're not that familiar with, going into the story. McCaffrey has written of Alemi and little Readis before, although not in great detail. T'lion is a new character. Personally, I found myself liking the unassuming Alemi and T'lion, especially T'lion, whose personal conflicts involve his untested status (he's too young to fight Thread) and his jealous older dragonrider of a brother (T'lion had impressed a bronze, his brother a mere brown). I'm mostly lukewarm towards Readis, who, to me, just isn't that interesting. And, concerning his act of rebellion, Menolly did that first, and a long time ago. However, my favorite new character here is Theresa, who doesn't appear until the book's almost over. But she sure has a presence about her..."},{"Title":"The Dolphins of Pern","review":"The \\"shipfish\\" are the dolphins of pern and they once helped they once accompanied the earlierest settlers of pern. Altough he child (Readis) who is not understood by his parents is reminiscent of Menolly's story, there's so much to like. I just wish there was more about the dolphins and less about Readis. Pern also has changed a lot in this book and what I think made Pern interesting is how people interacted and were dependant upon each other though the re-discovery of the dolphins and the events that take place after-ward will keep your eyes glued to the page."},{"Title":"The Dolphins of Pern","review":"Child wants to follow dream, is stifled by overbearing parent, has a serious injury, runs away from home, finds a cave, meets up with critters. Sound familiar? Sounds exactly like the plot of Dragon Song doesn't it. I was very disappointed. I love this series of books and the world of Pern, but I recommend you save your money and not purchase this book."},{"Title":"The Dolphins of Pern","review":"Dolphins of Pern was a very enjoyable read. All the favorite people are back and again you are transported to the beautiful Pern. This is a good bridging book in that is picks up right after Renegades, and then parallels All the Weyrs of Pern and then goes on a bit farther.I had only two problems with this book. One was Aramina. How did she go from being the poor abused lovely heroine in Renegades to being the shrewish &quot;female-Janus&quot; in Dolphins? Did she go and take lessons from Menolly's parents on how to be an evil person?My other problem was the feeling that on page 360, Anne must have looked up at her clock, realized what time it was and decided to get the book done with NOW! The last few pages read like &quot;and all the people had a change of heart, and all dreams come true, and everyone joins together in a happy party and everyone lives happily ever after.&quot;Personally I feel that it would have been better to have ended the book when Readis walked out. Anne could then have picked up the story in another book and given some more details instead of the way it was hurried over in the last few pages.I would have loved to have given this all five stars. but the ending was so rushed and glossed over that I can only give it four."},{"Title":"The Dolphins of Pern","review":"Anne McCaffrey's Dragonriders of Pern series has always been one of my favorites. But this is no Dragonflight! The Dolphins of Pern is by far the worst Dragonrider book, with some of the least appealing characters. If I read about that kid Readis whining one more time I may just rip the book up. HOWEVER, this book does provide more insight into Pernese history (ie the dolphins), and some parts were quite enjoyable. But if you are new to the series, start with Dragonflight or Dragonsong--this will have no relevance to you if you have not read others of the series"},{"Title":"Laughter and Tears: The Emotional Life of New Mothers","review":"This book tells in realistic and compassionate detail (from a credible medical and psychological expert) what new mothers are sometimes embarassed or ashamed to admit was their experience. It celebrates the highs of motherhood and reminds the new mother of everything she has truly acomplished. Even if you are not having any ambivalence or stress from becoming a new mother, this book gives a wonderful and understanding portrait of what these early weeks and months are like."},{"Title":"Laughter and Tears: The Emotional Life of New Mothers","review":"The stories were comforting to me. They were grounding and I enjoyed reading this before and after pregnancy. It is a good new-parent book."},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"I'm afraid that I have to agree with the minority here - I can't understand what everyone else is raving about. I just wanted to scream, \\"Hey, Kathleen, get a good shrink, a prescription for a huge bottle of Prozac and get a life!\\" What a depressed and self-absorbed character. It took the author over 500 pages to tell a story that lasted a little over one week in her pathetic, melancholy life. The only parts of interest were the main character's attempts at writing a love story about some long ago Irish residents. Unfortunately, she became so absorbed in their fictional lives when she should have been dealing with repairing her own sad life (which she made an attempt at in the last twenty pages or so). Ultimately, their story, too, was filled with sadness. The author's frequent flashbacks and references to memories left me confused at times (she jumped all over a two hundred year period) and the lacking of quotation marks made the flow of conversation difficult to follow at times.I did manage to finish the book with the hope of learning more of the great potato famine (which I did to some extent), but it will not become a part of my personal library. Hey Kathleen, get some Prozac!"},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"When I first began reading this book, I was really drawn in. I thought some of the thoughts expressed were really profound and, being an American, I found the British/Irish conflict angle to be very interesting. I also love historical stories about how people felt and acted in a different age. But then I began to realize that this woman hops into bed with a man, any man who comes along, all in the space of about 2 hours or so. I am no prude, but I found this rather extreme (and I'm 15 years younger than this character). I also thought she didn't use very effective problem solving skills and ends up making a lot of her own problems, which makes for frustrating reading. I did finish the book, mainly because I wanted to find out how the historical aspect came out, but I can't recommend it to anyone else."},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"If you like books about extremely self-absorbed people wondering why their lives are so meaningless, this is the book for you. I kept looking for a transformation in Kathleen, but as she jumped from her landlord's bed to many more, she only remained the Irish tramp so stereotyped in England. O'Faolin's historical narrative detailing the famine was fairly good. I finished the book but it was really a waste of time."},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"The only interesting thing about this book is the information about the famine. If that is of interest to you, I would suggest reading about it elsewhere. This book is too much muck to slog through to find few bits of historical information. The main character has no redeeming qualities and the self pity is enough to put you over the edge. I don't have a clue why this book was written or published. If you do give it a try and keep thinking it will get better, give up on it, it only gets worse."},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"I bought &quot;My Dream of You&quot; because the advertisement that I read described it as an historical novel that takes place in Ireland. I am making a trip to Ireland and thought it would be good preparation. I was greatly disappointed. There is only a smattering of Irish history in it, and what is there is strictly secondary to the &quot;soap opera&quot; that is the rest of the book. It was O.K. pool side reading but for me, that was about it. Wish I'd waited for the paperback!"},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"This book was a huge disappointment. The book is told in the first person by &quot;Kathleen&quot;. Kathleen does nothing but complain, rethink her life over the last fifty years, and whine about Ireland. You read the whole book thinking that at the end she is going to come to a huge realization about herself, and it never happens. The second story in the story also has the same type ending. By the end of the book you just want to tell this woman to get a life, but then again that is what she is lamenting about. I wish I could get back the several hours I spent reading it!"},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"I've often wondered why people found a fat, brainless, rude, emotionally abusive and bigoted man named Archie Bunker so amusing. I could never watch 'All in the Family' for more than 2 minutes. But millions did and it shouldn't surprise me that there are so many glorious recommendations for this book. The main character is so self-absorbed in her pathetic, empty and immoral life. I tried reading this book for my book club but had to stop about half way through. This book is torture and a complete waste of time. Maybe it's that Archie Bunker syndrome that there are so many people out there who really enjoy the idea that someone else's life is as bad if not worse than theirs."},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"&quot;What happened to me?''-Nuala O'Faolain, Are You Somebody ? : The Accidental Memoir of a Dublin WomanThis was, without a doubt, the most depressing, anti-human book I've ever read (well, actually, listened to). Kathleen de Burca, a travel writer, has fled an unhappy childhood in her native Ireland, only to find an unhappy adulthood in England. She has almost no friends and seems never to have loved or been loved. Instead she engages in innumerable casual couplings, fueled by nothing but physical desire :I believed in passion the way other people believed in God: everything fell in place around it.But now, as she approaches fifty, she faces the possibility that even this sexual consolation will dry up :But then I thought, Isn't it some kindof good, that a person can be shocked into truthfulness, even if it's only for afew hours and only with herself? I sat in the thick night air of the plane and Ithought, If anyone had said to you, all these years, are you interested in sex?you'd have said, haughtily, No. I'm interested in passion. Passion. I murmuredthe word half out loud. What passion? It was never real excitement that got youinto bed; it was hope, like some stubborn underground weed. Look at the wayyou've believed every time, at the first brush of a hand across a breast, that theroof over your life was sliding back and a dazzling, starry firmament was justcoming into view. When it never happened. When a one-night stand has never,in all the years, done what you wanted it to do. What's more, the whole thing isgetting more and more pathetic. The truth is, I said to myself, that the older youget, the more grateful you are for being wanted on any terms, by anybody.But if I stopped all that, how would I ever meet anyone? If I didn't have thiskind of sex life, I'd have none! Then I thought, But should it even be called sex?Look at the businessman in Harare. You're not even giving them any pleasureanymore, never mind getting any for yourself.Pathetic ? Pathetic doesn't even begin to cover it, sweetie.Finally becoming dissatisfied with her utterly meaningless existence, and shocked out of her torpor by the death of a gay male coworker, Kathleen returns to Ireland. But things go no better there as she squabbles with sisters, gets involved with a married man, and rages against the country's anti-abortion laws. Apparently, the lot of Ireland's universally unhappy women would be infinitely better if only they could terminate their unwanted pregnancies. In fact, it's not merely the children who are wrecking their lives, I lost track of how many women in the book have some kind of disease of the womb; their very womanhood is killing them. A whole lot of other nonsense goes on, but by then I plunged deep into a suicidal fugue state...Lest you think I'm overstating the case here, allow me to submit in my defense this quote from a profile of O'Faolain in The Guardian :'I can't wait to be an old lady,' she says. 'I'm dying to wither up so I can stop hurting.'For God's sake, someone put the old girl out of her misery, or at the very least out of ours. This one has Oprah Book Club written all over it.GRADE : D"},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"I simply could not find anything sympathetic about the main character in this book. She is an irritating, self-centered, and immoral woman who created her own empty life and then whined about it. The book held flashes of interest when it dealt with the secondary story about the Famine love affair. Much of the conversation in the book is stilted. I love current Irish fiction and non-fiction, and there are much better examples of the fine writing now coming from Ireland than this novel."},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"Part shocking history, part sexual odyssey, all lyrical prose, Dublin journalist Nuala O'Faolain's first fiction is stunning as she interweaves past and present in parallel stories of two women seeking fulfillment.Ms. O'Faolain's bestselling memoir, &quot;Are You Somebody?,&quot; won accolades for its utter honesty and brilliant craftsmanship. These attributes shine as brightly in &quot;My Dream Of You.&quot;Kathleen de Burca, an unmarried 50+ travel writer is a woman who &quot;believed in passion the way other people believed in God; everything fell into place around it.&quot;Yet to date her life has been a series of meaningless, rueful-in-the-morning liaisons. Compounding her unhappiness is the sudden death of her best friend, Jimmy, a gay fellow writer.Hoping to begin anew, Kathleen takes a leave of absence and returns to her native Ireland. Memories of her homeland are disheartening. She recalls her mother as oppressed and the children as &quot;neglected victims of her victimhood. Villain? Father. Old-style Irish Catholic patriarch; unkind to wife, unloving to children, harsh to young Kathleen when she tried to talk to him.&quot;Nonetheless, Kathleen wants &quot;....my life given back to me, so I can live it again better.&quot; She has become fascinated by the Talbot affair, an actual event which took place during the Potato Famine, some 150 years ago. According to records, Marianne Talbot, the wife of an Anglo-Irish landowner, was seen by servants en deshabille with William Mullan, a stableman.&quot;There could hardly have been two people less likely to be drawn to each other than an Anglo-Irish landlord's wife and an Irish servant,&quot; Ms. O'Faolain writes. &quot;Each of them came from a powerful culture which had at its very core the defining of the other as alien.&quot;Intrigued by the disparity between the apparent lovers and the fact that Marianne is found guilty of adultery, Kathleen determines to write their story.She travels to Ballygall, site of the former Talbot estate, where she is aided in her research by Miss Leech, a feisty spinster librarian; and cosseted by Bertie, a widowed inn owner.As Kathleen delves into the past readers are reminded of the grim devastation wrought by the Famine. Those were days when the still living &quot;had to open the pit in the top field to push in more bodies,&quot; and Marianne could hear through her drawing room window the cries for food, when &quot;the low noise of pleading and begging swelled to shrieking.&quot;Surely few have painted the Famine's stark reality as movingly as Ms. O'Faolain. Her descriptions constrict the heart, enabling readers to see anew a mortally wounded country and its people.As Kathleen unearths surprising data about the Talbot scandal, she also discovers some truths about herself. It's at this juncture that she finds another opportunity for romance, but at what price?With &quot;My Dream Of You&quot; Ms. O'Faolain clearly shows that she is not only a deft memoirist, but a brilliant storyteller, a keen observer of humankind, and a compassionate chronicler of a still present past."},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"The title of this book might lead you to think that you're in for a good soppy holiday romance, and that's exactly what I thought I was buying as I headed off to the sun. Very quickly into My Dream of You, I realised that I had lucked onto something far more sophisticated and special. What a great book. The main character of the book, Kathleen, finds her life rocked after the death of her closest friend. Unsure of how to proceed with her life she throws herself into a project of investigating an ancient Irish love affair and in the process finds herself discovering some truths about herself. A gripping read - lets hope Nuala O'Faolain writes a second novel."},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"A phrase you see on a lot of back-cover-blurbs is that a book is like &quot;Possession.&quot; I've always wondered what that meant -that the novel delivers the same kind of engrossing, teasing literary thrill that A.S. Byatt's novel did, or does it mix a modern tale with one placed in the past? Usually it's the latter, with the touted book offering a disappointing shadow of the satisfaction given by Byatt's book.Nuala O'Faolain charged on the literary scene several years ago with &quot;Are You Somebody?&quot; which intrigued a lot of readers. Her first novel, &quot;My Dream of You&quot; meets everyone's expectations. It is like &quot;Possession&quot; in that it is completely engrossing, teasing, thrilling, moving, and yes, it does include a story rooted in the past. But then, for the Irish, so much is rooted in the past.Kathleen de Burca is a travel writer whose carefully chaotic life is thrown in to real disorder by the loss of her dearest friend and retirement. She goes back to Ireland to research a novel on a story that's always intrigued her about an English lady's alleged affair with her Irish stableman during the Famine. Her return to the country of her birth brings her back to the land of her wretched childhood, but also throws her into a love affair which turns her upside down.The characters are so well drawn that it's hard to believe they're not really in the library or behind the bar or in the shop where Kathleen meets them. Ireland, with its rich, conflictive history and wonderful contrary people comes across in all its complexities. Kathleen's physical and spiritual journey is completely involving, and this book lingers long after you've turned the last page.."},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"Reviews of this book are somewhat mixed, but most acknowledge that Nuala O'Faolain writes so well that even if a reviewer didn't like this, her first novel, there is still an urge to read her nonfiction &quot;Are You Somebody?&quot;After reading and falling in love with &quot;The Red Tent,&quot; I was certain it was unfair to read and review this book set in modern times, with an imperfect female protagonist reluctantly turning 50. But although quite different from the other novel, this is also a story to tenderly love, especially if the reader is a 50-something woman who's made significant mistakes and has often been confused by love, intimacy and family life.At 20, Kathleen fled to London, leaving her dysfunctional family in Ireland. Her distant mother, left behind, with a string of young children, abandons everyone by dying too young, while pregnant. Her father remarries a woman who has no love for any of the children. Sister Nora goes to New York; brother Dan finds solace in drinking but also with his own loving wife and daughter. The youngest child dies of a blood disease. Kathleen is left alone, on her own, separate from the loveless life of the de Burca family.Of course, as she later comes to realize, one never really freely escapes; the attachments and lessens learned from home can follow you forever. She manages to create in her own life a detachment from almost everyone. In her search for love and approval, she destroys her first deep relationship while still in her early 20's. She can't seem to shake off her notion that sex and love are connected, that the former will lead her to the latter. Through her 20's, 30's and 40's she's found it impossible to turn down advances from men who find her very attractive, but not suitable for a long term relationship.She retreats to a basement apartment and a job that requires her to travel from place to place. She alienates herself from her best female friend, from her boss, and from most of her living family but attaches herself into a safely distant friendship with a gay American coworker. When he suddenly drops dead of a heart attack, she is left alone, feeling totally rootless.The novel follows her search for some connection in her life. She turns to the safety of writing about people who lived long ago -- that of an English woman married to an Irish lord who divorces her for adultery. Within the novel, she semi-retires from her job as a travel journalist, goes to Ireland and tries to research and write her own interpretation of what 'really' happened -- but the story changes as she gets more information. She identifies with the woman, and somewhat desperately folds her own hunger for passion into the novel she's writing (making this around the time of the Potato Famine, when many of the Irish starved to death gives us a painful parallel.)Along the way she semi-settles into the life of an Irish family and an aging librarian (managing to stay distant yet feel close), reattaches a little with her brother and his family, and meets and falls in love (through a physical encounter) with a married man, Shay, who falls in love with her, too. In a very true and familiar story for many single women, Shay wants to enjoy their love without disrupting his life with his wife, daughters and grandchildren.The novel within the novel is only slightly distracting toward the end, as Kathleen tries to twist it to fit her own needs (when the evidence is pretty clear about the true story). It would be artificial, I am afraid, to think that at 50, she will radically change, but hope is left at the end that she's heading to some acceptance of herself, of her age, of her life as she has made it (not all bad, not really).Not a light read, very introspective. I loved Kathleen because she is so much like me -- a cynical romantic (can there be such a thing), ever hopeful and yet practical, imperfect, packed with mistakes and flaws, some painfully obvious to others, some painful to herself, and yet ultimately, lovably human.Not for everyone, perhaps best for the empathetic imperfect reader!"},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"&quot;My Dream of You&quot; is a totally honest book, so much so that it hurts to read it. There is not one word that is wasted, there is not one thought that is not so pure, so well described, and so TRUE, that it causes the reader to stop breathing for a moment. O'Faolain's great talent is the way she draws the reader in to worlds that should be alien, but somehow feel familiar, eg, Ireland during the Famine. This talent was evident in her memoirs, and is equally strong in this fictional narrative that I suspect is drawn straight out of her own life. Indeed, it matches her memoirs in many aspects, and it is hard to remember that this is only a story. O'Faolain skillfully weaves together two narratives in this book--one tragic love story from the time of the Famine, and one very modern tale of a woman trying to come to grips with aging and all that implies, from the terror of losing her sexuality to the fear, felt for the first time, of being alone. The plot is secondary to the inner thoughts of this incredibly strong and independent woman, Kathleen, as she faces her own inner weaknesses. This is a book well worth reading, and keeping. It is one that I read very slowly, in order to savor every word."},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"My Dream of You is the best novel I have read in such a long while. It reminds me of Ellen Gilchrist at her wildest and most inventive, except this writer is Irish, not Southern. But she made me laugh, often, and run to read passages aloud, and I cried more than once, and through it all I was amazed at how much wholeness O' Faolain puts down in black and white, how much tenderness and anguish and forgiveness and layers under layers of buried secret griefs. I hope Nuala O'Faolain reads this because I say: Keats and Rilke would be proud. I finished the last 300 pages this Sunday in one sitting. I couldn't stop reading. Beautiful, fantastic NOVEL. Brilliantly, splendidly written. Thank you."},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"Kathleen De Burca is a thoroughly modern woman living in London. She is nearing 50, but she is still quite attractive, takes care of her body and wears designer clothes. She has roamed the world as a travel writer, eaten in the best restaurants, stayed at elite hotels, and had numerous lovers. To Kathleen, life is about the pursuit of passion and passion equals love. Kathleen will do almost anything in that pursuit, a sort of means justify the ends, even if it hurts other people and herself. Yet real love has still eluded her. She is not sure whether it is the last travel assignment in Manila where she sees children with a baby in the road that puts her off travel writing, but for sure, the sudden death of her best friend and colleague, Jimmy, signals a wake-up call.Finally feeling that she has finally hit rock bottom, Kathleen decides to give up travel writing and go back to her native Ireland, which she ran from twenty years before and never looked back. The purpose is not to stay or reunite with her family she tells herself, but to research a real nineteenth century Irish scandal, that had come to her attention years before - a love affair between a member of the gentry (the Talbots) and her Irish groom, that resulted in a tragic divorce and the loss of her child. There are a lot of unanswered questions in Kathleen's mind about the case.Kathleen travels to Ballygall, in remote Western Ireland, the lands of the former Talbots. She begins her research but becomes more and more intrigued by the history of the potato famine of 1848 and wonders at the connection to the 1849 scandal.As if this were not enough, fate draws Kathleen into an unexpected affair, but this time it is real love and she is going to have to make difficult choices. That and her being back on Irish soil and researching the scandal, force her to look back on her life and face painful truths.This is a large menu and in much less skillful hands it may have failed, but in the hands of Nuala O'Faolain, it is a triumph. As Kathleen asks the tough questions, we the readers are always one step ahead or one step right after her anticipating and asking also.This is too good a story to spoil, so I won't tell you the outcome, but as the two stories intertwine, Marianne Talbot's and Kathleen's, we find out that life is much more complicated than it seems and that there are no easy answers. The story is spellbinding and heroic, gorgeously written, full of constant surprises. If you have one novel to read this year, make it this one!"},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"An elegantly composed symphony of passion and emotion. A coming of age in middle age book. A historical novel. A story of a hard scrabble traditional Irish Family, melding into the present day. Coming to terms with the sudden death of a companion, a middle aged Irish immigrant heads back to Ireland, to solve a 150 year old mystery of passion. Along the way, her own personal mysteries begin to unravel. An amazingly candid look at mid-life, romance, where we come from and what it makes and takes of us. As well as a picturesque vision of Ireland juxtaposed against the unglamourous and merciless Ireland of the potato famine and religious oppression. A fascinating and utterly bewitching story that will stay with me always. Some of the best writing I have ever encountered."},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"I picked up this book on a recent trip to Ireland, mostly to occupy my time while waiting for buses -- but instead, once I started reading it, I could hardly put it down. I'd already read her nonfiction &quot;Are You Somebody,&quot; and some of the same themes and characters reappear here, but she's woven them so effectively into the story that they don't seem intrusive. I found the narrator inherently interesting because I'm a woman of about the same age who grew up in a partly-Irish Catholic family. I feel that the main character is an accurate embodiment of the mind-set inculcated into many women of our generation and background: a woman's role in life is to love and be loved, and to serve others selflessly; and if your life isn't everything you want it to be when you reach middle age, it's ALL YOUR FAULT for not living up to the womanly ideal. Intense self-examination is part of the process of dealing with this (&quot;Where did I go wrong?&quot;); denial is part of it too, and the main character's ruthless analysis of her illusions and self-destructive behavior patterns was, I felt, admirably done. The 18th-century tragic romance woven into the story is touching in its own right, but it also reflects (in melodramatic exaggeration) the narrator's thought processes and emotional states. What I found most engaging about the book was the characters: the author has a facility for depicting memorable personalities, and everyone -- from the narrator's family and friends, to the supporting characters in the imbedded story -- was vividly described, both physically and mentally. I didn't feel that the ending was &quot;inconclusive&quot;: the narrator has come to a better understanding of her own behavior, rejected yet another emotional &quot;dead end,&quot; and engaged in a selfless act of friendship that has the potential to turn into something more, so she's definitely matured in the course of the story. All in all, I found the book highly satisfying, and I look forward to more fiction from O Faolain."},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"My Dream of You is one of the most best books that I've read this year. It's the intensely-felt, beautifully-written, and deeply-moving story of a brief period in the life of travel writer Kathleen Burke (Caitl&iacute;n de Burca in the Irish), told in unrelentingly-honest first-person narration, during which she examines in minute and searing detail the events of her childhood, youth, and adulthood. In comparing her own life with those of the principals in a scandalous divorce case during the Great Famine years, and in attempting to reconnect with family, friends, and ancestry kept at a distance too long, Kathleen leads the reader step by step through the pain, struggles, and triumph of her fifty years on earth.More than anything else, this is a novel about survival: although millions died during the Famine, the survivors went on to found the Irish nation; although Kathleen's life has been filled (and overflowed at times) with the suffering and the remorse of unexamined fears and misdirected ideals, she has gone on to build a successful career and now, perhaps, will create something true and important in the latter part of her life. O'Faolain's writing is filled with the most perfect of imagery, capturing a room, an innkeeper, a lake in a valley, in just a few well-chosen words.At the end I put my head in my hands and quietly wept--in sympathy, or, more accurately, in cathartic empathy for Kathleen's middle-aged awakening. I can't recommend this book highly-enough: lyrical, contradictory, gritty, poetic, romantic in the deep, deep sense of the word, stinging and scalding and uplifting in turn, Irish to the core. Simply beautiful, with nothing simple about it."},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"Nuala O'Faolain delicately narrates one woman's journey through her own personal transition in the midst of answering questions about an unsolved trial set in Ireland's past. There comes a time where every beautiful and worthy woman must face her dissatisfaction with herself and her life and \\"turn her eyes inward\\". This is what the author does with the main character, Kathleen- a mid-life irish-born beauty with a classic troubled childhood. Her lack of love in her young life leads Kathy through an endless cycle of self-destructive choices in various sexual relations. O'Faolain creates a sympathetic character who makes us wince one moment, as she continually reflects on poorly judged sexual excapades, and the next moment has our heart beating wildly with passion and romanticism. The trial that Kathy has taken upon herself to unearth and and piece together only serves as a tool to help Kathy peel away the several layers of her own self. Gently written with lots of genuine characters, I feel this novel is a good read for any woman, young or old, who ever felt less than what she's really worth: in love, in family, and in life."},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"Kathleen DeBurca is on a quest, or rather on simultaneous quests. One is to come to terms with her lonely life, the other is to solve the mystery surrounding the divorce of Lord Talbot from his adulteress wife during the latter 1800's.The setting is Ireland and its tumultuous history during and post the famine years. Kathleen leads the willing reader to a number of possible scenarios concerning the infamous divorce. Was his Lordships's wife innocent, a schemer, wronged and lonely, or cunning?Kathleen meets a cast of charming characters in the village to which she travels and holes up as she tries to unfathom the answers to her historical mystery. Documents are discovered by the local librarian (another charming addition to the multiple-layered tale) in the village's library that allows Kathleen to change her estimation of Lady Talbot; then still more is discovered and the possible scenarios change again!The story is peeled away layer upon layer and it's easy for the reader to wish Kathleen would \\"get on with it\\" when it comes to her own personal dilemmas, so that the Talbot plot can be once again re-entered and solved. But it is because of the episodic \\"finds\\" in the local town that the tale remains intriguing to the end.A fine read!"},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"I'm only halfway through this book, and the title for my review pretty much sums up my impressions. O'Faolain describes things beautifully. But I am completely exhausted with the main character's lack of character and obsessive self-reflection. Perhaps it is a generational thing (Gen X here), but I find her VERY difficult to relate to. Perhaps she'll find some personality by the end of the book, but I'm pretty much just hanging on in hopes that she grows a pair. (Tongue firmly in cheek.)"},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"One recent afternoon, whilst browsing in my neighborhood bookshop, this novel's enchantingly lovely jacket cover caught my eye. The description it bore - a story of loneliness and passion, delved within another story of loneliness and passion - seemed exactly fitting to what I'd longed to be reading at that moment. I therefore immediately procured it, took it home, and immersed myself within.I quickly found that though this wasn't the riveting, can't-put-it-down kind of read I'd been counting on, it certainly was an endearing one. Nuala O'Faolain's writing has a richly textured, yet somehow quiet quality about it, that tends to draw one intimately into the story.Kathleen de Burca is an expatriate Irishwoman on the brink of 50, who's been living in a London basement apartment and employed as a travel writer for over two decades. She's estranged from her family, and her work colleagues are her closest intimate friends. When her best friend suddenly dies, she is not only slapped full in the face with a grief she has never before known, but confronted also with the devastating realization that she is truly and utterly alone, and that her present course precludes that she will be so for the remainder of her life.Kathleen never does come right out and say it, but the terror and despair she feels is palpable. So she packs up and moves out of her basement apartment (and I must herein state that even though I applauded Kathleen's decision, I felt terribly sorry for &quot;Next Door's Cat,&quot; with whom she had shared many of her dinners). She then takes indefinite leave from her job to journey back to Ireland to investigate a divorce case from a century-and-a-half ago, which occurred toward the end of the Irish Potato Famine: a case which had fascinated her ever since she had learnt of it while in her mid-20's.The divorce case involves an affair between the English wife of an Irish landlord and their Irish servant -- and what makes the case so fascinating, at least to Kathleen is, in her words: &quot;I was interested, always, in any story about passion, so I was interested in Mrs. Talbot and William Mullan. I believed in passion the way other people believed in God: everything fell into place around it. Even before I started mooching around after boys when I was fourteen, I'd understood, watching my mother, that passion was the name of the thing she was pursuing, as she trawled through novel after novel. And it was extraordinary to me that the Talbot affair happened when it did- just after the very worst year of the potato famine.&quot;In Ireland, Kathleen stays with an earthy and agreeable Irish family, and makes friends with a few of the local personalities. Her past is deeply painful, and it keeps creeping into her thoughts. She briefly visits her brother and his wife and child, who are the only family she has left in Ireland; then she meets a married man, and finally gets a taste of the passion she'd been barren of for so many years. Meantime, she's fleshing out her story of the Talbot affair, but in the end her discoveries are not only rare and hard to come by, but are actually materializing into something quite bleak. Her depictions of the massive devastation caused by the famine are, in fact, some of the most shocking and heart-wrenching passages I've ever read.In the end, it's essentially Kathleen discovering Herself, and in the very essence of that word: she discovers her past, her family, her heritage, her country, her regrets, her longings, her failings, and even her own unique beauty. The factual lives of Marianne Talbot and William Mullan may remain forever shrouded in mystery - for it's most likely that their affair never even took place - but their starving ghosts certainly embody vivid life in O'Faolain's writing:&quot;The habitat of their passion, where they roamed like two animals on a great plain, was silence. Not perfect silence-- there were always the sounds of the household and sounds coming in from the estate. Sheep, penned in a front yard. The creak of turf carts coming in from the bog. But the couple were habitually mute. Except that they panted and grunted when they forgot themselves in each other. Then afterwards there was peace, and silence again. And after that, she lived in a hot dream of him.&quot;"},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"This is a beautifully written book that everyone can relate to. Nuala O'Faolain takes us into 50 year old Kathleen's life and her search for love, knowledge, and forgivness. By interweaving two different faiths in two different times, O'Faolain takes readers on a captivation journey and sometimes causes you to pause and take a look at your own life."},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"\\"My Dream of You\\" is the story of two lives, the pitiable Marianne Talbot of Ireland in the 1850's, whose husband divorces her for infidelity, and Caitlin de Burca, a 50-ish modern travel writer who returns to write Marianne's story but instead embarks on a review of her life. This is a book I should have loved, but instead I just wanted to shake Caitlin (Kathleen) and tell her to get a life! As a young woman she destroys her life with her lover by blatant promiscuity with his housemate, and with the janitor at work on the side. From then on she sleeps with anything that walks, while pretending to be in search of passion. The only person she never sleeps with is her friend Jimmy, and he becomes the only person she loves and trusts. Kathleen's unlikeable sister Nora repeatedly tells her she needs a shrink, and I couldn't agree more.The plot was equally silly. Kathleen goes to Ballygall, where Marianne lived, and immediately becomes best friends with a local innkeeper, who sets her up in two beautiful houses. She spends two days trying to research her story, and finding little she immediately starts complaining that Ireland is \\"too hard.\\" She then writes a fictional account of Marianne's story in about 3 days, work that would take a real writer months. In the meantime she rehearses in her mind her terrible childhood, that included everything from an abusive father to a vague and ineffective mother who dies from cancer and a miscarriage to a little brother dying at the age of 6. Along the way she meets what she thinks is the true love of her life, a married, barely literate landscaper, deals with her boss Alex' breakdown, visits a brother whom she has not seen in years, and relives every moment of her life. All this in perhaps 2, not more than 3, weeks.So why did I bother? O'Faolain shows her talent in her wonderful descriptions of the Irish lanscape and brings the famine of the 1850's alive. I never realized the devastation, made worse by the English landlords who threw people off the land as they were dying. A whole generation left for America and never came back. As England built her empire, the Irish were dying in droves right across the water.I know this was O'Faolain's first novel--she shows promise, but that's all. This book is most definitely not like \\"Possession\\"--this novel is a fairly trashy soap opera set in an incredibly interesting land and historical period."},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"This book is one of the most beautifully written that I have read since reading &quot;Well of Loneliness&quot; when I was in junior high. The incredible sense of honesty that was achieved by delving into the deepness of her soul left me stunned and captivated. She is truly gifted in her portrayal of the emotional wreckage of her parent's marriage and how it affected her life and the life of her siblings. This book has to be read by every woman who has ever sought real love and was not able to find it. I wouldn't recommend it as a good read for men because I don't think they would like it. It is a woman's book and the best of the best as far as I know."},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"I'm not ready to write a review of this book, although I am full of opinions, but as for now, I just want to know about this current trend of leaving out quotation marks. I gave up on Cold Mountain for this reason, and I was sorry after I bought \\"My Dream of You\\" when I realized she does this also. I have struggled through it because I have had to reread many passages when I realized it wasn't her thoughts, but someone speaking. What is the reason for this? Why is this considered acceptable?"},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"Nuala O'Faolain combines a gripping yarn about an extramarital affair on an Anglo-Irish estate immediately following the great famine of the 1840's with a soul-searching quest undertaken by a contemporary travel writer; the latter is unquestionably a thinly disguised fictional version of herself. &quot;My Dream Of You&quot; may not set new literary standards in women's fiction, but it deserves recognition for its spellbinding, lyrical prose. Those who were captivated by O'Faolain's memoir &quot;Are You Somebody&quot; will enjoy this novel. But those interested in two gripping tales woven successfully together may find it a less interesting, and occasionally tedious, read. The best parts of this novel are devoted to the early 1850's affair; unfortunately I did not find as compelling, the saga of travel writer Kathleen de Burca."},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"The characters seemed flat, one dimensional for the first 300 plus pages.I couldn't get myself to care about them. Much of the narrative in those pages seemed to me extraneous to the book. Only the last 100 plus pages held some interest. Had I not been reading this as my book club's choice I would have put it down after the first 50 pages."},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"bravo to O'Faolain for creating a \\"middle-aged\\" woman (main character is turning 50) who's neither sexless, a spinster in a little hat, nor in any other way made cute and cuddly.I was fascinated by the main character's journey-- she goes back to Ireland, having lived in England for a long time and worked as a travel writer, after a dear friend dies. There she tries to discover the mystery behind an old aristocratic scandal, and begins a novel as part of the process, and begins an affair with a married man. Along the way we see glimpses into her full but ultimately empty love-life, and cheer her on as she makes, ultimately, a difficult and painful decision.O'Faolain's prose is beautiful without being self-conscious. She writes of a cat having touched the main character \\"with one plush paw\\" and I've never forgotten it. The longing and the vividness behind that description have stayed with me. Similarly an observation about the kinds of kisses that don't leave you pretty struck me hard. Wonderful dialogue and vivid characters, too.A surprisingly quick read for a thick book. An Irish friend read it on my recommendation and enjoyed it but thought at times it seemed a little Bridget Jones-like. It is, in a way-- Bridget Jones at 50, with a more somber and serious outlook than Bridge ever had. When I finished this book, I felt I had been to Ireland and had lived some of her life. One of the best reads of 2002, for me."},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"I actually bought this book because of the cover, it's really beautiful. And then I discovered that the writing was as well. It took me a while to get into the book, but once I was over a hundred pages into it, I became totally intrigued. First of all, I love the way the author descibes Ireland, how beautiful it is, how scenic. And I love the details about the Famine, and how the author weaves past and present together in the text. This story is about a woman who finally decides to confront her past, and who opens herself up after staying closed off to people and to herself for so long. It's an engaging and vibrant story, the characters are real and alive, and the setting (London and then Ireland) is richly described. I highly recommend this book, not only is it a beautiful story, but it also has a lot of history in it, so that you can learn about the Famine and Ireland as well, well at the same time get deep into the heart of the story."},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"For some insane reason I am drawn to stories that take place in Ireland and surrounding areas. Our main character is still looking for herself, but it's not until her dear friend ,Jimmy, dies that she is forced to return to her homeland and forced to return to herself. Geez...maybe it's because I am in my mid-forties that I am able to relate to some of Kathleen's, well, I know it isn't a word, but Kathleen's pure, unabashed &quot;lostness&quot;!! She really has nobody but herself and she knows it. Her return to her home, her desire to see her actual town, her relationship with her dear brother and her young dead brother, well, she's on a mission. What a wonderful....hated to see it end book."},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"This was a wonderful book. It's not a quick read; some of the passages tend to drag a bit. However, it is quite reflective and thought provoking. There were many passages I would have to ponder for a bit before I could return to the book -- some which made me feel like I needed a nap afterwards to recover.Kathleen is at the same time lovable and pathetic and annoying. Some of her qualities make her an unlikely heroine, but the reader can't help but wish her the best."},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"Just like her first book, Are You Somebody?, this book is an easy read that is both comforting and entertaining. I love the way O'Faolain writes and how she keeps passion and love in the center of her books. It is a touching and personal book about a woman trying to figure out the mystery of love. A great book to keep by bedside."},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"I did not expect to find &quot;My Dream of You&quot; to be such a critical read for women of any age and any culture! The author is able to mix past and present into a suspenseful and meaningful account of what it means to be Irish, what it means to be a woman and what it means to approach middle-age. I enjoyed her use of flashbacks to weave together the story of her main character and the story of two &quot;star-crossed&quot; lovers during the Famine. Above all, &quot;My Dream of You&quot; is an examination of passion in many different lights. What drives someone from their homeland? What pushes us to choose a career over family? What draws two people together as powerfully as it can tear them apart? Can passion last? What personal sacrifices are we willing to accept in order to sustain it?Do not be mistaken - this is not a novel just for middle-aged women! As someone who just turned 30, I found a lot of Nuala's insights to be just as relevant in my life as hers. I also don't believe it is solely a woman's novel. When I shared some excerpts with my Irish boyfriend, he found it to be a telling account of Irish life, past and present, male and female."},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"I'm a big O'Faolain fan, but this book suffered by being way too long. I found the plot to drag, our heroine living a life a bit too surrealistic, and no all-absorbing element to suck the reader in and keep her/him reading. Being cheated on the Talbot story was perhaps O'Faolain's biggest crime! This was built up to be a pivotal part of the plot, but was never delivered. I was disappointed by this latest, but hope that others find it better than I did. Try Thomas Moran's _Water, Carry Me_ if you're looking for a great Irish romance with enough twist to keep you turning pages."},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"If you like Dickensian characters, brilliant writing, smart and sympathetic situations, etc., visiting other countries via reading, this is a must read. It, along with Pat Conroy's literature, is one of my all time favorites. It's an absolute keeper -- there are not enough stars to rate this book appropriately! Buy it, relish it..."},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"A beautifully written novel, with skillfully intertwined personal and cultural histories, Nuala O'Faolain's \\"My Dream of You\\" tells the age-old story of a highly accomplished and successful woman who has missed out on the mysteries of family and home. However, instead of steering us to empathize with the main character, O'Faolain keeps pointing at her crippling selfishness and horrendous choices. Just as Frank McCourt explains the Irish psyche by painting a picture of his impossible conditions in childhood, O'Faolain explores her characters in the context of hunger and desperation. We assume that an emotionally hungry person would welcome regular nourishment, but ironically O'Faolain's main character behaves in a way that rejects love and emotional connection.When 49-year-old Kathleen DeBurca learns of the death of her old friend Jimmy, she retreats to her apartment for days and, in an effort to keep her mind busy, reads everything in her apartment shelf by shelf. Among the reading was a transcript of the Talbot divorce judgment that occurred in her native Ireland in 1856. Kathleen had come into possession of the transcript years earlier, when she was in love with an English law student. In those fulfilling days, the place she and her lover called home was also the place where their passion thrived.Now, living alone in a dank basement apartment, or traveling to distant destinations as a travel writer, passion was something she experienced apart from her life. Sex was an accommodation she made to an occasional stranger. \\"Sex was a hotel thing. I don't think I'd have liked to disturb the perfect nothingness of where I lived.\\"Reading the judgment now, with its references to Mrs. Talbot's intimacy with an Irish hired hand, has opened up questions about not only Kathleen's personal past, but also the Irish famine as the backdrop of the Talbot adultery. She decides to journey to her homeland to research the case and possibly write a book about it. In Ireland, she faces her past, particularly her guilt about leaving her chronically depressed and dying mother.Kathleen is faced with difficult choices to make, regarding the Talbot story and her own future as a woman, friend, and family member. She can make those decisions based on fictional ideals, or based on the realities of committing to people."},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"I did not love this book. It was very long and often put me to sleep. Having said that, the imagery of Ireland is wonderful, and the mystery of the Talbot affair kept me reading. I wanted to know how that story turned out much more than the story of Kathleen and her lover. Not worth purchasing, perhaps a library read."},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"While I read this book, I was never sure whether or not I liked it or was enjoying it. By the time I finished, I still could not say. But the more I thought about it and discussed it, the lower my opinion of it became.Perhaps I am too young to relate to a story which largely concerns growing older. But a good author should have been able to make me feel some liking, or at least sympathy for the main character. Kathleen wallows in her own unhappiness, does nothing with her life, and will sleep with anything that moves. She feels no regret for any of these things. I just could not sympathize with her or her pursuit of \\"passion\\". While she repeatedly emphasized that she was in search of passion, not sex, I could not but help think that constant infidelity and loose sexual morals are not the way to find any meaningful passion.The 1850s divorce case that Kathleen is researching for her book was interesting, although I never fully understood what happened. O'Faolain should have only written about the divorce case (it says at the beginning of the book that the divorce case really happened) instead of making the reader suffer through Kathleen's boundless misery and self-pity.The one redeeming feature of \\"My Dream of You\\" is the vivid, lush depiction of Ireland's people and places, as well as the discussion of general prejudice against Irish in England. For these elements, I give the book two stars."},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"There is something to be said for a book that really grabs you and keeps you there throughout.

And after all the expenditure about the Talbot case, I expected a little better resolution to that story.Not recommended."},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"This book is a moving account of life in Ireland that covers the troubled consequences of the tragedies of Irish history as visited on 3 separate generations.Kathleen or Caitlin as she is called in Ireland is a real life career woman who faces coming of age at 40+ and who deals with those challenges while exploring their roots in her youth in Ireland. Caitlin deals with loss, love and an uncertain future while pursuing a mystery from 150 years ago that is in itself a good story (and based on actual events). I learned much about Irish history which has given me a perspective of the Anglo-Irish conflict and its enduring legacy.O'Faolain has woven a compelling story on a multitude of levels. Give it a try... you won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"I had a heck of a time getting into this book - about 150 pages I forced myself to read before I got to the point where I actually wanted to continue to read. Maybe it is because I am only 21 and have a difficulty relating to the 50 year old main character. Maybe I don't agree with her values. I have to admit the only thing that's keeping me reading is the silly romance. This one is not going to be a classic. Not a book I'm going to read again. Not a book I recommend purchasing. Go check it out at the library and save yourself the money."},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"I couldn't wait to read this book because I enjoyed Nuala's autobiographal effort so much. I actually found the novel disappointing and almost embarrassing at times. The central character Kathleen is a bit of a dag, whiny, self obsessed, humourless. The other characters just don't come alive somehow. The plot is predictable and plodding. The sex scenes are cringe making. I guess it really lost me when Kathleen's middle aged lover leaves his false teeth on the bed. More detail than I needed, Nuala."},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"I read Ms. O'Faolin's memoir &quot;Are You Somebody?&quot; before picking up &quot;My Dream of You, only to find it was the same grim story recycled and re-packaged as a novel.The story follows a travel writer - who is uninspired by travel -through her various failed relationships, including those she sabatoged herself, to the stage where she is gracelessly aging and grasping for all that life has not handed her on a platter. It seems the best thing about this character is her wardrobe, since for some reason we are given more insight to what brand names hang in her closet than who she might actually be. By the middle of the book you don't care, are just wishing that an editor had been involved in the publishing of this book.I wonder who Ms. O'Faolin WAS dreaming of - it's never really specified, I only know I was dreaming that this irredeemable character would, in the next chapter, or the next, stop whinging, pick herself up out of her morass of self-absorbtion, and give us all a break."},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"MY DREAM OF YOUAUTHOR: Nuala O'FaolainPUBLISHER: Simon &amp; SchusterREVIEWED BY: Barbara RhoadesBOOK REVIEW: If you have a good ear for accents, then there will be no problem with listening to this book. Unfortunately, Dearbhla Molloy, the reader of My Dream Of You, is so good at English and Irish accents that it is extremely hard to hear the words if you are not able to understand these accents to begin with. In fact, she was so good that after listening to one side of the tape, I gave up.The other draw back to this story was that the first half of the tape was spent in such detailed background information that it did not hold my attention. At this point, between not being able to understand what was being read and the drudgery of the detailed background, I lost interest in reading any more.The story, as outlined on the back cover, seemed like it would be a good one. It was about an affair between an Irish servant and the wife of an English landlord. If you can get around the accents and the laborious details in the beginning, this may be a good book."},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"To be honest, I meant to buy her memoir, which I think I would have liked more. The writing is very solid, and the story of Cait's life is interesting, unresolved and delivered in pieces to keep you going. My problem was just that this is not the type of book I read. While I loved identifying with the 50 year old woman who doesn't quite fit in and never has, I have a much harder time with the almost Harlequin sex scenes and the book she is writing about aristocrats and their servants about drove me nuts. Especially, when she was switching chapters between the narrator's story and the book she was writing. All that said, I still think I will pick up her memoir soon."},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"Such a shame- I had hopes for this one. Instead it was drivel. Overwrought, florrid nonsense. Absolutely hated the main character. Full of navel gazing and embarrassing sex scenes."},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"I was eager to read this first novel by the fiercely honest and compassionate author of Are You Somebody? I should warn you that I am drawn to stories about messy human beings who, even in their middle years, have not settled and are still hanging in there and hoping for wisdom and happiness, however that translates to the individual. O'Faolain provides us with a rich cast of characters, many of whom have haunted me long after reading the novel. The author's forte is writing candidly about family relationships, and the De Burca family in My Dream of You is particularly well imagined.O'Faolain's heroine, Kathleen de Burca, is introduced as a woman who has finally realized that she must make some significant changes in her life. She is mourning the sudden death of her beloved colleague and friend, Jimmy. This great loss awakens her to the reality that she is also grieving the disconnection she feels with her surviving family members. And Kathleen is mourning her middle aging and the dearth of passion in her life. She tells us early on, \\"I believed in passion the way other people believed in God:everything fell into place around it.\\" Throughout this novel Kathleen's casual acceptance of sex with anyone who offers is therefore believable, but not always easy to read about. As demeaning as many of the experiences seem in the cold light of words, Kathleen is always ahead of the reader in her hard and often humorous self judgement. It isn't the sex that interests her. It is the hope for Passion. She believes that her life in London has become a dead end and decides to leave a very good job as a travel writer to strike out on her own as a writer of an historical novel based on the Talbot Judgement requiring her to return to Ireland.The return to Ireland and Kathleen's research into the Talbot Judgement and the history of the Ballygall area during the Famine initially lead her to write a passionate and rather torrid imaginary account of the Talbot affair, the novel within this novel. Ireland also brings Kathleen home in the best sense of the expression. Growing up, the child of an angry father and a weak, incapacitated mother caused her to wonder if the Famine, \\"something that had happened more than a hundred years ago, and that was almost forgotten, could have been so terrible that it knocked all the happiness out of people.\\" The engaging cast of characters she encounters while researching the Talbots and the Famine, all help Kathleen to slowly see herself reflected in a more hopeful light. Kathleen De Burca finds the beginnings of an answer to the happiness question. She already knows that hell is a hard place to leave when you know your way around. She discovers that to be especially true concerning the hell of shame and self loathing. It is human nature to attach oneself to an idea and assume that as an identity . Kathleen is a heroine who figures that out and takes a leap, and though the ending is left open, one hopes she has found the self respect that is needed to live wisely and to finally become a person that she can be proud of.I found this book entertaining and agreeably thought provoking. Nuala O'Faolain explores important questions of personal responsibility and the importance of one's history both literally and in the univeral sense. I am in awe of O'Faolain's use of words to paint vivid settings. Kathleen De Burca's travels, her basement flat, the TravelWrite Office, Ballygall, all become real places through O'Faolain's descriptions. You don't just visualize these places. O'Faolain gives you the smell, the sound, and the feel of place. She honors Ireland both past and present with a sensitive reflection of the Famine and of the survivors. Yet this story is universal. Suffering is an unfortunate fact of life. This ambitious tale of a woman's search for happiness reminds us that we must not attach ourselves to suffering. As Kathleen De Burca discovers, forgiveness is necessary to move forward and \\"to see ourselves as precious. Just for having existed!\\""},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"Kathleen de Burca, a single, middle-aged travel writer living alone for twenty years in the same basement flat in London, finds her whole life changing when her closest friend and confidante dies very suddenly. Her loneliness is overpowering, her desire to leave her job and try a new kind of writing is growing, and as she faces the age of fifty without a family or any lover, she remarks soulfully, \\"I have to get old...I have to watch the [irresistible passion] in me dying....This is the hardest thing; and no one warned me.\\"Possessing the court transcript for an adultery trial from the 1850's, Kathleen decides to return to Ireland for the first time since she left home, thirty years before, to look for more information about the case and perhaps to write about it. She is puzzled by the irony that the apparently unrestrained passion of the \\"affair\\" took place during the depths of the Potato Famine, when hundreds of people on her husband's estate perished of hunger, their deaths made even more miserable by their forced evictions from their homes. She is also open to a passion of her own.Kathleen de Burca is an unusual protagonist for a love story by virtue of her age alone, and few women will be able to resist her attempts to find direction for her life, with or without a lover. Skillfully alternating Kathleen de Burca's search for meaning in her own life with her discoveries about Marianne Talbot, the famine, and emigration, O'Faolain creates a flawed and realistic main character trying to find connections within the mess of her life--the Irish roots she has abandoned, friends and lovers she has thoughtlessly hurt, and ill-considered choices she has made.Lush (sometimes too lush) descriptions of the Irish countryside alternate with dry court documents and testimonies, time alternates back and forth across the 150-year time frame, and hunger and passion are seen through the dual points of view of Kathleen de Burca and Marianne Talbot. This is a big, enjoyable story of love and passion as seen by both a young wife and a woman in her 50's, leading to new perspectives and new considerations of their roles in our lives. Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"This is a book where every word and every thought have weight. It is not easy to read, but it is not about easy subjects--families and memories and love and betrayal and truth and history. Kathleen, the narrator here, begins her story crippled in some way be all of these things. If she is certainly not healed byt he end of the book, she is more self-aware and has freed herself to the point where she can allow herself to live in the present, and maybe in the future, instead of always focussing her life and anger on the past. She is a complicated, not necessarily likeable character, but one of the saving graces of her pilgrimage back to Ireland is that she meets up with a succession of people who are able to see through the barricades of her life and give her credit for things she is not able to credit in herself.The historical narrative of the Talbot adultery and divorce trial, set in the time of the famine, when civilization was stripped away so terribly, and Kathleen's retelling of those events, goes through several different versions here. It is clear early on that we will never know the truth of these events, and that is both sad and also tantilizingly provocative, as Kathleen realizes as she lives her own experience through these characters.Some reviewers have compared this book to A. S. Byatt's Possession, which is one of my favorite books. It is, in its weaving of multiple tales and in its prickly, complex characters. Both are books that deserve thought and respect."},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"I bought it for my wife, but it's not just a woman's book. Nuala O'Faolain weaves together the past and present of Kathleen de Burca (herself) with an old marital scandal of an English landlord and his wife from mid-19th century Ireland. In so doing, she connects the reader with his/her own personal and cultural pain and life struggles, causing one to make personal evaluations of life as it is.O'Faolain has a unique ability to weave the story together in a fashion that draws you in. You feel like you know her personally; you feel like you are there. I think that's because she connects us with the pleasures and disappointments and crises we all know and experience in life.It isn't necessary, but one gains additional understanding of Kathleen de Burca by reading O'Faolain's &quot;Are You Somebody&quot; before reading &quot;My Dream of You.&quot;It's not just a woman's book. It's a passionate, soul-searching read. I recommend it."},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"This book starts slow. In fact, it is kind of slow all the way through. However, this fits the novel. Kathleen is a travel writer who has spent her life traveling and hiding from her past. When her best friend Jimmy dies suddenly, Kathleen is left without bearings--no one for her really to turn to in times of trouble. However, she remembers a 150-year old divorce case she read many years ago, and decides to investigate it. Throughout the novel, Kathleen comes to many conclusions about her past, her family and her relationships with men. She comes to these conclusions through her investigation of the Talbot case.I didn't think that I would be able to complete this novel. However, about 1/3 of the way through, I became engrossed in the various stories in the novel, that I couldn't put it down. I would highly recommend this novel, but make sure you give the beginning enough time to resonate within yourself."},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"I was amazed by the variety of reactions to this book of Nuala O'Faolain's, which I found touching, insightful, and full of compassion. Kathleen Burke, the protagonist, is a woman with whom I identify in her search for love and meaning. She only gradually comes to understand why she has made certain choices throughout her life, and often these reasons go back to something in her family relationships. She sounded real to me, a woman of middle age who has begun to realize what lies ahead. As in real life, these flashes of insight come partially and sometimes obscurely. But the emphasis on learning to live actively, to forgive the past (especially one's parents), to make choices that will increase loyalty and friendship, grows steadily firmer in Kathleen and in the reader. The book is written beautifully, especially in its descriptions of countryside. I read the beginning pages on line and was immediately convinced I had to have the entire book. I found it an enriching experience, slow to develop (as life is), not entirely finished, (as life is also), but bringing about a deepening appreciation of how precious is every encounter."},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"Nuala O' Faolain has done something remarkably unusual here. She has written of middle-aged female fears and insecurities--with gusto. Note the photo on the cover, the discomfort of the woman, head angled awkwardly on her hand. In a way, that photo leads right into the main character with her awkwardness and fears, with her continual struggle not to succumb to lonliness. Something is very touching when a woman lets all that we don't say about our advancing years out onto the page. And this too: she, the author/character is generous, generous with her words, her story within a story, her characters, Jimmy especially, herself, whether with others or when alone. Though the book is unweildy in parts, that's fine because it's all of a piece with the subject. I salute her big-hearted work and her larger than life tale, which is not polished and all for the better!"},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"With the skill of an old world craftsman, Nuala O'Faolain creates a story that engages the imagination and soothes the rumpled psyche of this disgruntled reader. It is fresh. The language is deliciously crisp and real. The characters, so startlingly genuine, interact with such ease that I found myself disinclined to stop the tape. Dearblah Malloy narrates this book for audio. Word choice and pronunciation- enunciation- produce the most pleasing sound and bring the story even more to life. One of my favorite things about the book, is the issue of Kathleen's (the main character) sexuality. Her honest and unselfconcious description of longing for, enjoyment of, and dread of living without the most basic of human needs is brilliant. But it is only one of many human interactions she is able to examine so insightfully. It is- a wonderful and wonderfully written book."},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"I read the first chapter of this book online and then knew I had to read the entire book. O'Faolain has created a character that is real and complex. The type of person you'd enjoy to have as a friend. I enjoyed the intertwining of the story of Talbot scandal and Kathleen's own growth and discovery as she returned to Ireland. I believe readers of Maeve Binchy novels would also enjoy this book. Very satisfying."},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"The beginning of this boox was wonderful -- unlike some of the other reviewers, I found the narrative about the Irish Famine fascinating and quite well-written, and then was excited about the prospect of a different kind of historical fiction, along with the critical perspective on travel writing...but the book disintegrates from there. The narrator can't stop thinking and talking about herself. The whole book is fileld with \\"I\\"s that are uneccessary, from a technical viewpoint, and the character/author is so self-obsessed that when her best friend comes to her in a moment of crisis, the author's only response is \\"But she didn't ask me about ME, can you believe it?\\" UGH."},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"A 500+ page book is a huge commitment of time. I had this book on my bookshelf for years, and decided to finally read it. It started strong but lost its way mid-way. Because I was over 200 pages into it, I decided to keep reading. It was a slow read. The portions of the book that related to the Irish Potato Famine were enthralling. However, I found the protagonist to be poorly drawn and her behavior inexplicable--the text never really delved into what made her tick. In the end I came away with the feeling that this book could have used a good editor who would have helped the author decide on her focus and then edit the text down to its appropriate length. This story could have been written in half the pages, and I would not recommend that people commit their time to reading this book because in the end you will come away frustrated and sorry you spent so much time reading a mediocre book."},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"There is some excellent evocative writing in this novel. If only it were properly edited, I would have enjoyed it much more. I would start with the novel within the novel, which just is not very good, with a heroine of little interest. My appreciation of Kathleen, as her life and self-examination unfold, would have been on firmer ground if I were privy, earlier in the book, to the events which led directly to Kathleen fleeing Ireland. The episode between Kathleen and Carole's ex-husband was overkill.Finally, I think Kathleen had enough of a moral sense, at her worst, not to list Shay's being a happy husband as possibly being one of things which made her fall in love with him (p.414); I do understand that if you are seeking a mate, PREVIOUS happiness with a spouse is a positive."},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"My Dream of You is a dissertation on passion: whether found or thwarted. Kathleen is a London travel writer long absorbed in a xerox of a divorce case an ex-lover once gave her. The \\"Talbot\\" divorce case involves the supposedly adulturous affair between the wealthy Marianne Talbot and the lowly groom, William during the aftermath of the Irish Potato famine. Akin to Possession , the story jumps ( seamlessly ) from the present to the early 1850's. The metaphor of famine as a physical and emotional state is pretty astute. Further, the idea of passion starved is fully realized in the old-maidenly narrator, the lonely Kathleen.This book has a twist which makes the one so praised recently in The Thirteenth Tale pale quickly in comparison.I read this brilliant book in one sitting with a cup of tea while watching the snow outside my window. The portrait of the famine was heartbreaking; especially in comparison to the wealthy excess she paints in the ignorant Talbots. More heartbreaking still is the starved existence of Kathleen....who yearns for passion and romance and must revisit a tattered courtcase to live it ( Think The Lonely Passion of Judith Hearn by Brian Moore )."},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"I believe the review fromBridget Rampton \\"muswellhillmum\\" (London, United Kingdom) really says it all very well!"},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this audio book, and so want to share in particular my experience of that. The pacing was excellent and the actress reading the book for the audio presentation was simply wonderful with tone, emphasis, and voice characterizations. It was great to hear such a professional audio presentation. That said, when the initial quest for the narrator's roots gives way to historical research, the writing, although excellent, begs a more specific sort of expose than one finds. I was hoping for a more direct link between the narrator and the expose', from a story-development perspective, and I think this is reflected in other reviewers' remarks. Nevertheless, I found it thoroughly enjoyable, and would recommend it highly for its combination of pure story and enthusiasm for revealing some of the historical secrets of the Irish famine years."},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"It took me some time to read this book. I would read a chapter, put it down and go about doing something else, then pick it up again. At 500+ pages, and densely written, it's not one of those \\"I couldn't put it down\\" books. But Kathleen slowly wound her way into my heart and I read the last 250-odd pages in two nights. O'Faolain writes in so much detail about Kathleen's thoughts and feelings--in a lesser writer,such in-depth description would have been boring and tedious. But O'Faolain's writing is never that. Thought-provoking, especially for someone like myself with ties to Ireland, and the Ireland of the famine. I did find some of the writing about the Talbot Case frustrating in that at first I wasn't sure whether it was Kathleen fictionalizing it or whether it was truly what happened. Perhaps that was deliberate on O'Faolain's part.I would recommend the book to those who enjoy reading a mixture of fact and fiction, who enjoy reading detailed life stories. I certanly did."},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"This is a beautiful story, full of fascinating happenings, bittersweet richness, and of course the Irish Experience, which is a Hallmark of this writer.Nuala O'Faolain is a magnificent writer, and this book makes a grand statement that she can write more than one great book. Her other book \\"Are You Somebody\\" is a masterfully written memoir which is highly recommended, as is this wonderful work."},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"I read this b/c it was a selection for my book club. Initially I thought it was going to be yet another \\"women's interest\\" book, probably (or at least hopefully) an enjoyable read, but nothing of lasting importance to me. Well, I am happy to say, I was very wrong. Oh, this book definitely will appeal mostly to women. But for excellent reason.The narrator, Kathleen de Burca, is a single woman around age 50, who fled Ireland and her family after high school, for an England she could not become completely comforable with. The plot consists of three main story lines:1) the narrator's current trip to Ireland and the circumstances that spurred it, and that arise from it;2) the historical tale the narrator is investigating; and3) the narrator's personal history.Her style and voice are very believable. She's flawed but INCREDIBLY sympathetic. Rather than weak, this strong character is smart and competent. Throughout the book, in the framework of the intertwining plot lines, she faces her past, examines her present, comes to terms with her regrets, and walks forward into her future. The narrator' self-examinations are refreshingly honest, not morbidly piteous, and touched with flashes of humor. For example, after musing about a particular character trait of a friend... \\"I have always appreciated the good in other people, I said to myself, as if to recommend myself to an invisible judge.\\"Themes explored include class, Ireland and the Irish, family, passion/romance/love, friendship, hope, regret, acceptance, forgiveness, and dreams for the future. This book moved me both to laughter and tears, and helped me to feel I am not alone with my own self-doubts.It's hard to know, after all \\"so many books, so little time\\", but I have a feeling my future may hold future revisits to this title."},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"Warning: nothing much happens in this book. It's basically about a 49-year-old woman's mid-life crisis. There's no real plot to speak of -- heroine Kathleen de Burca spends hundreds of pages reflecting on her life and bemoaning her missed chances. Frankly, it was never clear to me why she felt she'd had such a bad life. She had a lifestyle most people would kill for, traveling the world and having all sorts of passionate experiences and affairs. Instead of being grateful for her opportunities, however, she's feeling sorry for herself and thinking herself into a funk. Finally, in the last 50 pages or so, you learn about the thing that led to her lifelong estrangement from her family and from Ireland. In my opinion, this was a cheap literary device by the author to string you along for the length of the book. It's the kind of information that could have been revealed much earlier in the writing, but then the author wouldn't have had much to entice you to keep reading. Then, in the last few pages, Kathleen is enlightened by some trite insights we've heard a million times before: forgive your parents, claim your life, be open to the present moment. Hello, Oprah! Basically, once the author quits dwelling on herself and starts focusing on the outer world and on appreciating other people, she starts feeling better about her life. Duh!The way the book is structured also is frustrating. There are at least two \\"stories\\" in this book -- Kathleen's mid-life crisis and the historical novel Kathleen is writing about a 19th-century divorce case. The author is constantly switching between the two tales, sometimes within the same paragraph. Just when you get caught up in, say, the historical novel about the divorce case, the author starts rambling about some aspect of Kathleen's past or the weather in Ireland. Sad to say, Kathleen's life is not nearly as interesting as the historical novel she's working on, so each time the author yanked me back to Kathleen, I found myself getting increasingly irritated.On the plus side, some of the the writing is lovely -- I enjoyed some passages immensely and found some of the imagery quite beautiful. It's in the plot -- or lack thereof -- that this book falls down. If you're a self-absorbed middle-aged person, this book might resonate with you. If, however, you accept that aging is inevitable and that it's your responsibility alone to create meaning in your life, you'll quickly grow weary of Kathleen de Burca and her whining."},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"One can tell the narrator is a single woman. She has much time to dwell on her life - past and present. Much of the time she is as an outsider looking in, it seems to me, which is rather sad. She expresses herself in a thoughful, honest and courageous way, asking herself questions which many women ask themselves. I could understand, when in a certain mood, her having a need to read a poem by Rilke for comfort. Reading this novel, for me, was a gratifying experience. I also liked her first novel and the manner in which she writes."},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"O'Faolain usually writes journalism, memoir, essays - all nonfiction. In her first journey into the world of novel-writing, she comes up a winner with My Dream of You. it's an intriguing tale about a female Irish travel writer who is seeking the deeper truths behind a notorious divorce case during the Great Famine so many years ago. In the process of digging into the buried facts, the writer comes to question her own life choices.Nuala O'Faolain's intelligence shines through the prose in this book, as she reveals a tenderness for her characters."},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"bravo to O'Faolain for creating a \\"middle-aged\\" woman (main character is turning 50) who's neither sexless, a spinster in a little hat, nor in any other way made cute and cuddly.I was fascinated by the main character's journey-- she goes back to Ireland, having lived in England for a long time and worked as a travel writer, after a dear friend dies. There she tries to discover the mystery behind an old aristocratic scandal, and begins a novel as part of the process, and begins an affair with a married man. Along the way we see glimpses into her full but ultimately empty love-life, and cheer her on as she makes, ultimately, a difficult and painful decision.O'Faolain's prose is beautiful without being self-conscious. She writes of a cat having touched the main character \\"with one plush paw\\" and I've never forgotten it. The longing and the vividness behind that description have stayed with me. Similarly an observation about the kinds of kisses that don't leave you pretty struck me hard. Wonderful dialogue and vivid characters, too.A surprisingly quick read for a thick book. An Irish friend read it on my recommendation and enjoyed it but thought at times it seemed a little Bridget Jones-like. It is, in a way-- Bridget Jones at 50, with a more somber and serious outlook than Bridge ever had. When I finished this book, I felt I had been to Ireland and had lived some of her life. One of the best reads of 2002, for me."},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"I recently saw Nuala O'Faolain speak and was very taken with her personality--you could tell she's a good storyteller--self-deprecating, funny and yet poignant. I read this novel directly after reading her memoir, and it's obviously a very close parallel to real life. I loved the troubled but valiant character of Caitlin de Burka and the look at Ireland, both today and during the 1850s potato famine. Learned tons and cried buckets at the end as Cait holds out for something better in her life. Reminded me of Miles Franklin's My Brilliant Career somehow. And could the story within the story end any more affectingly? Strong recommendation for readers of literary women's fiction."},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"&quot;My Dream of You&quot; is one of those rare unforgettable books that keeps you thinking about the story well after you are done reading it.

Frank McCourt's Angela's Ashes may have received a Pulitzer, but this book is much better written with more depth, meaning and complexity than the title indicates. Kathleen's spiritual, emotional and physical journey is a painfully contemporary nightmare relevant to too many of us. That the author refrains from the obvious and the sentimental is as refreshing as the smell of clean, cold, fresh Irish air."},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"I really love this book - I've sat and read a lot of Irish fiction and have never found any I've liked as much as this. The author steps outside the expected stereotypes of the Irish in her development of her main character. She boldly faces the topic of internalized racism/prejudice that propels the main character at times. Best of all, she addresses that the prejudice and problems still exist, that it didn't all end when the famine was over or Southern Ireland was free. Great work!"},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"My Dream of You was not only an entertaining story, it provided a poignant insight into historic Ireland and the dilemmas and dreams (yes, there are some left!) faced by middle-aged women. I found the story at once depressing and inspiring, reminding me that even though I'm &quot;getting up there&quot; my life is by no means over yet and if I am going to get anything out of the rest of it I have to &quot;do the active thing.&quot; The only drawback I found was that I had to be able to read with little distraction as Kathleen jumps from decade to decade and back again at every turn. Cudos to Nuala O'Faolain. Well done."},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"Upon first selecting My Dream of You, I was cautious and unsure about my enjoyment of the work I had selected. As the first pages whisked under my eyes, however, my fears evaporated like mist on a sunny spring day.O'Faolain's ideas are introspective, contemplative, profound, and unendingly moving. The chapters of the book flow as if sewn by a seamstress of unparalleled skill and demeanor.We face many decisions in life. Important among those are purchasing decisions: how are we to spend the income for which we work so hard? Purchasing My Dream of You constitutes one of the wisest decisions a person can buy.Get this book.You won't regret this book."},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"\\"My Dream of You\\" appears to be Nuala O'Faolain's own beautifully-written, fictional answer to the situation she presents in her recent outstanding memoir,\\" Are You Somebody:\\" the loneliness a woman who has devoted her life to achievement may suffer as she hits her later years: a woman who, for whatever her reasons, has not integrated well with her surroundings, and suddenly finds herself living in a world too thinly populated.This book features a protagonist much like the one O'Faolain showed us in her memoir, a no longer young, intelligent woman who has a way with words, still looking for love in all the wrong places; a woman with complicated feelings, never resolved, for her native land, Ireland, who has lived in England for some time. A woman who has contempt for her overwhelmed, alcoholic mother, victimized by too many children and too small a purse; her rigid, limited father, and her bedeviled siblings.The loss of her primary friend and co-worker at a small London travel-writing service destabilizes this woman, Irish name, Kaitlin de Burca; known in English as Kathleen Burke. She therefore leaves her dingy London basement flat to return to the land of her birth. She has decided to try to write a novel about an apparently actual Irish divorce case, Talbot versus Talbot, that went through the Irish courts and reached the British House of Lords, where apparently all divorces were then required to be ultimately heard, in 1850, at the height of Ireland's disastrous famine.The author here intertwines Kathleen Burke's current story, as she continues her search for love, with the story of the earlier affair, between Marianne Talbot, wife of an English landlord, and William Mullan, one of her Irish servants. (Kathleen is finally unable to write this novel, as further documentation appears that makes it impossible to decide whether the affair actually took place. In case we should be ignorant of this point, O'Faolain has one of her characters, a librarian, point out that such ambiguity is currently all the literary rage, and greatly irritates readers.)However, in reaching this conclusion, O'Faolain provides the reader with excellent writing about the famine. She brings the terror and despair of that century old tragedy to life, in, at least, my imagination. She takes an unusually close, sympathetic look at the animals of modern day Ireland. She also provides an interesting commentary on where women, particularly Irishwomen, were at that time, and where they are now.O'Faolain also gives us a narrator capable of learning and growing, finally able to forgive her lovely homeland, her mother, father, and siblings for their faults, and to begin to integrate herself into a larger, better world. She's no longer capable of having children at age 55, but she meets a few, to give her new world a future worth living for."},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"O'Faolain gives us an easy-to-understand grasp of the complicated history of Ireland - both political and physical - and she does so in a way that challenges my romantic, biased views of my ancestors. Weaving memories of her past into her present life, the heroine unveils the prejudices of both the Irish and the non-Irish through the generations. A wonderful book, and sure you can hear the Irish lilt."},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"I adored the postcript to &quot;Are you Somebody&quot; and took &quot;My Dream of You&quot; out of the local library as soon as it was published. I really enjoyed this book, never found it boring, even relished a certain messiness about the writing, a careless joy is what I'd call it. My only critique is that it went on a little too long and didn't flesh out the historical story within the story fully enough. But highly recommended nonetheless."},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"My Dream of You is told in the first person perspective of Kathleen De Burca. A woman of a particular age (fiftyish), she's led an empty, sad existence her entire life. She lives in the same dungeonesque flat in London as she had for the past umpteenth year. She works as a travel writer for the same small publication for as many years, with the same drab coworkers. Single, Kathleen's life consists of a series of brief affairs and one night stands as she searches for something she will never find because she doesn't know what she's looking for. After Jimmy, her best friend and coworker dies suddenly of a heart attack, Kathleen comes to a crossroads in her life. Quitting her ho-hum job, she travels to her homeland of Ireland in hopes of writing a novel on the infamous Talbot divorce which occurred during the Potato Famine.Kathleen begins writing a rather sordid, ficticious account of the doomed union of the Talbots, but eventually has to abandon her imagined take on the scandal as evidence is uncovered which sheds new light of the people involved.I found this a rambling, boring read. Kathleen has so many flash backs, it's hard to stay interested in the present plot.I had much higher hopes for this book."},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"Once upon a time, there was a middle-aged, unmarried Irish lady, who spent most of her life in London, as a journalist, working for a traveling magazine. Having severed her relationship with the Mother Country, her relatives, she drifts through life seeking happiness, and not being terribly successful in that quest. On the spur of the moment, she decides to make a substantial change in her life, and make some use of her writing abilities, and fictionalize the old story of love between an Irish pauper and an English landlady in the dark times of the famine. That story wasn't quite of the Cinderella quality, because the Cinderella himself was a man, to be sure, and second, because there wasn't really much to tell, no fairytale to expand on, and there was no happy end for both lovers. As might be expected, although not hoped for, the fictionalized romance was essentially a journalist's essay, suffering from wordiness, and skimming only the surface, despite the effort put into the retelling. I am sure that Nuala O'Faolain is a talented person, however, as this book clearly indicates, her talents lie quite elsewhere, not in mainstream fiction. She has a keen observational sense, that much is evident, however, with a scope of work as wide as this one, she somehow cannot escape the occupational hazard, and the book, or at least the relatively small part dealing with the romance is not much more than an essay, which delivers about as much essence as a long magazine article would. Famine - how much there was to tell, how much to discover, or rediscover, rather - from a new perspective of the XXI century, from the point of view of a lady of Irish heritage, who knows the ins and outs, the charms and peculiarities of the country. Unfortunately, the topic is just barely touched, as if common decency dictated to at least put a threadbare skeleton of a setup. There is not much to learn from this book in this respect. Instead, the fictionalized story of the Talbot divorce case is a pure romance of the flesh, so to speak. The author is clearly interested in the carnal dimension, her writing reflects that tendency, and when all is said and done, the whole literary adventure seems to be quite bland. So many words, and so little essence.Then there is the second dimension of the book, the memoir. In scattered bits and pieces, the narrator tells us the story of her life, what are the current aches and pains, with the events of the past unearthed if only to provide an explanation for the current, miserable state of affairs. The lady repeatedly tries to answer some basic set of questions, circling around and about, and finishing as confused as she started. Perhaps there is no simple answer to questions like this, so perhaps she shouldn't be blamed for not having offered us a reasonable, robust and sound explanation. Why is she alone, why there was only one person she was able to attach herself to emotionally, and in fact that man, her colleague, has never been her lover, while at the same time she never refused anyone else, who bothered to ask, or even slightly hint at? Why did she hurt everyone who loved her, where did this force come from a force that transformed her life into a series of carnal adventures, some uplifting, some grim, and some utterly forgettable, why? She does not know. I don't know either. This book is a memoir of a confused lady, that's what it is, and it's intriguing to read, no doubt, but somehow the confused state of the writer seems to be contagious. So much has been written, and as a reader, I am deeply confused. I regret that I haven't been able to extract more from this book, perhaps I am too young, and my personality hasn't evolved enough for me to be able to understand the musings and anxieties apparent in \\"My Dream of You\\". On the other hand, I have an impression that the author's attempts have turned out to be too shallow to be memorable, her quest toward discovery of what it means to be Irish is never definitive, full of slogans and stereotypes, nothing to be fond of. If you would like to read a real work on that topic, you might try Edna O'Brien or Alice Taylor, and last but not least, the great son of the Emerald Island - James Joyce."},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"There was something that drew me to this book, maybe it was the cover, I don't know. But after I started it, I had a very hard time reading it, much as I wanted to. The woman was so unhappy, and everything seemed so miserable, I couldn't continue. If you want a book that involves intrigue, fun, confidence, genuine passion, or anything of similar like, I would not recommend this book to you."},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"I love Nuala O'Faolain and Are You Somebody? was a very touching book, I thought. It was so honest and from the heart. My Dream just doesn't have that authenticity. The main character rambles on about a scandal from the past but it never clicks with me or interests me enough. When O'Faolain writes from her deepest self, there is none better. I hope she will do another book soon but, perhaps, fiction is not her strongest genre."},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"After reading some of the overblown reviews, which reference feminism, self-discovery, and the crossover between literature and love, I was expecting something along the lines of A.S. Byatt's \\"Possession.\\" Instead, this book was the depressing tale of a woman who is unable to say no to dreary and squalid sex (at one point her elderly lover takes out his dentures to take her to bliss) and the historic/tragic love affair she is researching is even less interesting. The protagonist has the inner life of a blank page and the dead woman she identifies with is equally tepid. Her flashbacks to a difficult childhood are supposed to illuminate her distance from the world and those inhabiting it. Instead, they seem to be an oversimplified and awkward technique that takes the reader back to a past where our heroine is as featureless and unexplained as she is in the present. I hate to be harsh, but I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"Nuala O'Faoloain's My Dream of You is a coming-of-middle-age tale about Irish women across decades looking for \\"something to love.\\" While the novel is overtly about passion, it also explores the meaning of coming home and leaving it, of familial ties, of friendship, and, most poignantly, of growing older. Fiftyish Kathleen de Burca finds herself bereft and alone when her best friend Jimmy dies, and she begins to question the choices she has made. A persistent memory of a former lover and his \\"gift\\" to her of court documents prompt her to quit her job as a travel writer and to research the scandalous affair between a married Englishwoman and her Irish groom, an event that occurred during the Irish Potato Famine. Kathleen arrives on Irish soil after a long, stubborn absence, and there, she begins to open up, to understand matters of love and passion, to grasp the significance of her childhood, to give meaning to what it means to be Irish.O'Faoloain's prose is lyrical, though sometimes overwrought, and its cadences propel this essentially quiet story. The historical side of the book, that of the principals in the Talbot Judgment, lends texture to the present day story, although the story itself is not as compelling as it could be, especially when Kathleen recreates it as fiction. O'Faoloain's unflinching descriptions of the realities of the aging body and its desires give this novel a freshness and an honesty. The psychology of the protagonist is revealed with equal candor.My Dream of You should appeal largely to women, although all readers who like to read about Ireland will enjoy its textures of history and description."},{"Title":"My Dream Of You","review":"This was a truly great read!

This book is one of my very favorites from the past few years, and one of the very few that I plan to reread. I was surprised to find some of your reviewers hated the book.

I am seeing such a difference in the peacefulness and focus present in the students. I am re-reading Jivamukti Yoga for the second time and often refer to it as I plan my classes. I highly recommend this book to both students and teachers of yoga.Many thanks to Sharon and David for this very beautiful and spiritual work."},{"Title":"Jivamukti Yoga: Practices for Liberating Body and Soul","review":"I think I have read many of the books on yoga today, some of them are really good about telling me where I should be putting my left toe, during my practice, where I should be looking when I do a headstand, really good about telling me how my body will get better , more flexible etc. etc. but none where more powerful in changing my perception of the world than this book.... Yoga is a spiritual practice an ethical way life , a compassionate way of living a political and social movement that cares about the environment and all living beings . This book brought the teachings of yoga to me in a straight way , it gave me more information about what yoga is than all those other books combine. Is a book that i keep coming back to ... I can pick any page and fine a teaching , to me that's the mark of a powerful and timeless book.. I don't really understand how can one compare Jivamukti Yoga to any other style or book out there...Its the only book in the market I feel that presents Yoga as a spiritual practice . OM"},{"Title":"Jivamukti Yoga: Practices for Liberating Body and Soul","review":"I refer to it all the time. Whenever I want to engage my practice off the mat, but am not sure which direction to turn in, their book provides plenty of inspiration. I'm grateful that they have presented traditional aspects of yogic philosophy in a way that makes sense for the modern yogi :) They state from the beginning that their intention with Jivamukti is to INTEGRATE the old with the new and your practice with your life. It will not collect dust on your bookshelf. It will become worn from use as a reference and as an inspiration! My first yoga teacher recommended this book to me and described Sharon and David as &quot;yogis gone bad!&quot; It is the first book I recommend to my friends who are interested in starting to practice."},{"Title":"Jivamukti Yoga: Practices for Liberating Body and Soul","review":"The book incorporates the authors' journey of spiritual discovery.It doesn't exclude asanas (smaller photographs of asanas are presenting in sequence along the page bottoms--later at the end, whole &quot;classes&quot; of vinyasas are reproduced: you can choose basic, intermediate, or advanced classes, with variable time lengths, or specific emphases), yet does focus a lot of yogic philosophies from both the Yoga Sutras and the Hatha Yoga pradipika--There are unbelievably beautiful chapters on the Guru, on Vinyasa (asana sequences), on Karma, and on Nada-Yoga: the yoga of sound.Iyengar's books (Tree of Yoga, particularly) explain all the little, fine details (all those &quot;sheathes&quot; and &quot;subtle body,&quot; &quot;causal body&quot; etc.) a little more thoroughly, but this book has its true success in making all of that ancient knowledge so immediately relevant.At the end, this book is many things, and all of them well: it is a good book for the beginning yogi to learn about the philosophy and relevance of yoga, more advanced students will find great use in the reproduced vinyasas and classes--It goes far beyond &quot;asana&quot;--only the third of the Eight Limbs of yoga--it covers all eight limbs, talks about Karma Yoga, Bhakhti Yoga, Chanting, Meditation, etc."},{"Title":"Jivamukti Yoga: Practices for Liberating Body and Soul","review":"If you have an issue with \\"brand name\\" yoga, then leave it at the door. Jivamukti Yoga is for those seriously seeking a book on yogic principles without feeling spoon-fed. Sharon and David offer a revolutionary approach to teaching that is rare and necessary in a time when yoga teachers and yoga teacher training comes at a dime a dozen; and most teachers are incapable of communicating to the Western yogi/yogini the reason why 8-limbed astanga yoga principles are so important without loosing the true essence of the ancient teaching. Excellent!"},{"Title":"Jivamukti Yoga: Practices for Liberating Body and Soul","review":"I was thrilled to discover these two delightful individuals. While I am attracted to yoga, I cannot fully immerse myself in yogic philosophy that does not emphasize kindness to all creatures. Sharon and David are people who have expectations from the human race, they are not \\"dumbing down\\" yoga practice to fit the needs of the public. They are asking us to contemplate the food we eat, the clothes we buy, and to consider all of the other people and animals on the planet. They seek to empower us, believing that our daily choices can make an impact on the world. I have often put down yoga/meditation books before, discouraged that they make statements like \\"it is wrong to kill a fly\\" but acceptable to eat meat, or give money to causes that promote suffering and death. I perceive that attitude to almost condone it, as long as you didn't directly kill the animal or didn't directly participate in the slave labor, etc...That is a big turn off to me, spiritual leaders that aren't bold enough to stand up for basic rights. Kudos to Sharon & David-I am sure there were many people who thought these two wouldn't make it standing up for what they believe in. But sincerity pays off and I am just so thrilled to have found them. They are an inspiration."},{"Title":"Jivamukti Yoga: Practices for Liberating Body and Soul","review":"Yoga is now a trendy form of physical fitness, but it's also a spiritual practice. Many Yoga books overlook this critical element in favor of stressing how to properly assume the postures (ie, asanas), but Gannon and Life give readers the whole picture.I'm impressed with the authority, depth of knowledge, thoroughness, and sense of humor that Gannon and Life bring to yoga. I'd never trust an authority who wasn't, in their own way, anti-authoritarian, or a guru who didn't laugh. The Jivamukti approach is sound, emphasizing the parallel development (and union) of mind, body, and spirit, but this basic concept is delivered with a wonderful dash of irreverence. This I can heartily endorse!Remeber that 60s credo, &quot;Free your mind and your *ss will follow?&quot; With Jivamukti, you can free your mind, and your *ss will tone up. How can you lose?"},{"Title":"Jivamukti Yoga: Practices for Liberating Body and Soul","review":"Sharon and David have done an amazing job with this book!

I have read just about every piece of literature on yoga. This book is by far the best book that I have read on the practice, philosophy, and structure of yoga for me. I love Ashtanga and Hatha yoga, but was missing something from the two. Well, I found it with Jivamukti. I love the music, and freedom to be who I am in yoga, and not what the teacher wants me to become. I am a work in progress, and want the opportunity to find self-realization through my journey. This book gives you the tools to adjust and find your spirituality as you see fit. It may not be right for everyone, but lets face it, most of us live in the US and need to incorporate the way of a yogi or yogini to our lives. I am a westerner, and this is the yoga for me in my Karmic path. It fits my life for now. I just hope to have the opportunity to study under David and Sharron. Their wealth of knowledge and love for yoga is addictive."},{"Title":"Jivamukti Yoga: Practices for Liberating Body and Soul","review":"This is an excellent book setting out the personal, spiritual, political, psychological, ethical, musical and physical aspects of Jivamukti yoga. It is highly readable, well laid out and accessible. But not simplistic. It is a solid, fascinating read that weaves yoga, philosophy, ancient terms, quotations and modern life issues seamlessly into a lovely whole. Kind of like the Jivamukti practice itself.Now - when are they going to release a DVD of their full length Jivamukti class? Soon please - for those of us whose nearest Jivamukti accredited teachers are an hour and a half drive away.Certain chapters such as the one on Karma and the one on vegetarianism stay in your mind and while confronting, work away at you. Mine chapters on these topics are covered in myriad margin notes. As a farm raised girl I thought some of the comments about not using milk from cows or eggs from chickens because of cruel animal practices reflected a very old view of choices about these options. For example, in Australia we have options of free range organic eggs certified as being from chickens who do run around outside in the sun, eat natural food only and walk voluntarily to their bird cages at night for food, shelter, fresh straw and to avoid being attacked by foxes. I of course agree totally with their comments about battery farming of hens as being cruel and unacceptable. Similarly their material on cow milk production did not cover cruelty organic free options now available. I read recently that the Dalai Lama had tried to be vegetarian but failed, so I guess he and I are struggling with the ethics of this. It would be terrific if in an updated version of the book they delved into such options so those of us not quite there yet have a pathway to get us there which is not the cold turkey route.The authors are magnificent physical specimens so the arty black and white photography is not only aesthetically pleasing, it shadows the muscles starkly, so you can see the definitions appropriate for each pose. The break out boxes are useful for added detail but the font size is miniscule. I had to use a magnifying glass to be able to read them. The break out boxes break up the page in interesting ways, so look great, but the tiny font size means many readers could miss the detail contained within. It would be great to have the break out box contents reappear at the end of each chapter as Endnotes at the normal font size."},{"Title":"Jivamukti Yoga: Practices for Liberating Body and Soul","review":"The Jivamukti Yoga book isa constant source of knowledge and inspiration. Suitable for yoga students and teachers alike, the book outlines the Jivamukti Yoga method and philosophy while also, in an accessible way, describing yogic history, philosophy and physical postures.The writing is straight forward and light and the authors, Jivamukti Yoga founders, Sharon Gannon and David Life, never compromise on the message: yoga as a way to be a kinder, more compassionate human being with an ultimate goal of personal enlightenment.Every chapter also mixes facts and theory with anecdotes and personal stories of the authors' yogic endeavors.I keep on returning to this book wheather I have questions regarding the practice, want tips on a new sequencing or need a topic for a class discussion."},{"Title":"Jivamukti Yoga: Practices for Liberating Body and Soul","review":"It just arrive in the last minute but I got it and its in excellent conditions."},{"Title":"Jivamukti Yoga: Practices for Liberating Body and Soul","review":"for those of us new to yoga this is an awesome book for the wonderful insight and incredible photos"},{"Title":"Jivamukti Yoga: Practices for Liberating Body and Soul","review":"I have read several books on yoga and I must say I am very impressed with all of David and Sharon's work!

The book is written so much in the manner of David and Sharon's highly informed yet ever practical approach that reading it is like being in class with them. Thank you, David and Sharon, yet again. Om shanti."},{"Title":"Jivamukti Yoga: Practices for Liberating Body and Soul","review":"This book Jivamukti Yoga is very different than most yoga books in that it is about Yoga in a more holistic sense. It has some material on asana sequencing (very interesting I might add), but that is the smallest part of the book. I would also agree with others that the photographs have a lot to be desired in their size and the way they are cropped. Not user friendly at all. It seems as they were willing to sacrifice clarity for the sake of being \\"artsy\\".Jivamukti Yoga is more of an overview of the more spiritual aspects of yoga and puts the asana practice in the context of this more complete picture. It truly treats asana as just one limb of yoga practice.While I enjoyed it on many levels, I must also say that there are many times where I felt the authors got very preachy and sometimes seemed a bit off base to me.For example, Gannon and Life's view of \\"Ahimsa\\" compared to other authors on the subject. Most writing on this concept of non-harming that I've read also stresses not harming oneself, Gannon and Life don't give very much importance to this aspect of it which has a bit of a \\"martyr-like\\" attitude to it.In Desikachar's book \\"The Heart Of Yoga\\" he says (I'm paraphrasing) that \\"Ahimsa also means acting in kindness toward ourselves\\". and goes on to say for example that \\" if one is a vegetarian but are in a situation where one must eat meat in order to survive then one must do what they need to do so they can continue to take care of their family and other responsibilities\\" and goes on to say that \\"it would show a lack of consideration and arrogance to become stuck on one's principles\\".Gannon and Life often seem to be stuck on their principles which I found to be a bit of a turn off.Even Buddhist Metta practices start with the idea that one has to love themselves in a healthy way(not in a hedonistic or egotiscal way) before they can truly have space and peace in their hearts for others. Only then can people love in a pure and unconditional way as that love expands outward. How can one give what they don't have?Anyway, besides occasional somewhat \\"fanatical\\" attitudes throughout, I enjoyed this book immensely. I am currently reading it for the second time and can see that I will go back to it and re-read it many many times in spite of my occasional disagreements with the authors.I have read some complain of a lack of \\"thoroughness\\" regarding the \\"yoga philosphy\\" in this book, but in fairness to the authors, this book isn't a scholarly book on Yoga philosophy but rather an introduction that will surely open many eyes to Yoga as a broader practice than just the asanas. Most people new to the more philosophical and religious aspects of yoga practice are not going to start with Patanjali but would be better off getting the overview from a book like this.As mentioned above, for those interested, I would highly recommend Desikachar's \\"Heart of Yoga\\", which does have the \\"Yoga Sutras\\" translated at the end of the book. It is preceded by an overview of yoga philosophy prior to presenting his translation of the \\"Yoga Sutras\\" (as well as some chapters on yoga \\"asana\\" practice) to give the reader some background.Desikachar himself is the son (and student)of the late Sri T.Krishnamacharya. Krishnamacharya himself was also the teacher of Pattabhi Jois (the primary Guru and Ashtanga yoga teacher of Gannon and Life and THE most well known proponent of Ashtanga Yoga). Krishnamacharya also taught BKS Iyengar. That should be enough of an endorsement to convince anyone of Desikachar's \\"Yoga lineage\\" and credibility which would in my eyes put him in a different class than Gannon and Life. Sometimes it seems that some Westerners tend to \\"romanticize\\" their experiences in India whereas someone like Desikachar is not apt to do that since he is a native of that land.Still, regarding \\"Jivamukti Yoga\\", I still think it deserves a five star rating and Highly recommend it for those interested in this very interesting approach to yoga.Namaste"},{"Title":"Jivamukti Yoga: Practices for Liberating Body and Soul","review":"This has been a very interesting read for me. I attempted to read the book without thinking about things that I have heard about the authors. Sharon and David are much discussed in yoga circles - they are considered fairly radical - and I have heard many good and bad things about them. I also tried not to let the views of the authors that I don't entirely agree with influence my view of the book. In the end, I was quite please with this book.First of all, I think the overview of yoga philosophy, is good. This is the main focus of this book. As an introductory book on the philosophy aspect of yoga, it does not go into great depth. The authors believe that this aspect has not been being spread as much as the physical practice of yoga. However, be forewarned, the authors practice veganism as a part of their ahimsa (non-harming) practice and they are strong advocates for animal rights. This stance is presented throughout the book. While I don't entirely agree with them on this, if you read the entire book, they do explain where they are coming from on this issue.As far as hatha yoga / asana practice / the physical postures of yoga, there is some of that in this book. The authors assume you have studied asana previously. They point out there are many books and teachers availible regarding hatha yoga, and they don't feel compelled to repeat this. What they do is dedecate a few chapters to demonstrate their style of vinyasa krama (linking the postures together with breath in a dance/tai chi like flow series). They give 5 sample 'lessons', three for beginners and two for intermediate/advanced. They also give numerous flow sequences you can put together yourself in various ways or incorporate as a segment into your own practice. As others have stated the pictures of the authors doing these sequences are not extremely clear, but I think this is because they are already assuming you know how to do the poses. They do state you should have studied yoga before attempting to do these sequences. I have incorporated some of these lessons into my home practice and have found their sequencing extremely enjoyable.Basic meditation and pranayama (breathing) techniques are also given. They do suggest exhale retention, a practice many do not advise until experience in pranayama is gained; however, they don't go into discussion about the various theories behind this.There is much discussion of spiritualism throughout the book and devotion to the divine in whatever form you see it. in the authors' opinion, this is the goal of yoga/life. There are also discussions of the arts in worship. Building a spiritual community is another major focus in the book.There is a considerable bit of name dropping in this book. This may be American name dropping but I want to offer another explanation. In many yoga traditions you are supposed to recognize anyone and everyone who has contributed to your growth. It is a sign of humility: I would not be here without all these people (all things that have come before me have made me and I will be a part of all that comes after me), I have done none of this own my own.I have never met David and Sharon, but I have heard a lot about them second hand. I don't know what of that is true or false. All I can say that this book is a good, well-rounded presentation of yoga that does include the authors viewpoints and personality in its pages (whether this is good or bad depends on how you feel about this as a reader).I give this book four and a half stars."},{"Title":"Jivamukti Yoga: Practices for Liberating Body and Soul","review":"In an era when yoga has become trendy and commercialized it is refreshing that a mainstream publisher offers a book that advocates a return to spiritually oriented yoga practice. Ironically, the authors have created yet another &quot;brand name&quot; yoga while delivering a book that has more style than substance.I was disappointed with most of the contents of this book. For example, the section on pranayama and bandhas has enough detail to get someone into trouble, but not enough detail to provide real guidance. The section on asana has some useful comments on sequencing, but the descriptions and the tiny, grainy, badly cropped photos are useless.The text on various aspects of yoga philosophy and practice is uninspired and rather muddled. The section on ahimsa is particularly annoying, with a rather hectoring and judgmental attitude towards non-vegans.I was especially disappointed with the recommended readings found in Appendix II. A book that is intended to inspire people towards a spiritual path should have a well organized reading list that describes the recommended books in some detail. The provided list has no organization at all, it isn't even properly alphabetized! Nor is there any description of the included books.Surf on over to the Jivamukti website, there you can purchase some pricey yoga togs so that you can look very stylish on the road to spiritual liberation. The authors may have intended to promote a spiritual approach to yoga, but they've created yet another &quot;brand name&quot; yoga with themselves as &quot;yoga celebrities&quot;. If this sort of thing appeals to you, I suggest you check out their other book, The Art of Yoga, which is all style and no substance--but it sure is way cool."},{"Title":"Jivamukti Yoga: Practices for Liberating Body and Soul","review":"\\"Jivamukti Yoga: Practices for Liberating Body and Soul\\" is a wonderful book that reflects the path of Yogis David Life and Sharon Gannon. Although the couples views on Ahimsa (non-harming) are controversial (and to many readers somewhat extreme), they most certainly make one think.I have had the pleasure of practicing Jivamukti Yoga (not with Sharon and David, but with their students) and find it to be an energetic and well integrated style of Yoga. Like all yoga, Jivamukti's asanas and philosphy will not be for everyone. Yoga is a personal path and each of us that embark upon that path must invariably find their own way.What I enjoyed most about the book was that it is a detailed description of two people that clearly have found their path. Many find their path extreme, but that is for the reader and individual Yogi to decide. Ultimately you will recieve from the book what you need and put aside that which does not serve you.I definitely recommend that yogis read this book in order to clarify their own path."},{"Title":"Jivamukti Yoga: Practices for Liberating Body and Soul","review":"This book is unique among Yoga books as some topics come out in more detail with more of the Author's personal experience. Such as Karma (action), Ahimsa (Non-violence), Prana (life force), Vinyasa Krama (the act of sequencing), etc. The coverage is more extensive than most of the typical yoga books. A whole chapter is devoted to each of these topics and more. The authors state that the book itself is not really about the postures but what (all) is essential in liberating the soul (Jiva mukti - life/soul liberation).A very unique chapter is about the Guru. This chapter eloquently highlights the characteristics you should look for in a Guru. The authors point out the fact that your intuition apart from the intellect itself must play a role. Another point you don't read often is the fact that a Guru must have attained enlightenment. While very few teachers in the modern age have attained enlightenment, Sharon and David point out the need for the Guru to be in close touch with the scriptures as a substitute.Being strong proponents of non-violence and animal rights you can expect a good deal of coverage on ahimsa. Very few Yoga teachers prescribe a vegetarian diet; Sharon and David prescribe it as an must for a true Yogi.The book is complete with a superb collection of photographs and many charts of asanas for different focus - backbending, forward bending, twists and such. A quite comprehensive reference list and a comprehensive translation of sanskrit terms ends the well written and eloquent presentation.The cover photos while beautiful is needlessly catchy! In all, an eloquent discourse on many aspects of Yoga. It would be a complete book if the authors had an as in-depth commentary on the other yamas and niyamas, the rules and observations as some of those in the book."},{"Title":"Jivamukti Yoga: Practices for Liberating Body and Soul","review":"I did not like this book. There is too many rules to follow, too much religion like. For me yoga is about one's own wisdom, following one's own intuition because living someone else's life and following someone else's path will not bring happiness to anybody. No matter how good it seems. But according this book you must follow the rules to be a good person and to ever find any happiness. When you read it it makes you feel bad about yourself. Because up to their standart no one is good enough. Only if you devote yourself to their principles you can start to think about yourself as being a better person. And I don't believe that.This book is very limiting to the beauty and the spirit we all carry within. That something that makes us so special and different from each other. They mean well but the truth is somewhere else. Try to find your own path and your own truth. This book will not help you with it. It will only make you feel bad about who you are today."},{"Title":"Jivamukti Yoga: Practices for Liberating Body and Soul","review":"This book is wonderful! I'm so energized from reading such accessible information about the basis of yoga. The chapter on ahimsa is incredible and has helped me go back to veganism, which has been a struggle for me the past couple of years. Now I've been reminded of being mindful when faced with an opportunity to make a choice about many things, including food. I hope to meet these two wonderful people someday!"},{"Title":"Jivamukti Yoga: Practices for Liberating Body and Soul","review":"I cannot praise this book enough! I have never written a review on Amazon before but this time I had to. This book is one of a kind, integrating traditional Yoga - with all its colour, sounds, and mystique - with a modern day approach that far from detracting from the essence, truly brings Yoga up to date. So many other books skim over the other limbs and don't indicate how they can be integrated into every day life. In Jivamukti Yoga however, we are given differing methods to do just this! One of the real inspirations for me was that you don't have to live in perfect surroundings, you don't need to have serene, silent, idyllic conditions in which to practice; you can practice in the middle of a busy urban background and become an \`Urban Yogi'!I can heartily recommend this book for anyone who wants to practice Yoga how it was meant to be practiced! Buy the book, put some tunes on and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Jivamukti Yoga: Practices for Liberating Body and Soul","review":"This book.....what can I say? I got it and read the whole thing in 2 days. This book challenges you to look at your yoga practice, and your life. Often i have felt empty after, and during yoga class -- but why? I was doing the poses right, but i was missing something -- as David and Sharon put it; I had taken apart the clock and still expect it to work. Yoga is a system, a spirtiual system that leads to enlighment. A yoga body and a clam mind are simply the bi-products of the work.This book talks about the differnt braches of yoga and how they are still able to be practiced in today's busy life. The book has jivamukti yoga class out lines and ALOT of spirtural theory in a manner that is easy to digest. I recomend it highly for anyone who wants to take their practice to the next level."},{"Title":"Jivamukti Yoga: Practices for Liberating Body and Soul","review":"A good informative and sometimes inspired book. It is hard to reconcile the lofty philosophy of Sharon and David with their belief that celebrity is so important. Do you really care what Russell Simmons' view of Jivamukti Yoga is? I certainly don't. Good book anyway, lots of valuable info, well presented."},{"Title":"Jivamukti Yoga: Practices for Liberating Body and Soul","review":"Jivamukti yoga is the latest craze in the yoga world.This yoga style is focused on yoga as a lifestyle with exhortations to become vegetarian and enter into a total dedication to Jivamukti Yoga way if that is the way your yoga leads you.This is a good book, well written, lovely photographs, and some amazing yoga flows.This is more of a hard-form yoga. This is yoga near its most Western-culture appropriate strenuous.Wait and see whether this yoga lasts 100 years."},{"Title":"Jivamukti Yoga: Practices for Liberating Body and Soul","review":"Wow, here it is: the embodiment of the wisdom of two of the greatest Yoga teachers alive! Sharon Gannon and David Life have rocked (and shocked) the American Yoga community for the last 15 years. I guess it's hard to find a yoga practioner (or even a teacher) in new york who wasn't influenced by Sharon and David's approach to Yoga as a spiritual discipline. This book reminds us that the goal of yoga is not a healthier or stronger body (even if that some nice by-products) but the realization that \\"we can become God even while living in a human body - become a real jivanmuktha\\"! How do we get here? We have to start to purify our intentions and actions from selfish desire and start to create the least amount of harm to all the others around you, regardless of which race or specie. If we get our intention straight than our actions start to reflect our own divinity which is pure Love. This challenging concept seems to condense the core of the Jivamukti Yoga method. So, why don't we start today and dedicate the fruits of our practice to the happiness and freedom of all beings, each and everywhere.

They talk just like this. I'm so lucky to have been able to take Sharon and David's class for the past 2 &amp; 1/2 years. And I'm still not bored, completely inspired and fascinated and overwhelmed by the intensity and energy of their classes. I'm thrilled that this book fills in so many details that i've been curious about -- such as how they met their gurus. I've heard some of the stories in class but now feel I have a recorded document of them. Precious! I also LOVE sharon's story about hearing nadam (sounds, whistles, whoosh) coming from Shri Brahmananda's body. it sounds crazy but after taking her classes it is completely plausible b/c she gives you such a DEEP understanding of yoga.

The goal of the book is to sell the Jivamukti brand name. If you want to learn about yoga just read the yogic texts (Upanishads, Samhitas, etc.).

It provides 34 vividly colourful photographs of the Irish A and C class engines. This is not to be underestimated. Unless you can get access to Inchicore Engineering works where several pristine samples are preserved, there is little chance of seeing any of these in the flesh so to speak. Each of the various liveries are presented, the factory-fresh silver, the flying snail green, the original 60's black and tan and the post '73 golden brown incarnation. With the upsurge in popularity in modelling Irish railways, these photoplates provide a very good template for the various colour schemes of the early diesel period.Secondly, there is myriad of technical detail around the various engine refits, performances and dimensions of the classes. Unlike some railway articles, the prose does not drown in a sea of minutiae but clips along with both brevity and clarityHowever there is final aspect to this book that is its most powerful and perhaps most poignant. It captures an era that is now well and truly gone. The bulk of the pictures date from after Todd Andrew's slaughter of the network in the early 60's. Yet it is surprising to find pictures of small stations on little known branchlines that survived right up to the early '80's, such as Ardee, Barnagh, the Curragh, Loughrea etc. Other background detail is the prevalance of cattle trains and four-wheel wagons prior to the containerisation of freight. Given that freight too has now all but disappeared (container traffic having stopped just two months ago) even the picture of a Bell Container train in late '80's Cahir has a touch of nostalgia about it.All in all an essential reference book for anyone interested in Irish transport history."},{"Title":"Spooks, Spies, and Private Eyes","review":"I truly enjoyed reading the compilation of stories contained in this book.

Most cookbooks recipes are for six to eight people, at best some times four (Emeril's books are best, often serving four), which is hard for the single or &quot;in a couple&quot; working person. There are just so many leftovers you can deal with before they spoil or you get sick of them.What's good about this book is that the recipes are simple, there is a range of dishes from the everyday to the somewhat fancy, the ingredients are common but not ordinary, and it covers everything from soups to apple crisp.

There are only a few problems that I have with this book.

Are you crazy?) or involve more steps than I honestly have the time or \\"oomph\\" left for at the end of a long work day. Aside from the my critique of the timesink that is chicken noodle soup here, some of the other soups are good, and will remain in my repertoire, often doubled so I have something to take for lunch the next day. (Example: the Potato and Leek Soup with Dill).While I'm not going to toss it, this cookbook isn't seeing nearly as much use as something like Jane Doerfer's \\"Going Solo In The Kitchen\\", which is excellent all the way around and her recipes contain variations and suggestions for \\"recycling\\" the second portion (if you choose to double it) into a different meal so you don't feel like you're doing \\"leftovers\\"."},{"Title":"Cooking for Yourself (Williams-Sonoma Lifestyles , Vol 12, No 20)","review":"This is a great gift idea.

Each of the six layouts features the story with a few lift-the-flap surprises on the left and a fan/wheel on the right. There are two types of fan/wheels. With three pages, the wheel works like pull tabs in other pop-up books that cause a back-and-forth movement with manipluation. On the other three pages, you slide the tab of the fan wheel and the fan blades create a new picture. This format works well in this book (the blades don't completely obscure the first image, so in some books, the result can be a distracting mix of two pictures).Published in 1988, these revolving wheels predate the spectacular pop-up technology of today, but I like the technique. The only fault I have with the book are the flaps. While they will interest the young reader, they don't always have a whole lot to do with the storyline on the page. I do think the book is enhanced by them as they are, but I wish they were more integrated into the storyline.I think this book would appeal to the young reader and the pop-up collector (all though it isn't strictly a pop-up, I think this low-tech version would fit in a moveable-book collection)."},{"Title":"Dreaming in Clay on the Coast of Mississippi","review":"THE STORY OF A FAMILY'S DEDICATION TO EACH OTHER AND THEIR ARTBy Lynna Williams.Maria Estrella Iglesias, a collector of American art pottery, was in an antiques mall near Nashville when she saw a pottery vase glazed &quot;an extraordinary blue.&quot; Seeing it across the cluttered room &quot;was like catching a glimpse of the ocean,&quot; and when she turned it over she found a name and mark unfamiliar to her. Iglesias couldn't know it then, but that chance introduction to Shearwater Pottery would open up an extraordinary world apart: the personal and public history of the Andersons of Ocean Springs, Miss.Some readers may already be familiar with the brilliant work of painter, printmaker and muralist Walter Inglis Anderson without knowing the story of his role in the pottery, and the broader story of his family's passionate commitment to art as a way of life.Four generations of Andersons have created Shearwater's art and, while cordially disliking the term &quot;artist,&quot; have nurtured potters, painters, sculptors, poets and writers, from the Depression to the present. The story Iglesias and her husband, Vanderbilt professor Christopher Maurer, tell in &quot;Dreaming in Clay on the Coast of Mississippi&quot; has passion and torment sufficient for grand opera, all borne of a relentless dedication to the making of art. It would be a remarkable story in any time. In the America of the 21st Century, when art is so often viewed as extraneous in our daily lives, or as just another commodity to be consumed, it takes on a special, almost electric, resonance. Maurer and Iglesias' book, which starts with an account of their own &quot;falling into&quot; the Shearwater world, is a compelling account of lives in which art, for better and worse, is as basic a necessity of life as air and water.It began with a marriage, 100 years ago. After a 12-year courtship, George Walter Anderson, a prosperous grain dealer, wed Annette McConnell, a lawyer's daughter educated at Newcomb College in New Orleans, a central force in the post-Civil War resurgence of arts and crafts in the South. By 1907 there were three sons: Peter, Walter Inglis and James McConnell.From the beginning, their artistic mother wanted art to wash over them, to be fundamental to who they were. Their businessman father dreamed of &quot;Anderson, Incorporated,&quot; the family functioning as a unit. &quot;Dreaming in Clay&quot; documents how both parents' wishes shaped their sons' lives, from their free spirits and work ethic, to their specialized educations, to their vocations, to their choice of wives for whom love and art were one, inextricably linked. As in fairy tales, both wishes-for art, for a family enterprise-came true, but not at all in simple, happily-ever-after fashion.As an enterprise, Shearwater Pottery began after the family's move in 1918 from New Orleans to Ocean Springs, a place where the beauty and wildness of the natural world led inevitably to the making of art. Oldest son Peter was 22 or 23 when he built a kiln in the side of a hill. One of the pleasures of &quot;Dreaming in Clay&quot; is its careful record of what was involved in the making of modern pottery, and an artistic community, in a &quot;sleepy coastal town that had never had more than a nodding acquaintance with art.&quot;Slowly, amid Peter's ongoing education with established artists intrigued with the experiment at Ocean Springs, the family worked to perfect the technical aspects of producing pottery: the right kiln, the right glazes, the right touch with wheel and hand-thrown pots. The Andersons were getting a business on its feet, but artistic concerns were paramount from the beginning: More than 2,500 pots considered unacceptable -- sometimes entire kilnloads -- were intentionally destroyed before Shearwater opened to the public. The name for the pottery came from a book about birds but was used in tribute to Mississippi's black skimmers, which shear the surface of the water to scoop up small fish. The name reflects what has become Shearwater's enduring connection to the Mississippi landscape.In writing &quot;Dreaming in Clay,&quot; Maurer and Iglesias were given access to the family's archive, and it is in the letters of the day that the family's struggles and triumphs come most vividly alive. Nowhere is that more true than in the stories of the two oldest sons, Peter and Walter Inglis (called Bobby by his family), and the women they would marry, sisters Patricia and Agnes &quot;Sissy&quot; Grinstead. Pat was &quot;transported&quot; the moment she saw the handsome Peter Anderson, and was immediately adopted as a &quot;true&quot; member of the clan. Bob's courtship of Sissy was long and arduous, and drew him into producing decorative pottery and figurines at Shearwater as a livelihood, a way of showing that he, too, could support a wife. The two were married in 1933; four years later, Bob had a devastating mental breakdown. Not long after, Peter, too, was hospitalized, suffering from depression. Peter's illness was more easily treated; Bob's involved a more prolonged hospital stay, and the latest, and most extreme, of psychiatric treatments. When he returned home to Ocean Springs he would find his art again but never be a part of the family in the same way as before.The book's account of Sissy and Pat Anderson is fascinating in its picture of women determined that both love and art would survive. The resolve of all the family to see each other through, no matter what, helps make &quot;Dreaming in Clay&quot; a highly readable and remarkable testament. We're able to appreciate the survival of Shearwater Pottery into the 21st Century in part because it is also the continuation of a family that has lived, and lived through, its passion for art."},{"Title":"Dreaming in Clay on the Coast of Mississippi","review":"This is a great book telling a wonderful story of art in America. This is what American art is all about and how this little pottery enterprise made its mark on the art world. You will enjoy this book very much."},{"Title":"Dreaming in Clay on the Coast of Mississippi","review":"It is my privilege to be the first person to review DREAMING IN CLAY. I'm sure many others will find it a great book to read and review.This wonderful book presents the life of a master potter, Peter Anderson, his work, his immediate and extended family, and the evolution of Shearwater Potter in Ocean Springs, Mississippi. It is a book about transformation and affirmation of a family who has strugged and triumphed and the interconnections of the Anderson family, their air, and their love of nature and simplicity.The book is thoughtful and contains information, facts, and anecdotes that inspire one to travel to this small southern town on the Mississippi Gulf Coast to experience the magical feeling of Shearwater Pottery.The authors were clearly diligent in their research and fluid in their writing. The book is filled with fascinating materials that clearly describe the life of this master potter, his talented children, brothers, family, and their reception in the world of art. The authors have written in a manner that makes this unique family come alive to the reader.The book is also unique in the fact that it not only speaks of the great work of Peter and his brothers, Walter and Mac, but also, it is the story of the strong Anderson women who are there to support their art and life dedications.It is a fantastic book. The memoir left me with the sense of &quot;tell me more&quot;.

My daughter (about to turn 6 and going into K) just didn't get the concept of blending. She's smart enough to figure out word patterns (at, rat, fat, cat) to give you the answer your looking for, but put those words in a book and she couldn't figure out how to sound those words to save her life. This was a back door for us, I didn't tell her we were going to read, just learn a new word to spell today. Before we got to spelling, I just said we were going to play \\"What's that sound\\". (I didn't tell her or say we were doing the lessons from the book, it was just fun and slow paced for her). It's a game that I made up...I asked her to write the letter that liked to make the sound \\"t\\" and so fourth, until she learned the phonograms. When I began spelling with my daughter, I followed the instructions of dictating the word and starting with the first word on the Ayres List \\"me\\". I modeled and told her that I would spell \\"me\\" and explained out loud as the book describes. Then the next day or a few days later I would ask her to spell \\"me\\" in her spelling notebook. I end each week by giving her pop quizes to see how well she retains the words we have covered from the Ayres list. We will be moving on to \\"I spy\\" games...where I will ask her to \\"hunt for\\" the words she knows in books to get her slowly started reading. This book really helped me to figure out that my daughter just couldn't handle too much information at once, she just gets a bad case of sensory overload and this is the only program that is working for her. I am VERY SLOWLY starting her back on HOP, because I like the leveled readers for reading practice. She still struggles, but without the TWRTR I don't know what I would have done.Some have commented on how cumbersome the book is and I'll agree with that, I wish there were a companion with all that information formatted in a lesson plan layout. It would save me the trouble of scanning over pages and pages to make sure I don't miss anything (this is the only reason I didn't give five stars). I also know another home school mom whose entire family uses it and they have given me a few key pointers that helped make our lessons go smoother.Your child, by the way, does not need to learn to write at a young age to learn the sounds. There are passages that explain how to teach at each age level (from at least 4 yrs, 5 yrs, K and up--I can't remember if it explains for younger than 4 yrs old), but you better get out a pencil and write notes in the margin as you read, because it is hard to find the instructions for each age. I did have to read this book cover to cover over Christmas break to get the \\"big picture\\" and with the progress my daughter has made, I would say it was worth it."},{"Title":"Writing Road to Reading 5th Rev Ed: The Spalding Method for Teaching Speech, Spelling, Writing, and Reading (Harperresource Book)","review":"My daughter started reading some phonic cards when she was almost 5 and I was immediately in a panic that I couldn't explain why ow made an O sound in blow and an ow sound in clown. I found this book and in less than six months her penmanship has improved beyond my wildest expectations and she is able to read early reader books on her own. It has been so empowering for her and for me to be able to have a framework for why we pronounce things the way we do. We have encountered very few exceptions to the rules presented in the book. While I feel that the notation system presented is too complex for my daughter, she is able to use the ideas behind the notation (that each phonic unit has multiple sounds that are listed in order of use). For example, if she gets stuck on a word, I can tell her \\"that is the second sound of c\\" and then she can sound it out herself."},{"Title":"Writing Road to Reading 5th Rev Ed: The Spalding Method for Teaching Speech, Spelling, Writing, and Reading (Harperresource Book)","review":"I did not use this book while teaching my child to read. This book requires the child and the teacher to learn a complex system of notation. More than just learning the different sounds letters can make together, this book requires you to number, actually write out and memorize a number, for each letter than can be sounded out in more than one way. So the words you learn to write, spell, and read are diagramed with numbers. It's very complex. I would not even attempt to teach my child using this system. It seems very frustrating. This program also requires the child to be able to write everything that is to be read. My child is beginning to read well and enjoys practicing writing, but he is not required to write the word before he can progress in his reading. I recommend instead Phonics Pathways by Dolores Hiskes and the excellent starter books by Nora Gaydos in the Now I'm Reading series."},{"Title":"Writing Road to Reading 5th Rev Ed: The Spalding Method for Teaching Speech, Spelling, Writing, and Reading (Harperresource Book)","review":"The Writing Road to Reading (WRTR) is an amazing method. It is based on the research done by Dr. Samuel Orton beginning in the 1920's. His research delved into the how and why of learning to read and the difficulties some children experience. His results were nothing short of astonishing. He discovered how all children can learn successfully. His method used all the modalities: visual, auditory, kinestic and tactile. Romalda Spalding, a teacher, worked with him for approximately two years. She developed the Spalding Method based on his research and his direction. The Spalding Method is laid out in full in the WRTR. This program is a K-8 complete curriculum. The cost is amazingly low, while the benefits are amazingly great.I am teaching three of my children this method; two have started this method at the beginning of their school career, the other began at age 10. Although, the 10 year old did not have difficulties with language the method greatly benefited her logical reasoning when reading and spelling. It also greatly improved her cursive handwriting. She started the program at a grade 6.2 reading level, progressed to grade 9.8 within six weeks and then grade 11.2 at the end of another six weeks. My eldest is a gifted child, but this does not negate the amazing progress that she made using this program. I have no doubt that every child will improve, although possibly a slower rate.I just received my copy of the new 5th edition of Writing Road to Reading. This program has had the widest recognition for intensive phonics programs. The book is very comprehensive. There are 70 phonogram listed and still the 29 rules. The big change that I really like is the way in which they present the ayres list. Each word has the rule (if any) beside it and an explaination. The book contains sample dialogues and more of the spalding philosophy that you can find on the website.Two other features are the scope and sequence at the end of the book and the book list further broken down into grade level. The scope and sequence tells you what is learnt per grade and breaks down the grade level objectives. Beginning on page 205 there is a chapter on Children's literature recommendations. This list is updated as to publisher and recommends good literary sound books not readers. Dr. North explains the reason for using such books is the benefit of rich language.It contains added literature teaching. It also goes into detail about how to teach comprehension in relation to the book list. Sentence structure, word usage, and different types of composition are also included. Basically, it goes into more detail and is laid out in a more comprehensive manner. I believe that this book will encourage more people to use this program. It is both teacher and home educator friendly.The phonograms cards in the book are not really cards. There are are 7-10 phonograms per page. For instance, the letter &quot;a&quot; has two columns beside it. The middle column includes how you say the three sounds. The column on the right has more explaination and the rule that goes with it. I would photocopy the pages and then laminate them for your use. You could easily make a set of phonogram cards for the child, otherwise purchase the new cards from Spalding. I would guess that the new cards would have the added explaination on the back. That might be a question for the Spalding Institute. The big difference is that all the information is on one side of the page. The pages are not cardstock, but regular book paper.The research I and others have done on language arts curriculums demonstate that methods that are based on Dr. Samuel Orton's work are superior to all others. The Spalding Method, being written by a teacher, is far easier to teach and more logical for the students then all the curriculums I have reviewed.

I had my fears and doubts all the way up until I said \\"let's just do it\\". Now I will never try another reading program again. I've taught my 6 yr old dd from the ground up on how to write and read. If any of you homeschoolers are scared of this book- DON'T BE- just keep in mind it is written for professional teachers in a classroom. Keep it simple- and search on the internet about how you can implement this method for one child. It will be so so so worth it. You will notice results in 1-2 weeks tops. KEEP IT SIMPLE. I found a really good website on how to teach it to just a few children and it has worked without a doubt. Once you have started this program you will begin teaching the notation system without even realizing it, it becomes second nature when you are studying words on the board. And the kids really do get it, trust me. My 6 yr old already knows 4 spelling rules and how to apply them to spelling and reading words(it has only been 1 month). The concept of this book is to study the sounds, spelling, meaning, and pronunciation of words- not just how to say them. My kids think it's so much fun to break the code of each word studied. And that's what it's all about. Just jump in and go with it, take a day each week to look back at what was covered, and you'll begin to notice you've been teaching the method explained in all those pages. If the steps are confusing to you, write a simple outline diagram of the chapters. Don't give up, this book is well worth the price and the knowledge."},{"Title":"Writing Road to Reading 5th Rev Ed: The Spalding Method for Teaching Speech, Spelling, Writing, and Reading (Harperresource Book)","review":"this is a must for anyone involved in teaching anyone (especially challenged pupils) to read.

I only wish the government knew the secrets revealed here, then the \\"no child left behind\\" program would actually see real benefits. can't recommend this highly enough.

I found the layout of the book very cumbersome. I have used many different texts as I have homeschooled my daughter and this book is by far the most difficult to use. The instructions provided in WRTR for reading, writing and spelling are not at all well defined. It is not clear where to begin and where to end. I budget for my daughters school books every year and I now find myself having to invest in more books to cover these topics as well as putting us about 2 months behind schedule for this schoolyear.

Although this program says its a full language arts cirriculum, I find that I use it mainly for spelling. The word lists are divided into word list A-G, H, I, J, K all the way to Z and it doesn't really explain what grade level the words are (which I would like to know). I like that the phonograms are emphasized throughout the word lists and as well as spelling rules, but there are some errors on the phonogram lists and phonograms cards you can buy seperately. There are also letter blends and combinations that are not covered which I think would make things easier.I didn't give it 5 stars due to the phonogram errors, and the fact that for me, its easier to use one of the many handwriting or grammar type workbooks to teach how to form letters or form sentenses than trying for figure out my own lessons from scratch each day (Spalding recommends about 3 hours per day just in studying language arts). That is just too much. I think it is a good reference and I am going to continue using it for spelling this year but I may switch if I find something I like better. I recommend checking it out at the library and look and see it that is something you really want to use. Also the phonograms are taught on a youtube video downloaded by Spalding education so that maybe helpful for you."},{"Title":"Writing Road to Reading 5th Rev Ed: The Spalding Method for Teaching Speech, Spelling, Writing, and Reading (Harperresource Book)","review":"As a first grade teacher in southern Mississippi, I feel that the WRTR program needs to be rethought for kindergarten and first grade. Eighty percent of my students recieve free lunches and are not exposed to any enviromental print or books outside of the school. Over half of my students attended kindergarten at our school and were taught the Spalding program. It took me the entire first nine weeks of school to reprogram the children. Because they were taught that the letter \\"a\\" can make three sounds and the letter \\"c\\" can make two sounds, they could not even sound out the word \\"can\\". For example, the child would say.. \\" c (k) (s) - (a) (a) (a) - n \\" This was very frustrating and cost the children precious time in learning. It also caused them to fall behind in reading. As far as spelling, I feel that children should be spelling words that he or she may see in context during the week. Our school district is using a basal reading program for reading that also has a spelling program. My students do not see many of their spelling words in the stories that we read. Research shows that children should see the words many times to be able to remember the distinctive spelling. For example, homonyms such as meet and meat can only be taught through visual repitition. The rules in Spalding will not help a child distinguish between the two words. The child will learn by seeing the word used over and over in print. I am not sure how first graders at other schools manage to remember the rules or even to remember to bring the little book home or to school. My students have gone through several little composition books and still do not bring them back to school. First graders also have problems remembering rules and rule numbers. Remember we are teaching so much to these little minds. The only plus I have for this program is the phonics flash cards. However, I feel that kindergarten should only do basic phonics and then first graders should start learning some of the second and third sounds."},{"Title":"Writing Road to Reading 5th Rev Ed: The Spalding Method for Teaching Speech, Spelling, Writing, and Reading (Harperresource Book)","review":"Writing Road to Reading is an excellent phonics program.

It was spelling disaster for him and so I went back to the Writing Road to Reading and started over with phonics and spelling and the results were the same as before- fantastic.This book has all the spelling rules I missed when I was in school like \\"one\\" doesn't make any spelling sense until you learn that it comes from the word \\"lone\\" and when the \\"l\\" is dropped you are left with \\"one\\". Or \\"two\\" again, not phonetic but we probably once said the \\"w\\" in \\"two\\" like we still do in \\"twin\\", \\"twice\\", \\"twain\\" which all refer to two things.The spelling list is here in great detail and as a bonus in the back of the book is a great reading list through grade six."},{"Title":"Writing Road to Reading 5th Rev Ed: The Spalding Method for Teaching Speech, Spelling, Writing, and Reading (Harperresource Book)","review":"Thanks for the book.

I read it over a few times and took a few weeks to digest and think about whether to use it. It is a comprehensive program that is going to take some work on the part of the teacher to learn and understand the systems before you can teach it (which is why I think some people don't like it - they don't want to put the work in). But you also must realize it is a reading, writing, phonics / spelling program all in one. Most other programs cover only one or two of those areas. I have used it for about 6 months with my children (neither of which are even \\"school age\\") who are now almost 4 and 5 1/2. They really enjoy it. The idea of teaching ALL the sounds a letter can make is wonderful! They can easily understand that this is the 1st or 2nd sound of the letter and are daily trying to sound out words that they know. The teaching of all the double and triple letter phonograms prevents the frustration of them trying to sound out every letter, which won't work because the sounds change in these combined settings. They know the 1st 45 phonograms and are starting the A-G words lists - reading and writing. Obviously, you have to talior the system to meet the needs of your students - going as fast or slow as they may need (another idea that some commentors have missed). I believe however, anyone willing to put a bit of work in at the front end and commit to the program will see success. In in age where the government is watering down the school system so kids look successful, this program is solid and teaches kids the rules of phonics / spelling (another point people complained about in other comments)so they can learn to be successful readers on their own! They won't have to wait for a teacher to give them the spelling and pronunciation of a word, they will be able to do it on their own and be real thinkers and learners."},{"Title":"Writing Road to Reading 5th Rev Ed: The Spalding Method for Teaching Speech, Spelling, Writing, and Reading (Harperresource Book)","review":"This is a great program, but very difficult!

So, while the book is inexpensive, it is really not enough to do the program. You have to have those cards!Also, I was disappointed in the general approach...I believe this program is probably mostly used in the home environment, however, this book is definitely written with the classroom in mind.

NOT in this 5th edition.They are in the EARLIER editions (little 3 1/2\\" squares that you can either cut out and laminate or make copies and paste onto 3x5 index cards if you don't want to ruin the book). The info on the cards is in the book, but not in the flashcard format--they hope that you will buy a set from them.Also missing from this 5th edition but present in earlier editions (via one of those floppy 33 1/3 speed records) is a recording of the phonograms--why they didn't include a CD with this new edition and raise the price a tad is beyond me. You have to go to their site to buy a recording.As to whether the 5th edition is an improvement over the previous editions, I have mixed feelings. Yes, there is more \\"teaching info\\", such as the dialogues the teacher should use (which you may not bother with if you homeschool), but in some ways it makes it more difficult to actually get to the lessons per se. The word list is extended. It still uses their \\"clock method\\" of teaching handwriting, which makes for that very round, old-fashioned \\"school\\" look. Many schools now teach D'Nealian, which supposedly is easier to transition to cursive handwriting later (imho, they should teach Italic calligraphy instead). It still has samples of the notebook pages, but in a different part of the book than where the teaching dialogues are (again, they assume that this book/system is being used in a classroom, and you have the laminated posters, as well as laminated flashcards for everyone). The earlier editions have the full-size sample pages right next to the actual lesson.I actually felt it necessary, after buying the 5th edition AND after borrowing an earlier edition from my library, to buy one of the earlier editions (4th) used on Amazon in order to get the flashcards and the recording, as well as to more easily understand the lessons, because in the earlier editions the information is more or less presented and you move on, as opposed to being discussed at length as it is in the 5th edition.Also, I was disappointed that the 5th edition, unlike previous editions, is printed on newsprint (it resembles a smaller phonebook both in heft and feel when you turn the pages) and not on better quality paper--I'm skeptical as to how long it will last over time, and with what is essentially a reference textbook, you want something that will last for more than one child.Bottom line: the system is great. However, this 5th edition seems to really be written for classroom teaching--I feel that for homeschooling parents and someone learning on his own, that they would be well-advised to get an earlier edition (4th or 3rd) with the floppy record if you have access to a record player. The 5th does have an extended \\"parts of speech\\" writing portion, that the earlier editions don't have, but there are more interesting grammar books out there, for example, some of Karen Gordon's books."},{"Title":"Writing Road to Reading 5th Rev Ed: The Spalding Method for Teaching Speech, Spelling, Writing, and Reading (Harperresource Book)","review":"We have tried several reading programs, but this is by far the best. Your child will learn handwriting, phonics, spelling, and most of all, reading! After just a few months of using the program my children's reading took off. My first grader can read on a fourth grade level, and my third grader can read on a sixth grade level. Do not confuse this all new book with its predecessor (4th edition). This book is twice the size of the old version and includes step by step instructions for implementing the program as intended by its creator, Romalda Spalding. You can't beat the price either.Other guide books exist to use with the WRTR, but it would be a waste of your money to purchase them. Stick with the original and best! Although the program may seem difficult to implement at first, it is worth the time and effort and will repay your diligence many times over - stick with it and enjoy the benefits.I can't say enough good things about this program. If you're looking for an effective and lasting program to teach your children to read (and spell and write), do yourself a favor and purchase The Writing Road to Reading.For more information on this program, including detailed sample lesson plans, visit www.spalding.org"},{"Title":"Writing Road to Reading 5th Rev Ed: The Spalding Method for Teaching Speech, Spelling, Writing, and Reading (Harperresource Book)","review":"I am a first grade teacher in a public school and am currently taking a 45-hour class on this book! I can't imagine just picking the book up, reading it, and being able to implement it. I started this method with my first graders after the first two classes I took. I, too, thought the \\"marking system\\" to be ridiculous AT FIRST. But, I am totally amazed by how quickly a 6-year old can pick it up. What might seem totally confusing to adults is actually fairly simple to a child. The marking system enables the child to thoroughly analyze the words they write, and eventually they will internalize the rules of our language. In just 4 weeks, I have really seen remarkable results in my students. This is a fantastic book for any educator!

It is a godsend for anyone helping a non reader of any age. It is a tremendous asset to home schooling parents. The Writing Road to Reading is a total Language Arts program. The 5th edition has simple instructions for implemetation. There isn't another Language Arts program on the market which is as comprehensive. The Writing Road to Reading begins with the fundamentals of handwriting and phonics and proceeds through spelling, grammar, reading and comprehension. It is modestly priced. The simple paper back book will serve generations.

Secondly, it is helpful to have a mentor who teaches their children in a way that appeals or applies to your own situation.I was only able to use this book with someone who was experienced in using it.I have to say I TRULY enjoy using this book to teach my children to read and as they learn to write, they dont even realize they are learning to read by learning the uses of their letters as phonograms and such. All the information you could need is in one book, though there is a catch to it. It is not organized in a way that is understandable to a person who isnt familiar with the concept. There is a lack of organization and structure because the information is broken up throughout the book and/or chapters.EXAMPLE: If you are teaching phonograms to your children, it is not in just one place. You have to go to page 300 to explain it to the adult. Then, page 67, to explain to to your children, then page 89 to teach its correct written form.BUT there is a way to get the benefit of this book... without ALL the hassle. (BECAUSE the book is a truly valuable teaching tool for parents, teachers and children.) Writing Road to Reading has produced a teaching manual to help you format your teaching according to grade.

I am currently 34 years old and learned the Spalding method at a private school when I was growing up. I won Spelling Bees and went to speech contests and still seem to be able to \\"edit\\" or spell check better than any computer can. I took all of this for granted until it was time to decide where my child would go to school. The one thing I HAVE noticed is society, as a whole, is failing to properly teach our children to write, read, and to speak. I'm even finding grammatical errors on my teacher's aids and on billboards and on the ticker tape at the bottom of the news at 9. This has raised a red flag for me. It seems there are millions of people (including a LOT of people I know), that are horrible spellers, don't enjoy reading, can read, but have issues and are slow readers. As I've asked around and poked my nose into finding out why, I truly believe the method of learning how to read via the \\"Spalding Method\\" has helped me and grounded me in the area of language arts more than anything else I have learned in my life. I truly DO NOT trust any other method on the face of the earth as there is too much failure surrounding me. Grown adults who attended private school (as I did), but learned to write and read through a different method, cannot write nor read nor spell very well. I would love to put my child into private school and have the means to do so. There is not a private school locally that currently uses the Spalding method, therefore, I am forced to homeschool. This book alone can be confusing. This book, paired with the teacher's manual for the grade one may be interested in, will help one TREMENDOUSLY. I had the book, and then ordered the whole \\"kit\\" from spalding.org and now we are sailing through Kindergarten and LOVING IT! I read the Writing Road to Reading, 5th Rev Ed once. Then I jumped into the teacher's manual and we did a couple of weeks of school. I felt I was \\"missing\\" something, so I just skimmed the important parts of the Writing Road to Reading again, and magic happened. The whole method and why it works and why the psychology of it stays with you for life, just sunk in like water on fresh mowed grass. YES! Even though I had learned through this method and was reading at a college age level in second grade, I did not know what magic my teachers had performed and had to \\"be taught how to teach\\" for myself. FYI, the spalding.org website also has online \\"chat\\" to help you through any \\"bumps\\" along the way."},{"Title":"Writing Road to Reading 5th Rev Ed: The Spalding Method for Teaching Speech, Spelling, Writing, and Reading (Harperresource Book)","review":"Kids can pick up a lot more than you realize, Penelope. I learned to read using this same method, when I was a kid in the 1970's, and to this day, I never mis-spell a word, and I still remember all the markings, rule numbers, and phonics sound numbers. I have taught my own kids to read with this method, and in kinder and 1st grade, they could spell better than most 5th graders. They automatically remember to underline phonograms and number them according to which sound they make. I totally disagree with Penelope who said Spalding is too complex for kids to learn - kids are like sponges that soak up everything you teach them. When they learn the rule numbers and markings, it becomes second nature to spell, write, and pronounce things correctly when reading. For example, you underline \\"th\\" in a word, because you don't want the child to say \\"t\\" and then \\"h\\". By underlining it, they learn to recognize \\"th\\" as a separate sound. If it says \\"thin\\" then that's the first sound of \\"th\\", but if it says \\"this\\" then you put a #2 above the underlined \\"th\\" to show that it's the 2nd sound of \\"th\\". It's not hard - my kids picked it up right away, and they even recognize and point out phonics sounds and rules while reading. There are also rules that they learn to recognize, such as rule #2, that says the letter \\"c\\" always says it's 2nd sound (s) if it's followed by an e,i,or y. My kindergartner can understand that and recognize it in words, so why shouldn't an adult understand it? If an adult doesn't understand it, it's because she hasn't taken the time to study the method before teaching it. Yes, you do need to spend time reading the method first, but it's worth it, when you see your kids reading and spelling better than kids older than themselves."},{"Title":"Writing Road to Reading 5th Rev Ed: The Spalding Method for Teaching Speech, Spelling, Writing, and Reading (Harperresource Book)","review":"The Writing Road to Reading (WRTR) is an amazing method. It is based on the research done by Dr. Samuel Orton beginning in the 1920's. His research delved into the how and why of learning to read and the difficulties some children experience. His results were nothing short of astonishing. He discovered how all children can learn successfully. His method used all the modalities: visual, auditory, kinestic and tactile. Romalda Spalding, a teacher, worked with him for approximately two years. She developed the Spalding Method based on his research and his direction. The Spalding Method is laid out in full in the WRTR. This program is a K-8 complete curriculum. The cost is amazingly low, while the benefits are amazingly great.I am teaching three of my children this method; two have started this method at the beginning of their school career, the other began at age 10. Although, the 10 year old did not have difficulties with language the method greatly benefited her logical reasoning when reading and spelling. It also greatly improved her cursive handwriting. My second child was destined to have learning difficulties; he exhibited all the signs. He now is meeting all his milestones.The research I and others have done on language arts curriculums demonstate that methods that are based on Dr. Samuel Orton's work are superior to all others. The Spalding Method, being written by a teacher, is far easier to teach and more logical for the students then all the curriculums I have reviewed.

I am now a high school sophomore in an Advanced Placement English class.I am definitely teaching my future children this.

I have seen average gains of two to three grade levels in reading. For those reviewers who claimed the book was too complex, or did not teach homonyms or homographs, they are doing the method wrong. The method starts very basic with simply learning the shapes that go into making letters, then letters, then words. Kindergarteners do NOT write the words. First graders do not write the rule numbers. When they do begin writing the numbers, they are not complex and are easy to rember such as \\"Rule 4: A (or any vowel) may say a (the name a) at the end of a syllable. (You do not say the parentheses). There are some harder rules but they are taught at the upper grades when those rules come into play in grade appropriate words. After the weeks spelling words are dictated, then there should be an appropriate grammar lesson to deal with vocabulary, homonyms, homographs, word usage etc. If you want to skimp and do the method they lazy way, then yes, you may not get the results you want. However, if you do the method in its entirety, you will see wonderful results. Children learn what we expect them to. I have collegues that teach in primary grades that see excellent results. For example, one teacher uses this method to teach English to non-English speakers. Another used this method with his third grade class that was comprised of all below grade leve, border line special education students and by the end of the year, they all tested above grade level.

I've been reading it, and it seems that you start off by teaching your child to write the sounds as they learn the sounds. That makes sense, but do I really need a ginormous book to tell me this? The books doesn't have clear lesson plans in it, and it's really hard to follow. I feel like it really just make recommendations, and it doesn't seem to go in order so you're constantly flipping back and forth from chapter to chapter. For instance, the spelling chapter goes through and gives suggestions on how to teach all of the upper and lowercase letters in manuscript. Then it tells you that at around 2nd grade you should begin teaching cursive, and it has the directions for teaching cursive immediately after the manuscript teaching. Well, you're not really going to teach cursive right after teaching manuscript, so you have to skip all of that and go to the next chapter until you are ready to teach cursive. I've used other curriculums before, like Abeka and Explode the Code and I feel as if they have the same method of teaching reading, but present it in a more user friendly manner. I think I'm going to stick with using other curriculums, so I feel like this book was a waste.I'm not saying that this book is totally useless. It's a good method.

I consider myself to be fairly smart, I have a college degree and taught in a public school, but this Spalding method looked like a foreign language to me. I have no idea how children can memorize these numbers and be expected to write tiny numbers by their words before they can really even write well.

When they go on the hunt for the Devil of Doe Springs hijinx ensue.I enjoyed the whole thing. I enjoyed a werewolf who accepted her condition and even saw some use in it. I enjoyed her power and her intelligence. I also enjoyed the canine aspect - Rex, the terrier was the best character in the book as far as I'm concerned - and the true hero of the story. Read the book just so you can meet him, if anything.I found the werewolf lore fascinating, along with the werewolf interaction.I do think the author skipped around from viewpoint to viewpoint a little too much. And I felt there were still some questions that needed to be answered. And Melvin, the love interest, needed to get that stick out of his butt. The bad guy was thoroughly repulsive and evil - there was nothing redemptive in him. Gloria, the sheriff, was a beautiful character, so was Tee. I think the one thing I would have liked to have seen differently was letting Auf, wolf-hybrid, get more paper time with action scenes.Now you know, I look forward to the sequel to this novel.

But something else has also come to Doe Springs. Unlike Ivy who only stalks the guilty, this something else is much less discriminating.Do not buy this book if you are expecting a paranormal romance, this is sold under the Berkley Horror line and the story is focused on the action and behaviour of werewolves.Although I didn't enjoy this story as much as I'd hoped to, there were parts of it I very much liked. I always love it when an author includes clues, which get the reader thinking. The sentence in German from the platter, the story written by IV in the back of Lykanthrop. How all these individual threads come together to reveal the mystery at the end. Also the fact that Ivy is a pale wolf whilst the other is dark, brought to mind the story about how we're all born with two wolves inside us fighting for dominance and the one who wins is the one we feed.There are some fantastically written set pieces - the scene with the kids in the woods looking for a werewolf is straight out of horror movie central. Full of atmosphere and tension, and from the moment things go pear-shaped you are waiting for at least one of them to get picked off.I much preferred the second half of the book. The pace of the story builds up and we actually start to find out things about Ivy. Not only about her past, but also how she actually feels about things, as the world she's built for herself in Doe Springs comes under threat.All the way through I was trying to work out why I wasn't connecting with the characters. I felt like (especially in the first half of the book) I had a pane of glass in between me and what was happening on the page. It was a couple of days after I finished reading that I realized everyone in this story is alone. Ivy, Melvin, Gloria, Tee, Meeks, Ava. Sure, Ivy has her dogs, her pack, but apart from Doc's family there are no human connections in the book. Melvin desperately wants to make a connection, he wants a wife and family, but he's thwarted. I guess one of the things I like to see in a story is the emotional growth of the characters in some way, and I felt that was missing.At the end of the book I don't feel I ever got to truly know Ivy. I appreciated the story, and at the end it's satisfying how everything comes together.

Ivy Cole, a young woman who moved to town a year ago, is a werewolf who kills when the moon is full, but only people who deserve it in her opinion, like animal abusers, wife beaters etc. But she's not the only werewolf in town and she's the only one who can stop this ruthless creature that kills farm animals and innocent people, even children, for fun. But since she's on the short list of the sheriff's suspects and in love with one of the deputies, who has started to take too much of an interest in her activities, this is far from simple...This is a very intelligent and atmospheric novel with great characters, an interesting story and crime plot, some humour and a lot of heart. The author has also done extensive research into wolf behavior and the history of werewolf belief, which shows and gives the novel background and realism. 'Ivy Cole and the moon' is much better than most werewolf novels and I would highly recommend it. There is also a sequel with the title 'Luna' if you liked this book."},{"Title":"Ivy Cole And the Moon","review":"Great read. Interesting story that often goes in an unexpected direction. Kept me turning pages, right on to the second book Luna. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Ivy Cole And the Moon","review":"SPOILERS ALERT-------This is an excellent story about werewolves. Ivy lives in a small town in the mountains called Doe Springs. She's got a big heart for animals and shows it by all the stray dogs she's collected. Ivy's new to town too, she's not a lifer. And she's beautiful. Seems on the night of the full moon once a month dead animals and now people are showing up. Ivy takes her gift seriously and only kills those who will not be missed, but who's killing the livestock? Soon suspicion will turn to Ivy because of her excellent dog training and her big black Shepard. She's also attracted the attention of Deputy Sanders, who would like nothing better than to court the beautiful Ivy. But she can never let anyone close, unless of course they are like her, hiding the wolf.I loved this book from the start. It's a real page turner and I immediately liked Ivy. The author did a good job of slowly unraveling Ivy's past and not revealing who the animal killer was. I realized it after about 250 pages. But then I still wasn't positive.The sheriff is haunted by the death of a little girl that was never solved. It even destroyed her marriage. Interesting how that will come into play. How this plays out as a bit a side mystery is excellent. I would have liked to know what happened to Tee. I know he was killed but nothing was found of himself or his dog.Melvin is a great character; he just never seems to make right when trying to talk with Ivy. His keeping of her book and having it translated was good. But it's never translated for the reader, which was disappointing.The ending as well was great. Plenty of room for a sequel. However, I'm wondering, since Ivy is with child and it's one of the deputies, exactly when did she have relations with either? There wasn't a scene that I remember where she mated with the other wolf or where Melvin stayed over. Seeing as how this child is the kickoff for the next book, wouldn't it have made sense to tell the reader where the deed actually happened?For a werewolf book, which is what I love, this was great. Can't wait to read the next one and this one will have a permanent spot on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"Ivy Cole And the Moon","review":"I have been blasting through the Anita Blake series and a few other paranormal stories with vampires and werewolves, and I normally don't go about writing reviews, but when finishing this book I felt I needed to put a word or two out there about it. What an awesome book with a fabulous story. After being pelted with so many different visions of what the werewolf is, it was great to just settle down with a good spooky werewolf novel that didn't ooze sexual tension. This was a flat out excellent book with an outstanding story and some well crafted characters not to mention a swell villainous character and a few story twists that keep the mystery going at a quick pace. Well done Gina Farago! I look forward to your next books, whatever the story content might be; but Ivy is definitely a superior heroine character who I would like to see return down the line."},{"Title":"Ivy Cole And the Moon","review":"Ivy Cole and the Moon is not your traditional werewolf novel...and that's exactly why I enjoyed it. Be forewarned, this book does have certain influences borrowed from the romance genre, yet it's not overdone. In particular I enjoyed the setting: author Gina Farago gets high marks for the ease with which she planted me, the reader, smack dab in the little Appalachian town of Doe Springs. Checking with Cullen Bunn, an expatriate resident of North Carolina, Ms. Farago seems to have accurately added all the right touches that brought the feel of the place home for me.As the main character, Ivy Cole is both believable and likeable, though not squeaky clean. After all, she does eat a few people. But hey, they deserved it! Ivy uses the full moon and the power it brings her to good use. She rights wrongs, and in the process implicates herself in an ongoing serial-murder case run by Sheriff Gloria Hubbard. The complications multiply for Ivy when she finds herself falling for one of the sheriff's deputies. And it soon becomes apparent that Ivy is not the only lycanthrope hunting the backwoods surrounding the community.I hope there's a sequel coming out sometime in the not-too-distant future!"},{"Title":"Ivy Cole And the Moon","review":"It started out well, but the longer it went on, the less interesting I found the story line. The vengeful werewolf idea was appealing, but I don't like the way the book skipped from the different character POVs. I also found the writing acceptable, but not extraordinary. The romance was also pretty crappy. IMHO."},{"Title":"Ivy Cole And the Moon","review":"In \\"Ivy Cole and the Moon,\\" Farago's use of the language creates rich, vibrant images in the mind of the reader. The book is so vivid, I dreamed of roaming the Blue Ridge with wolves for days after I'd finished it. Ivy Cole comes alive on every page and made me yearn to go outside and howl at the moon. I can't wait for the sequel!"},{"Title":"Ivy Cole And the Moon","review":"Ms. Farago has created a tale with her smooth, almost poetic writing style that was impossible to put down.This werewolf story has heart, charm, gore, drama, suspense, mystery. Highly reccomended reading!For a more in-depth review, see Insidious Reflections issue 6."},{"Title":"Ivy Cole And the Moon","review":"Gina Farago is the new Master of Horror. All others, step aside.Like how Dean Koontz writes, Farago is smoother and more even paced.Remember how Steven King used to be able to scare you, Farago will will have your blood frozen in your veins.Like James Patterson's characters, you'll love the ones in this book.Haniable Lecter wishes he was as likeable as Ivy Cole.Derry, Maine is cold and unbelievable next to Doe Springs, NCLestat is not nearly as devious as Farago's bad guys (or good guys for that matter).The police work in the book is acurate, logicial, and understandable. CSI and Law & Order worthy.This book is a true find! You will never regret having bought and read this one. You'll love it and reccomend it to friends! They'll love it and think you a genius for it!"},{"Title":"Ivy Cole And the Moon","review":"Hello all believe it or not but I am the real Ivy Cole and this book touched me in many ways that no one could believe. I had not met the author but she reached deep into my soul and knew me and my very thoughts. He sequal Luna is just as amazing. Her skills as a writter keep you spell bound and totally enthrawel. I find myself going back and re-reading these book. A third should be on the way, I hope. Be ware the shape shifter inside us all. Remember to trust your own instinct it can be clearer than you realize my friends."},{"Title":"Ivy Cole And the Moon","review":"This is a great book but the only thing that irked me, was how the book favored dogs more than humans. More sympathy is given to dogs, if I wanted to read a dog-based book than I would read the Dog Whisperer...I was looking forward to a story about a werewolf, not a dog rights activist who prefers dogs as friends to humans...geez I know that sometimes society/humans can be cruel, but there is always someone out there who is sweet and honest."},{"Title":"Ivy Cole And the Moon","review":"I found this book boring and regretted paying for it. I didn't really care what happened to anyone and started skipping sections so I could \\"finish\\" it."},{"Title":"Dr. Folkman's War: Angiogenesis and the Struggle to Defeat Cancer","review":"This book clearly deserves many more than five stars.Dr. Folkman's War contains many valuable insights including how to: Raise children to be outstanding people; be an astute observer about nature to unlock new lessons; pioneer in a new field of science; and be persistent about something important. When the history of medicine in the twentieth century is written, Dr. Judah Folkman will be considered one of the most important figures. This book is the most accessible and complete source of information about his remarkable life and accomplishments.Dr. Folkman's research to date &quot;has found applications in twenty-six diseases as varied as cancer, diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration, psoriasis, arthritis, and endometriosis.&quot; &quot;Ordinarily, researchers working in any of these fields do not communicate with each other.&quot;Angiogenesis looks at the way that capillaries are formed in response to the body's biochemistry to help and harm health. Tumors depend on this action to get the blood supply they need to grow. Wounds also rely on a similar mechanism to grow scar tissue.I have been following Dr. Folkman's career for over twenty-five years, and heard him speak about angiogenesis just a little over two years ago. Because I felt I was well-informed, I almost skipped this book. That would have been a major mistake on my part. Dr. Folkman's War contained much new and interesting information that helped me to better understand the lessons of Dr. Folkman's life, as well as the future implications of angiogenesis.Unknown to me, Dr. Folkman had also played a role as an innovator in implantable pacemakers, time-released drug implants, and specialized types of heart surgery before he began his serious assault on angiogenesis.The discoveries had their beginning in 1961 when he was a draftee in a Navy lab in Bethesda, Maryland. He noticed that tumors could not grow unless they first recruited their own capillaries to bring an increased blood supply. &quot;Over time, he convinced himself that there had to be some way to block the growth of those blood vessels.&quot; He was right, but it took a long time before he knew any of the answers.In brief opening comments about the book, former surgeon general C. Everett Koop, M.D. and Sc.D. observed how this new science evolved. &quot;In the 1970s, laboratory scientists didn't believe any of it.&quot; &quot; . . . [T]he critics' objections were hushed for good in 1989.&quot; &quot;In the 1990s, the criticisms came chiefly from the clinical side, and the pharmaceutical companies didn't want anything to do with angiogenesis.&quot;The story is a very heart-warming one. Dr. Folkman's father was a rabbi who asked each member of the family each night what she or he had learned that day. He also constantly implored his son to &quot;Be a credit to your people.&quot; His father clearly thought that Dr. Folkman would also become a rabbi. Having announced his attention to become a physician, his father told him, &quot;You can be a rabbi-like doctor.&quot; This injunction was one he took to heart, often seeking out his father's counsel on how to console the families of his patients.His first taste of how close mortality is to all of us was when his first two children inherited cystic fibrosis. The younger of the two died, and the older one needed lots of special care to deal with infections. This probably made him a better doctor, by helping him see things more from the patients' points of view.Space constraints keep me from discussing the book's description of how angiogenesis developed, but if you like stories about trail-blazing research, you will be amply rewarded. The key hurdles are described, along with the blind alleys that were followed. Anyone reading this will see how important it is to add new skills to the study of any new subject.I was particularly interested in the way that press reports tended to harm the progress of angiogenesis, either by annoying other scientists, attracting hucksters, or delaying key deals with potential partners. We often think about freedom of speech being helpful, but here the case is a mixed one.My only disappointment with the book is that it does not provide as much clinical data about the drugs under testing now as has been made public. That material would have made for fascinating reading. There are also natural substances that can cause a tumor to shrink, and clinical studies have been very successful in growing and shrinking tumors for some time.I suspect that some member of your family will live a longer, healthier life due to future treatments soon to be available using angiogenesis. This book is a great way to learn more about the subject now, so you can encourage exploration of these experimental therapies where possibly appropriate. If anyone in your family now has cancer, this book is must reading for you!Dr. Folkman summarized the book nicely as follows: &quot;Success can often arrive dressed as failure.&quot; &quot;If your idea succeeds everybody says you're persistent. If it doesn't succceed, you're stubborn.&quot;May we all live longer and healthier lives due to the emerging medical treatments using angiogenesis . . . that were helped by Dr. Folkman's persistence!"},{"Title":"Dr. Folkman's War: Angiogenesis and the Struggle to Defeat Cancer","review":"This is the extraordinary story of an extraordinary man. Dr. Judah Folkman's approach to fighting cancer, long the subject of derision from the medical and research establishment, is finally bearing fruit. Robert Cooke writes beautifully and clearly, combining a scientific biography of Dr. Folkman with an introduction to anti-angiogenesis. Read this book- when Judah Folkman wins the Nobel Prize, you'll know all about him. (A sidebar- a Amazon customer reviewer, who pans the book, is under the impression that it is written by Dr. C. Everett Koop. It is not. He does however, write the introduction, which ends with these words, &quot;In the end, of course, Judah Folkman's beautiful idea has triumphed over the doubters. A few still persist, but their time will come.&quot;)"},{"Title":"Dr. Folkman's War: Angiogenesis and the Struggle to Defeat Cancer","review":"I'm in med school, and I've heard a lot about Dr. Folkman, so I was curious to read why he's so mythologized. Now I know! This is an inspiring book -- it reminded me how hard you have to work, how brilliant you have to be, and how lucky you have to be just to have a CHANCE to make a huge difference. Dr. Folkman was all three. THe author does a real service, too, in explaining the history of cancer research -- not easy to do in an engaging yet substantive way."},{"Title":"Dr. Folkman's War: Angiogenesis and the Struggle to Defeat Cancer","review":"Robert Cooke does an amazing job of rendering what could have been a dense scientific discussion of anti-angiogenesis and its role in treating cancer, into an engaging and meaningful discussion that someone without a medical background can easily understand. Cooke aptly chronicles Folkman's career ups and downs, and ably captures the doctor's frustration of being a scientist two decades ahead of his time.The real message in this book, however, is one of triumph in the face of scorn and ridicule. That Folkman's peers - be they colleagues at Boston's Children's Hospital who sought to have him ousted from his position as Chief of Surgery or to have his laboratory closed, or the anonymous reviewers at the medical journals where he submitted his papers describing his thoughts and findings in anti-angiogenesis who refused to publish his work finding it too implausible, or the conference attendees who would simply walk out of one of his scientific lectures thinking he was a crackpot - could subject him to so much difficulty in pursuing his scientific vision speaks volumes about how we, even in this modern era when we are supposedly more open minded, have trouble dealing with a visionary. Most of us, in Folkman's shoes, would have moved on to something else.Now that Folkman's ideas have come of age - science finally possesses the tools to validate his work and we are seeing the fruits in clinical trials around the country - I truly hope that his early critics will have the courage to acknowledge their error. As Cooke reminds us, genius can be very hard to recognize. Now that it is upon us, however, shame on those who continue to diminish it.This book is ideal for anyone possessing a fascination with science or medicine, anyone who appreciates stories of personal triumph, or anyone who is interested in how insight can be mistaken for heresy. Furthermore, as someone whose family has been touched by cancer, I found the book to be incredibly insightful in understanding the disease. Cooke's writing is clear and concise, and the Folkman story is incredibly engaging."},{"Title":"Dr. Folkman's War: Angiogenesis and the Struggle to Defeat Cancer","review":"When I first started reading the book I thought it was going to be more about Dr. Folkman's life and not about medicine. You quickly realize there is no difference as far as Dr. Flokman is concerned. Medicine has been his life and fortunately for us cancer research his passion. I was stunned to find out he has helped discover; cardiac pacemakers, drug release systems and a cure for an incurable childhood disease all while being a world-renowned pediatric surgeon. These life saving stories will bring tears to your eyes. All this alone would make for a great book without ever mentioning angiogenisis. However, the quest for a major cancer treatment while putting up with the critics and red tape read like a major military battle through which this man has prevailed. You will feel his passion."},{"Title":"Dr. Folkman's War: Angiogenesis and the Struggle to Defeat Cancer","review":"The discussion of Dr. Folkman's relations with corporations and the business of medical research is another great aspect of this superb book."},{"Title":"Dr. Folkman's War: Angiogenesis and the Struggle to Defeat Cancer","review":"Folkman is a paradox in the medical research world. He is a highly talented and committed surgeon by training - a profession ruthlessly focused on \\"results - now!\\" and often comically averse to academic molecular research. At the same time, following an early experiment during his conscription days for the navy, he set himself a path of just such academic molecular research. Part of the troubles he's had come from the cognitive dissonance that accompanies his appearance at conferences - the scientists don't want to hear a surgeon lecture to them, and neither do surgeons want a scientists to speak. In combining two disciplines he often fell between two stools.More than that though, his focus on angiogenesis initially made no sense at all for cancer research. When he first postulated that stopping a tumour required stopping the blood vessels, he was often, and probably justifiably, laughed at. At the time, researchers were elucidating the reasons for a normal cell's conversion into a cancerous one. Painstaking molecular experiments pointed to a sequence of random mutations, whose accumulation correlated with the cancer's aggressiveness. Be it radiation, viruses or old age, the common mechanism of all these tumour causing agents was their ability to induce mutations in cells. Stop the mutations, and you stop the cancer.Why on earth bother with the surrounding, normal, non-cancerous blood vessels?Folkman's epiphany, and subsequent stubbornness, rests upon the experiments he performed while in the Navy. Given free reign after completing his initial assignment, he teamed up with a pathologist. They played around with tumour cultures. Growing them in petri dishes, they observed a mysterious phenomenon. Although the tumours grew aggressively once placed on a mouse' skin, they would not grow beyond 1 mm on the dishes. Comparing the tissue on the dishes with the tissue on the skin, the only difference was the presence of blood vessels in the latter.So began Folkman's long journey. And it is a fascinating and historic journey. Along the way, he became Harvard's youngest ever Professor of Surgery. In particular, it was an appointment in Paediatric Surgery, at the Boston Children's Hospital - an appointment that shocked many, as he never been in formal Paediatric training. This was soon remedied by a personal, intensive 6-month course with the great Dr C Evert Koop himself, the father of paediatric surgery.Later, as he struggled for funding to research his ideas, he inked a multi-million dollar research agreement with Monsanto. This made history, as the first major agreement between a commercial enterprise and Harvard - at the time, staunchly refusing such tainted money. It opened up the floodgates for many future agreements, that lay the foundation for the reality of American research today - a lucrative and productive partnership between industry and academia, that helps maintain US research the envy of the world.Interspersed amongst this is a story of an intensely hard working young man, who attracts to his lab young researchers of similar nature. It took twenty years for his team to get the evidence the academic world needed to accept angiogenesis. But, they got it. And it's a great read to find out how.Truly - seminal."},{"Title":"Dr. Folkman's War: Angiogenesis and the Struggle to Defeat Cancer","review":"I have read quite a few books about the science of disease research and this is one of the best yet.

A good number of the other reviews detail many events that make up the life of Judah Folkman which won't be repeated here. The \\"war\\" of the authors title can relate to the many that Dr. Judah Folkman fought during his life: being Jewish in the 50's and overcoming prejudice in getting accepted into the best medical schools, rising to the pinnacle of his first career as a pediatric surgeon, improving the daily operations of emergency rooms, deciding to leave the surgical field for research on cancer, striking out and developing a novel theory on tumor growth and being ridiculed by the medical orthodoxy, scrimping along to find research funds but ultimately identifying the underlying mechanisms of tumor growth and new treatments. His views and discoveries were ultimately proven correct and recognition and awards were to follow. His ideas and inspired thinking still reverberate in the field of cancer research to this day. If he had lived longer there is no question he would have been a Nobel prize winner. I find his life story inspiring and would have desired to have known him personally. I have bought copies of \\"Dr. Folkman's War\\" to give to my nephews as they start their academic and professional careers.

Inspiring account of one man's life's work that is be leading to a great leap forward in cancer treatment!**I must comment on the negative reviews by &quot;Dr. Fitzgerald&quot; and &quot;George McCartle&quot; below, which I found rather bizarre. (1) Dr. Koop didn't write this book as these empty reviews seem to imply -- suggests that someone is commenting on a book they didn't read, (2) Both of these &quot;reviewers&quot; also trashed a Starbucks book in the same simplespeak suggesting it's the same person probably interested in reducing the overall rating, and (3) It's hard to know what motivates this person but perhaps it has to do with investing interests -- this stuff smacks of stock message board tripe.

After reading the reviewers' praise for Mr. Cooke's \\"detailed research \\" on the book's back cover, I was diappointed by some obvious errors in the book.

Being a cancer survivor, and particularly in touch with the issue as a good friend of mine died from a relapse this summer, I was interested in cancer research. When I chose Dr. Folkman's War, I'm not sure what I was expecting, but it was definitely better than what I had planned. As I began reading the book, I found I could not put it down! The lack of perfect chronology at times confused me for a minute or two, but it's not hard to pick up on. Anyone who has had their life touched - directly or indirectly - by cancer should definitely read this book. It takes you through a basic history of cancer research, and, having been written this year, ends with very current and pertinent information for anyone interested in the current direction of cancer treatment. For people struggling with a terminal illness, it is quite heartening to realize that there is a person out there who is working so hard to make you feel better. My favorite part of the book is at the end where Dr. Folkman tells some of his young proteges and interns to never ever tell a patient that nothing can be done. It may be small, but you can hold a patient's hand, and look out the hospital window with them, point to the research building and say, &quot;Do you see that building over there? That's the research building. We're working on it.&quot;"},{"Title":"Dr. Folkman's War: Angiogenesis and the Struggle to Defeat Cancer","review":"Through long, arduous practice, Buddhists believe it is possible to remove the lens of self-interest and dogma to perceive &quot;absolute reality,&quot; with &quot;automatic compassion.&quot; After reading Robert Cooke's biography one believes that Dr. Judah Folkman has never looked at medicine any other way.But the emperors of the scientific establishment have never dealt kindly with the boys who can't see their robes, as Cooke points out with several examples. (The Hungarian doctor who demonstrated that deaths from childbirth fever could be eliminated if doctors washed their hands was hounded by his colleages to suicide.) Dr. Folkman's heresy was the observation that tumors can't grow without stimulating healthy tissues to supply new blood vessels.Fortunately for all of us, Dr. Folkman's vision has been matched by his persistence in pursuing it. In following Dr. Folkman's path from his boyhood in Ohio as the son of a rabbi, to Harvard where he gained his self-confidence, to the Navy research lab where his angiogenesis hypothesis first formed, and back to Boston as a pediatric surgeon-scientist, Cooke makes what might have been a difficult and technical story into an epic adventure.In keeping with the fashion that writing a biography in chronological order is boring and passe, Cooke instead follows parallel thematic threads in Dr. Folkman's storied career. I personally found the resulting forward and backward jumps in time distracting, but not insurmountable.It would have been enough if this were merely a story of scientific progress and the triumph of a new idea over entrenched dogma, but it is also the story of a man whose vision is matched by his devotion to his patients. It should be required reading for all prospective medical students.Now angiogenesis-based therapies for cancer, atherosclerosis, blindness and arthritis are on the verge of exploding on the scene and Dr. Folkman's lab at Children's Hospital Boston is ground-zero. He and the generation of doctors and researchers that he has helped to train are revolutionizing huge swaths of medicine. When it happens it will seem like it was overnight, but those of us who have read Robert Cooke's book will know it was a lifetime in the making."},{"Title":"Dr. Folkman's War: Angiogenesis and the Struggle to Defeat Cancer","review":"This book by Robert Cooke is incredible! Mr. Cooke is able to explain to the average layperson the medical concepts of angeiogeneis conceived by the most under-valued person of our time: Dr. Judah Folkman. Dr. Folkman is to cancer what Salk was to Polio! Personally, Dr. Judah Folkman is my hero! A real hero, deserving of the Nobel Prize....and I don't speak lightly. I am a cancer patient that has recently learned that my cancer (thought was beat) has advanced to my lungs. The ONLY therapy for me is in an ANGIOGENESIS drug therapy program for a drug currently in study and labeled as &quot;PI-88.&quot; I am just so confident this drug will work.

The good news is, for nearly 40 years, Dr. Judah Folkman has been pursuing a cure for cancer -- or at least a way to fight tumors more effectively than chemotherapy or radiation -- that only until very recently has garnered serious attention. Dr. Folkman's theory is called angiogenesis, the process by which cancer cells emit an agent which triggers the growth of blood vessels to feed the growth of the cancer itself. For years Dr. Folkman's idea was basically scoffed at as the flailings of an amateur researcher, but Cooke shows how Dr. Folkman has perservered -- while maintaining his brilliant career as a physician -- and eventually, through a slow accumulation of experimental evidence, as well as the discovery of several antiangionesis agents, turned opinion around. Throughout this engaging and fascinating retelling of Folkman's journey, Cooke also provides an eye-opening account of the workings of academia, medical research, and their relationships to those Orwellian biotech companies you keep hearing about. The science is clear and vivid, the battle to defeat cancer inspiring, and the promise of victory -- thankfully, finally -- just around the corner."},{"Title":"Dr. Folkman's War: Angiogenesis and the Struggle to Defeat Cancer","review":"Dr. Folkman is my kind of doctor and my kind of researcher.

Folkman asked the questions that needed to be asked concerning cancer and tumor production, and in spite of all the negative reviews and downright nastiness of his scientific peers, he persisted in practicing good science. This ultimately led to major discoveries about how cancer works, as well as other necessary biochemical information that is now taught on a daily basis to medical research students in neuroscience and other fields.Folkman is one of those people who are in science and medicine for the benefits of others, as well as because he enjoys what he does. These are the types of people who ultimately do the most good. They quietly persist in their endeavors, and let their work tell the story. Too many times, scientists allow their questions and the answers to those questions to be influenced by the egos of their peers, the quest for fame and money (especially in biotechnology and genetics), and by fear of ridicule. It is unfortunate that so much science is done in labs throughout the world in such a way as to crush those who have unique ideas and can add creativity to the scientific endeavor.Folkman obviously made his lab a wonderful place to work in. To do that and be a good teacher, as well as an excellent researcher (who cares if he is a surgeon...it's the questions that are asked and researched that are important, not who does the asking). Those who were able to work with him and in his lab had valuable experiences, that happens all too rarely in the labs in this country. I was lucky in that I got mentors who were neuropathologists who dealt with both patients and research, and they were great teachers.Cooke is a wonderful writer. I intend to look for his other books because he did such a wonderful job with a topic which could have been boring. He explained the science behind angiogenesis in such a way so everyone can understand it. He also described the not-so-nice and competitive world of research science...nailed all the personalities involved! I had to laugh at much of this because I totally understood about the biased peer review and the political games which go on in this world.Karen Sadler,Science Education"},{"Title":"Dr. Folkman's War: Angiogenesis and the Struggle to Defeat Cancer","review":"Why Medtronic must build Folkman Institute for Angiogenic Research in Boston?

I have recommended this book consistently since 2004 and not one person ever came back to me and said - it was anything less than stunning! It is a cancer history book loaded to the brim with fact after fact after fact. Thus, there are a LOT of facts. But woven into the history of cancer research from the 1960's to around the late 1990's is a rich, touching and personal story of one man dedicated to a vision. This book was highly educational and I have a copy that I lend and one that I will not lend out. It is that important. If you want to learn about cancer and what has happened in the last forty years, this is one of the best books in my humble opinion. I can't say like one of the other reviewers that I have been following Dr. Folkman's career for a long time. I never heard of Dr. Folkman until this book was recommended to me by a cloistered nun.Thank you Robert Cooke for this outstanding book! May God Bless you abundantly for your efforts on this! I agree with one of the other reviewers who wrote that this book should get more than 5 stars. I do think some people will have a tough time reading it due to the science and the facts just to be fair, which is why I pray that it gets made into a movie!! Love, Lisa A.

In the 'publish-or-perish' 'world of medicine, his broad-mindedness brought a great progress in the treatment of giant hemangioma, diabetic gangrene, diabetic retinopathy, or coronary heart disease, to say nothing of cancer therapy.Dr. Isner's comment about Dr. folkaman is intriguing.&quot;Plenty of other people in that position, had they reviewed that paper, would have rejected it and then set their own laboratories to work on that subject, or they would maybe have stalled the paper, or done anything they could to have stomped out any potential competition. But he did just the opposite. He promoted it.&quot;He was never territorial or overly protective of this field he had invented and happy to help other scientists push ahead, even if they were competitors.He must be the ideal &quot;Boss&quot;."},{"Title":"Nightfighter: The Battle for the Night Skies","review":"Harboring a long time interest in night fighters born of first-hand experience, when I came upon a used hardcover copy of this book, I bought it. In this short (less than 220 pages of text) book, Mr Delve covers the entirety of night fighting from World War I through 1995, when the book was originally published. 30 pages are spent on World War I, 10 on the interwar years, 149 on World War II and finally, 22 on the post war period until the 1990s. Mr Delve rightly spends the vast majority of the book on German and British efforts against each other during World War II which is when the vast majority of action and innovation occurred. 5 appendices provide interesting supplemental data about somewhat random subjects.I enjoyed learning of the origins in World War I when the only way to find the enemy was sound, ground spotlights or an extremely lucky visual pickup. German Zeppelins raided England, spawning the need for night defense. World War II provided the catalyst to innovate. Ground and airborne radar, Ground-Controlled-Intercept (GCI), various electronic measures and countermeasures (ECM) etc. Finally, a vary broad summary of the postwar years.That being said, the book left me with more questions than answers and no where to get them. Not a single footnote or endnote to lead a reader to more information. No bibliography whatsoever.With all the gadgetry in World War II, there was little or no explanation of the equipment or how it worked, only mention of names. What was the difference between a British Mk I and Mk VIII radar? The reader never knows. Why was the magnetron such an important invention for the British and Americans? What IS a magnetron? Don't know. Numerous mentions of code names for gadgets (Naxos, Monica etc) with no glossary for easy reference. Nonetheless, the World War II sections are generally interesting, if frustrating to read. Numerous grammatical and spelling errors litter the pages.However, it is the postwar analysis where the book runs off the road. There is a photo of a US Navy F9F Panther wrongly identified as an F2H Banshee. There is a photo of a YF-22 with not a single mention of it in the text. The 1991 Gulf War is identified as the largest military conflict since the Korean War, a fact that the 58,000 Americans killed in Vietnam would surely dispute if they could. The Gulf War is declared to have had \\"no night aerial action\\". I suspect the MiG-29 shot down by the F-15 of USAF Capt J Kelk shortly after midnight on the first night of action might argue the point. Not a single mention is made anywhere of Night Vision Goggles (NVGs), in widespread use long before the book was published. The author declares that, in modernity, the Night Fighter and the All-Weather Fighter have morphed into the same creature. Long experience has taught aviators that no amount of technology or training will ever turn night into day.If what you want is a \\"50,000 foot view\\" of night fighting, this book might fit the bill. Otherwise, I will continue to look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Chevrolet and GMC Pick-ups, 1988-98; C/K Classic, 1999-2000 (Haynes Manuals)","review":"Unfortunately, Haynes once again fails to deliver on its promises.This manual covers 12 years worth of Chevrolet and GMC truck platforms. I could list the dozen or so models with the various sub-models, but it would take up too much room. I'll just say this: There is a night and day difference between my grandfather's old 1989 Chevy Silverado 1500 2wd long bed truck and my buddy's 1999 GMC Yukon 4x4.And yet Haynes covers them all in about 250 pages. How is that possible? Well, by cutting corners, being incomprehensibly vague, and touching only briefly on the major subjects of interest.I bought this manual primarily as a supplement to the diesel repair manual I bought from Haynes. I figured at least I'd be able to use this as a reference for my interior repair work and auxilory wiring system checks. Alas, I over-estimated Haynes once again. There is nothing vehicle-specific in here...and why would there be? Haynes is trying to pack 12 years worth of 12 models into 250 pages.This manual is worthless.

Their books go into great detail on easy things like unbolting an alternater, but are very sparse on more difficult things like transmissions, emissions, ignition, torque specs, capacities, and wiring -- exactly the things I need vehicle specific information on. Haynes manuals pale in comparison to more comprehensive manuals published by Bentley. I have a Bentley manual for my VW, I wonder if there is a similarly conprehensive manual for Chevy trucks.

In all revealed world religions the coming of the Kingdom is identified with the appearance of the Supreme World Redeemer, the Lord of Hosts, the returned Christ, the Qa'im, the new Buddha and about 1850 Baha'u'llah announced that he was this redeemer and the bearer of God's message to modern man. Ignored by the kings and rulers whom he addressed, he died in the Holy Land in 1892, an exile and captive of the Turks. Today there are followers of the Bahai Faith in every nation on earth. Townshend was particularly interested in that part of the Lord's prayer &quot;Thy Kingdom come&quot; and investigated whether Baha'u'llah was in fact the returned Christ. He found that a large number of people gathered in the Middle East in the 1840s waiting for Christ's return, but in vain as they overlooked an important clue in the Bible. 'Christ and Baha'u'llah' is the story of his investigation and in 1957 he decided to put his findings in book form to make it easier for others to conduct their own investigation.Townshend starts the chapter on &quot;The False Prophets&quot; with these words: &quot;As Jesus had prophesied, the false prophets contrived to change the essential meaning of the Gospel so that it became quite different from that which the Bible recorded or Jesus taught. It has long been generally believed that Jesus Christ was a unique incarnation of God such as had never before appeared in religious history and would never appear again. This tenet made the acceptance of any later Prophet impossible to a Christian. Yet there is nothing in Christ's statements, as recorded in the Gospels, to support this view, and it was not generally held during his lifetime.&quot;Three chapters discuss Muhammad, but I found these excerpts helpful in understanding the relationship between religions. &quot;Muhammad was already about 40 years old when he began to teach ethical principles similar to those in the Old Testament and to proclaim the succession of the prophets, including His own succession to Jesus Christ, whose Divinity and whose Gospel he called His believers to accept. But after a few years he found Himself forced by severe and continuous persecution to leave his native town for Medina where he at once began the execution of the real mission of His life, the building of a spiritual nation.&quot; And &quot;To the Christian Muhammad showed the greatest kindness, insisting that all Muslims should fully accept both Jesus Christ and His Gospel, and assuring them in the Qur'am (Sura 5 verse 85) that they would find the Christians nearest of all men to them in affection, He took them under his protection.&quot;If you are uncomfortable about the religious truths that have been handed to you; if you are uncomfortable that religious friendship has turned into religious rivalry; if you are open to learn about the evidence that convinced Townshend that Baha'u'llah is the returned Christ, this is a good book to study."},{"Title":"Christ and Baha'U'llah","review":"There is revolutionary thinking in every part of taday's life. People are told to step outside the box and look at previously proven ideas from a different angles. This has led to many discoveries.But, when it comes to religion, all minds seem to be closed.

Judaism and Budhism are omitted but the chapters describing Christian, Muslim and Bahai history were very informative. Others were too evangelical for me and made some large leaps in reasoning. Still, even if I were a devout secularist I would not be able to resist the vision of world unity described in the final chapter.The notion that Baha'u'llah was Christ returned will make many Christians uncomfortable, but then, if you await Christ's return, exactly how will you discern when it happens? With all its imagery, Revelations does leave room for interpretation.If you are secure in your belief that the religion you were born into, or have since converted to, represents the whole truth and has no peer, then a book like this should pose no danger. In the other case, it may be what you are searching for."},{"Title":"Every Room We Ever Slept In","review":"What poets want is for the reader to see through their words the visions and emotions that compell them to write. However, at its best poetry can be a terrible mess of private metaphor and internal struggle. After all, poetry is essentially compressing a snapshot of one's mental state into a few words; and I consider that lossy compression, indeed. True artfulness is uncovered when the poet's mind state and personality can be decoded effectively by a reader through only the words available...and I feel Shinder does this better than most of the poets I've read.I had the great luck to experience an introductory poetry class taught by Mr. Shinder, and as such got to know him fairly well. He was terribly anxious a lot of the time, as if he was sure what was happening around him wasn't quite perfect but he was going to let it happen anyway. He has a great perspective on his art, and has great friends in the world of poetry...and had the decency to drop Ginsberg's name only once every few hours (joke). But paramount to Shinder's personality was the great wisdom that eminated from him. Discussions with him were great fun because they seemed to go beyond standard discourse. Nothing was hidden, and his speech (while never curt) was always honest and directed at details intrinsic to the text.This book captures his dialectic nature, his openness and his anxiousness in a way which is masterful and yet easy to grasp and love. My fiance, a rough and tumble geologist who cares more for microbrews than micropoets, read every line of this book and nearly cried at some of the more vulnerable parts dealing with the anxiety of uncertain love (a dominant theme). If you enjoy poetry which is well crafted, well developed and quite meaningful (as well as delightful when read aloud), you must read this book. ...the price of a meal at a good italian restaurant, but much more fulfilling."},{"Title":"Every Room We Ever Slept In","review":"Jason Shinder was a brilliant poet, and his too-early loss to American poetry is incalculable.

It was a revelation to me that dueling was such an integral part of (male) western society over the last 500 years. You will shake your head at the absurdity, tragedy, and occasional glimmers of commonsense that permeate personal combat over the centuries. Barbara Holland's style is breezy and ironic. Some great moments-duelists battling it out in balloons-and interesting close encounters with dueling by such figures as Abraham Lincoln and Mark Twain, Occasionally style trumps content, and there are a few passages that show signs of hastiness or sloppiness, but this is a minor defect.PS: Teen and preteen boys will love it!"},{"Title":"Gentlemen's Blood: A Thousand Years of Sword and Pistol","review":"I find myself wondering if were dueling still legal whether someone would challenge the author for casting aspersions on the practice.All jokes aside, &quot;Gentlemen's Blood&quot; is a witty and engaging look at a social custom that seems incomprehensible in the late 21st century. Reading it, I could only think of how many stupid things are done in the name of honor and manhood.I disagree with the negative comments about this book. I don't think the author is a &quot;hack,&quot; and I don't think that she spares the readers descriptions about how unpleasant it is to get stabbed or shot. Pushkin's death from being gut shot in his last duel is a particularly vivid image that she describes.I also think that people should not read it expecting a deep discussion about swordplay and gunslinging. The book is meant to be amusing and informative, and it certainly is.The only criticism that I have against &quot;Gentlemen's Blood&quot; is that the author's thesis that modern day warfare is just dueling writ large is idiotic. In the past, some wars --particularly those of absolute rulers-- had features of duels, however, I would submit that an event like World War II or Vietnam is nothing like a duel."},{"Title":"Gentlemen's Blood: A Thousand Years of Sword and Pistol","review":"Barbara Holland has a winning way of bringing historical figures vividly to life. For instance, our illustrious presidents are all too human in &quot;Hail to the Chiefs,&quot; her delightful romp through American history (updated to include George W. and reissued by The Permanent Press, 2003). In Holland's &quot;Brief Heroes and Histories&quot;--many gathered from biographical sketches previously published in &quot;Smithsonian&quot; magazine--figures from Cleopatra to Elvis to Marx are re-examined with a fresh and funny perspective (Akadine Press, 1998). &quot;They Went Whistling&quot; (Random House, 2001) is closer in structure to &quot;Gentlemen's Blood,&quot; in that the most interesting people and stories have been carefully sifted by Holland and served up with flair for our amused edification--in &quot;Whistling,&quot; women who flout the conventions of their times and have Adventures, and in &quot;Gentlemen's Blood,&quot; duels and those who fight them. I highly recommend Holland's latest work. Aficionados of guns and such equipment may be disappointed, as this is a history of duels, not an encyclopedia of weaponry. And anyone whose research methods and subsequent writing can withstand the scrutiny of the &quot;Smithsonian&quot; editorial board is no slouch.

She provides an excellent narrative overview of her subject---and her coverage of dueling in early Western law and the period of the Founding Fathers were excellent.

Clearly the author has not bothered to seriously research her subject--the certain mark of a journalist hack job."},{"Title":"Gentlemen's Blood: A Thousand Years of Sword and Pistol","review":"I read Barbara Holland's description of dueling in Germany with dismay. Not one wit of the practices, purposes, procedures, social functions, legal sanctions, political position or technical aspects of German dueling she describes bear any resemblance to the facts of twentieth century German experience. As the first American after the Second World War to be admitted into a German student dueling fraternity and having fought duels myself, I can say authoritatively that the barbaric, illegal, pointless and grotesque activities described in her chapter \\"The German Version\\" bear no relationship to reality of German dueling over the last century. I'm not talking about missing the mark on a couple of points. I'm talking wholesale wrong, too wild to even try to summarize. If the German material is in anyway representative of the level of research in the remainder of the book, it is not worth the paper it is printed on. Titillating though they might be, the book's subjects of which I have first-hand knowledge are no more than inexplicable fantasy."},{"Title":"Gentlemen's Blood: A Thousand Years of Sword and Pistol","review":"This is a facinating subject, but Holland turns it into an incredibly boring read. While her book has some interesting historical information, one has to read through lenghty and unentertaining anecdotes to get them. Her literary style tends to be sophmoric and unpolished. Perhaps most annoying, her political bent often comes through in her writing, and it can be insulting. This is a book that I could not even bring myself to finish reading, and I cannot recommend it."},{"Title":"Dimensional Man","review":"I've owned Dimension Man for over 10 years now, and it's always a great additional to my wall. It's plenty durable as well, he is still in great condition after all this time. It's fantastic for anatomy reference, and even better at another purpose - creeping out your girlfriend.There's nothing like having your girlfriend walk around a corner to see a fleshless, lifesized zombie presented to her. The reaction is always a priceless mix of fear, anger, and confusion. And don't forget, when the lights are dim or she's groggy from sleep, she's even more apt to catch a glipse of our friend here with reactions ranging from shrieking in terror at the thought of an armed intruder to gasping a sudden breath then wondering why you have that thing hanging by your bed.Nothing combines education and creepy quite like dimension man. I strongly encourage you to purchase one today."},{"Title":"Dimensional Man","review":"This is an excellent source of learning all about the human anatomy (inside and out).

(Perhaps there is another group whose members purchase the book and display it prominently but complete no exercises.) In recent years, I have purchased a number of these books and consider this one to be among the best. (Yes, thanks for asking, I completed the exercises but how well I did is not relevant to this review.) For whom do I recommend this specific book? Anyone who is curious to know what the exercises involve, how well she or he does when completing them, and (of greatest interest to me) learning WHY her or his responses are correct or incorrect. Completing exercises in several different books also reveals certain patterns of thought which stimulate the mind to approach a given problem or question from different perspectives. For example, what do the answer choices share in common? What is missing among the options offered? Over time, we develop certain mindsets. For example, we tend to see only what we expect to see. So-called &quot;brain teasers&quot; force us to perceive a given problem or question differently. The brain is a muscle which, like all other muscles, needs regular exercise. Books such as this provide that."},{"Title":"The Mensa Genius Quiz Book 2","review":"This the second book of quizzes from Mr. Grosswirth, a well- known and long-time Mensa member, who probably goes back 40 years with Mensa. The questions range greatly in variety and difficulty, and there's enough here to challenge anyone from a neophyte test taker to a more experienced, battle-scarred IQ test veteran (like me :-).The question of IQ is a fascinating one, and the problem of accurately measuring human intelligence, despite over 100 years now of research on the subject, is still not resolved. One problem is that progress in the brain sciences over the last 50 years has given us a different perspective on intelligence, and one that current IQ tests really can't address. For example, the brain is really an amazingly complex network comprised of 14,000 major and minor brain centers, and each one contributes some function, some big, some small, to the overall integrated functioning of the brain and of intelligence.So far there is still no IQ test that assesses the true functional integration of the brain, although one could claim that Spearman's G, or general intelligence factor, first proposed by Spearman back in the 20s, is a proxy for that. Also, in the same vein, J.P. Guilford's structure of intellect model divided intelligence into 120 different discrete abilities, and most intelligence tests usually only assess three or four different factors. The DAT or Differential Aptitude Test measured 9, and was better than most in this regard, but technically, it is an aptitude test and not an IQ test, since IQ isn't the same as aptitude, since an IQ test is supposed to measure \\"non- crystallized intelligence.\\"And for you old-time psychometrics guys out there (like me, sort of), remember the great L.L. Thurstone's \\"orthogonal matrices with varimax rotation?\\" (basically an early form of analysis of variance).(Sorry about that; I just had to put that blast from the past in there. :-))Finally, the worst criticism of present-day IQ tests is that a simple, 20-minute vocabulary test can be shown to be 90% as accurate as the longest omnibus and multifactor test, a rather embarrassing fact considering the thousands of man years of effort that have gone into creating some of the most famous and heavily standardized IQ tests. Related to this fact is that the math subtests typically correlate at the .75 level with the verbal tests, which is quite high and should be lower so that a purer factor loading is achieved, although some of the spatial subtests only intercorrelate at .5 with math and verbal. And then there's the fact that the best predictor of college grades (and even of overall success in life) is high school grades, not an IQ test or even the supposed college exams like the SAT.Research efforts have shown that once one reaches an IQ of 120, further IQ points above that level are not as important as social intelligence, something that has come to the fore in recent decades. Unless you want to be a physicist or something, an IQ of 120 is enough for almost any degree or job in life. President Bush probably doesn't have an IQ of more than 115 or so, and look where he got. And the co-discoverer of the DNA Helix, James Watson, has an IQ of 118.Creativity is also a major factor in school and life success. A classic study by psychologists Getzels and Jackson showed that creative subjects with an average IQ of 120 had grades just as high as high-IQ subjects with an average of 140. And studies also show that creative people are happier than those less creative.All this shows that while IQ tests are interesting and are useful in many ways, we still don't know how to really measure intelligence except in a very basic sense."},{"Title":"The Mensa Genius Quiz Book 2","review":"Bought this as a gift, very good purchase. The seller had given a good description of the books condition. There was no damage to the book all the pages were clear of any creases or tears as well as the cover."},{"Title":"The Mensa Genius Quiz Book 2","review":"I have to disagree with everyone else. I found this book boring. Too many of the questions were really easy - and it's NOT because I'm too smart for the book. When you check the answers, quite a few of them indicate that 80%-100% of Mensans got the questions correct. On top of that over half the book is devoted to triva, vocabulary, and culture. With these you either know the answer or you don't - there's no intelligence involved - only familiarity.I assumed this book would entertain me for a day. I hoped it would entertain me for a weekend. Instead it bored me for a little over an hour as I took the quizzes. If you're looking for tests of logic, reasoning, and mathematics skills then this book will be of minimal interest to you."},{"Title":"The Mensa Genius Quiz Book 2","review":"I recall years ago being what I thought was a smart person, but was treated in school like a dummy or just average intelligence.However I always thought someday I'll show em what I can do. As it turned out I wasn't gifted, at least not IQ 140 or more, but fairly close to Mensa level. I have taken quite a few of the IQ tests on the web and scored 138 on one, but 119 on another. So why not pump up my mind as I would muscles? That's why I brought the Mensa Genius book. I rather suspect however that true genus may be IQ 180 and up with creative talents. In any event this book will help you discipline your mind to solve problems, some of which are tedious.The one element I dislike about this book is its chapters on culture. I mean for pity sake what 20 year old IQ 160 is going to know a damn thing about Teapot Domb, Richard Nixon or what an Italian opera house is called ? Talk about cultural bias!However the more straight forward and reasonable numeric and verbal puzzles I think do test intelligence, although I suppose one needs have read to do vocabulary items.The book is fun, but I am sad to say too culturally or should I say cultishly biased for true measures of intellect. None the less good minds will knid the book challenging and perhaps warm them up for the Mensa exam, which I understand costs about 300 dollars, and you must score 132 to be considered in the high IQ club.I bet Micheal Jordon would not pass any of these tests, but his gifts speak for themselves as being outside what Mensa is looking for.Am I Mensa material? Maybe not with all those strange culturally biased questions Mensa loves so much, but the book was a fun read and did sharpen my problem solving skills. I recommend it if for nothing else than recreation."},{"Title":"The Mensa Genius Quiz Book 2","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It was a fascinating read. I really learned a lot.

The book is divided into chapters by tissue of origin for pediatric tumors. The chapters cover their topic in great detail and allow easy reference, especially when reviewing the unusual lesion. Even for the rarest lesions, the references match those of a current search (up to date of publication). As Dehner and Stocker has no recent edition (2nd ed 1987) this book provides an excellent review. Although radiology is not the main focus of this text, the book is perfect for radiologic-pathologic correlation."},{"Title":"Subway Love","review":"Pick up a book called \\"Subway Love\\" by Nobuyoshi Araki, a photographer/pornographer equally notorious for both his documentation of the Kabuki red light district in the book \\"Tokyo Lucky Hole\\" as well as his several arrests for breaking Japanese obscenity laws, and you would rightfully expect something salacious, titillating or even downright dirty. Subway sex, illicit gropings, panty shots captured with ninja-like stealth from oblivious victims, ...the mind boggles at what this master of the underground sex scene might come up with in darkened corners of late night Ginza Line runs.But this is not that Araki. At the time, 1963-1972, Araki was working for an advertising agency, Dentsu, and still finding his voice as an artist. Riding the subway to and from work, he became obsessed with photographing his fellow passengers, partly to kill time and partly because of the empathy he felt with them, all taking the weary daily ride together.The photographs in \\"Subway Love\\" are raw. Printed directly from the contact sheet, there is a marvelous intimacy created between camera and subject, and then between subject and viewer. Araki refused to use his camera's viewfinder for the portraits, wanting them to come off the same way the eye does when people watching, random and uncentered. In a way, as mentioned in the interview following the photographs, this was his attempt to capture filmmaker Yasujiro Ozu's poetry of everyday life. Many of the shots are from low angles, emulating Ozu's tatami-level camera.Raw the photographs may be, but the subjects themselves are reverenced and always treated with the respect that daily life deserves. Araki was sure not to publish embarrassing photographs, no nose picking or sleeping office girls with their legs splayed wide. He called this collection \\"Subway Love\\" because he loved them all, these warriors of the working day, and wanted to show them as \\"individuals, not symbols.\\" There are a thousand faces here, some happy, some sad, some tired, some lively. But each and every one of them is a human being, and probably familiar to all of us who at one time or another have made the journey home on the subway."},{"Title":"Embattled Christian: William Gurnall & the Puritan View of Spiritual Warfare","review":"Is spiritual warfare something we should be concerned about? Bryan Zacharias takes you on a tour of what the Puritans, particularly William Gurnall, thought about the subject. Their Biblical approach concluded that spiritual warfare is indeed a serious subject with which all Christians should be familiar. This book is a good place to begin a sober study of spiritual warfare, which can be a matter of spiritual life and death."},{"Title":"Embattled Christian: William Gurnall & the Puritan View of Spiritual Warfare","review":"The Puritans were seasoned warriors when it came to spiritual warfare. Their emminence in spiritual matters can be seen in part through their writings themselves and by the ongoing influence that their published writings continue to have to this day.'The Embattled Christian' deals with the spiritual warfare that is common to all followers of Jesus Christ. The author refers primarily to William Gurnalls classic(on spiritual warfare)'The Christian In Complete Armour',but he also draws from the writings of John Owen,Thomas Manton,Thomas Watson and Richard Baxter among others.The book can be especially valuable to those who may find the Puritans difficult to read. It is an excellent introduction to what the Puritans have written on the subject of Spiritual Warfare.To understand the great battle that exists for every believer ,there must be a fundamental understanding of the enemies that the Christian must overcome. The greatest enemy of the Christian is the battle with their own inward corruption. Even when someone becomes a believer,they will still stuggle daily with this principle of evil(within them)until the day they die. Mr.Zacharias writes on p.54\\"The Puritans understand evil as lying at the heart of each human person,a fundamental warping of motivation,desire,and choice that turns the heart away from its true source and end,God,and directs it unto itself and the creation.\\"One of the strengths of the Puritans view of Spiritual Warfare,which Zacharias deals with in Chap.3 is the vulnerability and weakness of believers.The devil knows how weak and vulnerable Christians are,but some if not many believers are often ignorant of how weak and vulnerable they often are.'The Embattled Christian'will be of great help in making Christians aware of how weak they are in themselves,how much they need to depend upon the Lord to fight, and what weapons the Lord has provided for them to overcome the World,the flesh and the Devil."},{"Title":"Embattled Christian: William Gurnall & the Puritan View of Spiritual Warfare","review":"If you value the theology and wisdom and inspiration and experience and history of the Puritans this is a book you will want to own. It is only 119 short pages, yet it manages to summarize the entire picture of what the Puritans thought about and practiced and wrote on the subject of spiritual warfare. It also goes beyond that even with very skillful and informative and well-written short chapters on such subjects as prayer and the Puritan view of regeneration. This is simply a great little book. If you are familiar with William Gurnall's famous work the Christian In Complete Armour but have never read it (a mammoth work) this book will not only summarize its contents for you but inspire you anew to go to it for more. Zacharias also manages to include numerous quotes from works on spiritual warfare by other Puritans (more difficult to find than Gurnall). Because this book was originally the author's thesis for his master's degree (he studied under J. I. Packer who has himself written a classic work on the Puritans titled In Quest of Godliness) it reads like a book that has had alot of research put into it, and alot of thought about its content; in other words not just another quickly written title on Christian subject X for a new bookselling season. Highly, highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Wind Boy,","review":"I'm 55 now and have held onto a copy of Elliot's The Wind Boy ever since I was a boy. I remember being read the story and then reading it to myself later. Somehow, and I can't say just how, the story gave me hope -- hope for the world and hope for me as a boy whose father wasn't in the house because of divorce rather than because of a war.If we could all have the chance to see our lives and worlds from the Clear Land, perhaps we could figure out how to love, how to be peacemakers with more grace and ease.Must reading for anyone who could use a little more hope or a greater belief in the magic inherent in this world."},{"Title":"The Wind Boy,","review":"The Wind Boy is not my absolute favorite of Ethel Cook Eliot's work, but it's a marvelous story for young children with creative minds and very well written - and an unsung classic. It's also a blessing that one publisher wised up to the great loss to our generation of the difficulty finding her books - best among them I'd say is \\"House on the Edge of Things\\", also try to get your hands on a copy of \\"House Above the Trees\\". For young adults, \\"The Vanishing Comrade\\" is an ABSOLUTE MUST!! and this book is easy to obtain on www.bookfinder.com (Amazon is one of many booksellers listed there).The basic concept inherent in most of Eliot's books is that all life is interconnected (yet she takes no particular religious tack whatsoever, so the books are truly universal) and that most people (EVEN KIDS!) are simply too jaded to see it, and therefore our blurred vision holds us back from seeing most of the beauty in life. Eliot's characters, however, have clear vision, so we see what some of what they see - a fantasy world unparalleled in modern fantasy lit, in it's idyllic vision. In \\"The Wind Boy\\" Nan comes out of the mountains seeking this particular family, the children clearly in need and in a painful situation, their father apparently lost. She teaches the children what we all need to be taught - she brings magic to their lives. The children go on to share the magic with others. What more should we ask of our own children?I can't imagine a better gift to share with children than Eliot's literature, and while I make no claims at being an expert, I have run the Children's section at a Borders store, I'm a sometime storyteller and I'm a huge collector of children's/young adult lit. If you want a picture book for young kids, and you can't find Eliot's \\"House\\" books (they are almost impossible to come by at any price) try Seymour Leichman's \\"The Boy Who Could Sing Pictures\\" (also out of print but easily available through Amazon or Bookfinder.I bless you to see with clear eyes."},{"Title":"The Wind Boy,","review":"This is a book about a family displaced by war, living in a town which dislikes strangers.

Nan and other characters rescue the children from the relentless prejudice of the people in the town.This book provides comfort for anyone who has ever felt singled out or left out.

He loved it, but so did I. I found myself re-reading the book on my own while running on the treadmill (to keep myself from getting bored). It's so full of beautiful prose and magic and earth and a little of everything. From the first paragaph, I was hooked:Chapter 1 - The girl from the mountains\\"In a spring twilight a young girl was walking down a village street. Just at a glance anyone might know she was a stranger there. For one thing her dress was like nobody's else's.

I recommend it to all families!"},{"Title":"The Wind Boy,","review":"One of the relative few pre-Tolkien fantasies, originally published in the 1920s, \\"Wind Boy\\" is substantially more juvenile than books of that sparse fantasy era. Despite a slightly dated feel, it's a cute little read that children may appreciate as a bedtime story.A strange girl called Nan arrives in response to an ad for a housekeeper, put out by a refugee family in an idyllic little village. The only problem is a mysterious figure, wearing a cloak and a frightening mask, that is roaming around the neighborhood and scaring the kids. Nan drives the Masker away, then helps out the overworked mother and her two children, Gentian and Kay.It is soon revealed that Nan is not all she seems. She brings the two children into the fantastical Clear Land to be fitted for silver and gold sandals that can walk on the air. They also befriend the Wind Boy, a beautiful young boy with a pair of purple wings. Gentian and Kay continue their jaunts into the Clear Land with their friends, until the identity of the Masker threatens all of them.This is a cute little fantasy; the style of it, which includes constant addresses from the author to the readers, is somewhat dated, as is the idyllic village life with such career-named characters like \\"Artist\\" or \\"Policeman.\\" There is no family strife, problematic parents, and there are no villains. However, if the young readers do not dislike these elements -- or lack of them -- then they may like this book. It's ideal for very young kids, as there are no plot complexities or frightening elements.The writing style is somewhat flat, as often the author addresses the readers rather than describing, for example, Gentian's transitions into the Clear Land. However, the biggest bonus are intriguing scenes such as the weaving of the \\"starry-brightness,\\" as well as the charming little illustrations.A cute early fantasy for young kids with a high nostalgia factor. For all sweetness and light, try reading this."},{"Title":"The Wind Boy,","review":"I really liked this book because it made me feel happy and cozy when my mother read it to me at night.

The stories also fit well with the themes of Waldorf education. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Wind Boy,","review":"I recommend this book to people who like fairy tales. I like it a lot because it has good descriptions for the characters and has really great details. I think there is a little mystery involved in it and some parts are a little sad."},{"Title":"The Wind Boy,","review":"Nan, with her clear eyes that reflect the purple mountains, answers an ad to take care of a refugee family who was forced out of their village after the father, Hazar, went to war. This allegory is an ineffable combination of the mundane and the extraordinary. The mother, Detra, works hard in the factory during the week and at night on sculpting a wonderful figurine of the Wind Boy, who dwells in the Clear Land. The kids, Kay and Gentian, find their way there after being fitted for special sandals by the Shoeman, whose storefront exists in the village while the store is actually located in the Clear Land. This place exists a little above the mundane world but dimmer and clearer \\"as if viewed through a crystal\\". The Clear Land calls to mind the end of the 'Last Battle' by CS Lewis where the Pevensies see the mountains connecting Aslan's country around the world. Professor Kirke's house, where their adventures started, still exists there even though it has been destroyed in our world because it is \\"the England within England, the real England just as this is the real Narnia. And in that inner England no good thing is destroyed.\\"Kay and Gentian slip into the Clear Land at different times, listening to music in church, standing in the corner at school, in the deep still of the night, and during a day at the woods. Nan is like Mary Poppins in that she comes to help and leaves when she is no longer really needed. When we first meet them, Kay and Gentian don't fit well in school. Hazar has made his way to their country but has not been able to track down his family. Detra is a talented artist but must work in the factory to make a living for her family. The great artist benefactor of the village has a granddaughter, Rosemarie, who is lonely without friends. The children of the village are being terrorized by a masked figure and since the Wind Boy was responsible for making the mask, he is not allowed to play with the Clear Children, his former playmates. Since the Wind Boy is not happy, Detra's figurine has not captured the joy that should be there.I wish the illustrations had been better or there had been no illustrations at all because they are amateurish and detract from the story. There is one that is okay of the Wind Boy (not the cover) sitting with his knees drawn to his chest. However, the story is lyrical and sweet."},{"Title":"The Wind Boy,","review":"I am so excited to find that this favorite and haunting book from my childhood has been reprinted.

It's a nice story, with good characters, but the magic of it is that it is absolutely beautiful. I have read and enjoyed many books, but _The Wind Boy_ is one-of-kind, and stands on its own. No holds barred, it is the most beautiful book I've ever read. It paints pictures in your mind that are more than pictures, shows you everything in a way that, while in some ways nonsensical--saying that Nan's hair is \\"the color of a forest brook when the sun finds it,\\" (Eliot 15) doesn't actually make sense--conveys more than any actual description ever could, in a way I can't really adequately describe. Eliot captures a world, a reality, as close to us as breathing, but as foreign as the fifth dimension, and makes us understand it. For myself, I believe that it gave me, in part, the ability to conceive of and comprehend concepts that I have no reference for--I simply cannot adequately describe the beauty and magic of this book. It is very, very sweet, and perhaps not terribly exciting to those who are accustomed to novels of high adventure and drama, but _The Wind Boy_ is a masterpiece of art, beautiful and captivating, magical and breathtaking.It is also, to my mind, one of the best arguments against the idea that humans cannot conceive of concepts/things that we don't have words for. Up there with babies (who know no words at all but at the same time know very well concepts like food, hunger, and discomfort).In the end...I suppose I wouldn't recommend this book for a little boy, necessarily, in the same way I wouldn't recommend Heidi to a little boy. I cannot, however, stress enough how very much this book has meant to me over the years, nor can I stress enough the book's breathtaking beauty."},{"Title":"The Wind Boy,","review":"I have the original 1923 edition of The Wind Boy, and it is my favorite book of all time. Sheer poetry, with a timeless message of grace and redemption, compassion and the healing power of creativity that will touch something deep in every child and every adult who reads it.Sadly, after WW2, the author was persuaded to \\"modernize\\" some of the language for a new edition, perhaps thinking that modern children would not be able to relate to words like \\"porridge.\\" The changes are not an improvement. But the story is still beautiful, and several of my young friends have read and enjoyed it.If you can find and afford the original, by all means, buy it.

I decided I loved it so much I must buy it again.For something that you are not expecting in children's books this is for you. The story meanders it's way through. Not fast paced, but gentle, like a stroll through the forest."},{"Title":"The Wind Boy,","review":"I chose The Wind Boy in gradeschool when my teacher was giving away some of her book collection from over the years. This is a story I hoped my children would love as much as I did. When my youngest and I finally read it together she was drawn to it in the same way I was. When I was younger I identified with the brother and sister, who weren't accepted by most of the other children in the village because of different appearance and culture, and I fell in love with Nan as they did. The entire story is charming and draws you into the mystery of who is scaring the village children and how Nan brings joy of life, friends and a little magic into the lives of the brother and sister.

Still, I found this book to be an excellent resource for those who have a singular question regarding syntax rules or for those who are lacking in these skills. You do not have to use the system of codes for referring to the rules, as each subject is listed by the precise rule discussed. There is a section on commas, periods, correct use of verbs,correct word choice, and so much more. It is a complete concise reference book and is more than the average person needs to improve or begin his venture into the wonderful word of proper syntax or writng. Of course, for more advanced or scholarly treatises, a compendium would be needed, and still, this is an excellent jumping off place. I found myself reading the book as though it were a novel I could not put down. I studied Latin in high school and was a student of the old time Catholic grammar schools where grammar was taught from kindergarten through high school using the old system of diagrams. The problem I see today is that the teaching of grammar rules is delayed, and should be taught from day one of mandatory education and continued through college to refine and preserve those skills. I hear and see the destruction of the English language from every level of society. Graduates from the top schools in the country, writers, journalists, commentators, judges, politicians, and the average person defy the laws of grammar and writing from simple basic English to more advanced usage. The reintroduction of our language into the classroom would serve as a foreign language equivalent well worth the effort."},{"Title":"A Composition Handbook","review":"Merriss' and Griswold's Composition Handbook has been around for many years. It is a fine tool to use in composition classes in grades 8 through 12. The book gives rules and shows the student an example of a correct usage and often an incorrect one. The book is ideal for revising papers, which, as most English teachers know, is when much of the learning of correct writing occurs. The book takes a little while for an instructor to learn, because the various grammar rules are referred to by a system of numbers and letters. However, it is very thorough and straightforward. Students are not likely to get confused if they just follow the system. And it works!For more advanced students (and adults)I would recommend Pearlman's and Pearlman's &quot;Guide to Rapid Revision.&quot;"},{"Title":"Cases and text on property, (Law school casebook series)","review":"I am a 1L at Mass School of Law in Andover, and this book was required for my Property course.

The drawings included in the intro are accurate and help to provide me with a visual reference to use while keying. This book does not fit into the genre of the &quot;Field Guide&quot;, and is therefore not recommended to someone interested in simply finding a tree's name.

Other characters swirl in and out of the sphere of the Dew Breaker's new existence in America.The story opens with the Dew Breaker's daughter about to give a beautifully expressive sculpture representing a tortured prisoner to a prominent Haitian-American actress. The father destroys the sculpture before confessing to his daughter that he was not, in fact, the prisoner-figure she thought he was -- the figure she used to inspire all of her sculptures -- but the one who tortured the prisoners. He clearly wants to leave those times behind, but knows he will always be haunted by the fear that he will be found out in his new home, and that he can never make a clean start.We soon leave this story for a time to learn the stories of people associated with the Dew Breaker in some way, however tenuously: his tenants, customers, girlfriends of tenants... Some stories are resolved, and some are not. At first, this disturbed me a little, but then it occurred to me that we don't always know the whole story of people we connect with, nor do we fully understand how much we can influence their lives, even with brief encounters.Besides exploring a universal connectedness, this book beautifully depicted the interconnectedness of the Haitian community, both in Haiti and abroad. I also learned much about the horrible circumstances these people have endured over the years. Finally, the book made me think about how differently people respond to those circumstances. Why do some rise up against oppression, while some join in with the oppressors? What is the definition of a victim? Can the oppressors be granted their chance at redemption, or must they always be seen as villains?The book is splendidly written and a joy to read, even if the subject matter is heartbreaking at times, even in redemption."},{"Title":"The Dew Breaker","review":"\\"The Dew Breaker\\" is easily in my top ten list of most compelling books. I am usually not a fan of short stories, but \\"The Dew Breaker\\" doesn't read as a book of short stories. Edwidge Danticat has managed to string and intertwine the stories together in such a cohesive way that the reader sees them all as sums to the whole, rather than sections.This is such an amazing book to read. There is so much knowledge to be gained and so much compassion to be felt for the Haitians in the terribly brutal Duvaliers era. That the reader can feel unexpected emotions that leave an impression on them long after the book has been put down makes \\"The Dew Breaker\\" an unforgetable and truly inspiring book.I whole heartidly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"The Dew Breaker","review":"That book is very educational. I liked it very much and I will recommend for my friends to buy it and read it. Good work Danticat."},{"Title":"The Dew Breaker","review":"Ka Bienaim&eacute;, daughter of Haitians who have immigrated to New York, couldn't have known the secrets that would be revealed when she was working on the mahogany sculpture of her father, depicting him as a victim of Duvalier's terror. Dark secrets. When she shows it to him, he snaps, destroys it, claiming he's unworthy. Then he tells her about his past, about how he really got the rope-like scar on his face. He was a torturer of men back in Haiti in the 1960s, the scar, he tells her, was the result of an attack by his last victim.Her father had been a member of the dreaded Tontons Macoute, enforcers of the dictator Franois Duvalier. They were called dew breakers because they usually came \\"'before dawn, as the dew was settling on the leaves\\" to snatch their victims away from their homes in the name of Duvalier. Victims that were tortured, many killed, many never heard from again, many who were innocent of any crime, many not even political.From this horrific revelation the novel moves to chapter-long looks at the lives of the people Ka's father had tortured, lives he'd ruined, lives he'd changed. The chapters move back and forth through time, letting us see the dew breaker from the points of view of his family, friends and his victims.Ms. Danticat has written a troublesome novel about a subject many would choose to ignore and that, I suppose, is the problem. For too long in this world torture has been ignored, because good and decent people shudder at the thought of it. And even though Ms. Danticat does a superb job making the Dew Breaker at times seem sympathetic, I couldn't find any sympathy for him in my heart. Forgiveness for men like that, if there is any, should come from their maker, not from us in the hear and now, not from me. That said, this is a wonderful book, just simply wonderful."},{"Title":"The Dew Breaker","review":"Haiti has always struck me as a place with fascinating history, and since my grandparents lived there from 1967-69, I've been curious to learn more about that particular period. This slim novel, which deals at least partially with that era, seemed like a good way to get a taste of life under the repressive dictatorship of \\"Papa Doc\\" Duvalier. It opens with the story of a young woman who's just sold her first sculpture, a mahogany statue of her father. She's on her way to Florida with her father to deliver the piece to the wealthy actress who's purchased it. But this celebratory trip is derailed when the father reveals that the distinctive facial scar he got in prison in Haiti as a young man was not the result of being a prisoner. Rather, it was received from a prisoner when the father was one of theTontons Macoutesmilitiamen who terrorized the country during the Duvalier regime. The horrific revelation kicks off a series of chapters in which the legacy of that regime is examined through the eyes of a variety of Haitians, many of whose lives have been affected by the sculptor's father.The term \\"chapters\\" actually isn't quite accurate -- the sections are really distinct short stories, all of which have links of varying directness to the father in the first story/section/chapter. Indeed, as I later found out, a number of them had been previously published as freestanding short stories. This structure makes for a kind of choppy narrative, as there are not only a revolving cast of characters, but shifts in time and location throughout. While this approach does allow the author to look at Haiti's past from a variety of perspectives, it can also be somewhat distracting, as the reader has to stop and work out the connections between the characters in various stories, which takes one out of the whole process of immersing oneself in the book.And despite these various perspectives and a few descriptions of violence, I never quite felt that the book conveys the sheer nastiness and brutishness of the Duvalier regime. What's more present is the psychological element, the mental scars that last forever, on both the victim and the one committing the evil. One thing that's kind of nice about the book is that the father never makes any pretense that he somehow earn forgiveness or redemption for the evil he's done. Nor does the author attempt to \\"explain\\" what causes people to do evil -- the answer is simple, you give some people power and they will do evil. Remove the power and they will cease to do evil. It's a simple and tragic equation, but one that bears revisiting. In the end, the book was just too disjointed for me to really enjoy, but it's definitely worth checking out if you've got an interest in Haiti."},{"Title":"The Dew Breaker","review":"This is a book I feel you must read in one or two sittings. One you must finish right away. A story within stories. After reading this the title will haunt me...disgust me. This is a story that obviously won't appeal to everyone. You can see that in the reviews of this book. All I can say is if you liked BREATH, EYES, MEMORY as I did, I think you'd like this. You also learn a little from this book. First you'll learn what a DEW BREAKER is and a little about Haiti.

It betrayed the how many came to arrive in the United States from the tiny half island of Haiti, one of the oldest independant countries in the Western hemisphere, this was a story told backwards from the present to the distant past, when the untamed streets held different players, with very different (from us) ideals of station in life and place, I have read most of Ms. Danticat's novels and this one is by far the most adventurous. The use of language and imagery provides much of the color and accomodations for this journey, it was comfortable and enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Dew Breaker","review":"This was a great book. I had to read it for a class assignment. Danicat, has a different way of writing, that i really found interesting, had to guessing all the way through the book, to the very last page."},{"Title":"The Dew Breaker","review":"I read about this book in Time, and found myself very interested in reading it. When I finally got the book and opened the first page, I knew this would not, at all, be a happy fairy tale. (After all, it is about a Haiti prison guard).The story begins with the guard's daughter, a young woman named Ka, in a hotel room with her father, holding with her a sculpture, intending to give it to a famous Haiti woman. But her father smashes it, ruining it, and then confesses to his daughter that he's not the man she always thought he was. Instead of being a prisoner in Haiti, he was a torturer, and he was good at it.This changes the story. At first, I thought, hey, you know, maybe the man could repent his sins. Maybe he became good...But as the novel progresses, you realize that this man, no matter how much he has repented, did terrible, horrible, awful things. And no matter how he tried to forget him, they still haunted him, tried to make him pay for his wrong doings.In a sense, he did pay. At the way end, he gets a long gash in his face, making him look like a monster. And maybe he is.This was a brilliant book. I was truly impressed with Danticat's writing. The only reason I gave it four stars though, is that sometimes, the switch and introduction between characters was rather confusing at times. Otherwise, this was an amazing book. It's a little slow at the beginning, but if you wait, it gets better. The ending is the most shocking part in the entire book. I was stunned. This is an incredible book, and I suggest it to anyone who wants a great novel."},{"Title":"The Dew Breaker","review":"So, who or what is the Dew Breaker? The Dew Breaker is so named because he comes in the early hours of the day, disturbing the dew on the grass. In this story the Dew Breaker is a torturer and killer. The story explores the lives of the many people affected by a former Haitian prison guard. The story flows through Haiti, Florida and New York, from 1967 to present-day.The story opens with a young lady who is on a trip with her father. Ka, has invited her father to tag along with her on a trip to Florida to deliver a piece of her art to a prospective buyer. The piece is a sculpture that was inspired by and dedicated to her Haitian father. I felt anguish and sadness for the father when he explains to Ka that he is not worthy of such a work of art. This explanation comes as an answer to why he destroyed Ka's sculpture. Though Ka was very calm and patient with her father, my mind was racing trying to figure out what this poor man could have done that was so terrible that he was moved to destroy his daughter's prided creation. He gives us some insight when he tells her that he did not receive the dreadful scar on his face while serving in a Haitian prison and that he is not the man she believes him to be. \\"Your father was the hunter, not the prey.\\" he confesses to her. He doesn't uncover any more of the mystery at that time. Instead this introduction serves as the beginning of a journey through the lives of many that this man touched.The movement of the story is a little frustrating at times. Danticat moves between characters and it is difficult making the transition between one character's story and the next. There are some vivid and moving experiences described by the characters as they told their stories of their personal interactions with the dew breaker. As always, the author is very descriptive, which allows you to create a visual of what is taking place. There is a build up to the final chapter which reveals the events that place the dew breaker in his present life and present conditions. Why is he so secretive? Why did he withold the truth from his daughter? Why are he and his wife so anti-social and mysterious? These questions are answered when Danticat walks us through what happened that last night that prompted The Dew Breaker to leave his home and the life he had there."},{"Title":"The Dew Breaker","review":"The Dew Breaker is a very educational book with well crafted contradictions in the characters found in the story. It is a unique style that is very rich. This is a story about the haunting tale of a man who left Haiti for New York, and still could not leave behind his memory of victimizing. Told in a strong voice with great narrative and dialogue, the story is evocative, bringing to mind Disciples of Fortune, No longer at Ease, with great insight into the subject of transplanted lives and the huddles that come with."},{"Title":"The Dew Breaker","review":"The cycle of nine stories that make up \\"The Dew Breaker\\" revolves around the central character that haunts all of them: a loving father and husband living in New York who was once a member of the Tontons Macoute, paramilitary torturers during Francois Duvalier's despotic regime in Haiti. Only three of the stories deal directly with this man and his family, but the other six deal with his victims, their families, or their friends. Although I often feel that stories-as-a-novel (or fix-ups) are not convincing--the distraction of the seams can sometimes overpower the whole--this is an exception: if anything, the jigsaw-puzzle approach more powerfully shows how disparate lives have been shattered by one \\"evil\\" man.It's a heavy topic, and much of the book is melancholy and even gloomy--but Danticat is expert at throwing in both comic relief and the perfectly placed awkward moment. All nine stories are superb, but even so there are four the truly stand out. The opening story, \\"The Book of the Dead,\\" describes a semi-vacation trip to Florida taken by the now-elderly man and his daughter, Ka, who has sold a sculpture based her father's image to a famous Haitian American actress. When the father (with the artwork) disappears, secrets are revealed, Ka's adoration of her father is tested, and the obligatory meeting with the actress is both uncomfortable and unforgettable. In \\"Seven,\\" an immigrant living with two bachelors in a basement apartment gets ready to receive the wife he hasn't seen in seven years. (One of his initial concerns: his apartment-mates need to stop sitting around in their underwear.)My favorite section, \\"The Bridal Seamstress,\\" features Aline, a young, idealistic journalism intern who interviews a woman who is about to retire from a career making bridal dresses for other Haitian immigrants (\\"they come here carrying photographs of tall, skinny girls in dresses that cost thousands of dollars. . . . It's part of my job to tell them, without making them cry, that they're too short, too wide, or too pregnant . . .\\"). The story turns darker when the older woman describes the new neighbor who, she claims, is the man who tortured her in Haiti. And, the longest and final story, \\"The Dew Breaker,\\" takes us back to 1967, when the man who will be the cause of so many future nightmares conducts his last murderous assignment in Haiti, and then takes us forward to 2004, with the story of the woman who saved, forgave, and (if such a thing is possible) redeemed him."},{"Title":"The Dew Breaker","review":"I think this could have been a great book if it had tied together all the threads in it.

Haitian American sculptor, Ka creates a piece in honor of her father and what he endured during Dictator Franois Duvalier's torturous reign over Haiti. What she doesn't know is that her father was not a victim, but in fact a dew breaker-a Haitian torturer who because they usually came before dawn, \\"as the dew was settling on the leaves\\" to snatch their victims away from their homes in the name of Duvalier.One encounter after the other, Ka's father identity begins to unravel around him. Can he continue his new person as a Brooklyn barbershop owner or will the neighborhood find him out? Will his family forgive him? Can he forgive himself?This book is so great, because it tells a chilling tale of physical and mental torture. We learn more about Haiti and the lives of Haitian immigrants in America. And their struggle to assimilate to a new culture and forget their past no matter how horrific it was.However, the novel was set up more like a series of short stories instead of the traditional novel structure, which would have made the story greater as we felt a continuous peak and valley moving us to the most horrible moment of Ka's father's life. I wanted to drop with him--experience his greatest fears come to pass in front of his eyes, watch each encounter rip away at him until he is at his worst. Simply put I wanted to ride this rollercoaster of fear with him and that didn't happen because Danticat made Ka the narrator of the story, which keeps you from understanding the inner struggle of her father. Moreover, the pacing slowed the story down in places where it didn't need to be.Dee StewartR.E.A.L.

Again, it is a lot of short stories that are all linked to one family and in particular one man who did something that he has to live with forever.

It is a good book. My only problem is how it is written. A collection of short stories, and short stories leave me hungry for more and sometimes looking for answers. A friend of mine was reading along with me and she said she enjoyed the book, but couldn't read before bedtime as she would have dreams about the things happening in the book, to me..when a book transports you...it's a GOOD BOOK!

Some stories are better than others but all of them offer a great glimpse into a culture mainly unknown to me before reading this book. Very well written."},{"Title":"The Dew Breaker","review":"I just finished this book last night and am mostly impressed with the strong lyricism of Danticat's writing. The moving back and forth between 1960s Haiti and present-day New York was enjoyable. However, I am not a big fan of multiple narrative perspectives/stories in books because I feel the flow of the story has been interrupted. In the case of The Dew Breaker there were multiple stories that I had difficulty linking together. The stories seemed isolated with no obvious connection to the core characters of the book. I almost put the book down but I am glad I stuck it out. The wrap-up was so beautifully poetic and moving it all kind of came together in the end. My favorite scenario in the book was when a core character visited his homeland. The richness of Danticat's writing deeply immerses the reader into the Haitian culture. It took a little patience, but turned out to be a fulfilling read."},{"Title":"The Dew Breaker","review":"This young Haitian-American writer is making quite a name for herself. In this, her fourth novel, she again displays her depth of understanding of her people. She writes clear, sharp, poignant sentences that go straight to the heart. And the story, itself, is chilling.The book is episodic and can be looked at a series of short stories. But they're all interrelated, and tell the story of Haiti over the past twenty years. A \\"dew breaker\\" is a prison guard who tortures the captives in his charge. And he is the central character in the book. He now lives in Brooklyn and has a loving wife and a grown up daughter. He now works as a barber and his past seems a long time ago. We see him through his daughter's eyes as he reveals his true past to her. The daughter loves her father but this new fact about his life is hard to accept.We also meet other Haitian people, living in America. There's the nurse who sends most of her paycheck home to her mother. There's the young man who brings his wife to this country. There's another man who travels back to Haiti to visit his dying aunt. There are three Haitian women learning English and sharing their stories with each other.Eventually, we flash back to the story of the \\"dew breaker\\" in Haiti. It's not a pleasant story but yet a very human one. Even though we don't forgive, we do understand.I was a little reluctant to read this book. I thought it would have detailed horrors and be excessively brutal. I was glad that Ms. Danticant, in her wisdom, spent most of her time on character development and story. She only put in a few of the horrible details, mostly focusing on the people, rather than on the gore.The book is only 242 pages long, a fast read. It left me with a deep understanding of Haiti, its people, and what is going on in the news today."},{"Title":"The Dew Breaker","review":"Throughout The Dew Breaker, evil prevails in all its manifestations, particularly in the guise of authority, demanding homage from the persecuted. This novel is beautifully constructed; characters fall into place within the chapters, the infinite connections that bind one life to another clearly drawn. In each facet of her story, the author builds the momentum in this cautionary tale of horror, love, rebelliousness and hope, touched with myth and memory.As the novel begins, a young woman gazes upon her father with eyes of love, unaware of his past. Finally confessing his carefully hidden secret, he is revealed as deeply flawed, his actions virtually unforgivable. The scar he wears on his face carries a terrible history, his life in America built on deception. In his mouth the truth is a lie. Although the father pardons himself, there are many who damn him for the monster of their nightmares.Weaving through the chapters, we learn of those who have been touched by brutal dictatorship and oppression, where unmarried women bear fatherless children, eking out the most basic existence. Haiti, an island paradise, turns into hell under a despot's reign of terror, freedom a vague dream, while the hungry scratch for garbage, all under a starlit sky of infinite beauty. Even when these characters find a different life in America, they carry the indelible scars of Haiti in their hearts.This passionate novel is an assemblage of powerful interrelated stories; here a chorus of voices hums, the heard and the unheard, the \\"disappeared\\", the unborn, the women whose voice boxes have been surgically removed, the desperate murmur of prayers, the eternal silence of the dead and the staccato of random gunfire. There is a staggering contrast between good and evil in The Dew Breaker, as well as the grinding reality of a world made suddenly transcendent in the bright rays of the morning sun. Horrifying, how evil walks so freely through the world, casually touching its victims, then casually strolling into the quiet evening and a peaceful existence, unexposed and unrelenting. Luan Gaines/2004."},{"Title":"The Dew Breaker","review":"Author Danticat introduces her story of Haitian immigrants and the lives they have escaped in Haiti with the story of Ka, a young sculptress whose parents think of her as a \\"good angel,\\" her name also associated symbolically with the Egyptian Book of the Dead. Ka is in Florida with her father to deliver a powerfully rendered sculpture to a Haitian TV actress. Ka's father, who served as the model for the sculpture, however, destroys it, confessing tearfully that he is not the man his daughter has always believed him to be, and admitting that the disfiguring scar on his face was not the result of torture in a Haitian prison. He was \\"the hunter,\\" he says, and \\"not the prey,\\" one of the \\"dew breakers,\\" or torturers, who as part of the Tonton Macoutes, committed political assassinations and inflicted unimaginable tortures on orders of dictators Francois Duvalier and his son \\"Baby Doc\\" between 1957-86.In a series of episodes which resemble short stories more than a novel in form, Danticat illuminates the lives of approximately a dozen Haitian immigrants as they remember this traumatic period \\"back home.\\" As the \\"novel\\" alternates between past and present, it is told from disparate points of view--those of Ka's mother and father, a young man visiting Haiti after ten years to see his blinded aunt, a wedding seamstress in New York, a Haitian-American reporter investigating a possible \\"dew-breaker,\\" a man remembering a Haitian friend's long-ago disappearance as he awaits his son's birth in New York, and a popular Haitian preacher whose arrest affects lives for many years.The novel gains much of its power from the horrors of vividly described torture and the overwhelming fear engendered by the Tonton Macoute militia. By calling up such emotionally charged memories and presenting them in a series of episodes, the author can let the personal stories unfold without having to order events so that they lead to a grand climax. What distinguishes this \\"novel\\" from a short story collection, however, is the repeating motifs that appear throughout these seemingly separate episodes (a man's widow's peak, a woman's fear of cemeteries, for example), and by the end of the novel the connections among all the characters become obvious. A vivid documentation of many of the worst human rights abuses of the century, Danticat's novel is a moving testament to the Haitians' resilient spirit and a celebration of their survival. Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"The Dew Breaker","review":"One of the book's face pages mentions that the \\"Dew Breaker\\" is actually comprised of many shorter stories, some of which were previously published independently of one another in various journals. It takes an artist to blend these discrete stories, string them together as chapter titles, making them cohesive so that the reader understands a larger picture. Danticat does this with style, with escalating tension, and by drawing the reader into a maze of facts, characters and their personal stories with similar characteristics. All their lives have been touched by the reigns of terror under the Haitian dictators, Papa Doc and Bebe Doc Duvalier.The novel opens with the Dew Breaker's telling his beloved daughter of his background. Prior to the confession, he had been the tortured...not the torturer. And, following this confession, the story moves back and forth in time.One very clever touch, among many, is the portion where the Dew Breaker, now a respectable barber living a very quiet life in New York attends Christmas Eve Mass with his daughter and wife, Anne. Ka, his daughter, stares at a man she thinks to be a wanted man in Haiti. His picture appears on posters all over town because of his human rights violations. In the end, noticing the suspect bears an overall resemblance to the criminal, but is not an exact match, the reader is drawn to the fact that her own father, the Dew Breaker, altered his own appearance so as not to be recognized. He was formerly described as a very large man. No more. A parallel to the man in the pew?Going along with this strain of disguises, the bridal dress seamstress is also sure the Dew Breaker lives across the street from her but when a nosy reporter attempts to look into the house, a neighbor tells her no one has lived there for a long time. When this is pointed out to the seamstress, she relates that no matter where she moves, he finds her. How? Because she tells her \\"girls\\" (the various women who utilize her dressmaking skills) when she is moving. That's how the Dew Breaker knows. Is this accurate? Her imagination, grown out of her own story of horror when the Dew Breaker tortured her because she would not date him?Then there is Anne, his wife, who has known her husband's story for many years and has willing collaborated in her husband's obscure existence in order to keep a very low profile. They have no friends, cannot risk ever being recognized, seem to operate exclusively in a Haitian neighborhood. Which begs the question, wouldn't the probabilities be even greater that a criminal would heighten the chances of his recognition in a smaller neighborhood where so many have been touched by the regimes of the Duvaliers?Perhaps the answer lies in the fact that if the personification of horrors lives and works just down the street, a victim would be less likely to stir up a hornets nest! Nonetheless, Anne too, was touched by the Dew Breaker. Her own stepbrother was murdered by him yet she appears to believe that her stepbrother, a minister who openly preached against the regime, committed suicide. Is the author trying to show that many mechanisms are employed to stay alive? To attempt to forget? To make the best of the hand one is dealt?Danticat employs interesting characters to tell her short stories and she effectively uses the breaks in the various narratives to grow her overall story. And those short stories also provide her with the mechanism to jump back and forth in time between Haiti and New York. The reader is transported briefly into the stories of these diverse characters, their time in history, its effects on their lives and, when blended together, they create a whole, engrossing story.Her final coup d'etat is the story of the \\"Dew Breaker\\" himself; he is detestable, heartless, ruthless, cunning and he has become the quiet scholar, the man fascinated with the Egyptian \\"Book of the Dead\\". What does he seek there?"},{"Title":"The Dew Breaker","review":"I gotta say the Dew Breaker should definitely be on everyone's must read list. Dandicat's voice is clear, compelling and transports you to the moment in time that she is speaking of. It's a page turner to the very end. One thing though, there were times when I was confused as to who was talking. But once you understand that there are different people telling their stories and they are all related in some way (though not all of them are related to the main character \\"the dew breaker\\"; which can have you wondering why is this story there)it works very well. She really did a great job on researching the Duvalier regime and how people were treated. It brought a lot of things to the surface and helped me to now grasp what the revolt was really about, because though I was there, I was a child who I was just happy not to have to go to school for a few months."},{"Title":"The Dew Breaker","review":"Danticat is enormously good for us, especially now. She reminds us of the beautiful literary spirit of Haiti... much like that glorious cadre of revolutionary Haitian women literary figures Ghislaine Charlier, Jan J. Dominique, Nadine Magloire, and of course Marie Chauvet and more recently Myriam Chancy. Exquisite writers all. Danticat, like her sisters, reminds us of the rich literary legacy that truly celebrates all that is beautiful about this much maligned and misunderstood country. Danticat herself, in my view, is an accident of literary privilege, a formidably keen observer or witness to events that have happened or to what is currently happening. This story, The Dew Breaker, while a horribly true tale of interwoven lives connected gruesomely by the &quot;beast&quot;, actually chose her; she is the extremely gifted and talented vessel that serves to receive this story.Is there redemption for the protagonist, the shouk&egrave;t laroze himself? I don't know. Perhaps even Danticate isn't quite certain. The protagonist, an ultimately pathetic soul, is caught up in a nightmarish episode of reality --as is all of Haiti. As his daughter peels away the layers of his humanity, penetrating ever so deeper into his tortured soul to see just who he is, she too (like us) arrives at the point of moral ambiguity about her father. The skillful artistry in Danticat actually tortures us with this sense of indefiniteness ... which is what all excellent writers often do, of course. With measured steps,the author takes a daring literary plunge into the often risky arena between the short story and the novella. She triumphs wonderfully. In telling a painfully good story, Danticat presents us with real people agonizing in their search for answers, explanations and understandings. M' pa di pass&eacute; a.Definitely recommended reading.Alan CambeiraAuthor of AZUCAR! The Story of Sugar (a novel)"},{"Title":"The Dew Breaker","review":"Danticat's a hot commodity these days. Her first two novels have received much acclaim and this effort has been much anticipated. It hasn't hurt that Haiti is very much in the spotlight as the book becomes available, with all the attendant images of violence that accompany a Haitian coup. So, all in all, reading The Dew Breakers should have been a blockbuster experience. Sadly, it was not.The protagonist of The Dew Breaker (so named because he would habitually come for his victims in the very early morning, when the grass was wet with pre sunrise dew) is a former torturer for the Duvalier regime, now, as the book opens, a reformed family man living in suburban New York. His sadism is chronicled through a series of vignettes centering on a swath of his victims. Essentially, this novel is a loosely related series of short stories that uses the device of the protagonist as the glue that's supposed to hold the whole enterprise together. This is not an entirely successful undertaking as the protagonist is so steeped in shadow and mystery as to never truly come into focus enough to be an identifiable entity. Some of the vignettes are truly moving and, on their own, have genuine emotional impact. That impact dissipates, however, as the intrusion of the literary device that underpins the book often in fact acts to dispels emotional intensity and thus rob the narrative of its power.Danticat has a writing style that is often described as simple and elegant but which, to my mind, often can only be described as plain. This book is easy to read by there is a decided lack of any sort of lyrical quality to the work.However, the real problem with the book is it never even attempts to answer the questions it raises. History is full of monsters who were attentive parents, kind to their mothers and loved their pets. The question is-and Danticat broaches it-how do these freaks accommodate the inherent contradictions of their nature? History is also full of monsters who, for whatever reason, turn their back on their former life, reforming themselves into, if not something noble, at least into something no longer a monster. Where does the sadism, the cruelty, the inhumanity go when this happens? Danticat makes no effort to resolve these issues. At best, the book can be said to be infused with a sense of moral ambiguity regarding its protagonist. Even the question of whether the author intends for one to grant the torturer absolution for his sins is left indefinite.In the final analysis, the book sinks under the burden of great expectations. It does not live up to its hype and reviews. That's not to say it's a bad book-it's not. It's just that, when all is said and done, the feeling one is left with is that this particular glass has to be viewed as half empty. That is a great disappointment given the hopes I had for the book going in."},{"Title":"The Dew Breaker","review":"Given the subject matter of The Dew Breaker, the story of a killer in Haiti who has \\"given in to the greatest hazard of the job... It was becoming like any another job,\\" Edwidge Danticat has taken an enormous emotional and aesthetic risk by choosing to tell his story from his daughter's sympathetic point of view. Ms. Danticat also displays her story telling gifts by two astonishing twists in the plot and her capable handling of a central trope that reveals even as it hides the past of one of its central characters.In The Dew Breaker, Danticat has succeeded in showing us that love, even for a monster, can have redemptive effect. And while Ka Bienaim''s father can never fully accept the grace offered to him by Anne, his wife, and Ka, his daughter-he destroys a statue of himself that was a gift from his daughter-he does live a reformed life after he leaves Haiti.The Dew Breaker is a sublime work and the tone that Ms. Danticat maintains throughout the work captures the moral dilemma of the \\"hunter and the hunted.\\" It is easy to want revenge for horrific acts that have been done to our loved ones. But killers have families and children who love them, and they are in desperate need of the kind of salvific love that Anne offers. This humane novel is an act of bravery that may bring life back to the \\"dead spots\\" of Haiti's troubled past."},{"Title":"The Dew Breaker","review":"This is my favorite Danticat book to date. I wasn't as much of a fan back in the days of Breath, Eyes, Memory. I thought in the case of that novel that her beautiful writing tried to disguise some leaps in the narrative. I thought she often left the story at just the most critical, difficult to write part and jumped forward, skipping over the hard stuff entirely. I thought, really, that she'd pulled the wool over the reading public's eyes by writing so beautifully we didn't notice the gaps. I'll have to go back and look at that one again to see if I still feel the same about it.In any event, those flaws are not the case at all in this novel. Yes, there are connected stories that might have led to the same sort of problems. But Danticat has matured amazingly, which is really something considering the spotlight she's been under. She didn't HAVE to become a better writer cause she was already successful, but this proves that she set her sights high and reached them. The various stories inform each other while also standing distinct. She writes brutal material at times but with an understanding of the flawed humanity of all her characters - both the victim and the torturer. She asks questions about what sort of redemption is possible for past crimes. She deals with the hard stuff head on. She doesn't give easy answers, but that's the way it is with the best of writing. And this is some of America's best writing right now."},{"Title":"The Dew Breaker","review":"Edwidge Danticat's _The Dew Breakers_ is a deep, emotionally moving novel that asks readers to reflect not only on the history of Haiti but also on the complexities of their own personal and national stories. The book explores how individuals deal with experiences of profound suffering. The characters cope with violence and trauma that they have either suffered through at others' hands, or have meted out to others. In this novel the past is very much part of the present; the past is the texture of the characters' dreams and the background of their waking choices.The book speaks directly to the immigrant experience and the courage of people to endure. An organizing principle of the novel is an idea from the _Egyptian Book of the Dead_ concerning the \\"Ka,\\" a double, the spiritual being of the individual, which guides the body through life and death. One of the lead characters, the so called, \\"Dew Breaker,\\" who has reinvented himself as a barber in New York City, names his daughter, Ka. He often takes his daughter to Metropolitan Museum of Art to look at Egyptian art. His care of his daughter reflects his best self and his will to survive, qualities which the daughter later captures artistically and understands intuitively.In addition, the novel shows how people's lives are interconnected with each other and woven to national histories. What the individual experiences often recapitulates the broader experience of a people or society at large. For example, various minor and major characters in the novel mirror each other, as if they are working through parts of the same experience. For instance, Claude, a criminal who has been deported to Haiti, and the dew breaker are integrally related, yet they live at different moments in time and have no knowledge of each other. Likewise, a young immigrant named Dany has an interest in the \\"dew breaker\\" that is similar to Ka's belief that she has spotted a wanted criminal at a Christmas service. Anne, Ka's mom, is similar to Dany's elderly Aunt Estine Esteme. All of these characters capture aspects of the complex experience of multi-generational dictatorship that reveberates in the Haitian immigrant community.The novel is also structured in dual sections. \\"The Book of the Dead,\\" one of the chapter titles, contrasts with \\"The Book of Miracles.\\" \\"The Funeral Singer\\" contrasts with \\"The Bridal Seamstress.\\" These sections give the reader access to layered connections that the individual characters themselves are not consciously aware of.The dialogue among characters is likewise fragmentary and circular; often people are on the verge of speaking but refrain. In a later part of the book, another character might express a similar idea in an entirely different context. On some level, characters know each other without knowing the precise details of each other's histories. This knowledge ironically comes from experiences with others whose lives are similar. The structure of the novel hints at this understanding.The quote for my review comes from \\"The Funeral Singer\\" section of the novel. At the end of this section, a group of immigrant friends celebrates in a New York City Haitian restaurant after taking the GED exam. The friends are unsure if they have passed, yet regardless of the results, there is restrained optimism for a brighter future. (Danticat solves, delightfully, one of the G.E.D. math problems in her acknowledgements.)There are many wonderful reviews of the book on Amazon.com that shed light on the novel and Danticat's lucid prose. Danticat's writing, which is both finely detailed and beautifully spare, enables readers to create in their own minds a rich, layered world. Reading her novel is a gratifying learning experience; it remains true to the human experience.This is a magesterial work."},{"Title":"The Dew Breaker","review":"This book is so great, because it tells a chilling tale of physical and mental torture. We learn more about Haiti and the lives of Haitian immigrants in America. Their struggle to assimilate to a new culture and forget their past no matter how horrific it was. The novel was setup more like a series of short stories instead of the traditional novel structure, which would have made the story a greater read as we felt a continuous peak and valley moving us to the most horrible moment of Ka's father's life. I wanted to drop with him and that didn't happen because of the structure of this book. Moreover, the pacing slowed the story down in places where it didn't need to be. Nonetheless, this book is one of the most well written books I have read ever. I look forward to more of her work."},{"Title":"The Dew Breaker","review":"What a great, great read. Author Edwidge Danticat brilliantly weaves a series of stories that reveal much about Haiti during the era of the Duvaliers. But \\"The Dew Breaker\\" is not so much about Haiti as it is about the Haitian people, both the perpetrators and the innocents, of that brutal Duvalier regime. Danticat's simple arresting prose is dead-on as she so vividly and intensely relates the depth of human emotions of these tragic victims. Brilliant is the way Ms Danticat intertwines the stories of these individuals who find themselves in the same New York City neighborhood many years later living lives of haunted memories and deep remorse.The Today Show Book Club got it right again. \\"The Dew Breaker\\" is another highly recommended read."},{"Title":"The Dew Breaker","review":"The Dew Breaker is not for \\"linear readers\\". It tells the story of dictatorship and shows the residue of a Haitian father who, in the past, participated in torturing innocent people. Ms. Danticat weaves this project together like a jigsaw. There are many pieces, each with its own depth, region, and time--but no doubt an integral part of the whole. The stories are beautifully written. However, I find Ms. Danticat's talent (as I have known it in The Farming of Bones and Krik Krak) most demonstrated in The Funeral Singer, Night Talkers and The Dew Breaker. While some of the stories tug at the reader, the latter three stories I have mentioned, lock the reader in through Ms. Danticat's obvious gift of storytelling. I recommend The Dew Breaker as it is always a privilege to be graced with insight into Haitian life. I look forward to more works by this young, talented author."},{"Title":"The Dew Breaker","review":"Much like Tim O'Brien's THE THINGS THEY CARRIED, this book lingers in that nebulous hinterland between short story and novel where few writers have the gumption or the ability to tread. Each chapter is a self-contained story, with divergent and seemingly random settings--Haiti in the dictatorial 1960s, Manhattan in the 1970s, Brooklyn and Queens in the 21st century. And yet slowly, irrevocably, the reader is drawn into the shared love, the shared remorse, the shared history, the shared hope, the shared rebellions--both personal and political--that circle round this unassuming man...this husband...this father...this friend...this torturer...this dew breaker.About three-quarters of the way into THE DEW BREAKER I couldn't see myself giving it anything more than 3-1/2 or 4 stars. This is a book that rewards patience, one whose ultimate purity is not realized until the very last sentence, when that &quot;pendulum between regret and forgiveness&quot; swings one last time. Given what's going on even as we speak in the island nation of Haiti, THE DEW BREAKER's timeliness is nearly as haunting as Ms. Danticat's prose. Maybe this isn't a book for everyone...but it should be.Postscript: I bought the audio edition of THE DEW BREAKER after I read the print book. For those of you who find yourself tripping over some of the Creole dialect in print, try the audio. The narrator, Robin Miles, is an extraordinary talent."},{"Title":"The Dew Breaker","review":"Edwige Danticat offers us several short stories about the Dulavier era of Haiti. In her almost prosaic prose Danticat give us true horror stories and the monsters are human. Each story can stand alone but it is connected to the others through characters who are the victims of a brutal regime. Even the perpetrators are given sympathetic reality, which makes the reader wonder about the human condition.Danticat is a fantastic writer whose control of the language is gorgeous. There's nothing flashy or self-congratulatory about her spare descriptions and images - it's just perfect. Her book is full of surprises, yet it also moves inevitably to the title story in the end. In bits and pieces we learn more about the central mystery, moving into the heart by indirection, overhearing the stories of neighbors, tenants, and relatives, picking up the unexamined shards of truth and cussing out the gossip. The notes of redemption surface briefly in the din of denial, anger flashes through sentimental projection and idealism, and a portrait of Haiti emerges, soaked in blood, guilt, vision, sorrow, and hope. The diaspora of which most of the characters are a part seems a blessing because the charnel house from which they come echoes with the cries of the tortured, the terrified, the tyrants.Haiti is the dark jewel of our hemisphere, the island of hope and despair, beauty and poverty, love and torture. With poetic compression and heartbreaking compassion, Edwidge Danticat brings us face to face with mystery, grief, and life. I might not read this book again, only because the subject is so painful and melancholy, but Danticat manages to find beauty through her writing about the most horrible events."},{"Title":"The Dew Breaker","review":"This is a heart-wrenching collection of stories placing right and wrong, atonement and peace on a continuum whereby any of us could emerge anywhere on the spectrum. The writing is fluid and the imagery is exceptional, putting the reader in a church, in a jail, in the home of a famous actress and in the characters' journeys toward reaching their places on the continuum.I was challenged, after reading this book, to examine my own notions of \\"unforgivable\\" people and things.This is an essential read."},{"Title":"The Dew Breaker","review":"Edwidge Danticat's new novel, her third, is right up there with her first, Breath, Eyes, Memory, though very different. It's an elliptical novel, with much mystery. The title character is not seen directly until the final, title story. Instead he is seen through the eyes of his family (The Book of the Dead, The Book of Miracles), his victims (Night Talkers), victims not necessarily his own (Water Child, The Bridal Seamstress, Monkey Tails, The Funeral Singer), and his tenants (Seven).Together, the stories piece together the Dew Breaker (and people like him, and people who suffered from or survived people like him) from different angles.This is a book that defies the easy classifications of good and evil. It is about love, compassion, hope, regret, forgiveness, and understanding. But it has no easy answers. In many ways, it doesn't answer the questions it asks, allowing each reader to judge the Dew Breaker for him/herself.This is a timeless book, but given Aristide's recent exile from Haiti and the Abu Ghraib prison scandal in Iraq, it is a very timely book as well."},{"Title":"The Dew Breaker","review":"Ms. Dandicat has done it yet again. This anthology of short stories written in the inimmitable style that she has created is a very fast read. While each of the stories work on their own, Ms. Dandicat shows her ingenuity as she ties them all to each other in a subtle yet powerful way. Toward the last few, despite fully expecting the connection to the rest, the reader is caught off guard when the link becomes aparent. As is always the case, her use of prose and language will amaze even the most learned.Those of who have experienced life under any oppressive regime, or who have know someone who has have in this (and her other) work a unique opportunity to relate in a way that goes beyond the vicarious.Thank you Ms. Dandicat."},{"Title":"The Dew Breaker","review":"Edwidge Danticat has written a wonderfully crafted novel in stories in her fourth fiction release, The Dew Breaker. The title is taken from the term used for the men who were torturers during the Duvalier regime in Haiti during the 1960s.The Book of the Dead is the opening chapter of the book in present day, a story initially published in the New Yorker magazine. A young artist and her father, a respected citizen and business owner in the Haitian community of Brooklyn, New York, take a trip to Florida to deliver a sculpture when suddenly both the father and the art disappear. This sets in motion a series of interconnected stories by expatriate Haitians, who have been affected by this man, a former member of the Toutou army under the Papa Doc Duvalier's reign of torture and terror. The story is the catalyst for the subsequent stories that can stand alone as complete but have a thread that interweaves place, persons and time that culminates in a satisfying and intense ending.Almost every character has been touched by the Dew Breaker. The young man in Night Talkers who returns to his native village in the Haitian countryside is certain his landlord in Brooklyn is the man who killed his father before he was born; the English as a Second Language student in The Funeral Singer whose painter husband was killed for painting an unflattering picture of the dictator; the young boy in Haiti who never knew his father in Monkey Tails and the retiring bridal seamstress who believes the man who abused her thirty years prior is now her neighbor in The Bridal Seamstress. The ending story with the same title as the book is a sobering, moving tale that renders one drained emotionally without judgment of the antagonist.This reviewer has enjoyed and respected some of Danticat's past writings but this offering has earned her at the top of the list as one of my favorite writers. The language flows like waves over a blue ocean, brilliant color splayed over lines that dance off of the page. Lyrical, poignant, powerful; this work of art resonates with the reader for days later.Dera WilliamsAPOOO BookClub"},{"Title":"The Dew Breaker","review":"Edwidge Danticat is one of the leading Haitian novelists today. This latest book of hers, The Dew Breaker, looks like a novel but is really a collection of closely linked stories.

They would often come in the early dawn to take their victims away...thus the broke the serenity of the grass in the morning dew. These \`Macoutes' tortured and killed thousands of civilians, many for trivial incidences.Beautifully written, the chapters overlap and wind back around each other as the novel slowly reveals the ghosts of the past within the culture's stories of miracles and spiritual beliefs.Now, living in New York, trying to erase a past that shadows him continually, we meet a good father and husband with a horrible scar on his face and an agonizing secret embedded deeply in his soul...and now...finally it must be unmasked!"},{"Title":"The Dew Breaker","review":"Author Danticat introduces her story of Haitian immigrants and the lives they have escaped in Haiti with the story of Ka, a young sculptress whose parents think of her as a \\"good angel,\\" her name also associated symbolically with the Egyptian Book of the Dead. Ka is in Florida with her father to deliver a powerfully rendered sculpture to a Haitian TV actress. Ka's father, who served as the model for the sculpture, however, destroys it, confessing tearfully that he is not the man his daughter has always believed him to be, and admitting that the disfiguring scar on his face was not the result of torture in a Haitian prison. He was \\"the hunter,\\" he says, and \\"not the prey,\\" one of the \\"dew breakers,\\" or torturers, who as part of the Tonton Macoutes, committed political assassinations and inflicted unimaginable tortures on orders of dictators Francois Duvalier and his son \\"Baby Doc\\" between 1957-86.In a series of episodes which resemble short stories more than a novel in form, Danticat illuminates the lives of approximately a dozen Haitian immigrants as they remember this traumatic period \\"back home.\\" As the \\"novel\\" alternates between past and present, it is told from disparate points of view--those of Ka's mother and father, a young man visiting Haiti after ten years to see his blinded aunt, a wedding seamstress in New York, a Haitian-American reporter investigating a possible \\"dew-breaker,\\" a man remembering a Haitian friend's long-ago disappearance as he awaits his son's birth in New York, and a popular Haitian preacher whose arrest affects lives for many years.The novel gains much of its power from the horrors of vividly described torture and the overwhelming fear engendered by the Tonton Macoute militia. By calling up such emotionally charged memories and presenting them in a series of episodes, the author can let the personal stories unfold without having to order events so that they lead to a grand climax. What distinguishes this \\"novel\\" from a short story collection, however, is the repeating motifs that appear throughout these seemingly separate episodes (a man's widow's peak, a woman's fear of cemeteries, for example), and by the end of the novel the connections among all the characters become obvious. A vivid documentation of many of the worst human rights abuses of the century, Danticat's novel is a moving testament to the Haitians' resilient spirit and a celebration of their survival. Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"The Dew Breaker","review":"I found this book to be not like most I read however it had me memorized from the start. Danitcat took a series of short stories where each story worked on their own but they all tied together. It showed the softer side to the 'dew breaker' and how a life can change, how one event can change your life and make you stronger or break you.This was the first book that I have read by Edwidge Danticat - I look forward to exploring more of this author's work."},{"Title":"The Dew Breaker","review":"I used this book for a book club I started with some students at the university I work at. I think I was the only one who read the whole thing because it was fairly difficult to read and it was really disturbing."},{"Title":"The Dew Breaker","review":"Danticat has written some great stories prior to this collection (see \\"Night Women,\\" especially, and \\"Caroline's Wedding\\"), and she's no slouch as a novelist, either. But The Dew Breaker is a breakthrough book, a hybrid of story collection and novel so good that the reader need not worry about which it is.Each of these stories is working on at least five levels: (1) as a readable narrative in which everything leads to something else, and the reader is pulled through with the same kind of pleasure commercial fiction offers, (2) as a character study, and as an exercise in dramatic empathy -- the reader identifies with the character and feels what the character is feeling, no matter whether the character is inherently likable or not, (3) as a story-within-a story, the broader story being the shadow the dew breaker and his terrible actions cast over the rest of the story, (4) as a story-within-a-story-within the broader story of the nightmare Duvalier regime and the resulting Haitian diaspora, and (5) as a miracle of the lyrical, the language itself forming a kind of music that entrances the reader.I've not read many books as beautiful as this one, and it's worth your time to pick up a copy and read it."},{"Title":"The Dew Breaker","review":"I feel bad using a word like \\"beautiful\\" to describe a book in which torture figures so prominently, but Danticat is a fantastic writer whose control of the language is gorgeous. There's nothing flashy or self-congratulatory about her spare descriptions and images - it's just perfect. Every so often an angel will rise from a dream or a fragrance will be picked up from a handkerchief -- and you're transported. It's like drinking coffee with a friend and then just glancing out the window to discover that you're in a Haitian valley or a new section of Brooklyn. The world seems wonderful in that moment, but even then you know that surprises can be brutal as well as brilliant. Her book is full of surprises, yet it also moves inevitably to the title story in the end. In bits and pieces we learn more about the central mystery, moving into the heart by indirection, overhearing the stories of neighbors, tenants, and relatives, picking up the unexamined shards of truth and sussing out the gossip. The notes of redemption surface briefly in the din of denial, anger flashes through sentimental projection and idealism, and a portrait of Haiti emerges, soaked in blood, guilt, vision, sorrow, and hope. The diaspora of which most of the characters are a part seems a blessing because the charnel house from which they come echoes with the cries of the tortured, the terrified, the tyrants. Haiti is the dark jewel of our hemisphere, the island of hope and despair, beauty and poverty, love and torture. With poetic compression and heartbreaking compassion, Edwidge Danticat brings us face to face with mystery, grief, and life. Like the girl on the cover, the reader contemplates a lake of sorrow, loss, and guilt; you emerge from this book refreshed but wrinkled with immersion."},{"Title":"The Dew Breaker","review":"Edwidge Danticat's third novel, THE DEW BREAKER, arrives in bookstores on the heels of major turmoil in the author's native Haiti: in February Jean-Bertrand Aristide resigned the presidency and fled the country, sparking nationwide riots and the involvement of U.S. marines. These newspaper headlines make THE DEW BREAKER all the more topical and meaningful --- perhaps even more important --- on these shores, and the emotions in the story are all the more intense and vivid for the immediacy these events lend them. But to Danticat's considerable credit, this highly accomplished and extraordinarily powerful novel does not need these concurrent events to engage and move the reader; instead THE DEW BREAKER disinters the country's tumultuous past to reveal how generations of Haitians live in constant upheaval, no matter how far from their country they travel.Danticat structures THE DEW BREAKER as a series of revealing vignettes, each following a different set of characters and tracing its own narrative arc. What keeps it from being relegated to the recent --- and frustrating --- trend of novels-in-short-stories is the focused cohesiveness of its chapters: each examines a different facet of a much larger issue while contributing significantly to a larger storyline.In &quot;The Book of the Dead,&quot; a young Brooklyn sculptor and art teacher named Ka Bienaim&eacute; learns that her father was not an inmate in a Haitian prison, as she has believed all her life, but a torturer --- a &quot;dew breaker&quot; --- under dictator Francois Duvalier during the 1960s. As her mother explains, &quot;Your father was the hunter. He was not the prey.&quot; But as she tries to accept this news, she begins to question her parents' view of Haiti and wonders whether &quot;maybe his past offered more choices than either hunter or prey.&quot;The story-chapters that follow travel back and forth between New York and Haiti, between the unfulfilled hope of America and the crushing disillusion of the island country. But each segment of the novel somehow refers back to Ka's father and the agony and misery he inflicted on his people.In &quot;Night Talkers,&quot; Dany, an immigrant in New York, travels back to Haiti to visit his aunt Estina, who raised him after his parents were murdered. In &quot;Monkey Tails,&quot; Dany's roommate Michel recounts his friend's escape from the country during the riots. Another roommate, unnamed in &quot;Seven,&quot; saves money to bring his wife over from Port-au-Prince, only to find that seven years apart, coupled with the stresses of their new life in America, have dramatically altered their relationship. All three men live in the apartment basement next to the home of Ka's parents, who run a barber shop and are fixtures in New York's Haitian community; this connection binds them all together in a larger, overarching narrative.Danticat also gives voice to people who felt Ka's father's cruelty directly. The title character in &quot;The Bridal Seamstress&quot; shows a reporter the scars on her feet where, after she declined his advance, he whipped all the skin off her soles and made her walk the long trip on bloody bare feet. In &quot;The Funeral Singer,&quot; R&eacute;zia, whose husband he killed, takes classes to earn her high school degree, which is meaningless to her small but successful restaurant, but allows her to form a friendship with two of her classmates.In telling these stories from these different viewpoints, Danticat creates a makeshift community, an ever-shifting shadow society of the characters' native Haiti. The violence and brutality the title character inflicts on his people, therefore, exists not in a vacuum, but in a very specific context.Danticat is a writer blessed with both the curiosity to wonder how people can enact such cruelties on others and the wisdom to know that the answers are frighteningly complex and utterly impossible to explain in words. The task is futile, but as THE DEW BREAKER undeniably proves, the effort is worthwhile, even merciful. In the end, Danticat does not judge her main character or anyone else, but merely reminds us that &quot;atonement, reparation, was possible and available for everyone.&quot;--- Reviewed by Stephen M. Deusner"},{"Title":"The Dew Breaker","review":"The \\"Dew Breaker\\" raises the question as to whether someone who murdered and tortured others can ever be forgiven or even understood. The story revolves around a man who fled Haiti and now lives a new life as a barber in Brooklyn. When we first meet him, he is a pensive and spiritual man who has a love for Egyptian mythos. We initially like him, or at least this current version of himself. With each new chapter, Danticat gives a new first-person narrative from other Haitians. Some of them had encounters with a past version of the man, when he was a macoute, a cruel assassin and torturer, called a \\"Dew Breaker,\\" working for the Haitian government's version of the Gestapo. Our initial opinions of the Dew Breaker come into conflict with the accounts of his past deeds from other characters. He is a very complex character, painted lavishly by Danticat. We can judge him however we want, and accept or condemn any one of the versions of his character that Danticat presents to us.One of the book's best features is its nontraditional structure, which Danticat sculpts beautifully throughout. Although every chapter of the book is written in first person, the identity of the narrator shifts with each chapter. Though it is disconcerting at first, it keeps the book fresh and engaging. The book goes backwards in time, developing the Dew Breaker and touching on his tragic past. The remaining characters in the story reflect different aspects of this man and his monstrous past. While the story makes more and more sense as we delve further back into time, the real treat of the book is Danticat's writing style. It is both beautiful and disturbing at the same time. She uses colors for fluid description, and integrates Haitian words and proverbs into the writing seamlessly. Her writing is full of symbolism, and has very dark undertones. This novel should be admired, if not for its beautiful language and structure, then for its thought provoking content."},{"Title":"The Dew Breaker","review":"Throughout these nine interconnected short stories resides the life of one man attempting to hide from his violent past in Haiti as a torturer. Now older, thinner and living in Brooklyn, New York, he tries to blend in with society. Himself and his wife even keep the truth hidden from their unsuspecting American-born daughter. But despite decades since his crimes their life is less than stress free. They worry that his true identity will be discovered in spite of his altered appearance. While these stories are not told in chronological order, each deals roughly with the protagonist. My favorite story is 'Night Talkers', the tale of one man who travels back to the Haitian mountains to tell his grandmother that he believes he knows the whereabouts of the man who killed his parents when he was a young child. I found the descriptions of rural life fascinating and wanted to learn more about the local customs. But other than a few select stories, I didn't find this collection to be particularly noteworthy. I tend to read many short story compilations and I would rate THE DEW BREAKER as standard. The premise of these stories is certainly appealing as there is an abundance of individuals in the world today who attempt to hide from their violent past and remain undiscovered. As a result I wanted to dig deeper into his mind and his thought processes than what was accomplish here."},{"Title":"The Dew Breaker","review":"THE DEW BREAKER is a collection of vignettes featuring characters whose lives intersect mostly as a result of fate. At the heart of the story is a nameless man who is known as \\"The Dew Breaker.\\" Early in the book his daughter, unaware of his torrid past, creates a sculpture in honor of her father, a Haitian immigrant now working in the U.S. as a successful barber. He carries a menacing scar on his face which is only a superficial representation of his inner turmoil and his unsavory past life in Haiti. Subsequent vignettes provide additional information about \\"The Dew breaker\\" from the perspective of his wife, neighbors, boarders and others. With each vignette another layer of this story and the main character's past is uncovered. The ending, while satisfying in a sense, will leave you to consider the moral imperatives that are presented and come to your own conclusions.Danticat takes us on a series of highs and lows while traveling back and forth through time, from Haiti to the U.S and back. Ultimately, she leaves it up to readers to decide whether the main character is remorseful and seeking redemption or happily basking in the fact that he has gotten away with heinous crimes. While fate is often the impetus that brings the characters together, each of the vignettes and characters ultimately fit together in a synthesis that is both realistic and believable. This is a book filled with intricate nuances and minute complexities that, if overlooked, will prevent some from fully grasping and appreciating this fine work. It is complex, thoughtful, and sure to become a timeless classic.Edwidge Danticat has done it again. She presents a complex and multi-faceted character driven story that includes keenly executed and descriptive prose. From the first page I was drawn into the story and felt as if I was experiencing things right along with the characters. She provides a well-rounded and empathic look at the varied experiences of some Haitian and Haitian American people. Danticat is a vibrant, young voice that is sure to go down in history as a literary great.Reviewed by Stacey Seayof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"The Dew Breaker","review":"He is a nameless, middle-aged immigrant, unremarkable except for a hideous scar on his face. He is happily married, has a grown daughter and lives a quiet, unobtrusive life in a middle-class Brooklyn neighborhood. And he has a past he can't run away from: he was a &quot;dew breaker&quot;, so called because of their practice of breaking in to homes at the crack of dawn while the dew still lay on the ground to arrest suspects and drag them off to jail and death; a former Tonton Macoute, one of Baby Doc's murderous thugs who kept the population in abject terror in Duvalier's Haiti.Danticat's exquisitely written novel is more like a series of interconnected short stories, each one integral in itself, and yet each one related to the whole. We meet people who have had their homes and their lives stolen by Duvalier's goons. We see others who have escaped from terror in their homeland, only to see the face of evil in the faces of everyone they meet. And we meet the dew breaker himself, an ordinary man you'd meet on the street any day, who allowed himself to be transformed into a monster.What kind of person becomes a torturer? He joined the Tonton Macoutes at nineteen, after Duvalier's army troops appropriated his family's land. If you can't beat 'em, join 'em. He uses his power to appropriate free meals in the best restaurants, free rent, and free access to other men's wives and daughters. He rises through the ranks through becoming expert at vicious interrogations of dissidents; he's the best at his job. One of his former victims says of him, &quot;He thought he was God.&quot;The dew breaker meets his nemesis at the hands of another victim, a local priest who has been preaching dissent against the dictatorship. The dew breaker is ordered to shoot him outside his own church, but arrests him instead and has him dragged to his own private interrogation chamber at headquarters. The preacher, a gentle, mild-mannered individual, manages to inflict a horrible wound on the dew-breaker's face before being killed. But being the victim for once instead of the victimized transforms the dew-breaker. He's had enough. He meets his own salvation -- and possible redemption -- in the form of the woman who helps cure the wound on his face and later accompanies him to America. Although she's the relative of one of his victims, she can see the humanity hidden inside him. They will live quietly in Brooklyn, minding their own business, harming no one. All he has to do is figure out how to live with himself for the rest of his life.In 244 pages, Danticat shows us the face of evil and its effect on the perpetrator, his victims, his own family and everyone he's touched. The book moves back and forth across decades from the 1960s to the present, from Brooklyn to Haiti and back again, a seamless trip across time, space, and the tortured inner self of an ultimately pathetic individual. Is there redemption for the dew-breaker? We don't know, and Danticat doesn't tell us; just as she leaves it to the reader to decide which in the end is suffering the most: the dew-breaker himself, or the broken lives he's left in his wake."},{"Title":"The Dew Breaker","review":"This incredible collection of linked short stories is beautifully written and moved me as much as any book ever has. From the first story about a grown daughter and her scarred father, I was seduced by Danticat's beautiful prose. And with each new \\"chapter\\" I was brought further into the web of the many lives affected by the acts of the father. The tension in each individual story was enough to keep me reading, but I was also drawn in as I wondered how each new story fit with the previous stories. The final chapter which brings it all together in Haiti in the 60's is incredible. The fact that I continued to read even through the scenes that were painful enough to make me cringe is testament to what an incredible writer Danticat is. Beautiful writing that looks at a very difficult story with truth... even when it's uncomfortable. HIGHLY recommended!"},{"Title":"The Dew Breaker","review":"My initial thought upon purchasing The Dew Breaker was I would have difficulty relating to the book's themes. My impression stemmed from both my unfamiliarity with the book's background (Haiti during the Duvalier dictatorship) and its structure of a separate short story for each character (which I thought would result in a disjointed narrative). However, by the end of the book, neither concern had become manifest for me. Danticat's vivid writing style made it easy to become emotionally connected with the book's characters, even though I had little familiarity with their environment. But, most surprising was the success of the short story format. Instead of being a haphazard collection, Danticat carefully weaves little facts (sometimes no more than a name) which tie the stories together. By taking this approach, Danticat highlights the fact that we are all interconnected in ways we don't readily see. The approach also allows her to show how that interconnectivity transcends both physical location and time to impact lives. Such a statement likely wouldn't have been as clearly conveyed under another format.It is no surprise that The Dew Breaker has found a large audience and received substantial critical acclaim. It is a well written novel with fully realized characters and a powerful message. If the experiences of the Haitian people are the genesis for such an interesting examination of our humanity, then let us hope that Danticat continues to find their efforts as inspiration for her future explorations of the human condition."},{"Title":"The Dew Breaker","review":"This book is so great, because it tells a chilling tale of physical and mental torture. We learn more about Haiti and the lives of Haitian immigrants in America. Their struggle to assimilate to a new culture and forget their past no matter how horrific it was. The novel was setup more like a series of short stories instead of the traditional novel structure, which would have made the story a greater read as we felt a continuous peak and valley moving us to the most horrible moment of Ka's father's life. I wanted to drop with him and that didn't happen because of the structure of this book. Moreover, the pacing slowed the story down in places where it didn't need to be. Nonetheless, this book is one of the most well written books I have read ever. I look forward to more of her work."},{"Title":"Big Bowl Noodles and Rice: Fresh Asian Cooking From the Renowned Restaurant","review":"While the Bay Area has an abundance of Asian restaurants few compare to Big Bowl in the Mid-West.

What makes this book such a great reference is the emphasis on using quality ingredients and the cooking techniques are well described and easy to understand.

However, I read a hostile review above that was bursting with erroneous assertions. First, many anthropologists DO believe that the Neanderthals interbred with modern humans, and second, the Khazars DID convert en masse to Judaism in the 700s. A recent bestseller in Israel by Professor Shlomo Sand confirms this. And 90% of all the Jews in Israel are descended from these Khazar converts, who are racially a white Slavic-Caucasian-Jewish mix. As for the ludicrous claim the author is antisemitic, the author, Michael Bradley, IS semitic! Not only is he half-Jewish but he was raised to be very liberal. But I suppose that if he speaks the truth, now he is a \\"Nazi.\\" A liberal Jewish nazi.... One of the main thrusts of the book, btw, is defending the dignity of women against violence.

After reading Bradley's &quot;The Iceman Inheritance&quot; and &quot;The Columbus Conspiracy&quot;, I found the Chosen People to be highly informative. Bradley takes the reader through the brief and short history of the Caucasian Man (Origins from somewhere in the Caucasus Mountains in Central Europe) to the misinformation being purported about Jewish Ancestry and its ties to Europe. With the knowledge of the reader, Bradley clearly shows that the conversion of Caucasians to Judaism occurred around 729 A.D. by the Arabs; these same people today deny the real Jews of the Bible, the Falasha of Ethiopia, their real identity and relationship in relation to the &quot;White-Washing&quot; of the Bible today. Insightful reading for people of color who may be confused as to what a Semite really is and who is really a Jew and is there such a thing as Yiddish being the language of the original Jew.

The novel actually contains two stories -- two examples of contact with alien life from Mars. The one about the Inca could imho have been left out entirely. I think Watson tried to use this part to reinforce the archetypal images, which I feel ultimately drags down the story of the astronauts. However, this is a very ambitious novel that does succeed on a mythic level, and some readers may prefer this story that takes place on Earth. For me, the mystery of Martian life forms takes place in a stronger way with the space story. Could an encounter with an alien life form be of benefit to mankind in both a mental and physical way? This is the question Watson answers at least in a poetic fashion in this classic of science fiction. I had to read the last chapters a number of times to get at least some idea of Watson's conclusions. Even then, the answers do enter the realm of the mystic, which is, I guess, his forte as a writer."},{"Title":"Martian Inca","review":"Another book concerned with mental states and evolution.

I read this book and it's a good read. It gives insight as to what 'could have been' and Bette Ross says she did a good deal of research and took a lot of things into account. That's fine, but if you're re-telling a Bible story to enhance it, and give more meaning and understanding to it, I believe the story told should at the very least be accurate to the Bible story.

Unfortunatley, when the author starts on about the philosphy of painting and perspective things get a bit dense and the language obscure.This is not a very large book (78 pages), but it does have some interesting things to say about Elizabeth's portraits and how they would have been viewed by their makers and the people who would have viewed them in Elizabeth's lifetime.The portraits delt with in this book are: 1 Elizabeth as a princess (red dress) 2.The &quot;armada&quot; portrait at woburn Abbey 3.The coronation portrait 4. Elizabeth playing the lute (a minature by Hilliard) 5 Queen Elizabeth and the 3 goddesses 6.The Darnley portrait 7. The &quot;Siena&quot; portrait 8.The &quot;ermine&quot; portrait 9. The &quot;ditchley&quot; portrait 10.The &quot;rainbow&quot; portrait.There are nice illustrations of all these portraits in the centre of the book.

At the same time it is facinating to see how a few stupid people could nearly eradicate a soccer club that has been in existence for around a century.If you are a football supporter but not a Leeds fan it is the ultimate illustration of how not to run a football club. Even if you hate soccer it is a great case study of business miss management, with all the classic elements such as poor financial controls, ego before thought and poor people management.As a fan I can only thank Trevor Birch and despise David O'Leary and Peter Risdale. The sins were no doubt unintentional but they were negligent and if you have the stewardship of anything as important as a Football Club negligence is inexcusable."},{"Title":"Standard Bible Atlas","review":"The product was what I expected and was informed of before I made my purchase.

Fr.Fernandez had exposed the problems friction between the GovernorGeneral and the Prelates in the Philippines. He illustrated severalstories but did not mention the daring coup d'etat made by his ownOrder the Dominicans on the murder of Governor Bustamante.Several chapters are also interesting including the quarrels betweenthe religious orders, and the religous orders and the secular clergy.The reluctance of the religious orders to give parishes to secularproved apocalpytic because currently several of the Secular Priests inthe country are corrupt and involved in other sexual scandals. Most ofthem are Scot Free because the Church refused to condemn their crimesand protects them from the prosecution of the Government.This book covers the Spanish Colonial Time, and I do not think therewill be no new books on the corruption and scandals of the PhilippineClergy at present time, for the remain powerful in the country."},{"Title":"Blood Brothers","review":"In 311 pages, Hopkins is able to blend in the CIA, NYPD, New York Mafia, Society of Jesus (Jesuits), and a 40 year old vendetta against Fidel Castro into a fast paced mystery adventure.

She uses renown experts on the subject, and than paraphrases/summarizes their conclusions in easy to understand language. As a teacher of poverty at a community college, it was a welcome relief to assign readings from this book because the students were able to grasp the subject so much better than with textbooks written for people already having a good foundation in economics, sociology and scientific inquiry.

Chasing a dream, he completely loses touch with reality. Although on the surface it may seem that he is a white man gone native, Almayer hasn't got a clue what he is dealing with. He is blind to the schemings of his Malay wife and equally oblivious to the fact that his daughter is drifting away from him.Admittedly, the book has 'orientalist' overtones but, then, Joseph Conrad is both a man of his time and a master of poweful prose, not a politically-correct scholar. The stereotypical mystique of Asia and the inscrutable oriental are exploited as a literary means to descend into the deeper levels of man's psyche. Just like the 'true heart' of Borneo and its inhabitants is hidden under layer upon layer of deceiving images, so is the core of each and every individual. The scariest place to travel is not the interior of an Indonesian Island, but the inner reaches of our own soul.Almayer's Folly is one of the best novels ever written. Not only because of the author's masterful portrayals of character, but also due his astounding command of English. It is hard to believe that Conrad's first and second language were Polish and French: he only learned English as an adult. It is this combination of psychological understanding and extraordinary use of language that make him into a literary genius."},{"Title":"Almayer's Folly","review":"This was Conrad's first novel, and I think it's an underappreciated jewel. It's written with a typical Victorian plotline, and one part of it has a romantic couple seeking their own happy ending, but don't be mistaken - it's real Conrad, so there's the glorious Conradian gloom, fear and descent into madness, too. It's a tale about a Dutchman in a business-gone-bad stranded in the Indonesian boondocks with his witch-like Malay wife who wishes him all the ill in the world. His only hope in life anymore is for his beautiful daughter and he dreams constantly of getting her educated and married off back in Amsterdam so he can wash his hands of his island nightmare and go back to normal life in Europe. But she grows up, grows distant to him, and he's clueless about the reality that she's adopted the local style and wants to be there. A handsome Balinese prince seeks her hand and the plot cranks into motion, spinning to a thrilling climax. It's an interesting study of problems of interracial, intercultural interaction, as valid today as it was in the late 19th century. The visual picture it paints of the old Dutch East Indies - the rivers, the tangled jungle flowers and the wildlife is another of its finest points."},{"Title":"Almayer's Folly","review":"I was surprised to find out this was Conrad's first book. I expected an awkwardness of a writer refining his skill, but what I found was a captivating, accessible and satisfying story. It has suspense and romance as well as the tragedy that Conrad is known for. I think the young characters and themes make this book far more accessible to a young person than the standard required Conrad novel--Heart of Darkness. Almayer's Folly is an excellent introduction to Conrad's work."},{"Title":"Almayer's Folly","review":"Almayer's folly is a powerful beginning to Conrad's second profession, writing. Since the story was written so close to Conrad's adventurous youth (the spring for his most powerful works), it provides the rawest expression of Conrad's views. Almayer, the prototype of Tuan Jim, takes the &quot;leap&quot; when he marries the Malay captive for promised wealth. This transgression drops his character into contact with the cold truths of nature; truths which dispel any artificial illusions or meanings. For Almayer, these illusions entailed sucess and fame in Europe, a place that he had never visited but only heard about from his mother. Superficially, this journey towards inner truth involves a journey into the wilds of Borneo, but,like in future Conrad works, we quickly realize that the journey is inward into the pysche of Almayer. Overall, an excellent introduction to Conrad."},{"Title":"Almayer's Folly","review":"Almayer's tragedy is that he has become mired in an enterprise which has not paid off. His supply station just doesn't make him rich as he had hoped. In the meantime he has taken a wife, a Malay, and they have a daughter. So Almayer is mired in Malaysia in more ways than one. Almayer dreams of Europe but it is unlikely he will ever return. His fate is to rot in the tropics. Conrads tale of a hopeless colonial exploiter is interesting for its unsentimental, unidealized view of the whole colonial enterprise. It is seen as being a losing situation for both sides. Both cultures suffer. The most tragic figures are those whose heritage is divided between both cultures, exploiter and exploited. (This is something this years Nobel Laureate 2001 V.S. Naipaul, who is often compared to Conrad, writes about.) Conrads book has an appealing exotic side to it as well though. The descriptive writing of the winding rivers and foliage and the entire tropical setting is tempting as it attracts interesting types and seems to offer a life of indolence and easy riches and forbidden pleasures but of course there is a backlash. The plot itself is a winding river with many turns. Not a perfect book but an interesting book to read after having read many of Conrads later books. Conrad in his autobiographical A Personal Record describes his meeting with the character who inspired the fictive Almayer as being the beginning of his writing career. The whole colonial enterprise seemed to be embodied in the attitude and fate of that one isolated figure for him. I guess for that reason we can thank Almayer for existing."},{"Title":"Almayer's Folly","review":"I refer to the Wordsworth Classics printing that contains the short stories 'Tales of Unrest'. 'Almayer's Folly' is an engaging novel that kept my interest despite being read in a haphazard way during travel. My favourite quote from the novel is: 'But a man busy contemplating the wreckage of his past in the dawn of new hopes cannot be hungry whenever his rice is ready.' I enjoy the convoluted paragraphs that Conrad constructs that are surprisingly transparent for the reader - an extraordinary achievement for a man with English as his second language. He really does show the power of the language to richly counterpoint ideas of place and people. What, I wonder, was Conrad's skill with his native language? 'The Return' is a story of such mundane environment that I wondered if I was reading Conrad, but the unfolding of the narrative soon restores my impression. is there some Anna Kavan here? (or is Conrad in Kavan?)."},{"Title":"Almayer's Folly","review":"Though overshadowed by his later work, Joseph Conrad's Almayer's Folly is one of the most impressive debut novels - excellent in itself and fascinating to fans and scholars in how it has in embryo so much of his later greatness. When we consider that he lacked literary training and did not learn English until his twenties, the accomplishment is near-unbelievable. All fans will of course want this, and its relative straight-forwardness makes it a good place for neophytes to start.Like most Conrad, the book can be thoroughly enjoyed on a very simple level as an adventure tale in an exotic locale. This story of nineteenth-century Borneo has much exciting drama: smuggling, international political intrigue, internecine rivalry and fighting, and much more. There is even a very moving and somewhat unconventional love story as well as a focus on domestic matters to which Conrad rarely returned. His depictions of the little-known landscape are also lush and memorable; he truly seems to bring to life a world very few Westerners know anything of even now with all its excitement and danger. These are the elements that initially got most attention, much to Conrad's chagrin because they were not his real point. However, they are still notable, and we can now enjoy all elements in proportion.The others are indeed noteworthy; it is truly nothing less than remarkable how much food for proverbial thought Conrad injects into this early work and how many themes later dealt with in more detail were already here. He would of course write many more stories featuring the sea and out-of-the-way locations, but these are only trappings for his tried and true themes, the most immediate being colonialism as well as the clash between Eastern and Western cultures, racism, and other ensuing factors. The story is set at a time when the Dutch and English both had interest in Borneo, dramatizing their profound and often destructive effect on the indigenous culture with stirring realism. The colonialism condemnation is not as overt as in later Conrad, but he spares no detail in depicting the havoc it wreaked. This debut novel interestingly focuses more on the native perspective than later works, giving a nuanced view and earning considerable sympathy for the oppressed culture. Indeed, in a true blow to Western ego, non-whites eventually triumph, and their constant cries against the \\"infidel\\" and benedictions of Allah's merciful Providence ring true.More important, though, is the tragic vision that all this symbolizes. Few writers - nay, few human beings - have been as pessimistic as Conrad, and he began at least as darkly as he ended. The appropriately named novel focuses mostly on its tragic title hero, who is not without admirable qualities but is simply unable to overcome his flaws. His dreams are big, but self-delusion, prejudice, greed, and narrow-mindedness ensure continuing failure and miserable destruction. The novel is a grand vista of individual tragedy; loathsome as Almayer is in many ways, he is arguably more sinned against than sinning. His truly wretched fate arouses much pathos, as does the emotion-drenched book generally. It paints a very grim picture of human ambition and the efficacy of communication - a truly moving tragedy to which many can unfortunately relate.As always with Conrad, the prose itself is also of great note. At about 130 pages, the story is very concise, and the prose is extremely precise yet highly evocative; Conrad's vocabulary is simply incredible, and his descriptions are profoundly memorable and often affecting whether about landscapes, love, or blighted hope. There are more signs of not being a native speaker than later, as he had yet to master the language, which will fascinate fans and scholars, but he already had a greater command than nearly all natives in the areas that make great literature.All told, while this does not make Conrad's very top tier, it is tantalizingly close; it is not only an incredible debut but would be nothing less than most writers' masterpiece, which is probably all that need be said.As for this edition, it is important to realize that, like others in the Dover Thrift series, it is bare bones - only a short headnote other than the text. Anyone wanting extra will need to look elsewhere, but the work more than stands on its own."},{"Title":"Almayer's Folly","review":"This was Conrad's first novel, first published in 1895. It is the start of a series of novels and stories set in South East Asia. He had first hand knowledge of the region due to his own work as a merchant sailor. He also knew a lot, obviously, from Alfred Russell Wallace's travel account The Malay Archipelago.Main themes of the story are the greed of colonialism and the racism of colonial routine. The story: a young colonial Dutchman, grown up in Java, takes a job as a clerk in a trading firm in Makassar, on the island of Celebes, keen to get rich. A legendarily rich merchant captain picks him as son in law for his adopted Malay daughter from pirate background, offers him a job as station manager in Borneo, with prospects of a huge inheritance.All goes wrong. The business fails over the years, not the least due to Almayer's lack of social intelligence. The fortune of the father in law dwindles. The station is unable to compete or even coexist with the local ruler and an Arab competitor. The marriage fails, partly because Almayer is a racist, partly because the wife has other ideas of the world, as one would expect from a Sulu pirate. He invests his emotions in a beautiful daughter and dreams of settling in Europe with her, after striking it rich. He dreams of a Borneo El Dorado. He understands nothing and nobody, certainly not his daughter, who can not see the charm in the prospect of settling in Amsterdam. She prefers to fall in love with a Balinese prince, betting on the local half of her heritage.The historical background is the Dutch consolidation of their rule in the region that later became Indonesia. Borneo is yet hardly under control. A definition of British and Dutch interests and boundaries was still to come. Aceh was rebelling against Dutch rule, as they would later against Javanese rule. Bali is still independant and fiercely determined to remain so. That's why the Balinese prince shows up in Borneo, he is looking for gunpowder. Which in turn quickens Almayer's downfall, since the colonial rulers see him as an unreliable subject who trades with insurgents.A problem with the novel is the total lack of redeeming features in the damned fool Almayer. He is so much not a positive hero, that his failure fails to touch us as tragedy. But the man is real. The world is full of such people.Conrad's start into the writer's career was not the top of his achievements, but for me, it is one of my favorites among his works. This is partly due to a personal relation to the locations."},{"Title":"Almayer's Folly","review":"Although not to be compared with his major works, this is nonetheless a most impressive first novel. Perhaps because he was already well into his thirties when he wrote and published it, the book contains all the major themes that one associates with Conrad. If one has not read any Conrad at all, I would recommend going to his great masterpieces first (VICTORY, NOSTROMO, THE SECRET AGENT, UNDER WESTERN EYES, HEART OF DARKNESS, THE NIGGER OF THE 'NARCISSUS', or LORD JIM). But for anyone who enjoys the work of Joseph Conrad, this book can hardly fail to fascinate."},{"Title":"Almayer's Folly","review":"As this is Conrad's first novel, it is not fair to expect the sort of power that illuminates his later works. However, Almayer's Folly is a good, solid novel which shows the potential for Conrad's later greatness. A love story at its heart, Almayer's Folly also provides a last look at classical imperialism and the crossroads of multiple cultures. A short novel, I would heartily recommend it."},{"Title":"Almayer's Folly","review":"Though overshadowed by his later work, Joseph Conrad's Almayer's Folly is one of the most impressive debut novels - excellent in itself and fascinating to fans and scholars in how it has in embryo so much of his later greatness.

Quite simply, the treasure never appears and Almayer is left to ponder what could have been. His woes are intensified by the departure of his daughter, one of his few links to &quot;civilised Europe.&quot; Classic symbolism occurs late in the novel, as Almayer erases the footprints of his daughter the day of their parting. While &quot;Almayer's Folly&quot; doesn't reach the heights of Conrad's longer (read: better) works, this effort still captures the romantic essence of the Far East in the classic Conrad style."},{"Title":"Almayer's Folly","review":"Almayer's Folly was Joseph Conrad's first novel. I have nothing to compare it to, as I have not read his signature work, Heart of Darkness, nor any of his other lesser known stories and novels. I came into the possession of Almayer's Folly by chance; one of my friend's mothers had taken the book from the DISCARD pile in the library and urged me to take it from her.I'm glad that fate has brought me this book. It's the story of Almayer-- a Dutchman who has been born and raised in Colonial Indonesia. He spends his life idolizing Europe and Western ideals, scorning his homeland. Yet he never once ventures to Europe. In fact, most of his interactions with Europeans often find him the butt of their jokes. He doesn't fare much better with the Malay natives and Arab merchants--while often treated as a superior by virtue of his race, they still regard him as a fool.Almayer has nothing but haughty contempt for the native Malay culture of Borneo. Even with his Malay wife and half-Malay daughter, he keeps a Imperialist's distance from the culture which surrounds him. Feeling no true kinship with his European heritage, and scorning the one with which he is most familiar, he's a case study in the pathologies which arise from Colonialism.Essentially, Almayer is a semi-sympathetic buffoon. His life is full of grandiose wishes and little reward. He yearns for great treasure, yet is no warrior and a mediocre businessman. He lacks the cunning and courage of many other characters--A Malay Rajah, a slave, an Arab trader, and a swashbuckling British compatriot, are just a few of the characters who outshine Almayer.Yet, its his weaknesses which make his placement as the central character one of the most endearing aspects of the book. Because he is such a fragile, inept person, we become more comfortable with the savageness, intelligence, and verve in the other principal characters.Almayer's undramatic life serves as the backdrop for the love story between his daughter and a handsome Balinese Prince. Her choice to eschew a comfortable European upbringing and to align herself with the romantic, savage culture of her Malay mother is the emotional keystone in the novel.I was often astounded by Conrad's rich evocation of the setting and characters in colonial Indonesia. I'm not much for florid, lush descriptions, but Conrad sets himself above the heap of dilettantes and impostors: his ornate narrative holds together, forming a monumental, often breathtaking vision of Colonial Indonesia. The dynamic characters, expansive forests, and socio-political themes all receive the same rigorous, beautiful treatment.One drawback is that, because Conrad's talents are so visible and easy to explain, the mystery and magic in great pieces of art is obscured in this work. Furthermore, his characters seem to vacillate unnaturally between mythical, cliched representations of themes and truly organic, dynamic beings. That being said, the novel was a thoroughly enjoyable read and I am excited to soon discover some of Conrad's more well known works."},{"Title":"Almayer's Folly","review":"\\"Almayer's Folly\\" adequately introduces the theme of culture conflict, an angle that is expressed more fully in Conrad's later works. I would certainly recommend this to anyone familiar with Conrad's body of work, which is not to say that readers new to his work should avoid this novel."},{"Title":"Almayer's Folly","review":"This is Joseph Conrads first novel. It deals with the conflicts between native people (Malayans) and Dutch tradesmen in the jungle of Borneo. It has some brilliant passages, but all in all it's a quite dull read."},{"Title":"Almayer's Folly","review":"This excellent short novel is very representative for Joseph Conrad's work. Its main theme of the foolish, dangerous and deadly dreams of colonialists was also treated in his short story \`An Outpost of Progress' (in 'Tales of Unrest') and in his masterpiece \`Heart of Darkness'.The main character in this story dreams of finding a mysterious treasure in order to be able to return to his homeland and live for the rest of his life in \`untold wealth'.For the indigenous, he is not more than another \`white man that comes to us to trade, with prayers on his lips and loaded guns in his hands.' He shows \`the same manifestations of love and hate and of sordid greed chasing the uncertain dollar in all its multifarious and vanishing shapes.'He is bitterly confronted with \`the savage mood which civilization could never destroy'.For Conrad, \`no two beings understand each other', so certainly not the \`savage' and the \`white man'.More, the \`uncompromising sincerity of Malay kinsmen' stands in sharp contrast with \`the sleek hypocrisy of white people with their vivid but foolish dreams'.This novel has not the same high standard as \`Heart of Darkness', but should not be missed."},{"Title":"Almayer's Folly","review":"This book by Conrad is a love story and a tragedy. The tragedy of Nina's father, Almayer--and the love story of Dain and Nina.But Almayer's Folly is not as great a book as Lord Jim or Nigger of the 'Narcissus,' which are among the great masterpieces of literature.There are several problems with Conrad's novel. For one thing, Almayer is not sympathetic enough to be a tragic hero. He just comes across as a real jerk. For another, the love story of Dain and Nina is so overblown and romantic as to be almost laughable, comic, and ridiculous. The characters and settings are hard to keep straight, as are the motivations of some of the doings.Frankly, I found it quite difficult to take any of it seriously. It may be that we are just too distant from Conrad's Borneo in time and place, but this is not a problem in some of Conrad's other novels.This is an inferior piece of literature. (Why the three stars in that case, you ask. Conrad's writing is so skilled in detail, and the setting and some of the other details so interesting, that the novel is absorbing--and mercifully short.)"},{"Title":"Almayer's Folly","review":"An alternative title for this novel could be Amayer's rut.For that is the situation that the main protagonist in this novel finds himself in. Almayer is a European trader living in atrading post somewhere in Indonesia or Malaysia with his daughter,a product of mixed marriage.Almayer dreams of escaping to Europe after making himself wealthy and bringing his daughter with him also.But as time drags on it becomes obvious that he is going nowhere with his life. He is not getting richer nor is he getting any younger. His own daughter ends up deserting him by eloping with a native who takes her to his own village.Not being a pure European by blood she realizes that she would never be accepted as an equal among Europeans or the whites.For this reason she chooses instead to live with the natives.As for Almayer he remains as he was.He is an example that one can find everywhere in the world.Someone stuck in a situation going nowhere but always dreaming of getting out and changing his life."},{"Title":"Plumage","review":"It must have been while I was going to all those singles dances that I became fascinated by mating rituals, and decided to write about a woman getting back into fancy feathers after almost three decades of marriage. I knew how hard it was to do this, and how difficult to get back into courtship dances and billing and cooing... Stuck in a bird metaphor, I researched bowerbirds and budgies and hoatzins and such, becoming even more engrossed. Hey, all sorts of women's issues are incarnated in grackles and cassowaries and geese. I discovered that birds and humans have a lot more in common than just walking on two legs. Wow, do avian relationships parallel human ones! Birds of a feather share household chores together, but in species that glorify the male...watch out. Gender Inequality Alert. And how does my dowdy, dumped, middle-aged heroine, poor little Sassy, feel about that?Hmmm...Of course, there are some important differences between birds and people:1) In avian species in which the genders differ in appearance, the male gets to wear the fancy feathers. Of course, in humans, there are drag queens.... Enter Racquel, my other main character.2) In birds, mating is done via cloaca. Only waterfowl have...um, to put it crudely, only ducks have ... . And how does Racquel feel about that?3) Birds can fly. That's a real, real important difference. Does Sassy want to fly?Don't we all?I'm a funny little bird myself, I guess, to be thinking about these things. By the time I got finished writing PLUMAGE, I almost felt like I could eat pokeweed and crap purple. But there's a lot more to life -- and PLUMAGE -- than just fun and fancy feathers. Being able to fly has a lot to do with remembering how."},{"Title":"Plumage","review":"I purchased Plumage because it received a favorable review in an article on several books that addressed &quot;women's issues&quot; from different perspectives. To be honest, I wasn't all that interested in issue-oriented fiction, but it also sounded like it might be a good read. It hung around the house for quite a while before I picked it up one day and discovered that it is better than a good read - it's a great read.Plumage is one of those novels that restores your faith in - indeed, rekindles your memory of - the pleasure of a wonderful story. You are quickly drawn into the plot, which is quite imaginative, and slowly but surely come to feel the world through Sassy's eyes. The author's choice of words is not self-consciously artsy; yet her descriptions of the natural world (and particularly its colors and textures) are very evocative and perfectly integrated into the story itself.I won't reveal any of that story, as it should be experienced first-hand. But I will tell you that while reading it I found myself thinking of the child I once was, and how I experienced the world back then, and how all of us lose something as we make the transition to our adult selves, something that we can occasionally reclaim - at least in part.The plot is compelling and the resolution completely satisfying, but the real pleasure is in the journey itself. I am not a big fan of fantasy - I'd rather read Dostoevsky than Tolkien - but Plumage appeals on multiple levels. It appeals to both your &quot;sense of the sensible&quot; and your sense of wonder. Highly recommended; a fine-feathered find."},{"Title":"Furioso","review":"I love The three musketeers by Dumas; of late I've been purchasing all the books inspired by Dumas' immortal tale I've been able to find.

I really recommend it for any one who: a) loves Three Musketeers b)Likes spy stories c)is WWII buff"},{"Title":"Furioso","review":"I have loved this book and its sequel, Fracasso, for twenty years. It is comic, demented and poignant, following Dumas cleverly without sacrificing historical accuracy where the plot intersects known facts. Farce is piled on top of heartbreak: the story wows both the literature major in me and the student of WWII history, but that's not the point. It's the kind of writing you have to put down at intervals, because of the stone that forms in your throat at the ruthless way that Lestienne jams horror, innocence (and its loss), heroism and absurdity onto the same page. Reinhard Heydrich and Walter Schellenberg share the stage with Free French fighters who are unmistakable Musketeers: David Belletoise (Aramis), a handsome Jewish amorist; Pablo (Porthos), a French-African tattooed with a boa on his pimmel; and Breval (Athos), whose love story is even more grim and complicated than his original's. The English translation has a headlong style, and I don't know of any other author who can use so many exclamation points and get away with them -- in the narrative, not the dialogue. I have no idea why this book didn't get a wider public when it was originally in print."},{"Title":"Furioso","review":"In 1974 I read a blurp that said \\"The Three musketeers live!\\" I loved Dumas' book so I looked for this book. Let me say that it is written in the style of the original book, complete with chapter titles. It has a touch of HOGAN\\"S HEROES and some plain craziness.

When I say very good, I dont mean better than most romance novels good- I mean New England's answer to Chekov good. This lady really knows how to put a descriptive phrase together.the minuses- Akora is not a believable place. Some characters have hokey psychic powers which sort of conveniently saves Litton the trouble of writing a really sensible plot. Joanna, the main character is overly competent at everything to the point where she isnt believable. The character development is limited and the characters are sort of flat \\"good\\" or \\"evil\\" types with very few internal struggles if any.This book reads like Nathaniel Hawthorne was reincarnated as a 12 yr old girl who wanted to write the story of a disney cartoon. Well, maybe a precocious 12 yr old girl, but still.Overall, I did rate this book highly and would think that it is enjoyable for any woman that likes romances and many women that dont.

I bought this book and thought it was an ok read still very entertaining and I like that she made up a fantasy island that everyone would love to see and visit.

Joanna believes her sibling is being held prisoner on the fortress island of Akora. Since Alex is half Akoran and half English and is half-brother to Atreus, the Vanax ruler of the island, she believes he can rescue Royce. Alex insists no stranger has come to Akora because he would know.When Alex sets sail for his home, a desperate Joanna sneaks on board the ship. With dissension even among the Akoran Council over Atreus' efforts to reform society, Joanna is an unwelcome stranger. As Alex struggles to keep the female Xenos safe, they fall in love. However, before exploring a relationship between them, they must deal with an insidious plot to depose the Vanax using the incarceration of Royce to further their cause.In a short time, Josie Litton has become a fan favorite and her tale will embellish her reputation. Ms. Litton's latest trilogy opens with an exciting Regency romance that takes the two stars refreshingly away from the Ton to an enchanting Shangri-La. The exciting story line enables the audience to taste a culture that is more isolated than most; though insightful, the description paints a place to enlightening and Utopian. Still, DREAM ISLAND is a wonderful tale that fans will enjoy while anxiously awaiting the next story, KINGDOM OF MOONLIGHT, starring Royce and Kassandra (Alex's Akoran sister).Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Dream Island (Medieval Trilogy)","review":"If you haven't discovered Josie Litton, do so immediately.

Her books never fail to bring you into the story and completly saturate your every thought. This story, while not on the same line as her previous books was every bit what I had hoped it would be. I could not put it down, I recommend this book for the regency romantics while her previous books I would recommend for the historical romantic. All are excellent reading!"},{"Title":"Dream Island (Medieval Trilogy)","review":"The first thing I appreciated about this book was Ms.Litton's departure from the traditional Regency romance setting of London. Instead the majority of this novel takes place on the ficticious island nation of Akora.Lady Joanna is looking for her brother Royce who has disappeared on his voyage to Akora. Because Joanna is determined to find him she stows away aboard the ship of an Akoran prince, Alex, and arrives on the island amid controversy and speculation. It would be difficult to say more without giving away the happy ending.What's nice about this story is that although political undertones and the typical romance elements exist throughout, the characters of Joanna and Alex are well written, completely believable, and likeable as well. I'm looking forward to the next book in the trilogy."},{"Title":"Dream Island (Medieval Trilogy)","review":"I bought this book merely because it was on sale at a local bookstore. I needed a book to read on a flight to a business trip. It started rather boring before leaping into action at the second chapter.A willful English outcast, Joanna desperately wants to find her brother, Royce, who traveled to the fabled land of Akora to seek out its secrets. Akora is a fortress of solitude and isolation. No one gets in and no one gets out. That's what the society is encouraged to believe. Joanna is not just anyone. She's a willful woman who only wants her beloved brother back home where he is safe.She is usually quite conventional, but to her surprise, when Lord Alex, prince of Akora, refuses to help her, she takes a leap (literally) into the dangerous clutches of an age-old evil. She steals away into an Akoran ship which happens to be the ship of the dangerous yet mysterious Alex. He hasn't the heart to do what he should, cast her into the ocean or deliver her to her enemies in desperation to preserve the cruel image of Akora.Joanna finds herself in a world of legend. Descending from Greek origin, the anciently isolated land of Akora is both old and new. Their knowledge, information, and society is a mixture like Joanna has never seen. Lord Alex, Prince of Akora, is unlike any man she has met.She has an instant attraction, and he feels the same way, but neither want to let the other interfere with their business, but when a growing political enemy of the leader of Akora threatens Alex's beloved Joanna, he won't let them get away. It doesn't help that Joanna is anything but naive and thrusts herself into the greatest evil in a desperate attempt to save her brother, he must take action.Another twist to the book is Joanna's odd but exciting power thats orgins are traced to Akora. This is a book that is no stranger to action, love, and excitement. Don't miss the sequel in which Kassandra, Alex's brother, and Royce, Joanna's brother, meet in a dreadfully challenging time in England.The only downfall in the book would be its confusing revelations about the orgin of Akora and the evolution of the Akorans. Everything else is mostly exciting, although it would have been funner if Joanna played more hard-to-get, but overall, it was enjoyable."},{"Title":"Dream Island (Medieval Trilogy)","review":"I'll admit it, I had high hopes for this book. I love the Atlantis idea and as I really enjoyed Josie Litton's first three books, I couldn't wait to read this one. I liked it alot but something seemed missing. Maybe the sensual tension was off? It just seemed slower moving than previous books. I didn't feel all that close to the characters but I did enjoy the story.

I haven't yet read any of Josie Litton's other books, but I really enjoyed this one. I've read it three times, so far.I was a bit wary initially of a book with a \\"mythic kingdom\\" but the author really brought Akora alive to the reader. The \\"another time, another place\\" aspect was fun and the customs and court intrigue on Akora were interesting.And Alex - half English, half Akoran - Lord Darcourt in England; Prince Alexandros on Akora was absolutely fabulous! I really loved his character. Sweet, charming, arrogant, smart, strong, sexy - mmm, mmm!Lady Joanna Hawkforte was fun and feisty. Stowing away on a ship bound to the foreign land of Akora which doesn't welcome strangers. Her brother went there months before and has yet to return, and Lady Joanna, unable to get any assistance to find her brother from either the British government or from the arrogant Lord Darcourt, sets off to find him herself.She is discovered in the hold of the Akoran ship by Alex and he allows her to remain on board and go on to Akora. He's not convinced that her brother is there, but he doesn't dismiss the idea either. He tells Joanna that he will look into her brother's situation once they arrive in Akora.From there, romance, adventure, intrigue and assasination attempts ensue. The action moves between England and Akora. We meet Alex's half-brother Atreus, leader of Akora, Alex's sister Kassandra and Joanna's brother Royce setting up the characters for a trilogy of \\"Akora\\" stories.

I think it is interesting that she has some of her characters from both cultures this gives it a little slant as they can understand both sides of the argument andloyalties which she brings up in all of these trilogies.

The two books so far from this guy Krane remind me of the Stephen King's early mature novels.The story is scary and compelling enough just in outline -- a disease that causes adolescent boys to suddenly burst into flame. But what Krane does with it is pure genius -- he gets into the mind of one of the boys, a heart-breakingly vulnerable and artistic orphan (guess why he's an orphan) and makes us live the tragic career of a talented man-child doomed to function as tool of an intelligence so alien that its cruelty and iron obdurancy make you want to shout out in defense of the protagonist.If that isn't enough, the other point of view character is a man seeking to solve the riddle of these boys who spontaneously combust. And his story also involves betrayal, anguish, and ultimately compassion for the victims.STRANGER INSIDE echoes CARRIE, yes, but it comes to the table with a deeper appreciation of what it is to be an alienated teen -- in this case a teen with a secret more devastating than an unsympathetic and anhedonic mother -- than we ever could have had when we read that earlier masterpiece. Krane, and we, have lived through the tragedy of Columbine, and if we're attuned to the complex message of that catastrophe, this book is going to make us think more deeply than ever before about the nature of innocence and victimization.Krane gets to the heart of what it is to be young and a victim. He treats issues of privacy and first amendment rights, as well as the ineffective and cruel way adolescents are treated in our society when they fall afoul of the law, whether as a result of their own ill deeds or innocently.You'll read this book fast -- the pages turn quickly.

Every aspect of his life can be found in Cheyenne Line. These are the keen-eyed observations of an educated man who has also been sanded down by prairie winds.

Life's truths were discovered and shared while playing cards and mendng fences. &quot;Running with Dogs&quot; and &quot;Teaching the Dawn&quot; revealed a man and his solitary musings.

Brummels is called a \\"cowboy poet,\\" and that may not be unfair. He writes about working the land, riding herd, small towns, and his love of Nebraska ranchland. But he avoids many cowverse stereotypes. He uses vernacular free verse, eschewing sentimental rhymes and too-cute quatrains. He uses snappy imagery and smart, vernacular idioms. Yet somehow, there's something about this book that leaves me cold.Cowverse is a very conformist community, and Brummels boldly ducks its most derivative shortcomings. When he writes about playing cards on a winter midnight in the bunkhouse, or buying tack in a dying prairie town, he's not glorifying himself or his world. I get the sense that he knows the world he describes is disappearing. He neither mourns nor exalts, he simply describes his world as it is.Based solely on his imagery, Brummels may be one of the most forthright, powerful, incisive poets to come out of Nebraska. But imagery is only half of poetry. His language is very functional. Reading his work, I get the feeling that he sees words entirely as units of meaning, not as units of sound. The result is poetry that feels very prose-like. Consider this representative sample, from \\"Letter to New York,\\" page 27:Those big storms on the news brought you to mind.The weather on the wide side of the Big Riveris seldom reported, except locally, and hereit's hardly news. All last summer we flirtedwith record highs set in the dirtiest yearsof the thirties without breaking a single one.If I read this work in a workshop setting, I'd tell Brummels to avoid dense concentrations of small function words like \\"is,\\" \\"and,\\" and \\"the.\\" I'd tell him that phrases like \\"the wide side of the Big River\\" are too cute and clich&eacute;d, like refugees from a country-and-western B-side. I'd tell him that punctuation should be kept to a minimum so the language, not the writer, determines the form of the verse. I could go on, but you get my point.Brummels constructs moving, insightful images, and leads the reader from examinations of the everyday, up through layers of metaphysical meaning, and back to the world, but trailing clouds of cowverse glory. In terms of meaning, I really like what he does with words. But in terms of the potential of language, he falls short, and the pieces read like short personal essays chopped into lines, almost at random.So perhaps we can call Brummels a mixed bag. Some people may place more weight on meaning, and will like these poems more than me. But those of us who see poetry as a confluence of meaning and music are likely to be disappointed."},{"Title":"Beef Production and Management Decisions","review":"If you are considering cattle ranching or producing beef in a feedlot this book will be invaluable to you or your students.I found the inclusion of general management advice to be especially valuable.The data provided to analyze the income potential of various types of production considerations also is appreciated.If you can buy only one book regarding beef production, buy BEEF PRODUCTION AND MANAGEMENT DECISIONS.

The initial section tries to appeal to the \\"higher management\\" of any Erp Implementation covering Project Management. Then it gives an overview of module by module of the Oracle 11i suite with special emphasis on what's new on 11i. The breadth of coverage is high but the depth leaves a lot demanding. To be fair to the authors, it is almost impossible to cover depth in each module in 11i because probably 50 volumes would required and because every implementation is unique.Most of the Erp Implementation have solution providers who know the basics of the setup and ilk but what they are looking for is examples and that is what, I did not find in the book. There is a mention of existence of interfaces and APIs but no examples are forthcoming in the text.Apart from the 11i, the information provided on consultants is interesting. There is a need for a book in Erps - Oracle , SAP or Peoplesoft that displays numerous example of implementation from start to finish. Unlike Excel or Word which have a low barrier to entry in terms of neuron consumptions, ERP require significant investment of time and experience and creative ideas to be even be at level, where one can barely float on the ocean of erp. Learning by examples is the best route and I am sure soon there will be specific books by some who will target piece by piece (module by module) the entire erp with some examples. May be we will have books module by module with explanation, soon!"},{"Title":"Special Edition Using Oracle 11i","review":"This book gives an excellent overview of the non-CRM modules in Oracle 11i suite - Financials, HRMS, Manufacturing, Projects. What is refreshing about this book is in addition to information on 11i, this book also provides thoughtful discussions on Project Management and on consulting. The authors have indeed succeeded in packaging these exhaustive material within one volume. This book is a &quot;must have&quot; as a reference for anyone who is involved in ERP implementation project.Hopefully we will soon have a similar book on CRM modules that includes inter-relationship between different ERP-CRM modules."},{"Title":"Special Edition Using Oracle 11i","review":"This book does not provide the level of detail that would help most Apps developers. This book is designed more for functional analysts responsible for setups, than for developers who need to understand the underlying architecture and functionalities.

This book also tries to cover too many modules, but fails to provide much detail in any areas."},{"Title":"Special Edition Using Oracle 11i","review":"I purchased this book mainly for HRMS. But there is a very small section denoted for it. I think the book is ok for the other modules, but definitely not for HRMS. It also doesnt cover OTL, Self Service or OTA."},{"Title":"Special Edition Using Oracle 11i","review":"The scope of this book is so huge there's just no way it could be anything other than a consise intro to the major functionality of each of the modules. For me (as an Apps Consultant) it's a decorative paperweight. I never refer to it myself however this is the book I always toss to the clients when there is no budget for any training whatsoever and some poor accountant has to switch to Oracle from another ERP - it's certainly easier to understand than the help screens ;)Overall I liked it - I think the guys from BOSS did a nice job summarising the financial applications. Of course, it's getting a bit out of date now but for an accountant it's worthwhile."},{"Title":"Hollow Tree Nights and Days","review":"My father loved this book as a child, and read it to us when we were young. I purchased this to read to my grandsons. The stories are delightful, but this particular edition has no illustrations. That is no big deal, but the text refers to a map of the Sleepy Hollow Woods - and there is no map to refer to. I will try to locate a copy with a map so they can have a visual to get a better feel of the characters' homes and adventures. Now that I think of it, it isn't the map I remember as a child, but the Sunday afternoon tradition of my dad reading this to us....precious memories. If you want memories like that, this is a wonderful book to share with a younger generation."},{"Title":"Hollow Tree Nights and Days","review":"Nothing like the original. Should have been told that it was just a script copy!!! No pictures and writing in play form.VERY disappointed."},{"Title":"Hollow Tree Nights and Days","review":"This book presents a wonderful cosmology of anthropromorphic animals living in the deep woods, their adventures, and the life lessons one might learn from these adventures. The book contains fine old ink drawings of the creatures and their habitat. This book hails from the early 1940s, so some of the tales will strike younger readers as dated or naive. Others may find the book's quaintness charming and the adventures of the denizens of the deep woods still very entertaining and worth reading."},{"Title":"Vampire Dreams (Smart Novels: Vocabulary)","review":"James Weston never wanted to become a vampire. He didn't even know that his mother was one until the night she changed him without even asking. After waking up from the horrible experience of having his neck bitten and being forced to drink the blood of his mother, James began his education on being a vampire. His mother's friend, Alistair, took him to his estate and began his training along with two other newly-turned vampires named Susan and Adam. Susan seemed to understand James' reluctance to succumb to the freedoms of the vampire life, but Adam, on the other hand, was the exact monster that James envisioned a true vampire would be. James realized he couldn't fit into the life his mother and the others wanted for him so he decided to leave and hopefully disappear in New York City. James never wanted to be found.Before being turned into a vampire, James had plans of becoming a doctor. He tried to attend classes, but realized it would be difficult with all the human blood he would come into contact with so he decided to give up the medical field and focus on plants. Even though he didn't need money since his father left him a sizable inheritance after his death, James usually had a couple of students he tutored each semester. That was how he met Victoria. The minute he saw her, his life changed. It had been five years since he left Alistair and the others and except for his cat, Solitaire, he didn't have any friends. Meeting Victoria made him realize he wanted companionship and someone to love. He just couldn't trust himself around her, which drove him crazy. Each time they got close he could smell the blood running through her veins and wanted to do nothing except bite her neck and taste her sweet blood.Everything in New York was fine until a serial killer began to strike. He leaves his victims drained of blood, which leads the media to call him the Vampire Killer. On top of all of his feelings for Victoria and the Vampire Killer being on the loose, James thinks he sees Adam. Eventually his fears are confirmed when Adam starts hanging around Victoria. James is scared for Victoria's safety, but is caught between a rock and hard place because he can't tell her the truth about the reason Adam is dangerous. Life becomes even more hazardous for James when other people from his past find him and force him to face some unwanted truths.VAMPIRE DREAMS: A SparkNotes SAT Vocabulary Novel is an interesting story even though it is a little forced at times because of trying to fit in all the difficult vocabulary. It didn't interrupt the flow of the story at all to look at the bottom of the page to check the definition of each of the boldface words that was used in the story. VAMPIRE DREAMS is a story not only for people studying for the SAT, but for everyone who is a fan of the vampire genre.Reviewed by: Karin Perry"},{"Title":"Vampire Dreams (Smart Novels: Vocabulary)","review":"I am a teacher of students who have a relatively low vocabulary and struggle with de-coding and learning words in context. This series is AMAZINGLY helpful! My students are chewing through these books and wanting more. AWESOME! The only down side is this story is a little 'out there.' The kids love the ease with which they can learn new words and see them used. It isn't a perfect environment for thorough vocab learning, but they are a wonderful place to start!"},{"Title":"Vampire Dreams (Smart Novels: Vocabulary)","review":"I found this book to have the hardest vocab out of all of the sparknotes novels. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to improve their vocab.But if you're looking for a good story, I found this story horrible. Though I love vampire stories, this one had an uncomplete plot, unsolved mysterIES &lt;- more than one, and just confusion about what the plot really was about. The author didn't really explain the conflicts of the main character - I was utterly disapointed when the author failed to elaborate more about the main character's parents.Recommended for students prepping for the SAT; but not for anyone looking for a good read."},{"Title":"Vampire Dreams (Smart Novels: Vocabulary)","review":"I picked up this book to brush up on vocabulary.

I realize it's more of a novella than anything, but I would rather read a novella that kicks 'rear end'(you know the word) than Crime & Punishment--which, by the way, I did not finish.

He agrees to sign up for four months to turn things around, and turns to his ex-wife to become the executive chef. Penny and Cal have not seen each other in three years, but the sparks are still there. She negotiates the terms, in hopes that after this gig she will have enough to open her own restaurant. She also neglects to mention that she is currently four months pregnant.When the restaurant re-opens, it becomes a hit thanks to Penny's culinary talents - she even makes fish and chips seem gourmet! But the biggest snag for success is Cal's witch of a grandmother who is constantly scheming to keep her grandchildren in line, including making life a living hell for Penny.Penny still loves Cal, but has never forgiven him for bailing on her when she lost their child. Unknown to her, Cal fathered a child when he was a teen, and while he has kept abreast of his daughter, he has never met her, and has kept her a secret from everyone but his conniving grandmother. He is not sure he has enough love to give another child, but rather than admit this to Penny, he let her leave him.\\"Delicious\\" is an addictive second chance at romance dramedy.

I addition you also get glimpses into the lives of the other Buchanan siblings with minor story lines.

The issue is that the best chef for the job in none other than Cal's ex-wife, Penny Jackson.Penny is very interested in the opportunity The Waterfront offers. By taking this job, she will be able to save enough money to buy her own restaurant. And now that she is pregnant, at least one of her dreams is coming true. If Penny takes this job, she will be well on her way to achieving another of her long held dreams.Soon things between Cal and Penny start to heat up. Just when it starts to look like they might have another chance at happiness together, a secret from Cal's past threatens their fragile bond.I've been a fan of Susan Mallery for quite some time. But I will admit, Delicious just blew me away. I started reading it after work and stayed up until dawn to finish it. Cal and Penny's story really captured me. I am a fan of second chances, and Cal and Penny satisfied my hunger for another try at happily ever after.Although, Cal made me want to take a baseball bat to him a few times, I could easily see Penny's love for him and her unconscious desire to reunite. Not that I don't adore Cal, I do. Ms. Mallery wrote him, and all her characters in this novel, quite wonderfully, realistically, and humanly flawed. I feel like I know them all and already miss hanging out with them!Of course, I am eager for the other three books in this series. I want happiness for little sister Dani. I think the handsome, tomcat brother, Reid, needs his comeuppance. I want to be around to see that! And the former marine brother, Walker, well... he touched my heart and I am salivating for his book! If you are a fan of contemporary romance, The Buchanans is a series NOT to be missed!

I liked Penny a lot: ambitious, spunky, passionate -- but the story behind Cal's lack of love in their previous marriage was just not appealing. I, too, wondered how, after he had so broken her heart, that she would immediately jump into bed with him and fall all over again. I did not, for a minute, think that he had changed so much that he really loved Penny.Ironically, the best thing about this book was the descriptions of the restaurant business and the hustle and bustle of working daily in such a fast-paced environment.The next book in this series, \\"Irresistible\\" is even less compelling than this one. Yawn. I don't even care to finish Book 3 and 4. After slogging through the first three Marcelli Sisters trilogy, I'm pretty much finished with Susan Mallery. I just don't find her writing very interesting."},{"Title":"Delicious (The Buchanans, Book 1)","review":"Mallery writes with flair and humor. Her dialogue is funny, witty, and very readable. The restaurant business is the background for this story and she hits it dead on. Very accurate. Her secondary characters -the brothers, the best friend, the sister, the kitchen staff, are great.The main characters however leave alot to be desired. Cal is a mess. He is self-focused, confused, guilt-ridden, and the way he acted in his marriage - unworthy of a hero. The problems that the author gave him - there wasn't a way to make it all better. His realization that he could love everyone- not just a child he gave up for adoption -was lame. It did not work. Not for me at least.The storyline - in regards to Cal and Penny's relationship was weird. Motivations were weak. I did not buy in to her sleeping with him - when the issues between them were so large. And when he stated that he had never really loved her - through their whole marriage -and how he was relieved when she lost thier baby - I was totally turned off.Why would she go back to him? Penny was a great character except for her relationship with Cal. She made something of herself, planned a family by herself, was tough and respected...yet a doormat when it came to Cal. Yuck."},{"Title":"Delicious (The Buchanans, Book 1)","review":"Although I love Susan Mallery's writing, I didn't care for this one. I didn't like the character of Cal. The notion that he carried guilt for years for giving up his child at age seventeen to wonderful parents who kept in touch with him about her well-being to the point that he was relieved when Penny lost their baby was a bit silly. I was hoping that Penny and his brother would get together instead.Every book has to have secondary characters, but I don't like the main character's story interrupted to hear their point of view. I prefer one point-of-view type of writing."},{"Title":"Delicious (The Buchanans, Book 1)","review":"What a treat this book was. I love the witty dialouge and the fabulous characters. This book has secondary characters more developed than primary characters in some other novels. A very complex story. Picked up the book to read a chapter before going to bed and was up until 1 a.m. reading to the last page. I feel like I know the Buchanan family.

The adoptive parents couldn't have been nicer. The kid was happy, well-adjusted. Sheesh, what more could a person hope for in this scenario? He just looked and sounded like a neurotic, emotionally stunted, closed off fool obsessing over what, the fact he gave up his kid to wonderful people who raised a wonderful girl. WOW, that is sooooo horrible. *rollseyes. He has a huge amount of guilt over the adoption as though he'd looked her up and found out she'd been given to child molesters who beat her and sold her in to prostitution. The real tragedy would have been if he'd kept the kid and Gloria had gotten her talons on her. The kid would have been a mess.As for Penny, I would have liked her 1000% times more if she'd just stuck to her guns and washed her hands of this guy. After all the grief and suffering she'd gotten from Cal's inability to be upfront or have the tiniest bit of common sense, she just takes him back after one pathetic \\"Oh I'm sooooooooooo sorry\\" scene.

I hoped for juicy kitchen drama, but received utterly predictable family drams instead. The worst written character was the grandmother whose motivations remained a mystery while she blew in and out of scenes like clock work to bedevil the other characters.

That's not the case here--the writing is just fine, technically, I'd give it a solid 'B'. The plotting, regarding the two main characters--a little unbelieveable, but it's a romance novel, after all, so I don't have really high expectations about that--call it a 'B-'. The character development of the two main characters, also pretty good, although the hero, Cal, had issues that didn't make sense based on his background--this grade would be a 'C+'. But the secondary cast of characters, and the plotting regarding them--over-the-top, unbelievable, a complete deal-breaker. 'D-'. I really wish this author would work on making the supporting casts of her novels less like evil villains and more like human beings, because I like her breezy dialogue.

Although I didnt like her I would have liked a little epilogue or something so we found out a litttle something about what happened when she went back home. And thats another thing, obviously I havent read the other books so maybe this is covered in the others but, this book or what I read from it, Shes pregnant from a donor, they are divorced after a miscarriage when she thinks he was glad she miscarried, he claims he doesnt want a family.......yada, yada, yada. So why would the book just end where it did? I would have liked a little something about the birth or something like that.

Though she has some reservations, no pun intended, Penny agrees to a sweet deal that will mean her unborn child and she will have a fantastic future. Cal has no idea Penny had herself inseminated until he begins noticing changes in her, and learns the truth. Though he regrets not being the one to give her a child, that is one of the catalysts that gets the stubborn man thinking about more than one reconciliation he needs to make. However, his grandmother makes the Wicked Witch of the West appear charming, and she will not stand for him to get involved with Penny again. Moreover, if he does, she will reveal secrets that will hurt his beloved sister. Cal and Penny both have a lot to face and deal with, but for them and the reader fortunate enough to get their hands on this book, it will be worth it.**** There are so many good points to this book it's hard to count them all. Beyond the primary romance, Penny's best friend Naomi is guaranteed to make you smile as she romances two of Cal's brothers. Both of the brothers are absolute winners, as are all the secondary characters, even the Granny from down below, who is emienently hate-able. One word of caution, however, you will be craving orange sherbert and fish and chips before the book ends. ****Amanda Killgore"},{"Title":"Delicious (The Buchanans, Book 1)","review":"This is a great new Series from Susan Mallery. I love that Penny is a girl on a mission and she won't let anyone take her down espicially the mean old bitter Gloria. Cal is a good man that is emotionally challenged, but has strengths as well. I love the four family members and the banter that they have with each other. I think I laughed at everything Naomi said, and was happily surprised that she had a deeper connection with the story and that she wasn't as shallow as she seemed.

The whole series is outstanding, I like to follow a family the way she develops family relationships. Sometimes they touch on other series and I have to go back and reread the other thread."},{"Title":"Delicious (The Buchanans, Book 1)","review":"This series reminds me of Lori Foster's books, but with slightly better writing. Cal hires his ex-wife, Penny, a talented chef, to run the kitchen of his failing restaurant. They divorced three years earlier when he decided he didn't want to have a child, after their first pregnancy ended in miscarriage. Now Penny is pregnant through in vitro fertilization but realizing she might not be as over Cal as she thought. Have they changed enough to make it work a second time?I really enjoyed Penny's character--her independence, her attitude, and her determination to have a child herself and a great career. I also liked all the details about the restaurant business and the dynamics of the kitchen, details which lend authenticity to a plot that sometimes stretches the imagination. While Cal's guilt over his past felt a little out of proportion, I really appreciated that the situation wasn't resolved neatly right away, though there is, of course, the requisite happy ending. I also liked how Cal and Penny got to know each other (again) over a reasonable period of time before falling (back) in love; I hate when characters claim to be in love after, like, a weekend.In \\"Delicious\\" Mallery tackles serious situations with humor and a charming cast I was eager to spend more time with. A great start to a very enjoyable series."},{"Title":"Delicious (The Buchanans, Book 1)","review":"I picked upDelicious,Irresistible, andSizzlingat the local store and couldn't wait to get home to read about the Buchanan siblings.Delicious is a great first book - it sets up all of the players and in a very entertaining way. Cal is the ex-husband who didn't seem to care too much about his wife when they were married, but now that he needs her help, he's willing to crawl to get her to sign-on and help re-establish one of his family's once great restaurants. Penny is bright, colorful, and trying very hard to not get lured back into liking her ex-husband who she felt emotionally abandoned her way before their divorce.Even though they are divorced, there is still that spark between Cal and Penny and as we slowly understand why they reacted the way they did when they were married, we see how they've changed and how they are willing to maybe give their love another try.The scenes with the Buchanan siblings are great because you can feel the warmth of feelings shared between them.After reading the other two books, Delicious still remains my favorite of the series so far.Highly recommended for anyone who wants to read a heartwarming and fun story."},{"Title":"Delicious (The Buchanans, Book 1)","review":"This was a fun, light read that is part of a 4 book series about the Buchanan siblings. Each book centers around a different sibling and is tied someway to food/chef/or the restaurants the family owns. This books centers on oldest brother Cal and his ex-wife chef Penny (who is now pregnant via AI). It was a good story showing acceptance of your past and looking at your present and deciding what you want in your future. Toss in a mean, conniving grandma and you've got a great family series.

HOWEVER, I do think that some parts were unnecessary, and you could really tell that the writer was setting up a series. I think that if I had not heard the audio this book would have received a 3, but since I did hear the audio, and got to hear the characters through the reader, I am giving it a 4. This is the first book in the series, and I will probably listen to the rest of the series. Brothers Walker and Reid and sister Dani get their own stories.

And yet, people still cling to that idea. John Borchardt had great insight on the field, and he was very helpful when a scientist in my family was unemployed."},{"Title":"Career Management for Scientists and Engineers (American Chemical Society Publication)","review":"Scientists and engineers are indeed a breed apart, and not just in their own minds. They should at least try to find to find a career -- or careers -- and not just a job. In this book, John Borchardt, an experienced chemist and technical writer, describes career management for this breed of professionals. Not only are individual skills and values discussed, but interaction of the individual with the work team, the organization, and the profession are treated as well. Use of computer technology and Net/Web resources are stressed throughout the book in addition to more traditional basics of all of the topics.The book is divided into 18 chapters in four sections: Professional Skills, Today's New Working World, Job Hunting, and Back to the Beginning. Each Chpater is well referenced including works by such authors as Peter Drucker and Tom Peters.Times are changing and the author stresses the need for self-evaluation and adaptability. Job performance may not be the only reason for either career advancement or stagnation, but evaluation and improvement of one's performance sure beats the alternative. I recommned this book to all who are -- or want to be -- in a scientific or technical career.-- Bob Buntrock"},{"Title":"PARTY POLITICS IN THE AGE OF CAESAR (SATHER CLASSICAL LECTURES (PAPERBACK))","review":"I ordered this book because I was busy drafting my own novel set in 80BC -50BC and with my lead character being an ambitious fellow from a leading Roman political family I was getting awfully frustrated trying to get to grips with the complicated mechanical workings of late Republican politics. Then I found this work, set 70BC - 50BC and I had to pinch myself for it was as if it had been written personally for me, so well did it cover everything I wanted to know. I possess many books on politics in this period but none of them impart a fraction of the knowledge this work contains within 255 pages. Yes its an old work, 1949 first printed. But it stands the test of time.The late Lily Ross Taylor in splendid easy to read prose has beautifully articulated all the facets of political life at the time of Julius Caesar. The relations of nobles to clients, the manipulation of the state religion for political purpose (for religion and lawmaking were inseparable), how Romans voted + how to get the vote in your favour and the way the various institutions/magistracies worked (or rather - were supposed to work). Finally the concept that Roman politics was not so much about \\"party\\" systems (for none existed) but forming/aligning oneself with \\"a loose aggregation of like minded associates or friends\\" to get your way.All the great names of the era and their roles and interactions are covered in painstaking detail. So many gems are uncovered. An example being the chapter \\"Cato and the Populares\\":Caesars battle with Cato. Seeking to bring Caesar to justice for in 58 BC for perceived disregard for state protocols/and irregularities with Treasury monies during his time as Consul, Caesar manipulates the Tribunate to honor Cato with a posting to Cyprus to govern a newly aquired province following the nonsensical dismissal of a King whose only \\"crime\\" was failing to pay his bribes to the right people quick enough (the Triumvirs). Cato accepts due to his unbreakable commitment to do as the state wants (though he is livid at the ruse) and Caesar staves off another threat. The book is just full of such accounts among protagonists and makes for page turning fare if you are a true Romanofile.By the time you have combed your way through this fascinating work, you will be in awe as to how anyone ever got anything worthwhile done or legislated. Anarchy, bi-partisan politics, violence, abuse of office, petty jealousy, murder, bribing, backstabbing, frontstabbing, use of marriage and divorce to improve career prospects - its all covered. By the end of the book you are left in no doubt as to why two civil wars followed and Emperor rule was established and the old Republic deserved the thumbs down. The worst modern democracy on a bad day was tame compared to this."},{"Title":"PARTY POLITICS IN THE AGE OF CAESAR (SATHER CLASSICAL LECTURES (PAPERBACK))","review":"For those looking for a tight, readable introduction on political life in Republican Rome there is no better place to start than Lily Ross Taylor's 1949 classic, \\"Party Politics in the Age of Caesar.\\" She reviews a wide range of institutions and practices -- from religion and the law courts to voting assemblies and political campaigning -- and does so in a way made especially easy to grasp for contemporary readers, often comparing and contrasting how modern notions of political parties and religion differ from those of ancient Rome.Taylor stresses that we cannot think of modern political parties when studying the fall of the Republic. The parties were not between the patricians and the plebeians as in the early Republic, she says. Nor was it a struggle between conservative and liberal forces in the polity, although the contest often took on that form for personal reasons. The author argues that the struggles that brought about the parties were over competition between the nobles for political advancement. The resulting \\"parties\\" were in actuality alliances based on friendship and family obligations. Taylor emphasizes how personal the entire system was. She compares gaining office in the late Republic to winning an American major political party nomination at a convention (note: Taylor was writing in the 1940s when Democrats and Republicans still picked their presidential candidates in back room wheeling-and-dealing). The world of nineteenth and twentieth century American political \\"bosses\\" and \\"machines\\" would thus be very familiar to Cicero and his colleagues. As the hunt for securing the spoils of empire intensified, Taylor writes, these alliances of friendship began to harden and take on a semi-permanent nature.Taylor blames nineteenth century historian Theodor Mommsen with promoting the myth that the struggle between optimates and populares was one pitting a senatorial party against a popular democratic party. She argues that the optimates/populares conflict was an internal struggle in the noble class aimed at their own personal gain and was not at all about any notions of democracy. She maintains that the populares were, on the whole, frustrated lower level nobles who were cut out of the major spoils of empire by the older, more prestigious families. It was at the people's expense that the populares manipulated the masses to circumvent the powerful grip of a faction of high noble families in command of the powerful Senate. In theory, their differences were based on policy, but in reality, Taylor argues, is was only a difference in political means at achieving identical ends.The Roman nobility has often been compared to the British ruling class in the way they dominated government. Taylor, however, suggests that by comparison the British were much more open to new blood outside the traditional families than the Romans. Indeed, in the last 150 years of the Republic only 10 \\"new men\\" (i.e. men without Senatorial lineage in their family) rose to the consulship, and only one man did it in the last half century (93-48 BC) -- and that was Cicero. She writes that the closed political system of Republican Rome is more analogous to the ossified patriarchate of the Republic of Venice than any modern system.Perhaps the most fascinating and illuminating section of this book, at least for me, is Taylor's detailed accounting of the step ladder political game that Roman aristocrats competed in. The path to power and success was clear and to a certain extent regimented: early education consisted of history and especially public speaking; then military service began at age 17, often as a military tribune; around 20 years-old he would begin to appear in the Forum to make small speeches for his family; at 30 he would be elected quaestor, which assured membership in the Senate; after the one year term as quaestor, there was a mandatory 9 year break before he could run for praetor, during which time he would likely serve as a legate of a governor in command of some province to gain further military experience and might also run for the optional office aedlie as a way to curry favor with the masses by throwing lavish public festivals and games at personal expense; by age 39 or 40, if all had been going smoothly, he would secure one of the 8 praetorships; after that it was back to the field in a headlong rush for military glory and riches all so that he could achieve the dream of all young nobles, to be elected consul in \\"his year\\" (i.e. age 43, the minimum age for holding that office). The stakes were high and the competition intense, especially as there were only two consulships elected every year, one each reserved for noble families from the patricians and plebeians. This political cycle consumed nearly all the energy of the leading families, as they were either in the race themselves or looking to secure advancement for a son or son-in-law. It was literally what life revolved around for the several dozen families that ruled the Republic.Both sides in the ensuing civil war claimed to be fighting to preserve the old Republic. Caesar was striving to save it from the tyranny of the oligarchy; Cato from the tyranny of the demagogic despot. Despite the high flown rhetoric, Taylor says, both sides were drawn by personal loyalty and interest, not ideology. All would agree that austerity, justice and honor were the guiding principles of the Republic, but no one represented that ideal better than Cato who, both in life and in death, exemplified what all nobles held to be truly Roman.After the civil war and Caesar's murder, Augustus ascended to absolute power, instituting a Nazi-like regime, according to Taylor, but carefully cloaked in the spirit and words of his uncle's archenemy, Cato. The great Republican's legacy flourished while Caesar's wilted. He came to represent liberty and virtue, the highest ideals of the Republic. There was never a party of Cato, the author says, but rather a cult of Cato, and it had no opposition."},{"Title":"PARTY POLITICS IN THE AGE OF CAESAR (SATHER CLASSICAL LECTURES (PAPERBACK))","review":"If you want a level of detail greater than \\"Caesar vs Senate, Caesar=tyranny, Senate=democracy,\\" then you should read this book.Taylor explains how Roman society was set up, how the various classes and groups of Roman society manifested themselves in politics, how the election cycle/balance of power sorted things out, and how politicians kept busy Monday-Friday, 8-5.Taylor offers the same level of detail on Roman Republican politics that you would get on American politics following major news outlets in an election season. He explains how Roman electoral districts were arranged and how that set up affected nominating processes and political strategies. He also walks through a typical campaign for an elected office.Taylor discusses how social and economic trends affected politics, too. For example, Rome's 34 electoral districts (similar to America's US House districts) were originally full of small-land-owning citizens in the vicinity of Rome. But, over the centuries, the farm land around Rome consolidated into large plantations, so the land-owning citizens registered in the 34 districts shrank in number and were mostly the rich nobility. Towards the end of the Roman Republic, the urban district with a gazillion people carried as much weight as the rural district with one giant plantation.If you're looking for that level of detail, I recommend this book. If you're looking for even more detail, like analysis of a particular issue in a particular election, I do not recommend this book."},{"Title":"PARTY POLITICS IN THE AGE OF CAESAR (SATHER CLASSICAL LECTURES (PAPERBACK))","review":"I've read a lot of history and a lot of historical fiction on Rome. If you're not the bookish type who likes to really dig into the details of a historical era, or if you're not fairly familiar with the people and events of Caesar's time, this would have to be one of the most colossally dull books you've ever read.

Tragically, he was accidentally electrocuted while in Thailand at a conference of Christian and non-Christian monks. Written from October 1939 to November 1941, Merton wrote in the 1959 Preface, \\"These are a few selections taken from a diary that I kept when I was a layman... This was written, like most diaries, informally, colloquially, and in haste... the careless style, the callow opinions and all the other defects are those of a writer much younger and even more unwise than I am at present.\\"He wrote, \\"If people looked at good pictures more, they would learn more about meditation, and if they meditated more they would learn more about looking at pictures.\\" (Pg. 15) He recounts an experience in church: \\"And so the unshakeable certainty, the clear and immediate knowledge that heaven was right in front of me, struck me like a thunderbolt and went through me like a flash of lightning and seemed to lift me clean up off the earth... it was as much an experience of loving as of knowing something, and in it love and knowledge were completely inseparable.\\" (Pg. 76-77)In June 1940, he wrote, \\"I don't pretend... to understand the war... the knowledge of what is going on only makes it seem desperately important to be voluntarily poor, to get rid of all possessions this instant... I am scared to take a proprietary interest in anything, for fear that my love of what I own may be killing somebody somewhere.\\" (Pg. 110-111)He observes, \\"It is astounding how little we really pray... If a person prays an hour a day, it seems tremendous: he begins to think himself a monster of asceticism.\\" (Pg. 120) Later, he says, \\"A purgatory is a place where we tear away our sins like plasters although not as suddenly... But there is this paradox: an abbey is an earthly paradise because it is an earthly purgatory.\\" (Pg. 186) Presciently, he wrote on April 12, 1941, \\"I only desire ... to follow His will... Could it ever possibly mean that I might some day become a monk in this monastery?\\" (Pg. 203)This book sheds a great deal of light (even more than \\"Seven-Storey Mountain,\\" in some respects) on Merton's development leading up to his entry into the abbey."},{"Title":"The Drifter","review":"I didn't think I'd read a book to match Ralph Compton's, but this one grabbed me quick.

These are real people who happened to be gay, or even straight. C. Bard Cole has written individual stories, about named individuals that are edgy, brash, and very insightful. The stories are about sex workers, punks, and characters from all different backgrounds which includes teens to rich college boys.I found this to be an intensely rewarding read because it was so different from the \\"normal\\" writing be put out there by the mainstream gay literary giants. This is a fresh and different type of writing. Each story was a brief history into the life of the character. This is a exciting debut for Cole and I really enjoyed this new author. The drawings and illustrations were an added bonus. If you want to read a book that it different and that will stir you try this one."},{"Title":"Briefly Told Lives","review":"Bard Cole's short stories profiling the lives of young gay men is fascinating. It's impossible not to care about them, as in just a few pages, they come alive. Some are loveable, some hateful, but I wanted to know more...what shaped them, made them choose one course over another? Gayness aside, the varying approaches to life's problems runs the gamut.Many of the stories are illustrated with Cole's excellent drawings, and if you can, by visiting his website, wheedle a copy of the chapbook &quot;Fag Sex in High School&quot;, you'll be glad you did. I hope this book will be the first of many."},{"Title":"Briefly Told Lives","review":"C. Bard Cole's laconic style limns a wide variety of gay characters in this collection of stories, from middle- and upper-class men, to denizens of the counterculture, to drug addicts and murderers. His ability to sketch a complete character in a few words is astonishing, and his deliberately documentary-like prose can make an unlikely interracial romance unexpectedly touching. Conversely, the tale of two teenage sex buddies who almost casually descend into murder and addiction chills to the bone when told this way. On the other hand, sometimes the flat style means the narratives remain--well, flat. Overall, there are enough engaging moments in this collection to keep one turning the pages, and the lesser tales are, if nothing else, short."},{"Title":"Briefly Told Lives","review":"In an interview published in The Stranger, Bard Cole made the rather sweeping comment that he killed Gay Literature. Perhaps he has, or perhaps he has blown more life into it than any author of recent memory. His short to the point stories have more connection to the actual lives of young gay men at the end of the twentieth century then the musty volumes of fabulousness that have gone before. I had the unsettling experience of reading Dancer from the Dance just before starting Briefly Told Lives, and Holleran's book suffered in comparison. It is difficult for me to say if this is just a difference in decades, or truly a measure of how much more descriptive Cole is of real gay men. I didn't just believe in his characters, I felt I lived with them for a brief moment.In the same interview, Cole claimed he writes like a retard. If this clear, to the point writing is the writing of a retard, then I sincerely hope to read more retarded writing in the future. His self effacing criticism masks his acute observational powers."},{"Title":"Briefly Told Lives","review":"Mr. Cole's stories speak with wit and intelligence to the reality of life for young gay men. There is nothing of falsified sitcom lives here -- just an honest look, from an original and honest voice, at lives that too often are whitewished or vilified. Mr. Cole's literary style is straightforward but has an undercurrent of humor and real appreciation for his audience."},{"Title":"Briefly Told Lives","review":"Most of C. Bard Cole's stories read like outlines for stories he seems unwilling to have written more artfully. Still, at times even these outlines can present very moving glimpses at the lives of outcasts. Cole works best when he writes clear, fast moving descriptions of his characters and uses minimal dialogue. Too often with Cole, one is reminded how often he breaks the Creative Writing Rule 101: &quot;show it, don't tell it.&quot; As a published writer, he should be beyond that. The last story in the book is the longest and most disappointing. It displays the worst of Cole's dialogue, which is not his strongest talent even in his best stories, and lacks the power of the earlier, fast moving pieces. Despite its shortcomings, &quot;Briefly Told Lives&quot; is worth reading for those strong moments. Just wait for the paperback."},{"Title":"The Letter","review":"Excellent book! Highly recommend it!

A dynamite book that makes you laugh at his footnotes whilst crying at the horrific examples of how not to run a business.'Enlightened' is an understatement - this man must have a direct line to some greater power that we poor simple folk have not found.

As far as we're concerned, though, he's dead on! Even his title for the book shows it. Here's a book that talks about business in a way that we've always thought it should be run. Mr. Gibbons presents his ideas in 101 Universal Laws of Business, but in essence these just state what most of us mere mortals (i.e., without MBA) would call &quot;common sense&quot;. He starts off with what he calls &quot;Tests of Rightness&quot; (no, not righteousness!) Already, we thought we could start making our own rules. Look, if it doesn't feel right, then it probably is a mistake, right? These are not namby-pamby &quot;feel good&quot; rules, but basic common sense. Mr. Gibbons presents all of these pieces of wisdom with with the kind of humor that makes reading a joy.

This is an insightful collection of essays that illuminates the essential relationship between Gandhi's theory of non-violence and his practice of the same. Dennis Dalton uses two powerful examples: the Salt March of 1930 and the fast to end Partition-related violence in 1947. There is a fascinating conclusion between Gandhi's ideas and those of Martin Luther King and Malcolm X, illustrating the relevance of Gandhi's thought to present day issues."},{"Title":"Mahatma Gandhi. Nonviolent Power in Action","review":"I don't care to duplicate the academic praise seen in the above reviews. But I can tell you simply that Dennis Dalton was my professor in a class on Non-Violence at Columbia Univ. and it changed my life. At a period of time when I was an atheist, believing that all religion was just a set of rules to control people, D. Dalton demonstrated through the example of Ghandi that the Love and Truth force can be a powerful vehicle for change. This completely changed my view point from victim to activist. One could actually have spirituality from within, instead of imposed upon him or her from without. A tool, not a punishment. The 'truth' one has seems to be irrelevant; it is one's passion and belief and willingness to stand behind that Truth that triumphs. If it is True in the archetypal sense, others will join (not follow) you. And by direct action at the heart level, you can touch and change nations. This is not about passive resistance; this is about direct non-violent confrontation. It is about appealing to the best, the highest nature, of that which you confront. He showed me that one can change the world with one's heart; that truth can win. And now I just wait for Dennis to write the definative book on Emma Goldman... Truly a great teacher and initiator of the inner spark of one's own truth force. And with Ghandi as his guiding archetype, this book should be on the reading list of every activist."},{"Title":"Mahatma Gandhi.

Nonviolent Power in Action","review":"Dalton presents the historical development of Gandhi's political thought, especially on nonviolence and satyagraha (nonviolent direct action). When read in combination with Joan Bondurant's \\"Conquest of Violence,\\" one understands the key concepts and strategies of nonviolent action in the context of India's independence movement. Despite the attention to historical detail, the reader is left wondering just how nonviolence works and how it persuades rather than dominates the opponent. Dalton's comparison of Malcolm X and Gandhi enlightens the reader on the striking parallels in the development of their political thought under conditions of racist oppression. Both traveled the road from emulating the white oppressor, due to a sense of inferiority, to psychological liberation and resistance, violent versus nonviolent. M. L. King, Malcolm X and Gandhi all embraced the idea of \\"inclusiveness\\" encompassing both oppressor and oppressed.

It is filled with exciting Halloween imagery and the rhyming words of the text flow well to help the story build to its ghostly conclusion. A brother and sister get a realistic-looking plastic skeleton at the fair and they hang it up in a tree for Halloween decoration. Their imaginations begin to run wild (or is it their imaginations?) They can hear the eery clacking of the skeleton's bones as the wind blows through the bare tree branches. They have named their skeleton Fred McFee and they suspect that he may be doing more than just his dance of the dead. Why does the old dog, Sam, stay away from the tree where the skeleton is hanging? Why have the hens stopped laying and where has the old rooster gone? After one particularly windy night Fred McFee himself disappears! Where he went, no one knows for certain. Maybe that bare spot of ground is his grave! Maybe he's even here now, haunting and clackety clacking his ghoulish dance. When the wind is blowing in the dark and the tree branches are clacking together, shhhh....is that Fred McFee?!

It is well written (it has an amazing economy of words). It provokes thought and discussion.Likely the most important thing about The Bones of Fred McFee is that it is incredibly well illustrated. The illustrator of this book has what I call \\"a voice.\\" Too many illustrators lack their own voice. They often suffer from being too derivative or too like other illustrators. This phenomenon is, for some reason, particularly common in Halloween books.That is not the case here. Kurt Cyrus' pictures in The Bones of Fred McFee are brilliant, clean, and not overbearing. The spookiness is left up to the words for the most part--as it should be.This story, about some kids who hang a fake skeleton (which they name) for Halloween should, in a just world, become a holiday classic.

The term is not strictly limited to houses, although many intelligence services use rural houses for extended functions such as debriefing defectors. In a city, a safe house may be an apartment or house that is not known to be associated with an intelligence service.This book covers the history briefly from biblical era to modern times, and the operational significance of safe houses. It provides details on how to keep it secret and compartmented from all but a limited number of people, for the safety of those hidden within them. The text also provides details, with information on how to select a location, finding support and outfitting the site location.Safe houses are integral feature of evasion and escape networks, as used in WW II undergrounds to move isolated service members back to allied controlled areas. Additionally they were an integral part of the Underground Railroad, the network of safe house locations that were used to assist slaves in escaping to the primarily northern free states in the 19th century United States. You can read about more of this in the authors other book \\"Underground Railroad: Practical Advice For Finding Passengers Getting Them To Safety, And Staying One Step Ahead Of The Tyrants\\".This book is by no means a complete \\"how-to\\" manual, but a very light and entertaining read covering the serious subject of intelligence tradecraft."},{"Title":"SPECTRE","review":"If you're looking for a wild read, read Spectre.

Lawrence. It is amazing how prescient Lawrence was here. Remember, this was written some 20 years before the discovery of the Gnostic Gospels at Nag Hammadi. Although gnosticism was known of, and to some degree what some of the gnostics believed about Christ, it was rarely acknowledged beyond the study of heresy within the Catholic and Protestant seminaries. Laypeople knew almost nothing of the origins of Christianity. That most original Christians had very different ideas about their Savior, and that indeed many believed that He was a sexual creature (and some even a homosexual), was blasphemy of the highest degree. And that many also equated Christ and Mary with the myth of pagan Isis and Horas (which many today believe is the real precusor of Chritianity), would have been unthinkable even as late as the 1930s.But Lawrence was an autodidact when it came to religion, and like many autodidactics, had some very strange and original ideas about that and Christianity in particular. Essentially a mystical deist, he found much to despise in organized, modern Christianity. Like so many of his generation, he blamed it, correctly, as one of the main causes of the First World War and the ills of the modern world. He also had an abiding interest in pagan religions of all types (read his The Plumed Serpent), but especially Roman/Etruscan paganism. How much he knew of the Egyptian Isis-Horas/Mary-Jesus connection I have no idea, but it was probably intuitive: Isis was one of the most popular godesses of late-pagan Rome, which Lawrence was very familiar. Did he know that certain early Christians also worshipped Isis and, indeed, believed in a sexual union between the two? I can't say. But knowing of Lawrence's interest in \\"mystical\\" sexuality, mixed with his other interests, it was probably natural that he would combine these into one of the most daring novels of all time.While simple-minded, prejudice readers might find this work blasphemous, it is in fact one of the most original and exciting novels written about Christ. This has none of the nonsense of Kazantzakis'Last Temptation of Christ, which was essentially a reverent and wholly orthodox work (but which also has an element of original Christian philosophy -- and thus the unjust controversy). Lawrence dispenses with all that, and somehow discovered and revealed the pagan heart at the core of much Christian philosophy. In his tale of a Christ who \\"survives\\" the crucifixion, has a sexual relationship with a priestess of Isis, and then renounces aesthetism for the wordly pleasures of the flesh, Lawrence typically and bravely went for the jugular, while also retaining his elegant, inimitable style. What emerges is one of his most profound and poetic works, and not surprisingly, as he was to die a year later, also pretty much sums up his philosophies in one, neat little package. If you have the chance to read this small, but rich and powerful work, you will have discovered one of the true masterpieces of one of the greatest writers of all time."},{"Title":"The Man Who Died.","review":"Lawrence's last novel describes a resuscitated Christ carrying his wounds and meeting old friends. He does not want them to touch him. He needs to move away from this life. He wanders onto the property of a priestess of Isis. She believes him to be Osiris and she is to heal his wounds and bear a child with him. This is how Christ leaves behind his body and blood. The erotic interplay between Christ and the priestess evokes in him a revelation that this is the mystery of life that the Father has not allowed him to experience. In Lawrence's day, the demythologizing of Christ and the erotic interplay underline incarnation. Today it seems a bit much. Forcing Christ into sexual liaisions betrays an emphasis on an erotic gnosticism apparent in contemporary &quot;spiritual&quot; movements. But at the time this novel was written, it may have had some relevance in challenging mystical applications of the Christ myth. The writing is beautiful."},{"Title":"The Man Who Died.","review":"A very short book that is more of a novela. As historians often say that students of American history \\"must get right with Lincoln,\\" so to must participants in Western culture \\"get right with Jesus.\\" As a man, little is known of Jesus. Of the 1800 or so sayings attributed to Jesus in the Bible, biblical scholars have whittled that number down to less than 100 sayings that they believe to actually be his. As such, the man is cloaked almost completely in the legend that has been built on his name. This book explores that moment when those two identities crossed--Jesus's resurrection from the dead. Tackled in Lawrence's distinctive style, \\"The Man Who Died\\" is far more provocative than works such as Mailer's \\"The Gospel According to the Sun\\" and is reminiscent of Scorsese's \\"The Last Temptation of Christ.\\" It confronts the received biblical narrative and shatters the narrow existential walls that limit the spiritual exploration that Jesus's life story demands.It is not just a must read, it is a must own. You will want to go back to this often, because it's never the same book twice."},{"Title":"The Man Who Died.","review":"A lovely short story from one of my favorite writers.

Thank you, Paul"},{"Title":"The Man Who Died.","review":"In my previous review of this masterwork I used the word &quot;aesthetic&quot;, when of course I meant &quot;ascetic...&quot; Also, regards the quality of the prose: This book was published in 1930, at the height and influence of the simpler styles of Americans like Hemingway and Fitzgerald. While remaining intensely metaphoric, the style nevertheless shows the influence of this younger generation of writers who had emerged in the past half-decade. The result is one of Lawrence's most accesible novels, while also retaining the quality of Imagism that distinguishes his earliest work."},{"Title":"The Man Who Died.","review":"The poor rendition of our Savior's resurection made me sick to read. He did not wake in a state of pain and anguish and lothing to be back in mortality with all the misfortunes of a mortal body. His resurection freed Himself, as well as all of us, from the pains of the mortal flesh! He didn't wake in a darkened stupor of pain. Angels from the presence of Our Father were there, and their illuminent beings more than made up for the lack of light in the tomb. Also as it is written, the angels came and tossed away the stone covering the entrance and were sitting upon it when Mary and the other ladies aproached to add spices to our Savior's body. (see Matt. 28)We also have multiple accounts of our Savior eating with His deciples, coming and going into rooms that are bared and shut to mortals. (study John Chapters 20-21) as well as the recorded appearance of our Savior to the people in the America's (see 3 Nephi 11) Jesus wasn't in some drunken stupor of pain, but His body was made Immortal, like His Father's.The man who died is a poorly and sadly uneducated rendition of the greatest, truthful, historical event in the world.The Man who died (Jesus) was not killed, but had power to give up His life and take it again, as He stated in John 1017 Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again.18 No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father. (John 10:17 - 18)Skip reading this piece of poor fiction based on actual facts.Go pick up your Bible and read the written testimonies of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John if you have a desire to read of our Savior's resurection.PS because He lives we all will too, and not in Zombie like idiocy, but in a state of no more pain and resurected glory according to our desires actions in this life to do good or to do evil."},{"Title":"The Man Who Died.","review":"The first time that I read this story was close to 10 years ago and it was coupled with another short titled, &quot;Bryn Mawr&quot; (sp).

The best of this style and subject."},{"Title":"The Man Who Died.","review":"This is D.H. Lawrence at his hobby horse again. He gives a portrayal of the risen Jesus after the crucifixion who is tired of life . . . weary of it all, with the life force at an all-time low. What can save him? Sex, of course. What else? It's the same old song-and-dance. Lawrence seems to think that the answer to all of life's problems is sexual union, which makes about as much sense to me as regarding vegetable curry as the meaning of life. Sex has it's place, to be sure, but I don't understand the primacy that Lawrence ascribes to it in each and every one of his novels. In certain instances, sex can revive a sense of purpose or ebbing energy, but it cannot and will not aid anyone in a sense of world-weariness. If attempted it will just be like trying to give live into a dead horse. It would probably only make one feel all the more disgusted with existence rather than giving one a sense of rejuvenation, as Sartre so adequately demonstrates in his &quot;Nausea&quot;. All, in all, i felt the whole attempt was kind of silly.

It is gross and blasphemous. D. H. Lawrence must have been mad when he wrote this. His tuberculosis was sure getting at him.The book, which is a novella, was about Christ's resurrection. He discovers that men are put on earth to have sex with women. And He Himself takes part in this heathen notion.I was insulted when I read this. Christians and non-Christians alike will agree that this book is not worth reading."},{"Title":"Microsoft C# Professional Projects","review":"I purchased this book because I learn best by following examples based on real, useful projects. I have completed project 1 and thus far have these observations:1) Though &quot;validating data&quot; is stressed, the example code does a very poor job of doing so.2) The authors seem to forget what they need in their example forms. For example, the CustomerForm in project 1 is supposed to be able to add and edit records contained in a customer table. However, they authors forgot to create a way to add the record!3) Some of the information is presented out of sequence and thus causes a great deal of confusion. For example, chapter 9 is on Validations and Exception Handling. It looks like this information was once part of chapter 10 and the authors decided that they should discuss validation first. However, it appears that they forgot to rewrite the material so that it would make sense in its new context! I found myself flipping back and forth between the two capters in order to finish the project.4) Even with these problems, the book would still be useful if an online errata existed. However, I have not been able to locate one on the Website provided.5) Project 1 presents an inconsistent interface. Each of the forms in the project has a similar purpose but entirely different interfaces and controls. I believe the authors did this in order to show the reader that there are different ways to use .NET Studio to do the job, but I do not recall that this was actually mentioned in the text. All I can say is do not use the projects in this book as models for good interface design.I have been a programmer for almost three decades and I am already knowledgeable in Java, C++ and Visual Basic, so I am still able to use this book as a tutorial to learn the features of C# and the .NET programming interface. Since this book was still useful in that respect, I have given it 2 Stars instead of 1.

The projects are not anything near professional grade in my opinion. For example, in the first project the code in the UI makes lots of calls to the database directly. From the title, I felt that a real-world distributed application using a data access layer and maybe even a web services layer would have been more appropriate. Also, the user interface design throughout the projects is non-standard and quite hokey in my opinion. I'm usually not that critical about the application architecture and UI design in the case studies presented in a book, but when the title is \\"Professional Projects\\" I believe the bar should be raised a lot higher.

After the authors take the time to lead you through introductory information about the language, they make the mistake of leaping too fast through the database creation. I have since found other, better books that discuss the creation and connections to the various types of databases supported by ADO.

No, I mean it--this is a book that's definitely designed for skipping around. If you do read it from beginning to end, you're going to find yourself experiencing a great deal of repetition. A great deal of repetition. (See, it's gotten to me!)With the exception of a few framing chapters, the book is divided up into six projects, each of which illustrates a different way to use C# and the Visual Studio package to achieve something that needs doing in the real world. While the projects themselves make very good (albeit simple) templates for the kind of stuff we find ourselves doing at work, the presentation could have used a little polishing. Not just copyediting, though a good deal of that would have been worthwhile, but editing and proofreading on a more general level. (I don't know if this has been fixed in subsequent printings, but a perfect, and obvious, example: chapters nine and ten are switched in my copy.) And while it's probably either nitpicky or simply not applicable as a complaint, it seems to me that it would have been easy to structure this in such a way that each project built on the one before it, which would have made the book more of a progression than what seemed six books stuck together; after all, the database access stuff you learn in the first project is used in every other, so why not use it that way instead of going over most of the basics again each time? (To be fair, there were a few attempts, it seems, to do exactly this; the authors do refer readers back to chapters in different sections a handful of times, but it's not a pervasive thing.)It's not bad, and you'll probably find yourself using it as a reference book for the basics, but the construction leaves a great deal to be desired. ***"},{"Title":"Microsoft C# Professional Projects","review":"This is by far the worst programming book I've come across in a long time.

During all those years I NEVER saw one decent book on developing real time ro embeddedsoftware... it sounds funny now, but bluntly, what we were doing reflected muchmore the medieval concepts of apprenticeships than cogent training... and Ihad my EE with physics/math/CS (and then an MBA in MIS, largely because I was irritatedwith deliberately ignorant and wasteful management structures - why am I thinking George W. Bush right now?)There are some books out there whose authors are clearly experienced in thisarena - in specific languages or compilers, like Visual C# - but they seem to hold back,perhaps aiming for that least common denomiator, or, perhaps, just perhaps,they still harbor that old 60s software 'magic' that doesn't want to give awaythe secrets of the sourceror.For a long time I'd buy or at least pick up book on graphics... and these wouldall start with the same first few chapters on ray tracing, etc... and thenthey'd go completely to hell. No code. No examples. Or, these books would havereferences to graphics software tools that the novice could use.What the reviews of this book show are that a market exists for the materialsuggested by the title, but that the books just aren't there yet.Now, I can tell you as of my writing, that C# is really picking up steam in Silicon Valley.Companies are adopting it in a rapid way that I would have not expected, butthen, until recently, I didn't realize that Visual C# had many of thefeatures of Visual Basic... which is one reason why this book is OK, eventhough ancient (2002) and deficient. The ability to develop a GUI in minutesand write the code behind the controls/screens is enormously advantageous.I had seen that in VB in 1992, and then in LabWindows/DOS and /CVI in 1994.My advice, if you've got a few dollars to spare, buy this book anyway. itwill at least give you ideas for professional projects and perhaps you cantake the sense of C# and run with it.

And one on D.H. Lawrence, and then lots on some people I had never heard of, but boy, they sounded intruiging.This book is a scholar's dream, and David Guy approaches his subject, sex, and his setting for it, spirituality, with a scholar's diligence, a true researcher's obsession. Whitman, Lawrence, Alan Watts, these are all perhaps predictable choices for a book like this if you consider Guy's approach. But an essay on Marco Vassi, pulp pornographer, bathhouse aficianado and paramour of sex queen Annie Sprinkle? Well, as Guy says, if you want to really research the field, you look to the experts, people who have gone to the edge and come back to tell the tale.Guy divides the book into three parts: a true confessional (this part might make you look at your normally sedate husband in a new light), a look at the trail-blazers of the sex-spirit link, and an introduction to some folks who are perhaps the unsung heroes of the healing arts world, alive and well and doing their thing (alas all on the West Coast).You know, you could write an encyclopedia about the way sex is pushed down in our country, made into the stuff of sleazy porn shops, peep shows, strip clubs, and curb-side pickups. And you can easily find the how-to tantric sex manuals, and try to get your aura flowing as well as all those other body juices. Here is a book that serves as a bridge. Can you consider a former stripper and sexual escort as a spiritual healer? Well, yes.

Both reviews, however, appear under both items. I would, therefore, keep the ratings of each reviewer for each edition.The Great Minds Series is indeed abridged and omits crucial material from Marshall's Principles. Marshall put all the mathematical apparatus in the Mathematical Appendix which is omitted in the Great Minds Series. The Porcupine edition is the unabridged edition of Marshall's 1920 8th edition of the Principles. The first edition was in 1890.There is also a variorum (9th edition) of the Principles edited by C. W. Guillebaud, 2 vols (1961), which is out of print, but it appears as volumes 4&amp;5 in Peter Groenewegen's Collected Works of Alfred Marshall,Thoemmes, 1997. There is also a great free on-line edition in the Library of Economics and Liberty.The book is by all means a classic. It consolidated neoclassical economics and it was one of the most influential books on economics ever written. Indeed, the very change of the name of economic science from &quot;political economy&quot; to &quot;economics&quot;, although not suggested by Marshall, is due to the influence of the Principles.To understand Alfred Marshall (1842-1924), I would suggest to read John Maynard Keynes's &quot;Alfred Marshall&quot; essay in Essays in Biography (1933) or Peter Groenewegen's magisterial biography &quot;A Soaring Eagle: Alfred Marshall 1842-1924&quot;, Elgar,1995."},{"Title":"Principles of economics","review":"The British economist Alfred Marshall is one of the greatest political economists of all times and this book represents a deep effort to address in an orderly way the many social and economical issues that were at stake at the turn of the 19th to the 20th century. This way of addressing disturbing social questions is an Alfred Marshall trademark.In this sense, his motto could well be the oft quoted \\" Natura non facit saltum\\" , which is Latin for \\"Nature does not evolves in leaps and bounds\\", and all things are going to be all right in the future but it will take some time untill they consolidate themselves into a coherent whole, where everyone in this world will have an opportunity to fully develop his natural propensities for love, companionship and free will. His view is helped by the many mathematical formulae he uses to illustrate his points of views, using differential calculus, due to his mathematical background. But the reader has not to worry if he/she is not proficient with this type of mathematical tools, because they are used only as a side-line to the text, which is dense and full of logical thinking in itself. Marshall, despite his mathematical background, didn't judge Mathematics as a fundamental tool to Politcal Economy.Alfred Marshall is the most influential representant of the minimalist movement called Neo-Classics Economics (Stanley Jevons, Vilfredo Pareto , Karl Menger) and in this capacity is the most notorius proponent of what today is taught and learned in all Economics Schools over the world as Microeconomics, or the economics of particular competitive or non-competitive markets. In some way, he is both the inheritor of the Utilitarian theories of Jeremy Bentham, as of the economics doctrines of David Ricardo and Adam Smith. Also, one of the interesting facets of Marshall is that he had both John Neville Keynes (the father) and John Maynard Keynes (the son) as one of his pupils in Economics.His knowledge of History and Mathematics is astounding and if he has not reached the status of Keynes or Adam Smith, this is more due to the constraints of the Victorian era in which he wrote this book, and the influences he received, than to any lack of deep understanding of economics realities, which were indeed recognized by John Maynard Keynes himself as fundamental to the latter development he gave to the so-called Dismall Science."},{"Title":"Principles of economics","review":"Everyone interested in economics should read this book, but this abridged edition excludes Books 4 and 6 and some interesting appendices."},{"Title":"Principles of economics","review":"The other review on this page is incorrect!

In addition, all the footnotes are hyper-linked within the text so you don't have to click past literally hundreds of pages to go to the note -- you simply click on the hyper-link.

Also, Signalman includes all the drawings and graphs from Professor Marshall which is not included in the other version.Also, one other note since some reviewers mention that some versions of \\"Principles\\" do not contain the full text: the version from Signalman contains all six books plus all appendices including the mathematical appendix."},{"Title":"Principles of economics","review":"Alfred Marshall (1842-1924) was the great \\"neoclassical\\" English economist, whose work helped transform economics into a more mathematically rigorous and \\"scientific\\" profession.He wrote in the Preface to the first edition of this 1890 book, \\"The present treatise is an attempt to present a modern version of old doctrines with the aid of the new work, and with reference to the new problems, of our own age.\\" (Pg. xi) He added in the Preface to the 8th edition, \\"The present volume therefore remains as a general introduction to the study of economic science.\\" (Pg. xviii)He states early on, \\"the fact is that the number of scientific economists has always been small relatively to the difficulty of the work to be done; so that the science is still almost in its infancy.\\" (Pg. 4) He asserts, \\"economists study the actions of individuals, but study them in relation to social rather than individual life; and therefore concern themselves but little with personal peculiarities of temper and character.\\" (Pg. 25)He wrote, \\"We have seen that economics is, on the one side, a Science of Wealth; and, on the other, that part of the Social Science of man's action in society, which deals with his Efforts to satisfy his Wants, in so far as the efforts and wants are capable of being measured in terms of wealth, or its general representative, i.e., money. We shall be occupied ... with these wants and efforts; and with the causes by which the prices that measure the wants are brought into equilibrium with those that measure the efforts.\\" (Pg. 49)He suggests, \\"Not only does a person's happiness often depend more on his own physical, mental and moral health than on his external conditions: but even among these conditions many that are of chief importance for his real happiness are apt to be omitted from an inventory of his wealth. Some are free gifts of nature... More of them however are elements of collective wealth which are often omitted from the reckoning of individual wealth; but which become important when we compare different parts of the modern civilized world, and even more important when we compare our own age with earlier times.\\" (Pg. 134)He argues, \\"Difficulties of this kind are continually arising with regard to attempts by partial monopolists, such as railway, gas, water and electrical companies, to raise their charges on the consumer who has adapted his business arrangements to make use of their services, and perhaps laid down at his own expense a costly plant for the purpose. For instance, at Pittsburgh when manufacturers had just put up furnaces to be worked by natural gas instead of coal, the price of the gas was suddenly doubled.\\" (Pg. 270)Marshall's book is understated, calm, and generally nonprescriptive throughout. It is essential reading for anyone studying the history and development of economics."},{"Title":"Principles of economics","review":"This books which dates to the late 1800's was the standard for textbooks in economic classes for many years. If you choose to read this book, be prepared to dig deep for interesting economic principles and takeaways. It's not a very difficult book to read but the author's writing style is very informal and loose along with the fact you have to get through the amazing quantity of words to find any value. The author's style is like a long winded professor talking to a class without any real point. I did enjoy the second half of the book more than the first as it seemed to have a point. As a student of economics I have to respect the early traditions and books and that's why I read this. In summary, it's a classic so you must read it but it won't change your life."},{"Title":"Principles of economics","review":"In the present book A. Marshall explains economic concepts with magistral semplicity and clarity.A must for the library of each economist."},{"Title":"Principles of economics","review":"This is certainly one of the most influential books ever written, and served as a pathway to a lot of governmental measures adopted at by many countries to adopt its fiscal, employment and money policies to revert the forces of recession in the United States and Europe.But this is not a book easy to read, given the fact that Keynes had to break a lot of prior misconceptions and fallacies of earlier economists. Also to be taken into consideration is that Keynes was especially keen of linguistics and got all the opportunities to present a very refined text with big literary value. What Keynes had in mind was to discard the useless precepts of free-hand economics, in the very tradition of early British neo-classical economists like Alfred Marshall and Stanley Jevons, and to energetically recomend state intervention to secure full-employment policies.Keynes was instrumental in many important policies adopted in the first half of the last century and along with Adam Smith, David Ricardo and Karl Marx, deserves to step to the pantheon of the most influential economists of all times."},{"Title":"Wordsworth","review":"Adam Kirsch writing in the 'New Yorker' reports that this biography does an outstanding job in covering the details of Wordsworth's everyday life. It contrasts with other biographies in giving equal focus to the long years after he had written his great works.Kirsch finds the book's limitation is that it gives equal time and attention to a host of Wordsworth's activities while not focusing on his Poetry. For the Poetry is what makes Wordsworth important to us today, and not the long, and rather dull life story.Wordsworth's radical youth, when it was bliss to be alive, and to be young was very heaven, his travels to France, his love- affair with Annette Vallon, the birth of his daughter all are in the background of the great decade of poetic work begun in the 1790's. Kirsch maintains that this great period of writing is one in which Wordsworth is still between worlds, torn by his disillusionment with the French Revolution. It is a time before he settles into being the Tory conservative, and eventually respected and admired poet laureate of England.The greatness of Wordsworth which Kirsch sees in great part as connected with a kind of democratic religious vision in which he sees into , sympathizes with and portrays the kind of ordinary and not - so- ordinary souls outside the realm of previous English poetry comes to a climax in this period of uncertainty.Wordsworth's special connection with Nature, the whole sublime and yet deeply passionate and calm tone of his greatest poetry provide a kind of consoling religious vision for many of his great and devoted readers. These include Emerson, and most especially John Stuart Mill .Mill's account in his 'Autobiography' of being saved from his terrible depression and loss of the sense of meaning of his own life, through his reading of Wordsworth is one telling example of how powerful the effect of Wordsworth's poetry.This biography according to Kirsch gives detailed insight into all of Wordsworth's closest relations, including what is one of the most remarkable and productive literary friendships of all time, Wordsworth's close connection with Coleridge.For all students of Wordsworth, for all those who would know his life in the most detailed way possible this work is indispensable."},{"Title":"Alexander Alekhine's Chess Games, 1902-1946","review":"This book is truly a marvelous book to have in my library. I have been collecting chess books since 1969 and despite having almost 500 chess books not much comes close. This book most clearly resembles the excellent two volume book on Rubinstein by John Donalson and Nicolay Minev. As big as a phone book this book does not easily fit on all bookshelves. The only caveat is that there could have been more anotated games. One example is that all the games from NY 1924 should have been annotated as Alekhine himself annotated all the games from the tournment and all of his games from that tournment should have been annnotated."},{"Title":"Alexander Alekhine's Chess Games, 1902-1946","review":"This book is everything Amazon's desription says.

It is really an exhaustive investigation work and better yet, with Alekhine's own annotations on games! We must be grateful to the authors on this fine work and to the publishers for the high quality edition..."},{"Title":"Alexander Alekhine's Chess Games, 1902-1946","review":"This book compiles all known games played by Alexander Alekhine over his career. It includes many (MANY) games from Simultaneous displays, as Alekhine did so many of these exhibitions all over the world, throughout his career. It also includes every 'serious' tournament game, and all of Alekhine's match games, along with many consultation and blindfold games. This is not a biography, although there are light biographical sketches periodically, and also information on his travels between each new destination.As with every McFarland Chess book I own, the physical quality is quite high -- hardcover, very well bound.There is a lot to like -- I'd consider it the only book on Alekhine's games anyone would need, but for two slight drawbacks:First, not every serious game is annotated. This is not a really serious problem, because the games which are not annotated are generally annotated elsewhere. For example, none of the Alekhine/ Capablanca match games are annotated, despite the fact that Alekhine annotated most of his wins and some of the draws for his best games collection. It's hard to fathom why they were not included here. This makes it less all inclusive than it would otherwise be.Second, all the annotations are Alekhine's. This is a minor issue, since his notes are generally accurate and good. Still, notes by other players would be nice, especially in the way it was done in Forster's epic biography of Amos Burn (in my opinion, the book by which all other Chess biographies should be measured). Forster commonly included notes by several players of the day within individual games, and he often added his own notes, or annotated a game fully himself where no other notes were available.Another slight demerit to this book are a regrettable number of typos. I have not noticed any in the prose of the book, but I have noticed a few in the game notes, just going from a random sample of games.That said, this is a great work. I wish it had been more of a true biography/ games collection, but that would have made the book absolutely huge, and a truly monumental work, as Alekhine lived, as the saying goes, in 'interesting times'.This is a wonderful book in any Chess lover's collection, and is a true desert island book."},{"Title":"Alexander Alekhine's Chess Games, 1902-1946","review":"Alekhine was not just World Champion, he was important for the development of Chess itself. He thought in terms of what it meant to unbalance the position. Alekhine took this concept and forced it into his games. Whether he was on the hunt with his own attack, or desperately defending he relished positions in which he could take some advantage he had and use it to the maximum. That he greatly favored being the attacker is obvious. This book is the most complete collection of his games in existence and will reward your study many times over. Not for the beginner, it is very expensive but worth every penny"},{"Title":"Alexander Alekhine's Chess Games, 1902-1946","review":"This book is excellent! It is expensive but worth every penny! It would have been nice if it included some rare photos but this is very minor. Even if you own other works of Alekhine's this is still a good book to have because of it's completeness. The publisher has other chess books of this quality on chess masters such as Capablanca, Marshall, Steinitz and Reshevsky."},{"Title":"Inside Out","review":"I literally could not put this book down.

I can't wait until the next installment."},{"Title":"Inside Out","review":"I am not gay nor am I a woman, so when friends told me I had to read &quot;Inside Out&quot; by Juliet Carrera I was a bit skeptical. It took me awhile to get around to it, but I eventually started it and simply couldn't put it down. Quite frankly it is a good love story: smart, sexy and extremely compelling. I really wanted to know what was going to happen to all the characters. I especially enjoyed the twisted tricks the congresswoman uses to manipulate Andrie. God,I wanted soemone to stick it to her. What a wonderful villain! Everyone should keep their mind open and read this book."},{"Title":"Inside Out","review":"What can I say - I loved this book! I read it practically overnight...I couldn't put it down! Juliet Carrera has crafted a wonderfully written story, with people in it that you're going to love and some you're going to hate - you know, regular folks. This is a story about true passion and what one person will do to protect the one she loves. I really don't want to give away too much of this story but I will say that I read the last few pages with dizzying speed and, by the time I was done, there were tears of happiness in my eyes. Yes, there is a happy ending and that's all I'm going to tell you, except to say read this book! You'll be glad you did!"},{"Title":"Inside Out","review":"This was without a doubt one of the best stories I have ever read! The characters came to life as I read each page and I found myself smiling, laughing and even close to tears at times. I never before read a book that could do that to me. You just can't help but be pulled into this story. Destiny and Andrie, the two women who were meant to be together remind me of a female version Gable and Lombard or Tracy and Hepburn! All the characters were so real I felt like I could see them. I loved David the medling but good-natured friend. He had funnier lines than &quot;Will and Grace&quot;. This should be a movie!!!"},{"Title":"Inside Out","review":"I loved this book! finally a really great book from a woman's hand about all the most important things we deal with! The story is a very modern love story, a love triangle between three women and it is so totally on the mark about all the issues. The characters are real and the pace is quick. Carrera's writing is witty and funny. Her talent is in making a story that really keeps your attention. The pages turn faster than you think and before you know it you are wanting more! I am keeping a close watch for her next book."},{"Title":"Inside Out","review":"From the moment you enter this book, Juliet captures your mind and emotions. She is able to project you into this love affair as a bystander wanting to jump out and help rescue Destiny. It is very easy to get involved and NOT be able to put the book down.

A great gift to give to anyone you know and love."},{"Title":"Inside Out","review":"I am a straight woman and I found this love story captivating! It is clear that the road to love, whether between 2 women, 2 men or a man and a woman can be the same rollercoaster ride! How exciting to see it throught the eyes of Ms. Carrera. She captures the passion and frustration that the roadblocks of life present with humor and empathy. Her characters are caught in the web of life choices we all face- desire for love, career, social pressure, yet she proves that if you are true to yourself you will be rewarded. BRAVA Juliet!"},{"Title":"Inside Out","review":"I found this book to be well-crafted and at times quite fun. It was like a nighttime &quot;adult drama&quot; -- overwrought and improbable, but still fun.I appear to be the only lesbian to review the book so far, and I would advise those lesbians who are looking for a book where lesbianism is something that deeply involves and drives the characters may be a little disappointed. This book appeals to a more mainstream reader. I'm not saying that that is a bad thing; it is within the author's purview to decide what audience she wants to attract. At times I personally felt the fact that the love triangle was between three lesbians was just a little too understated. Having said that, Carrera does end with a ringing endorsement of both the universal nature of love and the power of love to bring peace."},{"Title":"Inside Out","review":"This passion-filled love story is a MUST READ! Juliet Carrera captures the reader with an extremely well written approach to a love triangle. Each chapter combines humor, romance, passion, triumph and tragedy for the reader to revel in the lives of three extraordinary women, each filled with different desires. I had found myself rooting for Destiny Anderson, who is bound by conviction to be true to herself and those she loves. This book is a work of lesbian fiction, but, I can wholeheartedly say, that, as a heterosexual female, I believe that this enduring love story appeals to all sexual persuasions. I can like this to &quot;When Harry met Sally&quot;. Kudos to Juliet Carrera!

This is a copy of the original screenplay for the movie so all of the scenes are here, including a few snippets that were deleted in the final version of the film. The story is brilliantly put together and it only takes about an hour to ninety minutes to read the whole thing, including the informative introduction. This is a wonderful example to explore for anyone who wants to write or is writing screenplays and it is also great for any movie buff or fan of Wilder."},{"Title":"Stalag 17","review":"If you enjoyed just one episode of Hogans Heroes then you will love Stalag 17, which was the inspiration of that show. Although I must admit that I am not a big fan of the Animal character the script itself is darn close to perfection. Stalag 17 is one of the funniest films of all time. The plot is simple and is basically just several episodes in a german prisoner of war camp in world war II as the prisoners suspect that they have an informer in their midst. The scene where they find out who the informer actually is, is one the best scenes that you can watch or read. William Holden won the best actor oscar for his performance in this film and with material like this too work from it is not hard to understand why."},{"Title":"Fixed for Life: The True Saga of How Tom Became Sally","review":"Ms. Preiss is not a great writer of literature, but she has a unique way of telling her story in sparse, short, economical sentences that lured this reader along. On page 1 of Chapter l he was Tom, an 18-year-old sailor who was wet behind the ears in terms of any kind of sexual experience, yet longing to give expression to the woman inside him. He called her Sally. By the final chapter, we had watched Tom disappear as Sally emerged from her chrysalis, mourned the loss of her wives who loved Tom, grieved at the rejection of her children while marveling at her resolve to be successful in her life's twin goals: becoming Sally and making an excellent living. Despite the heart-breaking frustrations of dealing with those who could not understand her inner self, she never looked back, and became the fully transsexual woman in body, mind and spirit that she is today."},{"Title":"Fixed for Life: The True Saga of How Tom Became Sally","review":"If you ever wanted to know what it would feel like to be male (physically) but have an ardent wish to experience life as a female, read this book. This is the story of an ordinary man, a good man with everyman's successes and failures, who realized over the years that he really wanted to be an \\"ordinary\\" woman. The author relates his childhood and youth, and the lonely confusion of being different but having no words to describe it and no one in whom to confide. He was well into adulthood before he found others who were transsexual or transvestite and discovered that he was not alone. The author, as Tom and Sally, shows us the complexities of coming to terms with him/herself, making a living (yes, men get higher salaries), and navigating relationships and rejection.Ms. Preiss's style is straightforward and leavened with wry humor that occasionally had me laughing out loud. The writing of this book took a great deal of courage and honesty. It provides the reader a thoughtful, down-to-earth introduction into a world most of us do not understand and cannot imagine.I don't read a lot of non-fiction, but this book fascinated me."},{"Title":"Fixed for Life: The True Saga of How Tom Became Sally","review":"My friend wrote this book so I liked it lots."},{"Title":"The Poems of Robert Henryson","review":"William Dunbar, poet laureate at the court of King James IV of Scotland, lived from around 1460 to around 1520, a period during which Scotland provided many of the leading poets writing in Britain. Dunbar and his contemporaries Robert Henryson and Gavin Douglas are often grouped together as the \\"Scottish Chaucerians\\" because of the supposed influence of Chaucer on them. Dunbar wrote in the language which has today become known as \\"Middle Scots\\", although he himself referred to his native tongue as \\"Inglissche\\". (His contemporary Douglas, however, did refer to it as \\"Scots\\").Around a hundred poems are attributed to Dunbar; this volume presents a selection of over forty, which give a good idea of the range of his work. The description of Dunbar as a \\"Chaucerian\\" has been disputed, but there is clear evidence of the earlier English poet's influence. (Dunbar himself described his predecessor as \\"of makaris flour\\"- the \\"flower of poets\\"). Like Chaucer, Dunbar was equally at home with an elevated, courtly style or a very earthy one, and had two very different vocabularies to suit each style.The Chaucer who had the greatest influence on him was not the author of narrative poems like the \\"Canterbury Tales\\" or \\"Troilus and Criseyde\\" but the early Chaucer who wrote courtly allegories like \\"The Book of the Duchess\\" or \\"The Parliament of Fowls\\". Dunbar's own efforts in this genre, like \\"The Thistle and the Rose\\" which celebrates the marriage of James IV to the English Princess Margaret Tudor, are written in what has been called the \\"aureate style\\", characterised by elaborate descriptions of nature and by the use of an elevated, Latin-derived vocabulary. The word \\"aureate\\", from the Latin for \\"golden\\", is itself one of Dunbar's favourite words when writing in this vein. The theme of \\"The Thistle and the Rose\\" is a \\"beast-parliament\\" similar to that in \\"The Parliament of Fowls\\", which celebrated another royal wedding, that of Richard II and Anne of Bohemia, and its opening lines:-\\"Quhen Merche wes with variand windis past,And Appryll had with hir silver schouris....\\"seem like a deliberate echo of the opening lines of the Prologue to the \\"Canterbury Tales\\",\\"Whan that Aprille with his shoures sooteThe droghte of Marche hath perced to the roote....\\".Another Chaucerian influence can be seen in the poem \\"The Two Married Women and the Widow\\", a debate on love reminiscent of the Wife of Bath's Prologue, with the Widow having a certain resemblance to the Wife of Bath herself. Parts of this poem are written in the aureate style, but it also contains many examples of Dunbar's other literary style, characterised by earthy Scots words and used by him in his bawdy or satirical verse. One of the married women characterises her husband as a \\"wallidrag\\" (weakling), a \\"bumbart\\" (idler) and a \\"skabbit skarth\\" (a scabby monster), together with a number of other choice epithets.Dunbar's satire, in fact, is much coarser than Chaucer's, and his language can be much filthier than the gentle ribaldry of something like \\"The Miller's Tale\\". Whereas Chaucer's satire is generally social, directed against abuses in church and state, Dunbar's can be crudely personal, directed against individuals to whom he had taken a dislike. A good example is the \\"Flyting of Dunbar and Kennedy\\", a literary duel between Dunbar and a rival poet, Walter Kennedy, who exchange a series of scurrilous insults. Dunbar also holds the dubious distinction of being the earliest writer to use the so-called \\"f-word\\". It occurs in his poem \\"In secreit place this hyndir nycht\\", a comic account of the wooing of two lovers, who address each other with all sorts of bizarre endearments such as \\"curldodie\\" (\\"ribwort plantain\\") and \\"possodie\\" (\\"sheep's head broth\\").Another influence on Dunbar is the alliterative tradition found in Chaucer's Midland and Northern contemporaries, such as Langland and the \\"Pearl Poet\\". \\"The Two Married Women and the Widow\\", for example, is written in unrhymed alliterative verse:-\\"I have ane wallidrag, ane worme, ane auld wobat carleA waistit wolroun, na worth bot wourdis to clatter....\\"In other places he combines alliteration with rhyming verse; an example is his poem commemorating the visit of Queen Margaret to Aberdeen in 1511. This poem also exemplifies another common poetic device used by Dunbar, the use of the same line to conclude every stanza. (In this case \\"Be blyth and blisfull, Burgh of Aberdein\\"). Perhaps his most famous poem to use this device is his \\"Lament for the Makaris\\", with its recurring refrain \\"Timor Mortis Conturbat Me\\". (\\"The Fear of Death Disturbs Me\\").There is more to Dunbar than a combination of chivalrous courtly poet and vituperative satirist; he also wrote in various other poetic genres, including love poetry and religious poetry. Some of his religious verse is highly conventional in theme, like \\"Rorate celi desuper\\", a Christmas hymn, and \\"Hale, sterne superne\\", a hymn to the Virgin Mary, both written in the \\"aureate style\\". At other times, however, it can be much more personal and imaginative, such as the nightmare vision of \\"The Dance of the Sevin Deidlie Synnis\\". It was probably poems like this that the critic W.L. Renwick had in mind when he described Dunbar as \\"possessed of a riotous and fantastic devil\\".Dunbar's language is not easy for modern readers- at least those born south of the Tweed- to understand, and even modern Scots may have occasional problems. Fortunately, the book comes complete with an extensive vocabulary list and notes which make it quite possible for anyone familiar with Middle English to understand all but the most obscure passages. (The editor, James Kinsley, has to admit that the meaning of some vocabulary items has become obscure).This particular edition is now out of print. I came across it in a second-hand bookshop, and am glad that I did, because it serves as an excellent introduction to the work of one of Britain's strangest and most imaginative, if sometimes neglected, poets."},{"Title":"Private Passions","review":"This was a compassionate story about a woman who finds herself again after abuse at the hands of her ex-lover.

It is the compelling story of Sara Gray and how she learns to survive after being the vicitim in a physically abusive relationship. The book takes an indepth look at Sara's work life, her best friend, and her potential love interests.

This was not a downbeat novel but rather uplifting in that the heroine comes into her own and makes choices that fulfill her in every respect. After the initial angst I would have loved to have had a longer novel that would have given the reader a look at the happiness you expect for the characters but I respect the author's need to end the novel where it does.I was hesitant to buy this novel based on a earlier review that described the book in less than glowing terms. I am so happy with what I got because the novel is nothing like the negative reviews.from the publisher's web site - To outside observers, Atlanta-based advertising executive Sara Gray is a pillar of strength - the picture of a woman in total control.

The story is set in Atlanta and the main character, Sara, has recently gotten out of a bad relationship. But she's rebuilding her life and eventually meets someone new.

This book was very good. It's the best one I've read in awhile."},{"Title":"Private Passions","review":"I absolutely despise so-called &quot;romance novels&quot; that are filled with rape and degrading sex scenes. And then when the &quot;one&quot; comes along, they hold hands. This was a truly horrendous book, a waste of the paper it was printed on. It's only good for fire starter."},{"Title":"Aftershocks","review":"A major earthquake stirkes San Francisco, altering the lives of the city's many residents. Patricia watches in dismay as the house she re-built along with her partner Trout (Tracy) crumbles completely to the ground. Meanwhile, across town, Trout, a successful businesswoman, starts to lose control as the world around her spirals out of control. Louise's dyke bar in the heart of the gay district becomes home to an ever-increasing stream of women trying to make sense of what just happened and how they're going to go on.But the quake has done much more to Patricia and Trout than they realize as they struggle through new revelations about their relationship and try to repair the damage to their lives. A good story overall, but some of the storylines, such as Cherice who is trapped in an elevator with a male clerk from her office building, don't seem that important to the novel as a whole. A solid novel from author Jess Wells with many strong characters."},{"Title":"Genetics for Fish Hatchery Managers","review":"REVIEW IN SPANISHEste es un excelente libro introductorio para la gen&eacute;tica de peces, especialmente para acuaristas, acuicultores y bi&oacute;logos mar&iacute;nos.

Dr. Bolonkin discusses his non traditional and yet technically feasible ideas in great detail and insight. He is truly one of the most brilliant scientists in this as well as numerous other fields. I had the privilege of reading his personal manuscript for this book for free as I have had the fortune to be acquainted with Dr. Bolonkin for many years. I agree that this book is a bit pricey. As with most of his books Dr. Bolonkin mostly does not profit from his publications and there are many freely available on the internet. He is truly committed to his work as well as sharing of his vast knowledge and innovative ideas with th world. The high price of the book is due to limited number of copies printed which is inversely proportional to the print volume. As this book is targeted for a specific audience and as a textbook the costs for the editor to publish it may end up being more than the profits earned from the sales. I know Dr. Bolonkin personally and that he would gladly be willing to distribute his works to a wider audience at a lower cost if it was up to him. I can try to suggest other methods of publishing to him(such as an e-publishing) which would definitely lower the cost of his books but I assume that depends on his contractual obligations to the publisher in regards to books already in print such as this one. I will speak with him about this and his other books and publications as well and see if there is anything we can do to bring his work to more people at a more reasonable price and post a reply as to what we can come up with. In the mean time try searching \\"Alexander Bolonkin\\" to find many more articles and publications many of which are available for free."},{"Title":"Non Rocket Space Launch & Flight","review":"This book is well worth the read.

And no one is reviewing it... because no one is buying it, I guess.My state's libraries don't carry it. When I asked my local why, they said the price vs. requests.Author, Publisher please. If you make a book isn't the point for it to be read ... by at least some group of people who may be able to take it and run with its ideas straight to Congress?Even getting it down to a hundred is at least in the realm of the realistic.Until there's proof to the contrary, the book must be terrible because all we have to judge it by is the terrible price."},{"Title":"Buffalo coat: A novel (Local history paper)","review":"If you enjoy skillfully-crafted character studies, this is the perfect book for you. You will fall in love with the town and people depicted in this excellent read. My only disappointment with this book was that it ended. I found myself missing the characters and wishing I had lived then and could have known them in person. My daughter actually introduced me to the book when it was on her required reading list for an English class when she was in high school. It is a book worth having in your collection to read over and over again every few years.

Of course, Iceland has long had a deep and abiding commitment to literature. Anyone who's ever flown through Keflavik would probably share with me an amazement at how many books there were at the duty-free shop alone. This is a culture that loves literature, and it really shows in this anthology. Of particular note is the wonderful Halldor Laxness play &quot;The Pigeon Banquet,&quot; which as far as I know is only found in translation in this anthology. Jane Smiley is right when she says one of the great joys in literature is discovering Laxness' work for the first time, and this play alone is worth the price of the anthology. I hope that this volume becomes available again."},{"Title":"Coaching Into Greatness: 4 Steps to Success in Business and Life","review":"Kim George has produced an easy to read roadmap for how to both find your way into living in your greatness AND helping others. She combines personal testimony and stories designed to clearly illustrate her points. If you are looking for a better way to live than constantly worrying, thinking scarcity thoughts, locked into a struggle mentality, then you need to get this book. Or, if you already are a mentor, guide or coach for others, this book will serve as a good resource for you as you work with those who follow you. Far too many people live in a way that implies only a few are great, having bought into the lie that only certain things equal success (notoriety, money, fame, celebrity, etc...) and in doing so, they have missed their God-given right to greatness, greatness simply in living in who they are. And that does not mean settling for mediocrity, but walking boldly in their own greatness. Kim George's work certainly is a wonderful aid to moving forward in the process of living. As Swift said, \\"May you live every day of your life.\\" George would probably add, \\"live it with greatness, because you already are great.\\" Get this book."},{"Title":"Coaching Into Greatness: 4 Steps to Success in Business and Life","review":"If you're ready to rise beyond life's challenges and enjoy the fruits of your best efforts then give this book a look. If you love books where concepts come alive with juicy, real-life examples AND you value specific techniques for reducing limiting attitudes and behaviors, then don't just look, buy the book. You don't have to be a professional coach to benefit from it but if you are (as I am, www.multiplehats.com), then the vocabulary you'll gain for describing patterns we've all seen when clients get \\"stuck\\" is worth the investment.It is a rare book that actually helps you identify which side of the ledger you (or your clients) are on at any point in time. And let's face it, life IS a moving target so no matter how much self-development you've done in the past, an unconscious move towards restrictive versus abundant thinking sneaks up on all of us from time to time."},{"Title":"Coaching Into Greatness: 4 Steps to Success in Business and Life","review":"Coaching into Greatness does a fantastic job of making the concept of Abundance, and living abundantly, more accessible and easy to work into our everyday lives.Kim's gentle wisdom combined with telling examples from her own life make this compelling book a perfect guide for learning to \\"do what you can do.\\""},{"Title":"Coaching Into Greatness: 4 Steps to Success in Business and Life","review":"I found this book very informative, and down to earth.

Kim George has redefined \\"abundance mentality\\" in a whole new way. It is not just about a paradigm of there being enough to go around. Rather, it is about showing up in business and in life authentically. Through her 4-step process, we are able to recognize the behaviors and beliefs that no longer serve us so that we can make a conscious decision to show up differently and more authentically. What I love most about this groundbreaking book is how Kim lives what she preaches. She illustrates her own personal struggles as they relate to the illusions that held her back from living into her own greatness. Her stories are inspirational, and her methods are practical. Absolutely a must read for anyone who wants to improve their life!"},{"Title":"Coaching Into Greatness: 4 Steps to Success in Business and Life","review":"...to get an insight on what your clients may present within the coaching experience and then magically you start to draw connections to your own experiences!

At first I read with shear curiosity about Kim's theory of abundance and scarcity. And then my curiosity deepened and became internalized as I realized that it offered an original language about why people behave as they do and how we get caught up living lives with self imposed restrictions. It's the type of prose meant to be savored and digested...seeping slowly into hearts and minds.. forever changing the way we view our world. It's language is positively infectious...inspiring action on many levels. I loved the smattering of quotes throughout the book...enough to stop you in your tracks before reading on.

Whether a professional coach, business leader, trainer or stay at home Mom, Kim George breaks through the over saturated \\"self-help\\" instructional world and delivers nothing short of a brilliant practical system that is sure to have her readers savoring each page as she champions them onto greatness. I found her voice and writing style to be filled with creativity, originality, charm and wit that lead you into good solid direction. This book read differently for me than many of the others I have read. Perhaps it was reading that \\"Life is like a giant Slip and Slide\\" or \\"Struggle is strictly over rated\\" perhaps it was all of her fabulous one of a kind analogies but instead of my usual speed reading search for the \\"How To\\" parts, I found myself caught up in each and every one of the author's personal reflections, Illusion examples, case studies and personal interviews with those already living from personal greatness as well as her well outlined plan of action-her four steps that takes you from Scarcity into Abundance.This book read as a welcomed invitation, not a just a training manual or one more task I needed to do today. The approach to Abundance Intelligence not only clears the way for our clients to thrive, it delivers to us a way to be our best-without the struggle. In other words, Coaching into Greatness opens the door to an entire lifestyle of abundance not just a satisfied client roster.

Does scarcity thinking keep you from living into your greatness? How are the Illusions of Scarcity holding you back and keep you from being all you can be?If you've felt the changes happening in the world - the shift toward creating an open, loving and more abundant way of living - and wanted some of that for yourself, then look no further. Because Kim George, a highly respected and renowned life coach and pioneer in the field of Abundance, has written the best book available on how to do just that.She doesn't just tell you about scarcity thinking and how it narrows down and swallows up your life. She teaches you how to turn your life around 180 degrees to embrace Abundance and all its gifts - and offers simple, concrete, step-by-step actions for breaking through the Illusions of Scarcity that keep you from living into your own greatness.In addition to laying out the Illusions and their counterpoints, she illustrates the concepts and draws analogies and examples from real life to help you see the Illusions and their Abundant opposites in action, using stories from her own life, from those of her clients and from the lives of the several powerful business people, thought leaders and progressive individuals who shared their insights with her for the book.If you're worried about spending your hard-earned cash for another serving of fluffy, marshmallow-creme motivational text, don't be.

This book is like a coach unto itself, helping people get rid of the illusions that limit our life.I've read tons of self-help books, business and leadership books, as well as books on spiritual growth. Kim George's manual on success stands among the best of them all, and is uniquely different from the rest in that she created her own paradigm and language for success--AQ, or Abundance Intelligence.This book is easy to read if you are genuinely wanting to take your life to the next level. However, there will be moments when if you genuinely do the exercises, you'll be forced to confront your most limiting beliefs.As I go through that process, having created my Declaration, and am working on all of my exercises and questions, I find myself growing in an new ways.Here are some golden nuggets from the book.

There are only a few other occasions in which an author's message has impacted me in the way that Kim George's message has. Kim is in good company with Depak Chopra, Daniel Goleman and Debra Benton.Any organization serious about success must see the incorporation of the four step coaching model as a necessity. This book unlocks the secrets to a workforce that has grown more enigmatic in the face of an increasingly challenging world. Kim George has given brilliant coherent structure to concepts that have previously been thought of as complex and difficult to grasp.The mindset of abundance is one that I have been integrating into my being over the past decade or so. My attempts to spread the word in the corporate setting were only semi-successful. The frame and content to Kim's message reverberates so deeply with me because it is the first model I have seen that would have real viability in a corporate setting. All organizations would be wise to integrate the AQ aptitudes into their hiring process, training and development and into their performance appraisal program.On a personal level this book has changed my life. If learning a foreign language like Spanish helps one in getting around this world; learning the language of abundance will make one feel like they rule the world.

There's nothing to BECOME, nothing to ACHIEVE, nowhere to get TO, nothing or no one outside of yourself that will make this happen, because all that other stuff is about BECOMING something and this book is about already BEING something: G-R-E-A-T.It's a powerful premise and it takes a lot of pressure off.Initially, I thought this book was about how to get out of scarcity mindset and into abundant mindset all the time in order to get some on-going desired result, but it's way simpler and much more high level than that. The definition of greatness is so personal and different for everyone that it all comes down to doing what YOU CAN do each day. Being great for one person is not going to look the same as being great for someone else. Coaching into Greatness is about our human teetertotter between abundance and scarcity and riding the fulcrum to greatness. We live in each realm and the key is to be in harmony with both of them to DO what we CAN do everyday. While offering practical steps to recognizing and moving past the many human illusions we all share (illusion of comparisions, illusion of certainty, and the illusion of struggle to name my favorites), the author shows us how greatness is a highly attractive state of being, not a destination."},{"Title":"The Templar Treasure at Gisors","review":"The pretentious author of this book begins by debunking the myth of the Templar treasure of Gizors and then proceeds to discredit the theories of almost all Templar authors.

People often wonder why different Christian groups differ from one another in belief. This book is a big help. Although not light reading, it shows how individual religious leaders emphasized some point in such a way that it bent what was taught and believed in various movements. It is a very good resource to have and to use."},{"Title":"History of theology","review":"Bengt Hagglund was and is one of the foremost Lutheran historical theologians of the latter half of the twentieth century. This is a very fine intro to theology as it developed over the ages beginning with the apostolic fathers through to the anti-Gnostic fathers such as Irenaeus and then moving on to such greats as St. Augustine. The major forms of scholastic thought are covered as is Luther's reformation breakthrough and the other major reformers before Hagglund discusses later developments in Lutheranism such as Lutheran Orthodoxy (1580 - 1725 A.D.) and Lutheran Pietism. Rarely will one encounter discussions of the Formula of Concord (1580) and Lutheran Orthodoxy in books written in English, so this is a helpful resource for Hagglund measured judgments. But Hagglund then gives sparser treatment on more recent theologians of the 19th century such as Schleiermacher before offering a brief discussion of early twentieth century theologians.Hagglund's style is clear and concise and easy to understand. This is a good introductory text book to Christian theology as it developed. Hagglund is relatively fair and balanced, though many will not agree with all of his analyses. For example, his portrayal of Augustine's theology of salvation (soteriology)was far more convoluted than any of Augustine's major works on that subject. Hagglund may have been reading late medieval interpretations of Augustine back into the bishop of Hippo. Either way this is still a very fine resource."},{"Title":"Orange Juice (Science Emergent Readers)","review":"\\"Orange Juice\\" is part of a series of Science Emergent Readers.

He writes his book to illustrate a wonderful biography Madame Bovary as Gustave Flaubert. Interestingly and what makes this book fascinating is how Frederick Brown keeps his distance away from the audience to make us decide what the apparent contradictions in Flaubert's life really is. The 24 chapters not only offer a vivid, detailed, and accurate account of Flaubert's life, they also provide relevant historical background for Europe, France, and Rouen, Flaubert's birthplace. Flaubert (for those who don't know) was romantic and optimist yet his most famous work required a degree of discipline to keep his emotions out of it. He loathed the bourgeois, but perhaps was one of the greatest symbols of the social class in the middle nineteenth century when he hugged fame. Flaubert's loving relationship with his mistress Louise Colet really summed up the complexity of the subject of this fine work Mr. Brown provides in his biographical masterpiece in literature today. I really love this book a lot...since I am a fan of Gustave Flaubert. I highly recommend for those who are intellect and love to learn more about the life of Falubert and his career. Overall, 9/10!"},{"Title":"Flaubert : A Biography","review":"Julian Barnes in his excellent survey of this book in NY Review of Books states that Brown shows how Flaubert in the few intimate relations of his life preferred the memory of the experience in solitude where he could control it, to the actual experience itself. He cites an instance where Flaubert wrote to the woman closest to him Louise Colet explaining to her that if people truly loved each other they could do so without seeing each other for ten years. Colet appeared to be somewhat skeptical of the matter.Barnes also says that Brown in telling the story of Flaubert's relation to his long- time friend Maxine du Camp shows how the lifelong friends nonetheless aimed differently in life, and had subtle criticisms of their best - friends' enterprises. So Flaubert upon hearing that du Camp had been accepted as member of the 'French Academy' hinted that it was an honor not at all worth receiving. So du Camp criticized Flaubert for being stuck all the years in the same attitude he had early on.Barnes says that Brown's book is truly admirable though it contains no significant great revelation about a writer who has fascinated more than one devoted biographer.Nonetheless he makes it clear that this is by and large a first- rate biography, and one well- worth reading."},{"Title":"Flaubert : A Biography","review":"'Madame Bovary,' Flaubert's signature work celebrates 150 years of basically continuous publication. Shocking at the time because of its portrayal of the infidelities of a married woman, its publication caused Flaubert to be tried for lewdness.Flaubert, like many writers was a tortured soul. One page from his original manuscript of 'Madame Bovary,' shows pained writing, much crossing out and re-writing. For him writing was not something he enjoyed, but more along the lines of something that he had to do. The words did not flow easily and fast, instead he struggled over each sentence, each word. But at the end, a book still in print in perhaps a dozen editions in English alone a century and a half later.This new biography gives a look at both the life of Flaubert and also of his times. Here is a picture of the literary world that was Paris in the middle 1800's. Flaubert observed first hand the Revolution of 1848 and the Franco-Prussian War of 1871. While not a history of these events, Mr. Brown presents a view of them from their impact on Flaubert.This is likely to remain the definitive biography of Flaubert for many years."},{"Title":"Flaubert : A Biography","review":"Painfully overwritten, with passages of eye-roll-worthy bombast that make one shudder at the thought of ever having to hold a conversation with Brown. The assiduous research the author clearly carried out is, alas, rather poorly edited, and then rendered into passages of the most torturous purple prose.Flaubert is indeed a fascinating figure; and Brown does not *totally* fail in communicating this. However, for all the technical acumen this biographer is blessed with, he is woefully lacking in grace. Don't come looking for the deft brevity of a skilled historian, but rather for a farrago of murky narrative and hack psychoanalysis reflecting the masturbatory garrulity of a writer blindly infatuated with their own talent.If you buy it, buy it used.

There are passages of literary excellency, but one must weed through too much tedium to find treasures. This is more of a history lesson than a biographical description and analysis."},{"Title":"Flaubert : A Biography","review":"Be warned: this piece is more about Flaubert, than it is about Brown. Because before discussing Brown's biography, I am sorry to have to discuss Flaubert, the novelist that is, for whom - I have to admit - I don't care much. For although I have read just about everything the man from Rouen wrote, and did so in French, I never felt the urge to start all over again, just for fun. Of Bouvard and P&eacute;cuchet, which Flaubert wasn't able to finish, he himself said, many times, that it was an abominable book: \\"mon bouquin abominable.\\" The best thing I like about B and P (Flaubert's own short title) is the dictionary of clich&eacute;s, the \`dictionnaire des ide&eacute;s recues', which is very funny. Salammbo is just slightly less tiring than B and P. I don't care much for Flaubert's novellas either, no, not even for A simple heart (\\"Un coeur simple\\"), parrot or no parrot, Barnes or no Barnes. I do have a soft spot for Education Sentimentale, although that too is in many ways a troubled book. But it at least has a directness and a flair which is very un-Flaubertian. I more or less like Mme Bovary, of course, although it doesn't really set you on fire and you tend to admire it first and like it after.Writing for Flaubert always meant starting a project, and \\"piocher\\" (toiling) every time he did. It never meant just writing. Except for Bovary every novel or short story took stacks of literature to produce. Just sitting down and writing a story wasn't his style. Visiting libraries, asking friends, studying, going places just to check: and then afterwards complain: why did I ever start? And if just for once there was no research to be done, he was fond of writing a fine sentence, which took a lot of time as well, while at the same time complaining about his colleagues who didn't care how they wrote, meaning just about everyone else. \\"Industrialists\\", he called some of his colleagues, not excluding Zola, Daudet or the Goncourt brothers. And they were the ones he liked. It was George Sand, his older and wiser lady-friend from Nohant, whom he admired as a person - but without saying so, didn't take serious as a writer - who once wrote to him, and I paraphrase: what a pity that a man with so much personality, with so many convictions and ideas, who writes so well as long as he doesn't try to hard, has decided to write the way he chooses. Sand was a shrewd woman. She was right of course. I find that great style of Flaubert admirable, but also sterile and cold. If he had been a painter, he would have been Gerome or Bonnat, whom he both knew. The name of Manet appears in his letters only once, just to mention \\"that he doesn't understand the first thing of his paintings.\\" He didn't care much for painting, or for music by the way: he was a very literary man, almost exclusively so. Yet, I find the distance he demonstrates toward the figures in his stories very French, and slightly inhuman. I like Stendhal, who always addressed himself in bad English in the margins of his manuscripts, and now and then wrote sloppy French in between, but who could also demonstrate a spontaneous esprit that is a pleasure to read, every time you do. When Flaubert, in 1878, is asking Taine about editions of Stendhal which he can use for his B and P, he calls his colleague an idiot, and I am not sure he is joking.So, isn't there anything I like about Flaubert? Oh yes, there is. And no, it isn't very original to say this, because it has been said many times before: if Flaubert hadn't written his letters, I doubt if he would enjoy the status he enjoys now. He destroyed important parts of his correspondence, so that the five (French language) Pleiade-volumes of about 7500 pages, including some 2000 pages of annotation, contain just a part of what he actually wrote, but it is Flaubert's correspondence which still makes him worth wile. His letters immediately make clear why his friends and acquaintances were so impressed by him. Practically all of it written in the deep of night, or early in the morning, so that they are always dated one day late, produced in a hurry after his normal writing, but in sheer weight and volume many times as large, his correspondence is a work of real genius and shows an artist art work as you seldom see. The letters are eminently readable, are fun, and belong without a doubt to what is best in world-literature. In them Flaubert can be humorous, cynical, sarcastic and sentimental, and is always eloquent. He can be a hypocrite, a buffoon, and a whorechaser who talks very dirty now and then, but who also loves his mother and his (as far as I am concerned very unpleasant) niece. And then there - at last - appears Brown. Two months after Browns biography was published, in France appeared the fifth (and last) volume of Flaubert's letters in the Pl&eacute;iade (Gallimard), finishing an edition that started in 1973. Brown says that he has been able to read the 5th volume before it was published in December 2008, and he obviously did.Browns biography is, well, ... I hesitate... okay, it \`s adequate, but I also find it very aloof. He has a keen eye for human weakness, treats Flaubert in a businesslike way, and does justice to his talents and his faults, sketching the background where necessary, functioning as an accompaniment to the annotation of his letters. It certainly sheds no new light. Brown has just been doing what has already been done by many others. I felt the same way about his book on Zola, which was just as businesslike and fair as his biography of Flaubert. Brown writes well, as someone should who wants to write about Flaubert, but the only parts of the book that really come to life - in both biographies - are the parts about French history, about the background, as if Brown found writing the life stories a duty, and only had fun when he could get away from them, writing about Dreyfus in Zola, and about 19th century French politics (Thiers, Gambetta) in Flaubert for instance. The idea of following up Zola with Flaubert is not without its logic. It makes the biographers life easier, the two knew each other well and even professed to admire each other. But Flaubert made fun of Zola's scientific ideas, and rightly so, and Zola, who was an able producer of novels for the general taste (and who was just as smart in letting others produce plays based on them), must have had his reservations about Flaubert's artistry and literary snobbism. But the boy from Aix and the one from Rouen, outsiders both of them, hankering for success, while denying to do so, also recognized each other's seriousness, and although Flaubert considered himself a conservative, most of his close artist friends tended to the left. I suppose, well, I hope, that Flaubert, had he lived, would have been proud of Zola's J \`Accuse, and would have been a staunch Dreyfusard. Maybe it's time for Brown, while he is at it, just for efficiency's sake, to go on, and start writing a biography of Maupassant now, to whom Flaubert wrote many letters (\\"mon disciple\\"), one of them ending in: \\"I touch myself when I think of you\\", and signed: \\"sister clitoris.\\" Flauberts letters are not for the bourgeois, whom he despised. They beat any biography and deserve to be translated in full, though they probably never will. It takes a real hero to just try."},{"Title":"Flaubert : A Biography","review":"I understand that another author's biography was more psychological and I understand that Frederick Brown wanted to examine Flaubert in a more social, historical context. I just wish Brown had come up with a slightly different title for his biography of my all-time favorite writer. Titling the biography *Flaubert* lent me to think the biography would be more psychological, rather than historical. Perhaps Brown should have considered something like *Flaubert and Normandy* or *Flaubert's Normandy.* The historical passages are well done, but I wonder if they could have been trimmed a bit. Though I have been trained in European history, I gritted my teeth while reading every word. I wonder if Brown thought to himself, \\"Now let me get through this so that we can get back to Flaubert's literary tribulations and relationships.\\" Flaubert's literary struggles and relationships are the most fascinating part of this biography.My gripes aside, this biography is densely (in the best sense of the word) and beautifully written. Flaubert's best and not so great moments are limned gorgeously. The most touching aspect of the man is how good he was to his niece Caroline and how she honored his memory. I wished I had been Willa Cather when she encountered Caroline to talk about \\"les ouevres de mon oncle.\\""},{"Title":"Flaubert : A Biography","review":"Everything as promised; prompt delivery of pristine copy of the book"},{"Title":"Usagi Yojimbo Volume 19: Fathers And Sons (Usagi Yojimbo (Dark Horse))","review":"In an earlier review, I said how difficult it is to review Stan Sakai's Usagi Yojimbo because of its amazing consistency of quality. Each volume is just a good rousing and satisfying read. However, with this new volume, \\"Fathers and Sons,\\" Sakai has shown that he is not willing to rest on his laurels, and that he keeps pushing for better things.Miyamoto Usagi is traveling with Jotaro, the son of the woman Usagi once loved. However, unknown to young Jotaro, Usagi is not merely a beloved \\"uncle,\\" but his father. Usagi is conflicted. He is escorting Jotaro to Katsuichi, Usagi's sensei, to learn the samurai way. Should Usagi tell Jotaro the truth, or would that cause too much pain for Jotaro? However, there is another secret that Usagi doesn't know that puts a sad and intriguing spin on events.As the title suggests, the overall theme of this volume is the father/son relationship. The titular story has Usagi and Jotaro coming to the aid of Lone Goat and Kid, Sakai's parody of Lone Wolf and Cub. In \\"The Pride of the Samurai,\\" Usagi and Jotaro encounter a stubbornly proud but completely destitute ronin and his son as they seek to defend their meager squatter's shack from the local government.However, not all of the stories concern themselves with paternity. In \\"Kill the Geishu Lord,\\" Usagi once again crosses paths with the young lord Noriyuki and his vassal Tomoe, as a gang seizes a village to set a trap. It's a straightforward action tale, as is \\"Hokashi,\\" in which our heroes encounter a group of assassins disguised as street performers. Naturally, this gang has a grudge against Usagi. These stories reveal that Jotaro is quite the formidable little fighter, a chip off the old block. The last story, \\"Bells,\\" is a tale of Katsuichi-sensei's youth, a sad tale of his love of the woman of another dojo, and the tragedy that resulted.These are all good stories, but the real impact of this volume lies in Usagi's final decision about telling Jotaro the truth. I won't spoil it, but any astute reader will see it coming, as well as that twist Sakai throws in. Sakai sucessfully writes a very touching moment because it is completely in character for Usagi to make that decision. This attention to character is why this series transcends its furry animal trappings and achieves something quite sophisticated, almost brilliant.Anyone who hasn't read Usagi Yojimbo should. This volume might not be the best place to start, as it is unusually heavy on past continuity. On the other hand, Sakai makes his work very accessible, even this volume. On its own merits, this volume stands out as one of the best of a series that is in itself one of the best the medium has to offer."},{"Title":"Usagi Yojimbo Volume 19: Fathers And Sons (Usagi Yojimbo (Dark Horse))","review":"The latest Usagi compliation brings us to the end of the travels of Usagi with his son Jothro. It reprints a series of first rate stories (deceptive since there are not more than 5 or 6 that I remember not liking in the entire series.) ending with each of the major characters going their own way.As a rule the trade paperbacks that deal with a continuing storyline are better since you get the whole story all at once, by rights this volume should be purchaed with volume 18 and read together.Either way, you will get character development and I think the clue to the way the series will finally end.

It crafts a delicate and beautiful balance between honor and savagery, cute innocence and dark brutality, simple heart-warming stories and multi-part epics that shape a dense continuity. Whether or not you've ever been a fan of feudal Japanese culture, furry anthro characters, or independent, non-superhero comics, Usagi Yojimbo is a comic that can't help but impress even the harshest critic.Fathers and Sons (vol. 19) is essentially the continuation of Travels with Jotaro, the previous volume. Here continues the dichotomy of innocence and savagery that Jotaro illuminates in Usagi's world as they encounter everything from a band of greedy brigands to a full scale ninja assault. Along the way, they meet up with favorite characters such as Lone Goat and Kid, Katsuichi (who gets one heck of a flashback story), and Tomoe Ame. The last of these makes for the most compelling portion of the book as Usagi confides in Tomoe (his love interest) that Jotaro is secretly his son. Tomoe's reaction and ensuing discussion with Usagi certainly makes for one of the title's most dramatic and evocative moments of all time. It says a lot about Tomoe and their relationship, as well as forcing Usagi to continue to ask incredibly difficult questions about himself as his evolution of character progresses. Heavy, rewarding stuff.As the volume reaches its close and Jotaro's time with Usagi becomes briefer, the issue of their true relationship begins to take more of a center stage. Much of the drama in this volume lies in wondering whether or not Usagi will have the courage to tell Jotaro that he is his real father, as well as how Jotaro will take the news and how this will change Usagi's lifestyle and world. Regardless of what you think the outcome will be, I suspect that this volume will prove you wrong and have you dropping your jaw by its conclusion.Like so many volumes before it, Fathers and Sons is not one to miss. However, I strongly suggest reading Travels with Jotaro (the previous volume) first. You might even want to go back to Circles (vol. 6) where Usagi first learns that he is Jotaro's father."},{"Title":"Usagi Yojimbo Volume 19: Fathers And Sons (Usagi Yojimbo (Dark Horse))","review":"This book just follows what Stan Sakai's fans wait for:stories well written and with superb drawings!"},{"Title":"Usagi Yojimbo Volume 19: Fathers And Sons (Usagi Yojimbo (Dark Horse))","review":"This volume is very clearifying, and is putting twogether some of the things you've been wondering about.

This is a well-written novel, with fully realized characters, and yet, I wasn't caught up in reading about their lives. For a novel with such a sweep of history (from Edwardian Scotland to pre-WWII) it was rather -- reserved. Everyone is so stoic; emotions are muted. Even the romantic beginning, with Alasdair the first-born son stealing away his brother's bride-to-be, was very restrained. I kept waiting for the characters' emotions to break through. In that respect, I guess this novel was very realistic - life doesn't consist of high drama, just moments of it now & then. But in this case, even the moments of drama were restrained. When tragedies happened to this family, it was hard to feel anything for the characters. It's an interesting family saga, combined with a redemption story of one brother's misshapen life, but in the end, it's not compelling reading. Oddly enough, it would probably make a very good film -- the characters are distinct and realized, but the story needs action and good actors to bring it to full life."},{"Title":"Bomba the jungle boy: The Moving Mountain (Bomba series ; no. 2)","review":"This book was about a boy named Bomba.

But Bomba is a plucky kid whose best friends are animals, who is courageous and enterprising.

Years in one of the city's toughest districts have built an armor around Franco.Franco cares about the people in her district and is alarmed when the first victim of a serial murderer appears. Franco sees the pattern in these murders as an extension of earlier, increasingly brutal, rapes and walks a razor's edge as she allows herself to sink deeper into the killer's mind in order to track him down.Clare provides remarkable insight into the &quot;rearing&quot; of a serial killer in a series of short, often horrific vignettes at the beginning of each chapter. These hauntingly powerful depictions stay with the reader.Allison Kennedy, a young, smart mouthed, narcotics officer is brought in to act as bait for the killer. Displeased with the stake out plan, Franco is annoyed, worried and just a little attracted to Kennedy. --Feelings that Franco does not welcome, yet may be important for her salvation. Not because their relationship is necessarily destined to be a success, this is not a &quot;happily ever after&quot; love story. -- Because for the first time in years Franco feels more than simple lust for another woman and is willing to risk the relationship.Some of Clare's secondary characters are difficult to differentiate, particularly in the macho police world.

Like pulling on a one-armed bandit till it spews the action for you. Well, no whistles and bells here--just played off with a newspaper story.

Here is a woman who willingly tortures herself with a past that she refuses to forget, preferring, instead, to inundate herself with work, alcohol and exercise.The only drawbacks to this otherwise fantastic novel, are Clare's over reliance on nicknames and her portrait of Kennedy, a detective from another unit who is recruited as a decoy to try and trap the killer. After wading through more nicknames then I could count, I completely gave up trying to fit them with corresponding characters.

As investigative leads go nowhere, a trap is laid for the unknown assailant. The bait is Allison Kennedy, a playful young narcotics detective who seems to delight in irritating Frank. The two women face are compelled to forge an alliance in order to survive as their hunt for the killer brings Frank painfully close to her own demons and she must choose between freeing herself from the bonds of a turbulent past, or remain fatally shackled by them.

The pacing of the story is superb, but what saves this simple mystery is the characterizations.

In several sections: Among the Bedouins, Among the Druses, Among the Dervishes, Among the Yezidees. The Yazidi are members of a Kurdish religion with ancient Indo-Iranian roots. They are primarily a Kurdish-speaking people living in the Mosul region of northern Iraq, with additional communities in Transcaucasia, Armenia, Turkey, and Syria in decline since the 1890s - their members emigrating to Europe, especially to Germany. Their religion, Yazidism, is a branch of Yazdnism, and is seen as a highly syncretic complex of local Kurdish beliefs and Islamic Sufi doctrine introduced to the area by Sheikh Adi ibn Musafir in the 12th century. The Yazidi believe in God as creator of the world, which he placed under the care of seven holy beings or angels, the chief of whom is Melek Taus, the Peacock Angel. Seabrook was interested in them because of their reputation as devil worshippers. Actually, the reality is a little more complex. In 1915 Seabrook joined the French Army and served in World War I. He was gassed at Verdun in 1916, and was later awarded the Croix de Guerre. The following year he took up the post of reporter for The New York Times, and soon became an itinerant. Besides his books, Seabrook had articles published in popular magazines including Cosmopolitan, Reader's Digest and Vanity Fair. Cannibalism:Seabrook went on a trip to West Africa, living with a tribe known as the Guere. He asked the chief what human meat tasted like, but the chief couldn't describe it to Seabrook's satisfaction. Later, Seabrook had the opportunity to try it himself, getting a portion of stew with rice as well as a \\"sizeable rump steak, also a small loin roast to cook or have cooked\\" however he wanted. The source, Seabrook stated, was a recently killed man, but he was not murdered. He reported that, \\"It was like good, fully developed veal, not young, but not yet beef. It was very definitely like that, and it was not like any other meat I had ever tasted. It was so nearly like good, fully developed veal that I think no person with a palate of ordinary, normal sensitiveness could distinguish it from veal. It was mild, good meat with no other sharply defined or highly characteristic taste such as for instance, goat, high game, and pork have. The steak was slightly tougher than prime veal, a little stringy, but not too tough or stringy to be agreeably edible. The roast, from which I cut and ate a central slice, was tender, and in color, texture, smell as well as taste, strengthened my certainty that of all the meats we habitually know, veal is the one meat to which this meat is accurately comparable.\\" Later life: Around 1920, English occultist Aleister Crowley spent a week with Seabrook at Seabrook's farm. Seabrook went on to write a story based on the experience, and to recount the experiment in Witchcraft: Its Power in the World Today. In 1924, he travelled to Arabia and sampled the hospitality of various tribes of Bedouin and the Kurdish Yazidi. His account of his travels, Adventures in Arabia: among the Bedouins, Druses, Whirling Dervishes and Yezidee Devil Worshipers was published in 1927; it was sufficiently successful to allow him to travel to Haiti, where he developed an interest in voodoo and the Culte des Mortes which were described at length in his book The Magic Island. Although Seabrook had a lifelong fascination with the occult practices of satanism and voodoo, as he saw firsthand both in third-world countries (documented in his books The Magic Island (1929), and Jungle Ways (1930)) as well as in London, Paris, and New York, he later concluded that he had seen nothing that did not have rational scientific explanation, a theory that he detailed in Witchcraft: Its Power in the World Today (1940). In December 1933, Seabrook was committed at his own request and with the help of some of his friends to Bloomingdale, a mental institution in Westchester County, near New York City for treatment for acute alcoholism. He remained a patient of the institution until the following July and in 1935 published an account of his experience, written as if it were no more than another expedition to a foreign locale. The book, Asylum, became another best-seller. In the preface, he was careful to state that his books were not \\"fiction or embroidery.\\" He married Marjorie Muir Worthington in France in 1935, after they had returned from a trip to Africa, in which Seabrook was researching a book. Due to his alcoholism and sadist practices they divorced in 1941. She later wrote a biography: The Strange World of Willie Seabrook, which was published in 1966. Death: He committed suicide on September 20, 1945 in Rhinebeck, New York, by drug overdose."},{"Title":"ACROSS THE RIVER AND INTO THE TREES","review":"I just began reading this one. It doesn't capture your interest as much as other Hemingway novels, but i do look forward to the story because I enjoy Hemingway quite a bit."},{"Title":"ACROSS THE RIVER AND INTO THE TREES","review":"I just finished listening to this novel in an audio book format. Although several scenes felt overlong and slightly ludicrous, there are other passages that are as well written and moving as anything Hemingway wrote. In different spots I choked up while driving, particularly during the description of Hurtgen (sp?) forest, etc. The description of the Venetian marketplace was superb and rivaled James's Venice from The Aspern Papers. I loved the underlying wit and self-entertainment that permeated much of the dialogue and interior monologues. Renata, too good to be true? Sometimes cloyingly so, but at other times the way she manages the sensibilities and ego of her twilight lover was quite touching. I also appreciated the Colonel's cynical attitude toward politics, military bureaucracy, etc.I can see being frustrated by this novel in print; it's imperfect as a work of art and objectionably melodramatic at times; still, I love Venice and Hemingway, and, yes, this book also."},{"Title":"ACROSS THE RIVER AND INTO THE TREES","review":"This is the book critics love to slag off, because it is written by Mr.Redskin himself, but had it been written by somebody other than Hemingway it would probably have been highly praised. Hemingway has captured the relationship between the dying colonel and the young baroness beautifully. It is a book to read slowly, as one can play music slowly, but forget &quot;A farewell to arms&quot; and &quot;For whom the bell tolls&quot; before you start. Jump in the car with the colonel and his private chauffeur and let Hemingway bring you to Venice."},{"Title":"ACROSS THE RIVER AND INTO THE TREES","review":"This was easily the most tedious and uneventful Hemingway I've ever read. Set in Venice, it's two hundred or so pages of quick-witted conversations between a young Italian beauty and a dying United States war veteran. The protagonist is a sad old man, retelling war stories and bumbling over his anxieties concerning the impending loss of both his true love and his own life.There's no significant action and it's very difficult to find someone to root for.I can only recommend this for those of you who feel, like I do, that you must read absolutely every single Hemingway work before you can rest."},{"Title":"ACROSS THE RIVER AND INTO THE TREES","review":"Those who disparage this book most often do so on two grounds: It is not Hemingway's best, and it is a thinly disguised semi-autobiographical account of the author's own experiences returning to Italy in middle age.Both criticisms are accurate. To the first, I say: Judge the book on its own merits. It is a charming romantic tale, extremely well-crafted, with well-developed characters and great dialogue. To the second, I say: So what? &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; also drew extensively on Hemingway's own experiences and is rightly regarded as a masterpiece. Writers are supposed to write what they know. I think the real disappointment for many Hemingway fans is that the book doesn't have much action. An old soldier's recollections of war don't match Hemingway's brilliant battle scenes of his earlier works. But the book is about an old soldier, not a young one. If you approach this book with an open mind and an eye for the kind of nuance and subtlety of which only a master writer is capable, you will be rewarded. If you expect El Sordo's last stand, you'll be disappointed. At the very least, it's an engaging portrait of Venice, one of the most beautiful cities on the planet, painted with words by a man who loved it and bled for it."},{"Title":"ACROSS THE RIVER AND INTO THE TREES","review":"I thought this book was well-worth the read, but not as moving and insightful as other books by Hemingway. Despite the lack of &quot;action&quot; in the book, Hemingway writes beautifully constructed sentences with profound meaning. His literary style is unsurpassable. Some say there is no plot to this story, but i disagree. The plot focuses around death, love, and loss. This book is definately worth the read, although read it very slowly."},{"Title":"ACROSS THE RIVER AND INTO THE TREES","review":"Across the River and Into the Trees is definitely Hemingway at his weakest. But the thing is that even the weakest Hemingway is much better than what most mediocre writers produce in their entire lives. What we have here is a short plotless novel about an old army Colonel and his young mistress spending a romantic weekend in Venice. There is nothing inherently wrong with this set up: Venice is a beautiful city, and Hemingway describes it well; the relationship is unconventional, but believable (I recall that Hemingway had a very similar love affair at some point in his life); and last, the lack of plot is nothing new-- The Sun Also Rises was a brilliant bit of meandering. The reason why the novel is a failure is that the relationship between Renata and Col. Cantwell is dull, trite, and meaningless. The entire 280 pages is full of inane lines like \\"oh, don't talk so rough\\" and \\"you are my one and only love.\\" The vast majority of these pages is taken up by conversations between the two lovers which is, unfortunately, the least interesting part of the novel. If Hemingway had spent more time exploring the Colonel's psyche and less time having him exchange trivialities, he might have pieced together a good book.A perfect example of the ruined brilliance of this novel is on page 213 where the Colonel says \\"Every day is a new and fine illusion. But you can cut out everything phony about the illusion as though you would cut it with a straight-edge razor.\\" Classic Hemingway. But then Renata follows up this great line by saying \\"Please never cut me,\\" and he says \\"You are not cut-able.\\" The profound insight of the conversation degenerates that quickly into mindless pillow talk.In the end, this novel is definitely worth reading if you're a Hemingway completist, or even if you have any special affection for the city of Venice. I suspect too that former or current soldiers would especially relate to the Colonel's frustration and nostalgia after decades of harsh battle. But to someone new to Hemingway or someone looking for classic modernist literature, you're much better off reading The Sun Also Rises or even For Whom the Bell Tolls."},{"Title":"ACROSS THE RIVER AND INTO THE TREES","review":"Those that have not experienced the military cannot connect with this novel. The Sun Also Rises, glorified in later years by Hunter S. Thompsons nearly identical work, popularized even recently by Johnny Depp and Hollywood, absolutely pales in comparison to the insights relevant to geo-political irony captured by H. while a correspondent in WWII. The colonels' recollection of the recalcitrant command's decisions ring as true today as they did in the 40's. This book, despite the requisite theme of unrequited love, is by far the most poignant of his works. The love story is almost an excuse to write this novel; those that think H. was past his prime simply haven't been there to experience the intrinsic theme of the horrible irony and idiocy of military command. The good colonel's attempts to minimize loss of life while performing his ordered mission present the problems of command in some of the most eloquent terms. Do twenty years in the infantry and read this novel again if you find it inferior to the fluff of &amp;quot;The Sun Also Rises&amp;quot;"},{"Title":"ACROSS THE RIVER AND INTO THE TREES","review":"I am a big Hemingway fan and have read and reread many of his books. This one is definitely much harder to get through and the story just doesn't hold you the way most of his books do."},{"Title":"ACROSS THE RIVER AND INTO THE TREES","review":"I really liked reading this book. It is about a man who has spent all of his adult life in the service. He has survived wars, both on the battlefield and on personal levels. This story takes place during a car ride when the main character, Richard, is under a great deal of stress and in pain from a heart condition. He is recalling the previous days that he spent with a young woman that he loves. He shares his thoughts and feeling, memories of how the weekend events occurred with the reader. Richard is the only point of view the reader has, and he is in pain, fearing his impending death, so the reader has a pointed (and restricted) view. He is facing the idea that the chronic heart problems he has will probably end his life, and he is recalling many of his regrets, both professional and personal, to the female character and the reader. The reader gets more information than does his lover because we have some insight into what he thinks, but isn't saying. The female character seems flat, but really I think that is just because she is seen through his eyes, and he is under a lot of stress. I really liked this book. It is Hemingway, his writing is emotional and detailed. It provokes thought about myself and how do I affect the people around me. What are they going through that I'm not aware of?The Kindle edition of this book is formatted without issue and all the chapter links work."},{"Title":"ACROSS THE RIVER AND INTO THE TREES","review":"When Hemingway wrote this novel, he may have known that his materpieces were behind him. Although this novel is a lesser work, there are moments of tenderness, poignancy and power crafted in his trademark miminalist style that linger. The novel concerns a retired Army Colonel, who has fought in brutal combat, near the end of his life and is desperately in love with a much younger woman. To me the woman signified the Colonel's lost youth and the relationship may take on new meaning if one views it as such. The Colonel looks backward in the novel to the horror and futility of war, which serves as a contrast to the extreme tenderness of his last love affair in Venice. Hemingway's experiences during the Spanish Civil War and in Paris during World War II give him much to draw upon in this literary \\"moveable feast,\\" which soubriquet first appears here. Against the harshness of his existence the Colonel has retreated to Italian duck blinds, Venice in winter and the adoring young beauty of his life. One senses that at this time in his life, so near the end, that Hemingway sees his own life's lapse into finality in lines from Stonewall Jackson's dying moments to cross peacefully over the river and into the trees. Hemingway is a master of dialogue and there is much between the Colonel and his young mistress to savor. I recommend that you read Old Man and the Sea, A Farewell to Arms and/or For Whom the Bell Tolls before taking on this novel. If you admire and have widely read Hemingway already, then this is a very fine but not great novel relative to his masterpieces. This is a compelling, accessible novel which subtleties will linger and perhaps the greatest aspect of the genius of his craft is that he never fails to have this same powerful impact."},{"Title":"ACROSS THE RIVER AND INTO THE TREES","review":"Interesting fact: The Hotel that the Colonel occupies in this noval is a real hotel called the Gritti Palace Hotel in Venice Italy, where rooms go for as much as 3,000 euros per night. The hotel was also built in 1525.Althought this was not the best work that I have read by Ernest Hemingway it is certainly a great noval. The story is of an \\"old\\" American Colonel who is revisiting the places in Europe that he believes has shaped his character and personality. The noval is set towards the end of World War Two. The Colonel fought in World War One and did much of his growing up on the battle field. When he goes to Venice, he meets up with his \\"last and true and only love\\", a young Venician Contessa named Renata. He is old enough to be her father, but they are madly in love. Her youthful exhuberence tends to revive him in his failing health as he is suffering from a sevier heart condition. She loves him with all of her heart and Hemingway's simple writing style takes the reader away from the somber tone of the actual situation to a more romantic genre. Even if Hemingway is supposed to be the \\"man's man\\" in literature, this noval is the closest thing that I have read to a love story without it being written from the perspective of women. It shows a man who is in the twilight of his life and who has learned to really appreciate the finer things that this world has to offer. Things such as a fine city or wine, or an expensive cut of meat and delicious cheese; even more important though is the beautiful young girl that adores him so much and that he loves in return. Personaly I enjoyed the book very much and I would recomend it to anyone who likes Hemingway's works."},{"Title":"ACROSS THE RIVER AND INTO THE TREES","review":"I just finished this book last night--I read it at one sitting, something I haven't done in a while with any book. I found the story quite moving and interesting. I guess if you like Ludlum and Cussler you might not find it exciting, but there are other kinds of excitement besides car crashes and airplanes exploding."},{"Title":"ACROSS THE RIVER AND INTO THE TREES","review":"The plot line is absurd: a 50 year old, war-ravaged, American colonel has an 18-year old girlfriend, a beautiful Italian countess who loves him unquestioningly. His health is failing so they spend their time together ever-conscious of approaching death. He has neither beauty, nor money, nor power, nor any great charm; he himself does not fully understand why she loves him so deeply. Nor do we.An absurd storyline can be accepted provided the author lays sufficient basis for it. Unfortunately Hemingway fails to provide us with enough reason why the girl would see past the great differences in their lives. Very near the end of the book, Hemingway tells us \\"that the girl loved him because he had never been sad one waking morning of his life\\". The statement has great promise for divining the meaning of the rest of the book, but the author fails to tell us, expressedly or impliedly, anything else about this idea.Hence, the girl never becomes anything more than a fantasy figure. She does not take shape as a separate person. We know her only in terms of her love for the colonel. Their conversation has an endearing, gentle quality to it, but it gives little clues as to the girl's feelings and motivations.However, the story has an autumnal mood that can be moving at times. Hemingway's prose captures the cold Venetian wind, the long slow gondola rides, the bitter hunting mornings. Venice seems at once the most poetic and lovely city in the world. Nevertheless, the story fails to overcome the reader's skepticism."},{"Title":"ACROSS THE RIVER AND INTO THE TREES","review":"Across the River and into the Trees is the story of an ill American colonel in post war Venice. He is \\"half-a hundred\\" years old and suffering from an incurable heart condition. He has an 18-year-old girlfriend. She is a wealthy Italian countess who likes to have sex with him in the back of a gondola on freezing cold nights... Yeah, right.If you can get past the absurdity of this central conceit there are some good points in this novel. There is a lovingly detailed description of Venice. If you've been there you will recognize the places Hemingway describes. There is a long account of duck hunting on a frozen marsh that is quite true to life. The forgotten tense situation in post-war Trieste, with the United States expecting a Soviet invasion at any moment, is convincingly presented. Hemingway also presents his unflinching opinions on some of great figures of World War II in Europe.Unfortunately the whole is not very good. The dialogue between the dying colonel and the teenage countess is painfully malapropos. His buddy-buddy relationship with the hotel workers at the Gritti Palace seems contrived. Worth reading only if you want to read every word the great man wrote."},{"Title":"ACROSS THE RIVER AND INTO THE TREES","review":"I didn't like this. I found much of it pointless and unnecessary. It was essentially the hero's encounter with the girl he loves but can't have (vintage Hemingway fare), where they rattle on about the Italian war (or is it WWII?) and bemoan their fate several times.Nothing much happens; there was no climax, no plot movement. The dialogue is plodding and unrealistic to the point of disbelief. In this I was especially disappointed, given Hemingway's usual skill with dialogue. It seems like a shadow of a novel. The kind of novel a tired, old man would sit down and write, a story not *about* the war but a story about a man looking back and talking about the war, in a very long-winded and obscure fashion to boot. It had no life or vitality to it ... and this lack seemed to reflect as much from the author as from the book itself."},{"Title":"ACROSS THE RIVER AND INTO THE TREES","review":"From a longer post about it on my 5cense blog:I didn't mind so much that it was slow & nothing happens, it's just i couldn't relate to Hemingway's tedious version of nothing--sitting around in bars ordering drinks & cooing in lovey-dovey baby-talk. Or hunting with other men, stewing, not speaking.

Strange city, beautiful young woman in love with a dying man (and what exactly is his problem?), and a bizarre few days during which no one really works or accomplishes anything except interacting with each other amid the strange time and place that Hemingway has placed them in. Typical of Hemingway, the writing makes you feel what the characters are feeling - so this time, instead of hunger or lust or fatigue, as in other novels, I developed a sympathetic headache while reading this one. This probably should not be your first exposure to Hemingway, as there are better known titles that support Hemingway's fame, but this belongs in the Hemingway canon."},{"Title":"ACROSS THE RIVER AND INTO THE TREES","review":"Set in Venice at the end of World War II, Hemingway tells a romantic and touching story of the love affair between a gruff 50 year old American colonel and Renata, a young and very pretty Italian contessa. Loss is a recurring theme--the death of many of the Colonel's subordinates in combat, the break-up of his earlier marriage to a career woman, and the severe injury to one of the Colonel's hands from which he suffers constant pain. The Colonel may also be dying and his time left with his young lover may be very short.What gives the novel so much poignancy and resonance is the great devotion Renata and the Colonel have for one another. Renata seeks to comfort the Colonel and implores him to relate to her the worst of his combat experiences so that he may relieve some of his bitterness. The Colonel lovingly calls Renata, \\"daughter.\\"Hemingway tells this tale in the deceptively simple, direct, and matter of fact style for which he is justly celebrated. I could have done without the duck hunting sequences and some of the Colonel's more obvious macho behavior, but Hemingway, being Hemingway, understandably could not.This is a lovely and sad story, filled with the yearnings of its two lead characters."},{"Title":"ACROSS THE RIVER AND INTO THE TREES","review":"This is a beautifully told short novel about a human spirit brutalized by war. Our colonel looks in the mirror and does not like what he sees: the face shaped by war. A part of him loves Venice, Italian art, American trees and, very much, his beloved. And it is tormented by the reflection in the mirror. He carries this pain all through the book, trying to alleviate it with a drink every few pages. He apologizes to civilians after addressing them in a brusque battleground manner. The emotional pain is reinforced by pain physical, which he is quenching with double doses of extra strength medicine. This multifaceted suffering is weighing on him. The slow steady pace of his thoughts stretching over long passages is only temporarily interrupted by the reviving rapid-fire \\"he said she said\\" dialogue with Renata. Beautiful Renata loves him for \\"never having been sad\\", for not being weighed down by his life. Meanwhile he mostly sees in himself a soldier, foreign to magnificent Venice, to peacetime civilians and in some ways to his love herself.The book evokes a painting suggesting a picture much larger than its frame. Beyond the frame lies his past, the history of his relationship with the countess, the development of his friendships with the Venetians and much more. It leaves an impression of a story told reluctantly: even our colonel's name we learn only on page 81. And yet the book finely portrays the profound sadness of war's dehumanizing effect. In this respect Ricardo is somewhat closer to Seymour from \\"A Perfect Day for Bananafish\\" than to Paul B&auml;umer from \\"All Quiet on the Western Front\\". The only complaint is about the primary colors: love and death, youth and old age, Beauty and the Brute. Hence 4 stars.Pain remains the book's leitmotif. The war is what kills our colonel, but more importantly the war is the ordeal with which he lives. War kills something inside even the best of us. This is a good thing to remember, especially in our age of building coalitions of the willing and appeals to support our wars."},{"Title":"ACROSS THE RIVER AND INTO THE TREES","review":"Hemingway's philosophy was always of the craftsman's ethic, his esthetic, and where many have chosen to see masculine brutality, perhaps misogyny, a truer reading is of the soldier (not the general, but the subordinate, and this is an important distinction) whose ideal is a job well done, no matter how small. If anything, this attitude is romantic, old fashioned, and infinitely gentle, and we see aspects of this almost religious regard for the expert's skill not only in Hemingway's heroes - the old man of the sea, for instance, or Robert Jordan who when his bell tolls reflects that \\"one thing well done can make...\\" - but in the very nature of the author's prose. In A Moveable Feast, and in The Garden of Eden, the author describes his toil to write \\"one true sentence.\\" And where Robert Jordan leaves off, Colonel Cantwell continues, and asks: \\"But will it matter?\\"This is the story of the battle-scarred soldier who returns to the scene of his sacrifice to convince himself of the answer.

A battered old Colonel, dying from heart disease, and a nineteen year old Venetian Countess.The story is written in Hemingway's trademark style - sparse dialogue, with much left unspoken, and deceptively simple, yet labyrinthine, sentences. The book begins with the main character - fifty year old Colonel Richard Cantwell - duck hunting on a cold winter morning in Trieste. I mention the Colonel's age here as mortality and the recapturing of youth are the main themes of the book.After the duck hunting scene, pretty much the entire rest of the book involves Colonel Cantwell relating the details of a weekend he spent with the nineteen Italian Countess, Renata. If the age gap were not uncomfortable enough for some, it is exacerbated by Cantwell constantly referring to Renata as 'daughter'.It's an odd old thing.Indeed, if you are not used to it, the directness of Hemingway's dialogue can come across as stilted and very strange. This stilted language, however, has a rhythm and a cadence that covers a multitude of inner worlds - each character communicating only what they feel safe to put words to.ACROSS THE RIVER AND INTO THE TREES may not be the best known, or most accessible of Hemingway's work, but if you want a lesson in the unsaid, a picture of Venice, or a grapple with mortality, it's a cracker."},{"Title":"ACROSS THE RIVER AND INTO THE TREES","review":"Shortly after the second war, Richard Cantwell, a 50 year old demoted General, knows he is dying, makes the journey to Venice, a city he has loved since the first war, to say his goodbyes.

He goes on one last duck shoot and recalls with bitterness the war just fought;the politically adept who became generals and avoided all the fighting and got all the glory despite their ineptitude causing many real soldiers to die,the parvenu of the day-all wartime profiteers, and of the three battalions he led to their death in an ill conceived assault on German defences....A book full of all the classic Hemingway themes-love life and death and what it takes to be a real man.Amidst all the unique Hemingway style, however,is his handling of love between a man and woman that-dare I say it- I always find wet and almost embarrassed to read. Its ok in small doses, but here you get a great dolop, and its often tedious to deal with to get to the Hemingway of 'To Whom the Bell Tolls' and his powerful description and aversion to the waste of war.If you have difficulty stomaching the 'wet' affair of Cantwell and Renata, put this down and pick up 'To Whom....'Then come back to this to absorb yourself in his more profound interludes in this."},{"Title":"ACROSS THE RIVER AND INTO THE TREES","review":"An old American Colonel, a veteran of war (although it is not clear whether it is the I or II World War), returns to Venice, his favorite, almost fetish-like city. There he has a romance with a 19-year old girl from high society. During those days, he continually remembers war episodes, especially one when he was severley hurt by a river's side. He and the girl roam around Venice, in a good-bye-like mood. Then the Colonel goes on in a duck-hunting expedition with some old Italian friends, and the plot develops to the end.There isn't much plot, though, and this late novel has been widely criticized as pure self-parody, and the macho remembrances of a now old man, proud of his romantic and hunting prowesses. The old warrior, hunter, fisher, adventurer, lover and drinking hero seems to portrait himself with great melancholy and homesickness, imagining yet another romance - an unbelievable one - with a much, much younger woman, who could easily have been his grand-daughter. Although the lovers' dialogues are too ensweetened, Hemingway gets away with transmitting the bittersweet feeling of a beautiful but ill-timed relationship, in the very face of death. And this is the true axis of the book: approaching death. Hemingway must have been toying with the idea of suicide at this time, for the feelings of loss, of one last retrospective look at pleasure, love, intimacy, and real-man friendship hunting by a lake are cruelly poignant in this, perhaps underrated, novel."},{"Title":"ACROSS THE RIVER AND INTO THE TREES","review":"\\"Across the River and into the Woods\\" is one of the least known of Hemingway's works. Considering the fact that it is far from his best this is understandable. Although the book is no Old Man and the Sea or For Whom the Bell Tolls it is still quite touching. It is set in post-war Northern Italy and tells the tale of a terminally ill American colonel and his last days. It follows him in his passionate hobby of duck hunting, eating, his relationship with an attractive 19 year old Italian and his many cynical views towards war and many of his fellow officers, especially those that did not actually fight. Quite touching and moving, although, again, definitely not an Old Man and the Sea or For Whom the Bell Tolls.Despite the fact that the book is fairly good (would give it a four star rating) the audiobook, on the other hand, leaves much to be desired. The main reason for this is the voice of the Colonel's 19 year old mistress. The audiobook makes her sound like a transvestite or a very old women instead. This greatly detracts from the pleasure of listening to the audiobook. Considering that a good deal of the book is in regards to the relationship between them, this is more than a minor nuisance (hence only a 2 star rating for the audio)."},{"Title":"ACROSS THE RIVER AND INTO THE TREES","review":"People always say &quot;It wasn't his best.&quot; True, but then &quot;not his best&quot; is far better than most. A simple yet, as with all Hemingway stories, deeply complex and aching look at life near its end. If you like Hemingway and appreciate his style, read the book with open heart and mind. It will put a warm, sad smile on your face"},{"Title":"ACROSS THE RIVER AND INTO THE TREES","review":"I think Hemingway wanted to do two things: (1) critique certain aspects of how WWII was fought (particularly the politicalization of battle plans); and (2) pay homage to his beloved Venice. To do so, he crafted a fairly thin story about an old soldier who finds himself in one last love with a girl a fraction of his age. The plot (to the extent there is one) and the relationship between the characters would probably make a nice short story. The bulk of the book is taken up by tourist writing about Venice (locales, architecture, food, markets, layout, and, of course, the canals) and a journalist's rants about US generals in WWII. Diehard Hemingway fans will find some jewels worth the read; others should stay away."},{"Title":"ACROSS THE RIVER AND INTO THE TREES","review":"This story is a trenchant allegory of the dream that every older man has of how to die. The protagonist, Richard Cantwell, knows--contrary to appearances--that he is ineffably near death in spite of taking medicine to mask the symptoms and delay the inevitable. The quixotic desiderata that make his last days ideal are: long-time friends (army buddies) with whom he can reminisce about shared travails; participation in a favored hobby (hunting ducks); great food, drink, and conversation; the sensual unquestioning love of a beautiful young woman (Renata, AKA &quot;Daughter&quot;); and the ignorance of all of his physical ailment. He even manages, in one last act of improbable masculine bravado, to physically best two young toughs who had taunted him and Renata. He, in banter with his cohort, revisits his past war life of greater glory, danger, and horror--a time when his life had significance. He finds that he is unable to impart his understanding of life to the innocence of Renata. He accepts his imminent demise, curses life's ironies, and lives as if tomorrow is assured but takes prudent precautions such as properly providing for the return of precious gems given to him by Renata. What more could an old man want in his last days?"},{"Title":"ACROSS THE RIVER AND INTO THE TREES","review":"Without going into details (since everyone else has done it so well), it's just a plain and simple good read. I think it's one of his best. And like all his works, it makes me feel like I have just walked out into the bright Latin sun."},{"Title":"ACROSS THE RIVER AND INTO THE TREES","review":"Easily Hemingway's worst book. After For Whom the Bell Tolls was published in 1940, Hemingway spent most of the 40s drinking more heavily than usual. In the late 40s he spent two or three years hanging about Venice with northern Italian upper crust types and was infatuated with a girl of about 21. He decided to write about this episode of his life and blend that story with the fact that he was closing in on a half-century in age. Result- disaster. The best thing about this novel is that Hemingway's pride was hurt by the withering storm of bad reviews from the critics. He wrote the gem The Old Man and the Sea a couple of years later and redeemed himself."},{"Title":"ACROSS THE RIVER AND INTO THE TREES","review":"There is something unseemly about an older man (50 years old) fantasizing about and having an affair with an 18-year-old woman (girl.) Hemingway almost pulls it off. The Colonel with his war wounds and reminiscences of many battles and campaigns is a likable and interesting character, solid and believable, but from the very start, I was uncomfortable about his pursuit of Renata. Yet if the billing and cooing had occurred between Renata and a young man of an age more suitable for her, it would have been boring because it would have been predictable. As it was, this reader squirmed a little only now and then. Mostly it worked. The Colonel's world view and the repartee between the two lead characters and between the Colonel and everyone else he meets, including those few he dislikes, keep the book interesting. And the girl, for 18, once referred to as a countess, is mature and worldly beyond her years. The pillow talk gets a bit tiresome at times, but the weakest of Hemingway's books is still far better than almost all of the other stuff that's out there today."},{"Title":"ACROSS THE RIVER AND INTO THE TREES","review":"Obviously written during a period when H. was in a retrograde orbit around his personal mythology; foreshadows his inability to make his aging present meaningfully co-exist with the exploits of his youth, both real and imagined; and is the victim of its own brutishly sentimental attempts to be anything but sentimental. Even though it's bad, it's bad in a way that only H. can be bad, which still makes it good, or at least better than most of the toilet treats passing for best-selling fiction these days. This was right before he re-captured the gold and glory with The Old Man and the Sea. H. was obviously trying to write himself out of depression, using his art to give him closure. The problem is, it mistakes yearning for honesty."},{"Title":"ACROSS THE RIVER AND INTO THE TREES","review":"Imagine yourself sitting in a white chair under a tree during autumn. The wind gently blowing on your face and the leaves touching you as they fall down from the tree. This is the moment you would want to read a soft yet powerful story. What better than Across the River and into the Trees by Ernest Hemngway. Set in Venice, Italy, this is love story of an Italian countess and an arrogant American colonel. Though unsure about their future, all that matters to them is their undying love for each other. As time passes by they encounter doubts about their getting married.Promises of marriage, a home and family is just one part of the story. Will empty promises be kept by the Colonel? Read on and you would know."},{"Title":"ACROSS THE RIVER AND INTO THE TREES","review":"The book is not Hemingway's best effort, and consequently has a reputation of being a mediocre, thinly-disguised autobiographical sketch.The parallels with Hemingway's real life are obvious: The hero is an American WWI vet who returns to Venice at midcentury and falls in love with a much younger woman. But so what? Aren't writers told to &quot;write what they know&quot;?The criticisms of this book chiefly stem from the fact that Hemingway wrote others that were better. But, judged on its own, it is an enjoya"},{"Title":"ACROSS THE RIVER AND INTO THE TREES","review":"I approached this novel with an open mind, considering that it had had bad reviews, and such reviews never are indicative of the quality and significance of a literary work. Having found Hemingway's novels (and his poetry) often superb and certainly riveting and entertaining, I was profoundly disappointed. This novel is slow reading. The main character, Cantwell, is fairly rude and egotistical, which makes it implausible that he should have a warm and loving relationship with anyone. The love interest -- Renata -- is moronic, even for an &quot;inexperienced&quot; nineteen year old. These two characters say I love you so often and in so many ways that it quickly becomes shallow and meaningless -- love is demonstrated, and that doesn't come across at all. Infatuation, perhaps, but never love. If you forget that this is a romance and focus on the mentality of an aging and terminally ill soldier, you get another view of the novel. It becomes even more tedious as Cantwell relates war story after war story. We've all endured this in real life, and in literature it is just as monotonous. The rudeness of Cantwell, his conceit over his little apres-war association of former comrades, the obsequiousness of the Italians, the complete lack of suspense, all make this a rather dull and insignificant read. The only saving grace is the character of Jackson, Cantwell's driver, who would have been a far better choice to be the protagonist of the novel, with us seeing all the behaviors of an aging warrior, his simpering acquaintances, and his silly girlfriend through his honest and contemporary perspective."},{"Title":"ACROSS THE RIVER AND INTO THE TREES","review":"I am a big fan of the writing of Ernest Hemingway and if you asked me to name his weakest novel, I would probably say Across The River And Into The Trees.The novel has some strong points like the narrative style and the descriptions of Venice but the heart of the book is the love affair between Richard Cantwell a 50 year old American army colonel with a bad heart and a 19 year old Venetian countess named Renata. Their love affair is uncompelling with stitled dialogue dominating. Renata seems so airheaded it is hared to imagine a hardnosed man like Cantwell being interested in her.Cantwell saves the book from being awful. The characters sense of his decline in health and other ways makes me think he might be what Hemingway might have thought of himself at this time. In the end Across the River is just an OK novel and considerably below par for the great Hemingway Ii is for people like me who want to read all of Hemingway regardless of how good it may be."},{"Title":"ACROSS THE RIVER AND INTO THE TREES","review":"This was - by far - Hemingway's worst book. Bad story, bad characters, bad dialog. Why does this 19 year-old countess care at all about this 50 year-old, ugly, divorced, poor, maimed, dying, bitter colonel? And despite 283 pages, all we get is a 2-dimensional cartoon character for the girl that he calls \\"Daughter.\\" And, worse than the ridiculous story was the inane dialogue.\\"I love you very truly.\\"\\"I love you very truly, too.\\"...\\"Don't think of anything. Don't think of anything at all.\\"\\"I'm not.\\"\\"Don't think.\\"\\"Oh please let's not talk.\\"\\"Is it right?\\"\\"You know.\\"\\"You're sure.\\"\\"Oh please not talk. Please.\\"Over and over again. It's not just that it was late in Hemingway's career (1950). He wrote \\"Old Man and the Sea\\" after this. And, written later still, \\"Dangerous Summer\\" and, certainly, \\"Islands in the Stream\\" were much better works."},{"Title":"ACROSS THE RIVER AND INTO THE TREES","review":"An old soldier on the edge of death in post-war Venices reminisces and romances a young lady he has no intention of winning. If you like Hemingway, the colonel is a pretty clear statement of what he's after. For better or worse the colonel is very alive in this book. Unfortunately the girl could easily have been replaced by a tape recorder. I've rarely found Hemingway romantic and this was not a change. The colonel's a piece of very tough old meat, but his attitude, even his bad attitudes seem to come pretty straight from Hemingway's heart. The girl, on the other hand, seems to be echoing the main character. Odd question, why is this man so much more alone in Venice than the fisherman in Old Man and the Sea."},{"Title":"ACROSS THE RIVER AND INTO THE TREES","review":"This book is really biographical and psychological to Hemingway. Which is why critics slammed the book, but I feel its unwarranted. The story (which critics say is implausible, which confuses me as today we have people meeting on the internet and getting married) is about a middle-aged General-demoted to Colonel Richard Cantwell and his relationship with an Italian woman Renata.Its biographical in that it recounts a love affair Hemingway really had with Adriana Ivancich and its psychological because it explains how growing old damages one's psyche as he realizes life is becoming a physical hardship and questions whether he can make that transition from being a strong-willed man full of machismo to and aging ever growing weaker man who will never reach that stature again. Why the scope is narrower than Hemingway's previous work of fiction published, it contains some of his best written passages and his own insecurities about his life. I can understand why it's slated but I hope other understand why I like it."},{"Title":"ACROSS THE RIVER AND INTO THE TREES","review":"si ya lo se, hemingway era parco en sus oraciones, pero este libro es de una hermosura exquisita aunque a algunas personas lo encuentren soso y sin trama definida. la trama es lo menos importante en este libro.son las emociones que genera, el encuentro del amor tardio, como el lector se interesa en la trama y se va envolviendo con los personajes, con el futil atento de el de amar aun cuando su cuerpo esta desgastado. a mi particularmente me encanto y hasta me lo encontre demasiado dulce para un escritor como hemingway acostumbrado a obras algo mas que secas y desprovistas de sentimientos o llenas de violencia. muy recomendado, les va a gustar ver a hemingway en otro aspecto de escritor.LUIS MENDEZluismendez@codetel.net.do"},{"Title":"ACROSS THE RIVER AND INTO THE TREES","review":"Not much happens in this book. Critics said it at the time, and Hemingway said, &quot;What do they mean, not much happens, why there are two wars, etc.&quot; Well he was referring to stuff that was obliquely referred to in dialogue. But I have to say, I enjoyed this book in retrospect after I took my first trip to Venice, and rode in a gondola, and had a drink in Harry's bar. I was glad I'd read the book, then. So if you go to Venice, read this first."},{"Title":"ACROSS THE RIVER AND INTO THE TREES","review":"I am a big fan of Hemingway, and For Whom the Bell Tolls and A Farewell to Arms are two of my favourite novels, but this book was simply terrible. Firstly, there was no plot. I kept waiting for something to happen, and nothing did. Secondly, the dialogues between Cantwell and Renata are boring and highly unrealistic. Realism has always been Hemingway's strength, but he seems to have lost it in this novel. And finally, the whole effect is extremely boring. There is no story, no action, no life.I couldn't wait for this book to end so that I could read something interesting instead. My advice to you is - read a lot of Hemingway, but don't touch this one."},{"Title":"ACROSS THE RIVER AND INTO THE TREES","review":"I happen to like Hemingway, having read most of his novels, short stories, as well as Green Hills of Africa. While his lean style and powerful undercurrent of emotions make novels such as The Sun Also Rises unforgettable, this book epitomizes everything that was flawed in Hemingway's later writings.The book is pure drivel. The dialogue is stilted, the setting (Venice) is not effectively portrayed, and there is a noticeable lack of action. The protagonist, The Colonel, is an older, sick hero of two wars who has reunited with a much younger, wealthy lover in Venice. He is a proud and noble man, and I think Hemingway is trying here to portray the character's anguish at his lost youth and his inability to live in the virile fashion of a typical Hemingway male. However, if you want understatement and concise dialogue with real human emotions, read the novels of Howard Norman like the Bird Artist or The Museum Guard. If you like Hemingway and want better examples of his later period, stick to A Moveable Feast or even Green Hills of Africa, at least they are entertaining and have actual stories to tell. I still think that Hemingway's short stories and his first novel, The Sun Also Rises, represent the author at the peak of his creative powers. Across the River and Into the Trees is painful to read, and is only given a bit of literary attention due to the reputation of the author. An Amazon reviewer encouraged readers to read the book slowly with music playing - why not just close the lights and listen to the music?"},{"Title":"ACROSS THE RIVER AND INTO THE TREES","review":"I've just finished reading this book, and though I am a great fan of Hemingway, I found this book lacking in something. The love that the two characters of this novel share is probably hard for most people to relate to in the first place, simply because of the more than thirty years difference between their ages. But beyond that, I find that the love that these two find for each other hard to believe given how well they know each other, and that they have only spent an extremely limited time together (we see them together for only about a day and a half in the story).The language between the two is also quite exhausting. While Hemingway writes very simple prose, and it works well in many of his works, here it becomes very repetitive.If you can really believe that two characters such as this can find love that strong in each other then this book is otherwise a fine read. The story, of course, focuses on the love the two share and the failing health of the man. The two concern themselves with their love for each other (in every other sentence) and what they will do to remember the other when they are apart. Both know, but speak of it infrequently, that any moment together may be the last.If you are looking to read some Hemingway for the first time, I would suggest The Old Man and the Sea. However, if you are simply looking to read some more obscure Hemingway, this book certainly isn't a bad read."},{"Title":"ACROSS THE RIVER AND INTO THE TREES","review":"This novel flopped with the critics but I think it is nearly perfect. It has the jewelled sculptured quality of his short stories and is full of symbolistic harmonies. The only defect is the death of the colonel at the end which looks clumsy and detracts from the art of it."},{"Title":"ACROSS THE RIVER AND INTO THE TREES","review":"This is a book meant, like most of Hemingway, to be read slowly. Originally received with mixed reviews, now unhesitatingly dismissed, it is his most culturally rich, most allusionistic, most finely structured novel. And the one most subject to crude and hasty misinterpretation. Some of the chapters read as beautifully as the finest short stories, though the cynicism and wisdom of age now simmers and seathes beneath them. In old Europe where the May-September marriage is not considered perverse, where smug American market-aggression and cultural vacuity are givens, where the destruction of the war still (then) dominates everyone's daily reality, where the loss of the WW II generation - though less celebrated - was far more devastating; in other words, where the contextual fits and insights are better appreciated, this book fits and comprehensively glows. It is his best on art history and culture, on mortality, on bureaucracy and antiestablishmentarianism, rich (som! etimes prophetic) in military history and political contemporaneity, and dotted with numerous literary judgments, often savage in the Colonel's self-educated bombast (but not contraty to Hemingway's beliefs). The schizoid extremes of the Colonel constitute Hemingway's perhaps most profound personal portrait anywhere; the dawning intelligence, quiet dignity, and intelligent denials of Renata are anything but &quot;accommodating cardboard female,&quot; as so many are wont to hastily claim. The cross generational allegory and the very concern about how generations feed each other lie well beyond the ken of wise-a** critics and p-c faddists, but ring sadly relevant to the displacement we see so clearly now fifty years later. An extremely well structured, beautifully descriptive, at times savagely satirical, but sadly lonely book set in historically mystic and unapologetically byzantine, old-tough Venice - after modern war. It is the acculturated- (though unpolished-), survivin! g-warrior sequel to For Whom the Bell Tolls, wiser now in t! he bombed out European aftermath. It is personal and universal at the same time in its profound regret, deep reverence for life, and cantankerous but accepting self assessment. Read it slowly, carefully, luxuriatingly. Innure yourself against the colonel's cliche's and bluster (he is not a fancy speech former, but he is groping after central value and meaning, however suspect in post modern parlance), consider Renata more carefully than nations raised on Hollywood's idiotic icons can - see HER management of Cantwell - and you will come away breathless, knowing the only thing that prevents you from getting more out of the book is the time you wish to allow before reading it again. The elegaic, autumnal beauty alone will bring the poetic reader back."},{"Title":"ACROSS THE RIVER AND INTO THE TREES","review":"Exactly what sort of book would one expect from a writer who had just written &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot;? I don't know either, but probably not this hushed, elegiac novel. It's not the brooding melancholy of &quot;Across the River and Into the Trees&quot; itself that's surprising - it's that the book contains no action and no climax of pretty much any sort, and that it still manages to be so good.Essentially, the book is the restless consciousness of one Richard Cantwell, Colonel in the United States Army, veteran of two world wars, recipient of many grave wounds, who is travelling through Europe one last time to shoot some ducks, meet some old friends, and spend a couple of days with his last, real and only love, a nineteen-year-old (!) countess named Renate. The book is aptly titled - it flows like a quiet old river, slowly but surely and a bit sadly. Like many a Hemingway hero, Cantwell is stuck with an empty existence, a profession he doesn't much care for, and awareness of both of the above. Love Renate though he does, he lives in the past, constantly reliving this and that battle, moving imaginary troops one minute, then wondering about the meaning of it all the next.Renate herself is the least realistic of all Hemingway women, and as a female lead she's poor indeed. That is not, however, the way she should be seen. She is described as having almost unworldly gentleness and purity, an enormous contrast to the colonel (esp. given her youth). In a way, she becomes almost a symbol of the youth the colonel has irrevocably lost, an epitome of everything he missed out on - and the stories of the battles he tells her become almost like religious confessions. In the end, Cantwell ruefully realizes that he cannot tell her everything, that she could not possibly understand all the sorrows he suffered and never was freed from, that he thus cannot be redeemed, and the book ends on a funereal note.Lack of action notwithstanding, the poignant, honest self-analysis and wistful tone make this book beautiful in the same way a stately, quiet funeral dirge is. Cantwell is likely Hemingway's most autobiographical character - indeed, we get further inside his head than we did in Jake Barnes's, or Robert Jordan's, or Harry Morgan's - and probably well reflects Hemingway's own state of mind at the time. In the long mental soliloquys about politics, Europe, war and life in general, the line between author and character disappears. Indeed, it's difficult to imagine an American officer (of such rank) thinking in such terms - no, this is Hemingway himself, writing down his thoughts and feelings and donning a colonel's uniform for the occasion. And if you felt like that, you might well have come to the same conclusion the author did."},{"Title":"ACROSS THE RIVER AND INTO THE TREES","review":"This novel encapsulates all the frustrations of late Hemingway. It begins well, but lapses rapidly into sollipsism and self-parody. Just when the reader has his arm cocked to hurl it across the room, the novel improves; and just when the reader leans forward, savoring the Hemingway prose and waiting for what happens next, it goes bad again.Like The Garden of Eden and Islands in the Stream, Across the River and Into the Trees contains wonderful elements that are worthy of the best Hemingway but it is marred by a central flaw: There seems to be no compelling reason for the book to exist other than to update Hemingway's personal mythology.Hemingway's early work was powered by several powerful elements: the author's willingness to face hard realities unflinchingly and without romanticism; and an ability to frame his characters' situations so that they took on the force of universal metaphors.Alas, in this novel, flashes of the old brilliance can't overcome the main character's self-absorption and his creator's wishful thinking.And yet . . . and yet . . . after I finished rereading Across the River and Into the Trees, I went to a bookstore and found that all the books I examined looked slight by comparison.And the next day I found my emotions were very close to the surface, proof, I think, that Hemingway's power to move his readers and embed archetypal themes in his narratives persisted despite his decay.Very strange."},{"Title":"ACROSS THE RIVER AND INTO THE TREES","review":"I don't know why everyone is apt to be so sure this book is weak or sentimental. It's a difficult subject, what people call a tough ask; Hemingway is trying to describe the last luminous moments of a love that knows itself to be both utterly transcendant and also doomed. I think he succeeds, because the love scenes and their clumsiness and cliches and groped-for words are intespersed with thickly jargon-laden and nearly incomprehensible war recollections and also with perhaps the most radiant descriptions of Venice ever written (yes, better than Mann or Ruskin or James); the one of the Rialto market is especially powerful. This love has a place and a time; it's therefore also about the impossibility of even the purest love fully transcending these.I am tired of eveyrone saying tsk tsk about Renata's age; surely this is simply realistic? Old alpha males do like young girls, and young girls are the only ones gentle and honest and tender enough to bother with alpha males as grumpy and difficult as the colonel. He knows this himself. And at nineteen you don't set limits on your own generosity as you do later. That's lovely to remember, even if you also remember what it turned out to cost you. Renata is not stupid just because she is not feisty or assertive or spunky. I am tired of the conflation of strength with these traits. The literary portrayal of women has become a kind of anxious hymn to restless self-assertion. Can't there also be women with more self-belief? Try this book and see if you think there can; I can guarantee that it's beautiful even if you end up disliking its content."},{"Title":"ACROSS THE RIVER AND INTO THE TREES","review":"This was surprisingly my favorite Hemingway story in recent years. Readers in search of the typical bravado, bullfights and war scenes will be in for a shock. The dialogue between the main characters is really what drives this.The novel is about the story of an army colonel finding the love of his life too late to enjoy her. It contains the bittersweet pain of a premature ending that all will know comes too soon. Both the colonel and his young countess realize they are on borrowed time, and Hemingway shares the pain with his readers. The foreshadowing is reminiscent of &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; although it is not an action oriented novel per say.Also touching is the undertone of a loving friendship built between the colonel and the staff at his favorite hotel. There too, the dialogue is at it's finest. You can read the care between old comrades, and feel the spirit of their kinship.Read it expecting romantic dialogue intertwined with the pains of love, and you will enjoy it. Read it looking for the big game hunting or submarine search and you'll be disappointed."},{"Title":"ACROSS THE RIVER AND INTO THE TREES","review":"Almost all of Hemingway's tales include the loss of love, hope, and/or life. His novels are very well written but can be depressing. This novel was written in his later years and I think the hard-lived colonel it details is a depiction of Hemingway himself. He must have felt that his life was soon over and he learned to love at all the wrong times. The book was excellent however and did a worthy job of capturing average simple conversions in a colloquial type of manner."},{"Title":"ACROSS THE RIVER AND INTO THE TREES","review":"Surely one of Ernest Hemingway's most memorable novels, Across the River and Into the Trees, is the touching story of love that comes too late.First released in 1950 the novel covers three days in the life of Cantwell, a retired Army officer. He is now 50-years-old and has returned to the place where he nearly lost his life during World War II. Cantwell is a bitter man, feeling that he was unfairly demoted after losing a major part of his brigade during a forest battle. He was actually following orders, and believes the Army simply needed someone to blame and chose him.He spends his time in Venice dictating his memoirs, railing against top brass - Eisenhower, Patton, Montgomery. He also becomes involved in a love affair with a 19-year-old girl. This character is said to be based, at least in part, on a young girl Hemingway met when he visited Venice in 1948.For those unfamiliar with the story, there'll be no spoilers here by revealing the ending. Suffice it to say it is both moving and memorable.It's thrilling to hear voice performer Boyd Gaines read. The opening lines \\"They started two hours before daylight, and at first, it was not necessary to break the ice across the canal as other boats had gone on ahead.\\" set the stage for a remarkable performance. Gaines is an experienced award-winning stage, film, and television performer, and he brings this wide range of experience to his audio narration resulting in a stunning rendition of this classic tale.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"ACROSS THE RIVER AND INTO THE TREES","review":"Again, I see why Ernest Hemingway is adored by so many. This story of an old Army Colonel in love with a wealthy young woman is quite moving. The realism is excellent. I won't give the book away but the emotional depth of this book is outstanding. I would recommend this book not only to Hemingway readers but to all those hopeless romantics out there."},{"Title":"ACROSS THE RIVER AND INTO THE TREES","review":"This story is set in Venice a few years after World War II, the main character is (former) US Army colonel Robert Cantwell. Col. Cantwell is a veteran of the European campaign and commanded an infantry regiment during the war, and is now dying of a heart condition. This story is the tale of his last few days. There are two main threads to this story. First, Col. Cantwell reflects on his life as a soldier, what he has seen, what he has done, and his regrets. He is somewhat angry and embittered, but is trying hard to put these emotions behind him. Second, this is a love story as Col. Cantwell has fallen in love with a young Venetian girl. He is experiencing true love probably for the first time in his life. He was married once previously, although that relationship ended poorly.This is an introspective tale, and there is very little \`action' in this story (I would say virtually none). It is really a character study of a man who has seen more than most men should, who is undergoing a great transformation through the love of the young woman Renata, but who ultimately realizes that he and his relationship are doomed by his age and failing health. I loved this story and thought it was one of the top novels written by EH, although judging from some of the other reviews, there are clearly many that felt otherwise. This is not, generally, considered to be one of EH's best works. This book is also an homage to Venice (I would love to have the means to lounge around the city as Cantwell and Renata do in this novel!), and it is a vehicle for EH to comment on the European War and some of the principal actors.I found this to be a wonderfully engaging tale, better than some of the nominal EH classics. EH has wonderfully captured the emotions and regrets of Col. Cantwell. My enthusiastic opinion is not uniformly shared, however, and this book should be approached with caution. I think the reason that this novel is not generally loved is that there is virtually no \`action'. This is an introspective story from start to finish. If you are new to EH and looking to read your first novel, you should not start here."},{"Title":"ACROSS THE RIVER AND INTO THE TREES","review":"This is my favorite Hemingway novel, and the one which I find myself re-reading time and again.It is one of my own convictions that certain novels are best read at a certain age; for this reason, I have never picked up a J.D Salinger novel because by the time I learned or heard that he was well worth reading, the age at which I think I could have exacted the most from his work had long since passed me by. Truman Capote said something similar about Thomas Wolfe (with the exception that Capote actually read Wolfe).This is a book for those who have lived, by any but the most generous of reckonings, over half their life. I do not think I need to recount the plot: in its essence it is the ill-fated love of an older man and a much younger woman. It is certainly not the best-received of Hemingway's books; and indeed there are those which carry a greater weight: THE SUN ALSO RISE, A FAREWELL TO ARMS, FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS, and THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA.But most of us can identify only vicariously with Jake Barnes and Henry and Robert Jordan and the Old Man. Maybe the Old Man has the most resonance with us, because we all participate in the myth of Sisyphus, whether we cloak it in the pious delusions of religion or not.But we all experience growing old, the remembrances of past glories and struggles and, if we are truly lucky -- or wish to be -- find ourselves wishing for or actually experiencing that blessed second wind that is the refreshing exhileration of a new-found love.And that is the particular magic of this book. Moreover, it is Hemingway's great culinary and epicurean sense of food and drink, of landscape and water, that gives this book an even greater charm.To be sure, not many critics liked it. But by the time that Papa wrote it, my hunch is that the majority of the critics had tired of Hemingway: more to the point, they were jealous of his hithertoo unmatched success, and what could be more tempting than to project their own insufficiencies onto a work that perhaps hit too close to home?Read it, and judge for yourself."},{"Title":"Surviving the Secret","review":"For years I kept my secret.

The authors clearly define and explain sexual abuse issues as well as give scriptural references to explain God's role in our healing process.

This book will bring you closer to God and healing in the process."},{"Title":"Passion's Legacy","review":"This story is set right at the beginning of the Victorian era in England and concerns a group of women who are trying to lead unconventional lives in a period that only allows a woman a very conventional role. It opens with Sarah discovering, after twenty-two years of thinking rather highly of herself, that she is the illegitimate daughter of her uncle's dead sister. Suddenly, her prospects in this society are very different and it causes her to flee her uncle's home to find someplace where she can figure out what to do about this. Along the way, she is rescued at a tavern by Lady Augusta Pym and invited to visit with her on her estate. Sarah quickly develops an attraction for Augusta which she doesn't immediately understand, but which becomes clearer as she learns more about Augusta, the life she has led and her unusual group of friends. If you like Jane Austen's books, this is rather like a lesbian coming of age story set in one of her backgrounds. It's pleasant and quick reading."},{"Title":"Passion's Legacy","review":"Here's what you do: 1. Buy this book. 2. Set it aside until a long, rainy afternoon presents itself. 3.

It's a colorful fun book that is great to add your library!"},{"Title":"Martin Eden","review":"MARTIN EDEN follows the rise and fall of a young sailor who by sheer force of will educates himself and succeeds in becoming a famous writer (this is London's autobiographical novel, published in 1909, when he was thirty-three and the most popular living writer in the world). Few readers liked it then, they found it dark and depressing after a certain point; they wanted the entertainment they were used to from London (&quot;Come on, Jack, give us another story with dogs and snow in it!&quot;). Not as many read it now as should, and London himself disdained the fact that it inspired many young writers without talent to follow Martin Eden's example. But it is also a valuable story about a young man maturing in his conception of love as regards the opposite sex:\\"Ambition soared on mad wings, and he saw himself climbing the heights with her, pleasuring in beautiful and noble things with her. It was a soul-possession he dreamed, refined beyond any grossness, a free comradeship of spirit that he could not put into definite thought.\\" -- The youth becomes a man.London's prose is straightforward and vibrant, much like the author at his best. Martin Eden falls victim to the vicissitudes of his fame and fortune, much like the author at his worst (too much hard living is often given as the reason for London's death at forty). London spends a lot of time in this book criticizing American materialism in the way that materialism ought to be criticized. He also displays a certain kind of American work ethic (five hours of sleep a night, perseverance through failure, etc.) that sometimes doesn't know what to do with itself once it achieves success. We should all have that problem--just hope that we deal with it better than young Martin Eden does. A very worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Martin Eden","review":"\\"Martin Eden\\" is my fifth foray into the works of Jack London. Although I don't find the excitement within that was apparent in \\"Sea Wolf,\\" the passion is certainly evident. I have read that \\"Martin Eden\\" inspired more bad writers to sequester themselves with paper and pencil in unheated attics than any other book, and it is easy to determine why. Eden's obsession with learning and then creating the immortal printed word -- after falling for a woman above his class in society/socialist-conscious San Francisco -- is a powerful force that London expounds convincingly. Then, without warning, the sage advice \\"be careful what you wish for, it may come true,\\" rears its ugly head. London also includes a line about ghosts that should be a classic, but isn't, and his description of a suicide ranks as the best of its kind. A WORD OF WARNING: Do not read the foreward until after. It tells too much of the story and robs some of the author's intended suprises. This is unforgivable. May the publisher rot in hell."},{"Title":"Martin Eden","review":"If you are looking for pleasant summer reading, pass this one by. It ain't pretty and it ain't pleasant, but it ranks as one of the Great American novels of all time. Was it autobiographical? You betcha. More so than most airbrushed autobiographies of our time. Jack London was the first author to awaken in me the love of the printed word. I was 9 years old. The title that awakened me was Call of the Wild. I, like Marcia and everyone else, thought that Jack London was just an aborigine, wandering around in the vast metropolis and utterly lost. Years later I read The Sea Wolf, and my opinion changed.I no longer thought of Jack as an aborigine, but as a refined young man, rudely abducted from the civilized world and forced to accept the law of the strongest. Later still, I read Martin Eden, and I was devastated by the tortured visions of that same young man who was tranfigured by that experience and who was no longer acceptable as a member of civilized society. There's a whole lot of bitterness in Martin Eden, folks! And, the more I read of Jack's life, the more I am convinced that it is autobiographical. The fact is that Jack became a monster. At the same time, he became the most successul novelist of his time. In terms of money, we can only gasp at the financial success he enjoyed. He turned out novel after novel, and each of them was gobbled up by a hungry public. In the end, the SAME PEOPLE who had rejected him because of his crude mannerisms and calloused knuckles sought him out because of his MONEY. Do you really want the brutal truth about Jack London? And are you really prepared to weep for one of America's great sons? If so, then read Martin Eden. Otherwise, pass it by."},{"Title":"Martin Eden","review":"In Martin Eden, Jack London provides the portrait of a young man who thirsts for knowledge, for self-improvement, to join the upper ranks of the intelligent and cultured within his society. We seem to be setting off in a \\"Jude the Obscure\\" direction. Martin loves a young woman from this society, and strives to make himself worthy. His chosen vehicle from his class and station to hers is self-education, and then the writing of serious and important work. Along the way, Martain has to swallow the unpleasant truth that those he believed to be so intelligent were actually entirely superficial in understanding. Pieces of London from other novels come through. London's belief in the \\"superman\\" comes through, as well as his disdain for the oligarchs, for example. What is most striking, however, is the dead-on skewering of celebrity worship. \\"Where were you when I needed you\\" might be Martin's refrain. The same people who ignored and derided him suddenly can't get enough of him. Why? He was the same person he was before. It was simply because other people told them so. They all just want a piece of the celebirty, to be associated with him somehow. While in real life London of course courted celebrity, the stupidity of this is blindingly apparent and even more important nearly a century later. London readers may miss the absence of the \\"Charmian\\" strong female counterpart in this book (unlike in the Sea Wolf or The Abysmal Brute or Mutiny on the Elsinore, for example). The \\"classy\\" love interest doesn't measure up in terms of independent intelligence or strength of will, and her last appearance is particularly troubling. Lizzie, from the lower socioeconomic classes, has the spark but is too held back by her upbringing. This is truly an important book."},{"Title":"Martin Eden","review":"This definitely isn't the type of a book I would expect from Jack London but in my opinion should be regarded higher in achievement of his work, even more than &quot;Call of The Wild.&quot; While &quot;Call of the Wild&quot; is just concerned with the Spencerian and Darwinian 'Survival Of The Fittest' side of Jack London; &quot;Martin Eden&quot; represents the many sides of London: The poet, lover, seaman, self-willed individualist, philosopher, socialist and tormented writer. After reading &quot;Martin Eden,&quot; all I can say I am angered that this book isn't considered an American classic. I would say it is in rival with Eugene O'Neill's finest moments.I do not want to dwell so much on the plot because I do admit the plot is nothing new but it is the writing that counts. Simply put it, it is about a seaman who gets turned onto the world of class and literature and rigorously fights for mastering both worlds by spending all hours of the day and being frugal with money to achieve his dreams. As we later see, Martin Eden realizes the falsehoods of The American Dream and Individualism. While the back of the book claims that this book is an attack on Individualism, that is very curious because Jack London himself aside from being a Socialist, was an individualist and adapted the Nietzchean idea of Will to Power. This book was written around the time of &quot;The Iron Heel&quot; so I suspect London was going through his socialist days. This is such great writing that I would never consider myself an individualist but I felt myself throughout the book inspired of Martin Eden's will power and ambition. As a writer, I wanted to send my work to magazines after reading &quot;Martin Eden.&quot;&quot;Martin Eden&quot; is truly an American masterpiece of Literature and should be more widely read. Anyone who still thinks Jack London is a writer for kids and Darwinists must read &quot;Martin Eden&quot; and you shall see that his was an indispensable writer in all regards."},{"Title":"Martin Eden","review":"This is the American version of \\"Hunger\\" - an author striving to succeed despite background and social status. There is desolation within this text, a longing fraught with energy unbound. The pulse of desires roars here. Eden is the near-transparent mask of the young Jack London himself. Reading it, the educated reader will be reminded of the philosophies of Nietzsche, Herbert Spencer and Schopenhauer. Social Darwinism, the Will-to-Live, the Will-to-Power all resonate here.But in the long run, the philosophies are just part and parcel of the story. \\"White Fang\\" and \\"Call of the Wild\\" are excellent books, easily accessible. London, in my mind, is the Great American Author because his writing doesn't exclude readers, young and old can enjoy him. As for this work, \\"Martin Eden\\", it is a dark horse compared to his earlier works, perhaps prophetic of Jack London's later life.If anything, this novel is about success, its consequences, and what we sacrifice to achieve it. It also concerns the inner madness of attaining a goal, how nothing else seems important. Books will come go, but this book continually moves with me, a perennial home on my library shelf."},{"Title":"Martin Eden","review":"I think that every book falls into one of a few different catagories. It either sucks, is entertaining, or changes your perspective. &quot;Martin Eden&quot; ranks in the highest of all posible catagories for changing my perspective. I tried to read Jack London on a number of occasions and just couldn't get into him. His stories would rate as entertaining at best. I don't know why I picked up Martin Eden, but will forever be grateful to the forgotten soul who recommended it. Martin Eden is different because of what is barely under the surface. In my opinion, it's less a story than a philosophy. After I read it for the first time, I was struck by the parallel to Plato's &quot;Allegory of the Cave.&quot; In it, Plato warns of the price of enlightenment. Once you have seen the light, you can never go back to seeing things the was you did before. You will isolate yourself from everyone. Plato seems to say that ignorance is bliss, and London seems to agree. In the novel, Martin is stricken with the desire to ascend in class stature after meeting a high-class, late 19th Century San Fransisco family. He is enamored with the ease with which they debate social politics and wants to attain what he first sees as their level of intelligence. His vehicle for attaining their acceptance is to become a writer. To enrich his meager knowledge of these subjects he becomes an arduous reader of everything that he can get his hands on. In the process, he comes to realize that he has gained a true understanding of liturature and social philosophy, whereas everyone else merely talks with a false air of understanding. At one point he realizes that, in his quest to become an intellectual equal, he has surpassed them. It is after his meteoric climb in intellect that he realizes that he is alone. He also realizes that the people he so eagerly sought to emmulate did not shun him because of his lack of intellect (for their own intellect was merely a thin veneer), but because of his lack of money. In his separate but related quest to become a successful writer, he is frustrated by every publisher's inability to &quot;get&quot; his ideas. His inability to publish, despite his hard work, leads his love interest, high-born and condescending, to abandon him. She has no faith in his ability to achieve fame as a writer and he has no disire to settle down into a 9 to 5 job to placate her socialite parents. After some time apart, he does succeed in getting published, and not unlike the breaking of a dam, fame and fortume follow soon after. Upon learning of his fame, she comes running back, ready to make him the centerpiece for conversation at her family's socialite dinner parties. He rejects her and tries to return to the companionship of his earlier days as a sailor. Like in Plato's story, he finds that he cannot rekindle the bond that he once had with old friends, and is alone.While the story is an interesting case study into the nature of intellect and society, it is also a looking glass into the social scene in a major city during the turn of the century. The reader learns that the beat poets were around long before Kerouac and Ginsburg. This story is full of information -- social, political, historical, and intellectual. Read it."},{"Title":"Martin Eden","review":"If there's such a thing as an American canon, this book should be there. Everytime I recommend this book to a friend, they ask, \\"Who's it by?\\" \\"Jack London.\\" \\"Jack London! The author of call of the wild?\\"Well, yes. He's the one, but wait!, this book is like nothing else Jack London has ever written, and bears scant semblance to his Sea Wolf or Call of the Wild. In short, this is serious literature (advance apologies to Call of the Wild and Sea Wolf fans), and it's worth reading.This book reminded me a lot of Edith Wharton's Ethan Frome (another wonderful book). Both begin with hope, engage in change, and end in pathos. Martin Eden is a self-educated, self-made man (see why I say it should be in the American canon?) who attempts to garner the love of a young college student who pushes him out of what she sees to be his stifling chrysalis and become more like her and her fellow intelligentsia. The plot thickens when he does not only this, but surpasses them all in erudition with a passionate, eager mind, a more eager heart, and lots of hard work, all in the name of love. And then in the book's climax, he decides to ... oh, I can't tell you that. You'll hate me, and I'll ruin the book for you.What I can tell you, however, is that if you go to a bookstore, and pay full price for this book, you'll love it and feel that you've gotten a good bang for your buck. If you get it at a discount, you'll walk away feeling as though you've five-finger discounted this little gem.Read it ... you'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"Martin Eden","review":"Martin Eden is a young man who wants nothing more that to be accepted by (and to be like) the young, educated rich he sees as a struggling writer in turn-of-the (20th) century Northern California.Martin is certain that once in the ranks of these beautiful people (who speak in casual conversation of Greek myth and French poetry), he will finally be happy...He uncomfortably accepts the rude comments from these rich snobs, resolves to rise to their level and falls in love with a woman he feels is as a goddess walking the Earth...His true education comes swiftly:He \\"makes it\\" as a writer, and the man once seen as an interesting ape is now the talk of the town...It's the petty shallowness of the glittering world he had admired from afar that he's utterly unprepared for.This is a story of a person climbing the fence to the greener grass and finding it was all an illusion....and that he has nowhere else to go.Not a pretty picture, but very well painted by Mr. London."},{"Title":"Martin Eden","review":"It's surprising that London is so well known for his writings about nature while a classic like Martin Eden is practically forgotten. Here London shows that he is equally adept at setting a story in an urban landscape by chronicling a landed sailor's attempt to become a self-taught writer, no easy task for a man who has lived the rough and vulgar life of a sailor. But Martin is extremely persistent in spite of all the obstacles he faces. Everyone including his friends, family, and classy girlfriend question his ability to make such a transformation from a nobody to a somebody. It's hard to imagine anyone being as devoted as Martin is to improving himself, and it's a bit intimidating seeing how much devotion it can take to achieve your dreams. Knowing that London used his own life story as a strong inspiration for Martin Eden, you expect that Martin will someday be successful, yet the results of all his work are still unexpected. With enough reading, learning, and life experiences, do we all eventually take Martin Eden's point of view? That's a question this book still has me thinking about months later."},{"Title":"Martin Eden","review":"While living for a year in the former Soviet Union, I was often told that a favorite professor's or respected friend's most-admired author was -- Jack London. When I responded that he was known only vaguely by my generation as an adventurer and a ruffian, my Soviet friends gently shook their heads and regarded me as an ignoramus.My spotty education aside, I did recall London only carelessly through some snaggly-toothed wolf in a novel of his, read in junior high and not afterwards. Nearly a year after I'd returned to the states, I still hadn't re-read London, and had left my comrades' advice somewhere to rot in a long mental list of &quot;Authors I Must Some Day Read.&quot;On my birthday, then, I was strolling through book-store aisles with my boyfriend, trying helplessly to choose just one tome for a special gift. Hillman? Oh, no. I'll buy that myself, regardless. Nietzshce's &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra?&quot; As a birthday gift? Too silly.London's name cropped up into my mind, only half-so, and I dug vigorously through the L's until I came up with his &quot;Martin Eden.&quot;&quot;Martin Eden&quot; is a beautiful book -- not granted its proper throne in history.I'm not sure if London was pre-judged as an adventurer, if readers really didn't challenge themselves to dip below his surface - I'm no literary historian - or if, perhaps, if his politics played a role...it's silly to speculate.Regardless, &quot;Eden&quot; is a daring - if not entirely successful - critique of modern philosophy's most potent force: Nietzshce. It's also a historical novel, a coming-of-age, and a wealth of human insight. His big finish is, yes, overstated. Perhaps because he didsn't ultimately triumph over Nietzsche. But he gives a good right hook and a terrific read.Editor's note: Enough to rouse a former student and former reader back to a voracious love affair with words.Here's to Jack London! Cast aside by my generation, may his wild socialist self rise again!"},{"Title":"Martin Eden","review":"I loved \\"sea wolf\\" but didn't really understand why until I read Martin Eden a few weeks later; then instantly, at the unwanted ending of Martin Eden, I saw the dying of Wolf Larsen as the necessary end of a life of transformation. I can't think of this book without seeing the enforced slavery and punitive changes in the \\"second critic of America\\" on the sealing ship as an allegory for Jack London's own painful and wilful revolution into an author, and so as a variant of Martin Eden.As Larsen and his first mate struggle for life on the deck of the derelict Ghost, it is a foregone conclusion that the writer and critic will triumph, since Wolf is really trying to kill himself and cannot, even after passing the best of himself and his knowledge and experience into these alien hands.In \\"sea wolf\\" Jack London triumphs as a writer only by destroying his primitive self and uniting with a female alter ego. In Martin Eden, Jack shows that he really is only Wolf Larsen at heart, and cannot under any circumstances break away from his past without destroying himself.Ah, some things are not worth their price.Read these two books together, in any order, and preferrably in several orders to discover America and yourself, if you had to give up anything to grow up ..."},{"Title":"Martin Eden","review":"I picked this up out of curiosity after a male co-worker raved about it being one of his favorite books in high school.

Jack London died by overdose of morphine in 1916. He had suicidal impulses. MARTIN EDEN was Jack London's attempt to deal seriously and vigorously with important ideas. The forward notes that the novel is realistic but the metaphysics of the book are predominantly naturalistic.Martin Eden thought of himself as a wild man-- a wild man brought home to dinner. He had defended Ruth Morse's brother from bullies. He borrowed Swinburne and Browning from Ruth to read. Ruth felt that Swinburne was not quite correct. He lived with his sister and brother-in-law. He thought the man, Bernard Higginbotham, a brute. The many books he read served to whet his unrest. He felt an enormous distance separated him from Ruth Morse.He had always led a secret life in his thoughts. Martin saw Ruth at the theater. In his reading he was baffled by a lack of preparation. He attempted to read books that were beyond him. When he returned the books, Ruth noticed his pants were pressed and he seemed less rough. She wondered how to help him. His speech was uncouth.In compliance with her desires he studied grammar and etiquette. His swift development was a source of surprise and interest. The remodelling of Martin's life became a passion with her. Then he shipped out and read Shakespeare and did not even contact her right away when he came back into port.Martin planned to write. He wrote three thousand words a day and at the end of the week contacted Ruth. He bought a bicycle to accompany her on excursions. He heard Herbert Spencer quoted several times by orators and philosophers at City Hall Park and commenced to read his books. Martin was surprised that Spencer was very little read.He came to see his rejected manuscripts as pitiable children and hired on to work at a laundry in a resort. The description of the work in the laundry is admirable. Martin returned and began work again on his writing. Ruth's mother considered him an inappropriate beau.Ruth thought Martin's poverty was Lincolnesque. His landlady, Maria Silva, poor herself, knew better. Ruth appeared at the Silva house. He had been reckless enough to write to her to tell her that he had pawned his suit. Ruth saw the sordid face of poverty.Martin began to have some small sucess. He still suffered and starved and his behavior at a gathering at Ruth's house reflected his state of overwork and under-nourishment. He lost Ruth. His family did not support him. Eventually he had great success and Ruth came back to him, but he said it was too late. He said he was the same person her family had disliked. He left for the South Seas.Reading Jack London is akin to reading good science fiction.

It's about the artistic work ethic, and all true artists should read it."},{"Title":"Martin Eden","review":"As an individual ages from adolesence to retirement age, Martin Eden and other works of Jack London, though unchanged from the original printing, bring different meaning and worth to the individual. Jack London and other great authors of the period such as Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald, share unparalleled triumph in their individual genre and a shared tragic consequence of death. As a teenager, Martin Eden served as that triumphant underdog that nestles in many teenagers of some 50 years ago. Yet those teenagers, many of who grew up before, during and after World War II, have come to know personal tragedy. The tragedy of Martin Eden (autobiographically speaking)takes on more of reality to those past generations than perhaps the present generation. Nevertheless, the story is timeless albeit bittersweet. Martin Eden could well serve as a primer for those individuals who have yet to read his more classical tales of Sea Witch and Call of the Wild. Those were raw boned and sometimes brutal times he described. A reader may be surprised at the reality in the novels but should accept there is more fact than fiction as Jack London did indeed experience or witness much of these tales"},{"Title":"Martin Eden","review":"And being an angry young man is not a completely bad thing.

I believe, like every talented wordsmith, Jack London instinctively went for the most natural ending for his book. You see, the way I look at it, Martin Eden's only goal in life was to become a writer. And he did it. He achieved his only goal. And then what? In a way, his life cycle was finished after that: been there, done it, nothing else to look forward to. That's the mechanism behind his depression I think. I'm sorry if it sounds as if I'm rambling and I'm not sure if I can explain it, but in a way, this book shows the danger of going for one's dream. Once the dream comes true - that's it, end of story, there's nothing else worth living for. Had Martin found a new profound goal for himself, he could have overcome his depression. But he didn't. I was never happy with the ending: Martin helps everyone by making everybody else's dreams come true and still can't help himself. But his life was over because he replaced living with striving for one goal. Once he achieved it, life lost all meaning.

When he meet Ruth through her brother, he falls in love with her at once, eventhough she is a rich university student while he is an uneducated orphan that lives with his step sister and her husband. Martin deciedes to get an education so that he can get closer to Ruth. He starts to study grammar and to read heaps of books. eventually he decides to become a writer.

At the beginning of the story Martin is inarticulate, rough around the edges, and awkward in the presence of those he initially believes to be socially superior. When he meets Ruth Morse, a young lady of elegance and education, Martin's life changes. Impressed by Ruth's knowledge and apparent wisdom, Martin decides he wants to &quot;make good&quot;. It turns out Martin has a hard road to hoe.This is an inspiring novel of a man who, while experiencing intellectual growth, endures poverty, hunger, rejection, and all manner of hardship in his efforts to succeed as a writer. Fame and fortune seem a long way off. Because we know the story is based on Jack London's life, we can be certain that Martin's persistence will eventually be rewarded. But what comes after success? And what's it all worth?&quot;Martin Eden&quot; is a long journey of hope, bitterness and triumph. This is about a man who doesn't give in to adversity or yield to the conventions that society imposes on us. That makes Martin something rare. Most of us do get forced into that traditional pattern of drudgery and routine, of being slotted into a safe, sensible job with a comfortable salary, because that's what society expects of us. The pressure is hard to resist. It will be a long time before any of this changes. I think this book also says something about society's shallowness.&quot;Martin Eden&quot; is a fine novel. I may be stating the obvious, but stories about people who started with nothing are much more interesting than stories about heirs to a fortune."},{"Title":"Martin Eden","review":"Anyone who has written a novel and wants to see it in print should read this novel. Seriously. Poor Martin pinches pennies for postage money, types up his manuscripts, dispatches them in the mail and waits. When he inevitably gets them back, he mails them off to the next publisher on his list. Martin Eden is the perfect example of what it means to write for the public today. This tenancious, and realistic, routine eventually pays off, but the ordeal, as well as some difficulties in his love-life, has taken its toll. Martin becomes one of the bitterest cynics in all literature. The story moves at a fast clip and culminates in a shocking and heart breaking end. Unlike many of London's superb novels, this one will appeal mostly to adults--not that it is particularly racy; it just deals with adult problems and situations. Word has it that this is the most autobiographical of all London's novels."},{"Title":"Martin Eden","review":"In recent months, I've been reading the works of Jack London. I've gone through \\"White Fang\\", \\"The Call of the Wild\\", \\"The Road\\", \\"A Collection of Stories\\", \\"The Jacket\\", \\"Lost Face\\", and most recently \\"Martin Eden\\". All of these titles are offered as free Kindle books on Amazon. By far, \\"Martin Eden\\" seems to be London's masterpiece, although I certainly haven't read all of his works. Various others here have given a description of the story but I'm glad that I didn't read those too closely prior to opening the pages. I wanted the story to be fresh and just as I don't want to watch new movie trailers, I don't want to know the plot of a book beforehand. I had never heard of this book so wasn't sure what I'd be reading only that it was highly rated by other Amazon customers. Now that I've read the book, I happily returned to this page to see what others before me had to say and to add my 5 stars.Spoiler alert: Please stop reading now if you'd also like to read this book with no preconceived notions.I'm glad this wasn't the first of Jack London's works that I read because I was able to see autobiographical parallels of the real Jack London to the fictionalized Martin Eden as the story went on. Certainly some of the very works I read by him in recent months had to have been snapped up for publication, just as Martin Eden's works were, regardless of their merit. Certainly threads of his other tales and life story overlap in this book. I would have been more disappointed by some of the other works I read by him after this powerful piece, too. His depiction of Martin's struggles to better himself to become worthy of his love interest, but which developed into a crazed study and work schedule with only 4 hours of nightly sleep; later deepening into anger and serious depression just when his dreams were finally coming to fruition; and finally an unpremeditated suicide wish, seem to lay out symptoms of a young man developing manic-depression (bipolar disorder). At the start, I never imagined that it would veer off into such a dark and tragic ending. I ached for him to find peace and happiness from the start of this tale to the finish! This was a very engaging work that one can probably not help to think deeply and long about well after the final page has been read.I'm glad that Amazon offers many classics for free on the Kindle as I probably would have hesitated to break the spine of this book if I chanced an old volume on my shelves. Also, I'm thankful that my Kindle is loaded with 2 dictionaries as I found frequent need to consult them when happening upon somewhat archaic vocabulary I was unfamiliar with. I look forward to finding more works by Jack London to read in the future."},{"Title":"Martin Eden","review":"\\"Limited minds can recognize limitations only in others.\\"What if life, after working so hard and being misunderstood and laughed at by all you care for, gives you everything you have been dreaming of?Martin is a boy.

Jack London incorporates a lot of his incredible life story into this book.-Ian Holzhauer"},{"Title":"Martin Eden","review":"Jack London, a writer, journalist, adventurer; a tough man and a hopeless romantic. Although he is primarily known for his stories of adventure dealing with the Gold Rush, the Wild West and North, and of course for his marvelous novels with animals rather than people at the center of attention - he was also a great writer in many other respects, his &quot;Martin Eden&quot; being the best example. Slightly autobiographical, &quot;Martin Eden&quot; remains the single grand achievement of Jack London, one of the saddest books ever written, which made me notice that although most books end well, it's not always the case. How I wished the ending was different! And then I realized that some stories simply cannot end well, just like in real life events are more apt to destroy us rather than strengthen us, not to mention the fact that happy ends seem as real as fairies. Many people read books to escape from reality, to find that one place in the world where things turn out how we wish them to turn out. While I cannot deny this inherent human need, and I myself am not free from such wishful thinking, I seem to need brutal realism as much as I need consolation, among other things. &quot;Martin Eden&quot; shook me terribly when I was just a young moose, and since then I have read this novel several times, including the original English version, and it firmly remains among my favorites.Realistic this novel is, as are many books dating from that period, where the XIX century trends were still firmly instituted in the imagination of the turn-of-the-century generation, despite numerous efforts to revolutionize literature undertaken at about that time. Published in 1909, &quot;Martin Eden&quot; offers a wide array of topics and themes, all convoluted in a compelling, classical narrative. Firmly set in the aforementioned realism, depicting the society with brutal, unforgiving eye of the commentator, at the same time the novel is an apotheosis of idealism, as romantic, naive and detached as any other idealism out there. A young man serves at the sea, and at one point he meets a young lady from the &quot;upper middle class&quot;. In time, their relationship deteriorates from brute force attraction based on instinct, from cheerfulness and spontaneity to a grave series of misunderstandings based on the divergence of expectations one holds with respect to another, the more they know each other, the more so, to finally loathe in their lover what attracted them in the first place. &quot;Martin Eden&quot; is one of the most beautiful and touching love stories ever written, the more so because of its frankness which never borders on postmodern exhibitionism which plagued literature of the XX century.&quot;Martin Eden&quot; served London as a tool of social commentary, and thusly he expressed his disappointment and disapproval for the social class divisions, and as many before and after him, painted the bourgeois black with a fervor worth of any young radical. Nevertheless, as much as this sensitive socialism dated since then, it's a pleasure to read compared to what goes for literature almost a hundred years later, the journalistic socrealism of ideologues who imagine that they are writers. More generally, it's a sad fact that the XIX century essentially ended in 1914 with the outburst of the World War I, in all dimensions, including literature. &quot;Martin Eden&quot; thus may be considered as the last breath of the good old times that are never going to return."},{"Title":"Martin Eden","review":"Martin Eden is one of those books on which it's difficult to pass judgment. It doesn't rise to the realm of high art, although the writing is splendid in parts. The philosophy displayed through most of the novel comes across as sophomoric and meretricious. As autobiography it is dubious at best, as anyone who has read a biography of London knows. On all these accunts, London's other semi-autobiographical work, John Barleycorn, is much better and well-grounded......And yet, any one who has ever been in love or thirsted for beauty and knowledge, or has had ambition thwarted, or had it fulfilled and found that its reward led to emptiness can not help saying that this is the stuff of life.The book has Nietzsche's influence written all over it. Indeed, the closing lines of Chapter XXVIII are directly lifted from Nietzsche. This influence doesn't, to my mind, detract from the novel though. Quite to the contrary, it's what holds the book thematically and artistically together.The best part of the book by far is the ending, wherein London remains artistically and thematically true to himself and to his readers, and thereby renders the book unpalatable for mass consumption. As Nietzsche puts it, &quot;I love him who is abashed when the dice fall to make his fortune, and asks, 'Am I then a crooked gambler?' For he wants to perish&quot; There is also the influence and theme of that most anomolous of the books of The Bible, Ecclesiastes, which is, again, more overtly evident in London's John Barleycorn: &quot;Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher; all is vanity. What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun?&quot;This book has its faults, but indiffence to the very pulse of life and to the vagaries of the human condition is not one of them. I can't imagine any lover of and struggler with words and life coming away from Martin Eden unmoved."},{"Title":"Martin Eden","review":"There is always that one book in your life that you read and all of a sudden you realize that a book is more than just a story. This was that book for me. I still can't necessarily pinpoint why. But it did for me what I think a great book should do, that is make me think. Think about life, think about love and think about people. I can't say that this book answered any questions, but the important part was that it made me ask myself questions."},{"Title":"Martin Eden","review":"Jack London called MARTIN EDEN his greatest book. That's right: MARTIN EDEN, not THE CALL OF THE WILD or THE SEA-WOLF. He also said that THE PEOPLE OF THE ABYSS gave him the greatest satisfaction as an artist and THE IRON HEEL was his \\"gift to socialism.\\"Hm... that's not what we are taught in school, is it? Why has MATIN EDEN been so slow to emerge as a great American classic? There are two reason for this: one literary and the other historic.When first confronted by the character of Martin Eden, most readers are overwhelmed by his mental and physical strength, by his monumental drive to succeed as a writer and in so doing capture the woman of his dreams: Ruth Morse. Martin's meteoric rise comes across as not only heroic but downright inhuman, something that could only happen in the wildest of novels. But therein lies the trap. It really isn't a piece of fiction. For all intents and purposes Martin Eden is Jack London and the wraith-like Ruth Morse is Mabel Applegarth, the young woman he loved and aspired to marry and mate with.Contrary to popular opinion, the book is not the glorification of the individual but just the opposite: a warning of what can happen to the strongest of men when he foregoes societal consciousness. Martin's ultimate suicide is proof-positive that human beings are first and foremost societal creatures, that we need each other's love and affection in order to have complete and happy lives. In a word, Jack London and Ayn Rand would not have gotten along.Then there's the historic angle to MATIN EDEN. Unlike his great predecessor Herman Melville, Jack London is never given much credit for spending his artistic capital. But oddly the facts of his life show just the opposite. We must remember that London was writing at a time when the\\"robber barons\\" reigned supreme and the American worker had no protection whatsoever. There was no forty-hour work week, no child-labor laws, no workmen's compensation, no pension plans, no social security, and no safe working conditions. American workers were cogs in the great machine called the factory system. And as a child Jack London was one of those very cogs. He therefore detested the injustice he saw everywhere, especially the way the rich exploited the poor. THE IRON HEEL, his brilliant and direct assault on capitalism, was justifiably dubbed \\"the first negative Utopia.\\" But it was much more than that. It was a critique on the entire economic and social fabric of the day and was viciously and unfairly panned by the press. Nor did the criticism end there. London's next book - yes, you guessed it MARTIN EDEN - was panned too. London took his lumps and never wrote another great novel.So how do I end all this? Perhaps on a personal note. In 1962 my father said to me, \\"You know, son, Jack London is not properly understood in the United States. To my mind MARTIN EDEN was his best effort and it might do you some good to read it.\\" I took Dad's advice and did so. It blew me away. Then, at age forty, I said to myself: \\"I bet MARTIN EDEN does not pack the punch it had twenty-two years ago.\\" I was wrong. It hit me stronger than before. Now, at age sixty-six, I plan to read it a third and final time. Only this time I know it was not disappoint. Of that I am certain. Just like the last two times it will spin its magic and make me a better human being."},{"Title":"Martin Eden","review":"This is Jack London's fictionalized story, a Paul Bunyonesque tale of the power and strength of the spirit. More than anything, this book is about individualism: a man's life-and-death attempt to overcome his working class background and launch himself into what he thinks will be the culture and rationality of the upper class. Martin Eden wants to write so as to impress the dainty, middle-class girl of his dreams: her of the frail and conformist nature. In this quest, no barrier is to large, no pain too great, but in the end, as he triumphs as a writer, he finds the results empty and barren, the people he meets at the top, as shallow and vacant as those he sought to escape. &quot;Where are all the great giants?&quot; he asks himself. Together with London's hard-hitting and powerful prose, the book is a masterpiece for the ages: the bold, fearless individual pursuing the inner vision of a different life. Although set around the turn of the century, the message of this book is as relevant today as it was the day it was published."},{"Title":"Martin Eden","review":"In reward for an act of good samaritanism, Martin Eden, an uneducated working-class sailor, is invited to dinner at the home of the bourgeois Morse family. Upon first sight of lovely young Ruth Morse, he immediately falls in love with her. Over the course of the evening, Martin becomes enamored with the family's luxurious home, refined lifestyle, and cultured education, and aspires to raise himself to their level. With the intention of transforming himself into a man worthy of marrying Ruth, he sets upon a rigorous course of self-education. Soon he develops a passion for writing, and resolves to make his fortune as a man of letters.What follows is the long, arduous journey of Martin's ascent. His struggles as an aspiring writer are totally captivating; one can't help but rejoice in his successes and agonize over his failures. The portions of the book devoted to his literary exploits are so engrossing, the romance between Martin and Ruth often seems a cumbersome distraction. Though a realist and radical in his political and philosophical writings, London was often a hopeless romantic and downright puritanical in his depictions of male/female relations. In his works women are often set on pedestals, and no one gets a higher pedestal than Ruth Morse. Even so, as Mr. and Mrs. Morse deliberate over whether Martin is worthy of their daughter, the reader finds himself wondering whether Ruth is really worthy of Martin. Thankfully, as the book progresses and the characters gain a little maturity, the relationship between Martin and Ruth becomes less idyllic and much more firmly grounded in reality. As Martin's superheroic quest for self-transformation lurches toward fruition, he comes to realize that the result of his metamorphosis is not the paradise he envisioned.Whether you come to admire Martin or abhor him, this is an exceptionally thought-provoking novel that calls into question the inherent value of social status and intellectual achievement. What begins as a simple boy-meets-girl, rags-to-riches tale gradually progresses into a profound investigation into the complex conflicts of man vs. society, class vs. intellect, artistic integrity vs. exploitation, individualism vs. conformity, and ambition vs. complacency. This semi-autobiographical novel was Jack London's greatest attempt to break free from the ghetto of adventure fiction to which he was so often undeservedly confined, and to write the sort of philosophical literary novel one might expect from a Dickens or a Balzac. To this end he was extremely successful. Martin Eden is a life-changing read that deserves a place on any bookshelf alongside the great classics of literature."},{"Title":"Martin Eden","review":"Say Jack London and most literate persons would ring up \\"Snow, Dog Stories and nature tooth and nail set in the context of gold rush Alaska of the 1890s. Ironically, Jack London was a San Francisco native in which he sets his 1909 novel \\"Martin Eden\\" which is his fictional autobiography.Martin Eden is a young, virile bright sailor who resuces a middle class man from thugs. He is invited to the man's home where he meets his sister Ruth. Martin and Ruth fall in love. Ruth and her family seek to help Martin obtain a good job but he insists on becoming a published author. Years pass and his work is rejected. Martin takes such jobs as working in a laundry and going to sea as he ekes out a living on a near starvation diet. Martin is a voracious reader of fiction, essays and novels. He is influenced by Darwinian social evolutionsim and becomes a disciple of Herbert Spencer. Martin also subscribes to the Nietzchian concept of a superman who is above the herd of ordinary people. Martin is a lonely soul who is befriended by the moribund poet Brissende an alcoholic. Both of these writers have soured on life. Martin has moved from Eden to Hell in his thinking and prospects for the future.Martin eventually becomes rich through his writings but it is too late for him to have a good life. He grows to despise Ruth and her smug suburban middle class family. He hates businessmen and philistinism and pretence in society and the literary community. He befriends a former girlfriend but his autodidadic education and fame have separated him forever from his working class pals.Martin rejects a plea for love from Ruth and sails away from the dull life of middle class respectability and conformity.The novel is bitter and brutal in its depiction of the American dream turned into a nightmarish vision of a man sickened with life. The Horatio Alger rags to riches tale is given a wry twist by Jack London. The novel failed to win applause upon its publication. Since then the novel has grown in readership and literary stature.

If you are not used to London's word usage, you might be caught off guard. Despite his word usage the reader can still get the main points of the story. This story is one that touches on many topics such as self discovery, tragedy, trust, and the evolution of one's being. As you read Martin Eden you cannot help but identify with the main character in some way. By connnecting with the main character you will find yourself suppporting him in every way. You will celebrate his achievements and console him in his many failures. All of which make for an engaging novel.

Trying to change them, relate with them, or even addressing them on any human level will prove futile, in my experience. Essentially, don't go pullin a Martin Eden over what a pen of swine agree upon.And his speech to the socialists at the rally - lol!This was in 1908?

After I got out of the Army, I went to grad school on G.I. bill and for 37 years taught literature in college, including Jack London's fiction.I've often thought that the overall plot of MARTIN EDEN was VERY similar to that of Fitzgerald's THE GREAT GATSBY--both books are about a man who puts a woman on a pedestal and becomes a huge financial success in order to impress and win that woman--and then he finds out that she is not really the person he'd built her up to be in his mind--and so he has nothing to live for.SPOILER ALERT: Instead of being able to \\"grow up\\" or at least \\"suck it up\\" and move on, both men are destroyed when they are disillusioned about the object of their adolescent romantic fantasies.Read both of these novels and see for yourself.

I read it at 17 and didn't notice the flaws, but then read it again at 33 and saw how bad some of the sections were. I haven't looked up how old Jack was when he wrote this, but I assume he was still a kid. Some of the sections really made me dislike him personally because I assume that the hot-headed behavior and ignorance of the main character was really how the author himself felt and acted.However, Jack London did make it clear what life and existence would really be about if there was no God. The main character begins by having never really thought about life. Then he begins to get to the bottom of things and sees that we are animals and nothing more, and that everything is meaningless. I believe the Bible, but Jack is the is the only author I've ever read, or person I've ever heard that was a real atheist and didn't try to hide himself from the implications of that belief. I respect that. He doesn't paint a rosy picture and he doesn't try to keep from seeing the horrible truth of a universe without meaning; he looks directly at it.

When I responded that he was known only vaguely by my generation as an adventurer and a ruffian, my Soviet friends gently shook their heads and regarded me as an ignoramus.My spotty education aside, I did recall London only carelessly through some snaggly-toothed wolf in a novel of his, read in junior high and not afterwards. Nearly a year after I'd returned to the states, I still hadn't re-read London, and had left my comrades' advice somewhere to rot in a long mental list of &quot;Authors I Must Some Day Read.&quot;On my birthday, then, I was strolling through book-store aisles with my boyfriend, trying helplessly to choose just one tome for a special gift. Hillman? Oh, no. I'll buy that myself, regardless. Nietzshce's &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra?&quot; As a birthday gift? Too silly.London's name cropped up into my mind, only half-so, and I dug vigorously through the L's until I came up with his &quot;Martin Eden.&quot;&quot;Martin Eden&quot; is a beautiful book -- not granted its proper throne in history.I'm not sure if London was pre-judged as an adventurer, if readers really didn't challenge themselves to dip below his surface - I'm no literary historian - or if, perhaps, if his politics played a role...it's silly to speculate.Regardless, &quot;Eden&quot; is a daring - if not entirely successful - critique of modern philosophy's most potent force: Nietzshce. It's also a historical novel, a coming-of-age, and a wealth of human insight. His big finish is, yes, overstated. Perhaps because he didsn't ultimately triumph over Nietzsche. But he gives a good right hook and a terrific read.Editor's note: Enough to rouse a former student and former reader back to a voracious love affair with words.Here's to Jack London!

He falls in love with the daughter of awealthy man and decides he wants to become a famous writer, partly to impress her.Martin Eden suffers a lot in the book. All of his literary efforts are rejected by publishers and fail to impressthe woman he loves. He becomes very disillusioned and very poor. The account of how difficult it is to becomea great writer as opposed to a popular, published author rings true. I enjoyed London's writing style. There's a lot in the bookabout individualism versus socialism that didn't interest me. Overall, I would say it is a very worthwhile book with a lot of depth.

I was astonished by the high quality of the concepts explored, clear prose, wonderful character development, and the unfolding tragedy of the plot. I was also amazed at how Jack London weaves the philosophical currents of the time with a frank appraisal of the realities of class divisions of East Bay (Oakland, California) society, together with their intellectual limitations, which clearly echoed those more often associated with the eastern United States.One should know, fairly early on, where this novel is ultimately headed. But what holds our interest is the deeply insightful study of the consciousness of this aspiring intellect, aesthete, and writer in the process of becoming inspired, going through the darkness, ultimately finding empty triumph, paired exactly with his choice of an end.While reading this book I thought a good deal of other works that explore the consciousness of writers and societal studies, such as those of more highly touted contemporaries in Joyce's Ulysses and Proust's Remembrance of Things Past, and even the often derided Henry Miller, who was a later master of the genre. I would imagine Miller was influenced by Martin Eden, but I have no evidence of that.This book is well worth reading for anyone who wants to experience a young American novelist at the height of his powers.

This is a cautionary tale of \\"be careful what you wish for\\" as well as a commentary about class envy in America. This is such a well-known novel that you can certainly find a concise synopsis elsewhere, so I'll just add this: in Martin Eden, London reminds us that success...and fame, in particular, looks great from the outside, but often leads to disillusionment for those that attain them. It's not a new theme, but his take on it is very engaging. He also makes a devastataing indictment of the American upper class by pointing out the hypocricy of their \\"learned\\" status, in which they learn many facts but are intelectually lazy, unable to construct their own original insights or posess true cuirosity about the way the world works.

I read it for a thesis paper, and couldn't believe the quality of the writing. The imagery London uses is captivating, as is the whole plot line. The reader finds himself completely drawn into the story, a book where one has to set it down to reacquaint oneself with the world, because the book is so moving. I cried.I wholeheartedly reccomend this book, and would encourage everyone to read it."},{"Title":"Martin Eden","review":"This book is on my top ten list of favorite books; it is painful and wonderful at the same time, and I have passed it on to many of my friends. I think that reading this book is a tremendous way to get into someone else's psyche and help us understand other ways of thinking, and to help us re-evaluate our own.

Then imagine again a mind obssessed with knowledge, a body hungry for love and a soul agonized from the vice of humanity-that is the plight and tragedy of Martin Eden.Reading this book was a life altering read that I will always cherish, for every artistic mind will inherently and passionately understand every syllable uttered by Jack London's genuis-buy this book and read it and reread it indefinitely!"},{"Title":"Martin Eden","review":"I read this book while living in Montreal back in '88. By sheer coincidence, I was a struggling writer, working to earn my daily bread in a dry cleaning shop. The book had been given to me as a gift by the father of a friend before I headed off for Montreal to pursue my dreams.So, maybe it was the fact that I had steam blowing in my face at the cleaner's (much like Eden in the book), maybe it was the fact that I wasn't eating very much those days (much like Eden in the book), or maybe it was because of the fact that this book got right under my skin - but it's the book that convinced me that writing is hard work.As a work of fiction, I admit that it has its flaws, but I'm still giving it five stars for London's absolute courage in shifting gears in his career as a writer and putting out a book he believed in and that is absolutely believable. The reader could have done without the political aspsects of London's philosophy, but then again - maybe not."},{"Title":"The Journey of Elisa: From Switzerland to America (Immigrant's Chronicles #5)","review":"This book is part of a series of Immigrants Chronicles from Cook Communications and is based on the real-life stories of my great-grandmother, Elisa Bolli Buffat, and other French-Swiss immigrants who settled in East Tennessee in the mid 1800's. In the story Elisa, 11, and her sisters and brother move from Brazil, where their father is Swiss consul, to Knoxville, TN, to be near relatives. Not only must they learn to speak English and make new friends, but they suffer through the illness and death of their father. As the family learns to farm and make their way in the new country, Elisa learns that even during times of great loss our faith and God's comfort can give us hope for the future. I felt very close to my great-grandmother as I read her memoirs and created this story about her life, and I hope readers will find encouragement and strength in God's faithfulness to all generations. Read the story to find out how Elisa's search for her mother's wedding veil brings her hope, too!"},{"Title":"The Journey of Elisa: From Switzerland to America (Immigrant's Chronicles #5)","review":"Elisa's father is the Swiss consul in Brazil, and Elisa has lived in Brazil all her life. She is surprised when her father announces his intention to move to America so the family could be near relatives. But Elisa knows the real reason. Her father's health has never been good, and so they immigrate in hopes that he will recover. Elisa is sad to leave her home, but she is also excited about her new life.At first things seem to finally be turning out all right at last, when Elisa's father's condition worsens. And when he dies, Elisa and her family are struck with grief. Will Elisa ever learn to live without her father? And when Elisa has a bad fall and injures her elbow, will her arm ever be the same again? Find out in this heart-warming book!This has got to be one of my all-time favorite books. My mom got it for my birthday once because my name is Elisa also. I loved this book so much that I coaxed my mom into getting me the entire series, which are just as good as this one. My suggestion is to read them all!!!"},{"Title":"The Journey of Elisa: From Switzerland to America (Immigrant's Chronicles #5)","review":"I purchased this book for my 9 yo daughter and thought I'd preview it first. I must say that I LOVED IT!! The story line is engaging and the main characters are well-developed. It's simply a great story and one that I'll remember in years to come.Through the challenging events of their life (their move to America and the death of the father), the characters grow in the virtues of faith, hope, and love. They become stronger people who know that they must rely on God.My only reservation about the book is the suggested reading level (8 - 12 years old). I would recommend an older audience. My daughter (age 9) would be able to read the book as it's her reading level, but she hasn't had enough life experience to fully appreciate the whole story. I'll wait another year or two before I give it to her."},{"Title":"The Journey of Elisa: From Switzerland to America (Immigrant's Chronicles #5)","review":"Because their father was the Swiss consulate there, Elisa Bolli and her four siblings -- a brother and three sisters -- grew up in Brazil. But in the spring of 1853, when Elisa is twelve, her father's health begins to deteriorate. Elisa's parents decide that the family will move to Tennessee so that they can be near their relatives, who immigrated there from Switzerland several years ago. Elisa and her siblings manage to adjust quickly to their new life on a Tennessee farm. However, Papa's health does not improve, but only worsens. How will the family manage to go on when he dies?This was a good historical novel and a sweet family story for young readers, based on the life of the author's great-grandmother, Elisa Bolli, and her family. Elisa is a wonderful character whose relationships with her parents and siblings are very realistically portrayed. Readers who enjoy historical fiction about immigrants, or a sweet family story, will most likely enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The basis of combination in chess,","review":"This book shows how each individual piece can contribute to combinational play. It also shows how pieces work together in certain situations to deliver checkmate or win material.The only downfall I see is that most combination books, this one included, fail to appreciate the power of removing enough force from a piece or square to capture material cleanly. Yes, double attacks, pins, and forks are an integral part of tactical play, but interference, clearance, and removal of guard themes are the real keys to becoming tactically proficient."},{"Title":"The basis of combination in chess,","review":"This book was first published in 1938 and is surprisingly effective as a learning tool. Pay close attention to a sentence in the very front of the book, one easily skipped over, about how to best use the book: the advice is to mentally play through the examples, from the diagrams, while using the book, and then play them through again, setting them up on a board, this time without using the book. This technique is very effective in teaching and reinforcing the principles described.The book looks at combinations based on the unique abilities of individual pieces, first separately and then in various groupings. The examples are generally easy enough to follow and favor clarity over complexity (although of necessity the material in the latter parts of the book gets rather involved).A close study of the book is helping me with visualization as well as gaining understanding of the \\"inner workings\\" so to speak of each chess piece.Why bother with \\"yet another\\" tactics book, when there are so many out there? Why put up with old-style descriptive notation? (Come on, it's not so bad.)Because this is decidedly not \\"yet another\\" tactics book. While basic tactical motifs get covered, this is almost incidental, because the focus is on the chess pieces themselves. The tactics arise out of the unique ability of the pieces. This seems to be a very intuitive approach and quite different from \\"let's study skewers\\" or \\"let's study discovered attacks.\\" In short, the focus of the book is quite unique and even at nearly 70 years old, new insights can be found.One star off, giving a rating of four, because at times the prose is less than completely lucid.Definitely worth the $10 or so the book commands on the used market. It has won a place on my study table, where only a small handful of books reside."},{"Title":"The basis of combination in chess,","review":"This is a dated book, but one of the very best at teaching combinations for chess mastery. I recommend this book to anyone who already grasps the game of chess, but would like to up his game from beginner to intermediate. This is elementary to an advanced chess player but even they will appreciate the scope of how this book teaches combination moves to annihilate your opponents.The best thing one can do is get a chess board out and set up the pieces just how this book illustrates and go through the motions. I guarantee if you do this at least 3-4 days a week your chess game will double or even triple in tactics. Highly Recommended from a chess club champion(myself)It is much better to use a real chess set instead of an online program. You really get the feel of how the moves interact with one another.I am giving this book 5 stars because it deserves it and is one of the moreobscure books you never see at a library, but extremely helpful."},{"Title":"The basis of combination in chess,","review":"This book shows the unique abilities of each piece and the typical ways to combine the action of pieces to build combinations. The many examples are taken mostly from actual grandmaster games. This book will amply reward the time spent studying it. I found myself spotting combinations much more often and actually able to plan using pieces together after reading it. It is better suited to a beginner. Upon rereading it recently, my own understanding has increased since my original review and it is likely too elementary for players above 1000. It is useful to focus on the typical ways of using a piece in addition to knowing about pins, skewers, forks, etc. These motifs are all discussed by the author when illustrating the power and action of the pieces.The author translated both volumes of Alekhine's My Best Games into English. He credits Tartakower with help in preparing the book. The late Ken Smith, owner and publisher of the Chess Digest brand, wrote that Mr.du Mont told him that Alekhine himself helped a lot with the book.It is a shame that this classic has gone out of print. Perhaps, some publisher will reissue it and even translate it into algebraic notation.

Nora even more than I did the three volume Ellman biography of Joyce himself. In fact, Joyce fans will probably learn more about Joyce's writing by reading about his wife than about him. This is one of the most outstanding biographies I have ever read -- it's fascinating to learn how Joyce used Nora's every utterance somewhere in his works even though she herself never read Ulysses."},{"Title":"Nora: A Biography of Nora Joyce","review":"It is hard to imagine Jim Joyce writing as he did without Nora. Her stream of consciousness letter writing influenced his style. Her feisty Aries personality gave him much impetus. Maddox likes to delve into the private lives of her subjects. Jim was much taken by Nora's earthy nature, and Maddox does not hold back in this department.This book helps explain Joyce's interest in bodily functions and the less polite side of life.Virginia Woolf said Ulysses was the work of \\"a queasy undergraduate scratching his pimples.\\" After reading Maddox I would say it is the work of a pervert wallowing in a sewer. Maddox relates that Joyce, among other things, liked to watch Nora defecate. He often spent much of the night drinking and had to be carried home by a friend. I find Maddox gives too much detail about the mundane things of the Joyce's everyday life. I guess Joyce fanatics would not mind this. Nora comes across as a likeable and resourceful woman, who, despite the limitations of her background, rose to the occasion and coped with many challenging situations."},{"Title":"Concise Oxford dictionary of opera","review":"Would this give you confidence?On the first reading I had close to 147 objections by the end of letter C and most of these were factual errors.

It is possible that Messrs Warrack and West found similarly because the ranges given are not always correct. In a profession where the difference of a semitone can make a role possible or impossible, we read that Dandini and the Count in Capriccio range from c to a flat', when Dandini is actually G to f', a fourth out at the bottom and a minor third at the top. The Count in Capriccio is from A flat on page 159 of the score to g' on page 120.Jupiter in Orphee aux Enfers is credited with the bass range from the Amateur Operatic Society Version of the score instead of the baritone range in the professional. Perhaps the authors could go to Offenbach's various professional versions and correct me here.On pages 12, 16, and 230 we read about \\"vocal chords\\" instead of \\"vocal cords\\", a common mistake, a chord being two notes sounded together and vocal cords being the vibrating strips of flesh which produce speech and song.\\\\Under \\"Balzac\\" a list of obscure operas is provided but there is no entry for Oscar Wilde.According to ODO the action of The Fiery Angel starts in Cologne and goes to Cologne.Page 1 \\"Abigaille.

I travel back and forth to Japan a lot and missed classes sometimes. I had the book with me most of the time, and almost everyone I talk to in Japan recognizes the book as a popular text for teaching Japanese to foreigners. What I like most about the book is that I didn't have any trouble keeping up with the occasional missed class, because the book is so self-explanatory. You can work through the lessons on your own and get almost as much out of it as you do from the class."},{"Title":"Japanese for Busy People II","review":"E x c e l l e n tI love the method the book uses.You learn the language in a record-time with this book."},{"Title":"Japanese for Busy People II","review":"I think this book is a very useful one. I have finished the first two in the series and am moving on to the third. It teaches the basic building blocks you need to understand kanji. Kanji understanding is really necessary in order to begin to gain an understanding of Japanese. I will have to respectfully disagree with the above reviewer. I thinkit is absolutely essential to read and write kana fluently before moving from beginner level. It is a time investment but it is well worth it! As long as you are aware that this book is kana only you should be ok. I do wish they gave more casual language and a little less focus on business but I suppose that is useful for those who work in Japan. Enjoy the book ^_^*"},{"Title":"Japanese for Busy People II","review":"If you used Japanese for Busy People I to start learning Japanese, you might be disappointed with this second book in the series. JFBP II has been, for me, less user-friendly. In comparison with JFBP I, this book inundates the student with vocabulary and grammar notes in each lesson. Yes, having lots of information is good. But in my opinion, this book has packaged that information in larger chunks that are more difficult for the student to digest. Lessons are oriented around events, places and situations -- Lost and Found, the Health Club, a Business trip; a festival, etc. The book might have been more helpful had it been oriented around grammar concepts. Or better yet, give me a lesson focused on just new vocabulary and then give me a lesson focused on a grammar concept -- where I can use my recently acquired vocabulary. (I am learning in a classroom environment, and it's extremely challenging to soak up all the new vocabulary AND all the new grammar in each lesson.)This book also is big on kana and kanji and sparse on romaji (although the book, in the appendix, does awkwardly provide romaji for the lesson texts). I agree that learning to think in kana is important. But I think more prominent romaji is still needed at this level -- when beginning students are still visualizing in terms of romaji. Kana is easy enough but requires my brain to kick in some extra processing power -- which slows down my comprehension of the material. In other words, I think students still could benefit from the &quot;training wheels&quot; of romaji at this level. It could speed up learning of vocabulary and grammar. It just makes sense: We learn to speak English fairly well. Then we learn to read and write it. Why not learn to speak Japanese fairly well (using easy romaji) and then learn how to read and write our newly acquired Japanese using kana?And speaking of training wheels, more illustrations of vocabulary and concepts would have been helpful -- to help students better soak up new words and grammar. Another gripe: Not all words used in this book are in the glossary. (If it's not in the glossary, it's probably in the glossary for JFBP I.)If you are studying on your own and on no timetable, this book will do you just fine. This book covers a lot of territory. If you can soak it all up, you'll be Japanese wiz. But if you're truly a busy person (like me -- or maybe I'm just slow! ;) ) and if this is the book you have to use, be prepared to make extra time in your schedule. And do your best to master each lesson before you move on to the next one -- since each lesson requires knowledge of previous concepts. Otherwise, your house of cards will come tumbling down."},{"Title":"Felt Board Stories","review":"This book is an excellent source of felt stories, I use all the books by building blocks liz and dick wilmes.

The author uses Logo's turtle graphics as a way of exploring the properties of geometric space. From very simple beginnings drawing regular polygons and other simple shapes, the book gradually works its way to more and more complicated scenarios. After exploring the properties of ordinary turtle graphics, turtle graphics are tried on the surfaces of spheres and cubes, then on more complicated surfaces. Little by little, concepts of non-Euclidean geometry are introduced, until the final chapters in which the turtle is used to demonstrate the geometric nature of gravity in Einstein's general theory of relativity.I strongly recommend this book to anyone with interests in computer programming, geometry and physics. The unusual approach this book takes to the understanding of curved space is deceptively simple and surprisingly powerful."},{"Title":"Turtle Geometry - the Computer As a Medium for Exploring Mathematics","review":"Turtle Geometry teaches mathematics and physics via the computer and the Logo programming language. The mathematics covered is pretty advanced, including topology, and general relativity. Yet, through the use of turtle geometry this advanced math and physics becomes accessible to the layperson. Although all of the examples are in the Logo programming language there are listings of Basic routines in the back of the book. With the help of the Basic routines I was able to easily translate the Logo/Basic code to the Python programming language which I choose to use for reading this book. The reviewers of this book mention it as the beginnning of a revolution in mathematics education. It seems though, that this revolution did not come about as computers are still not used very effectively in the classroom. I think this is very sad as the teaching approach used in Turtle Geometry could be very successful in the classroom."},{"Title":"Turtle Geometry - the Computer As a Medium for Exploring Mathematics","review":"Anyone interested in logo from beginners to advanced userswill benefit from reading this book.

I did it out of curiosity inspired by the many interesting topics. Along the way I got a good foundation in vector algebra, 2d and 3d geometry, programming, and other things, all without effort.It is good for children or young adults who may later work in physics or vector graphics. I wish it was updated to use a modern language or a modern version of Logo. There is no other book that collects such a mixture of different subjects together.

I was there during and after the storm. First of all, many people do not know the facts. New Orleans is 12 feet below sea level not 7.

Third the State of Louisiana asked for money to rebuild the levees many years ago. That money was denied. It was too expensive for the country. So now it cost many billions of dollars to rebuild the city. A fine example of our government! A large number of very poor people were not able to evacuate. They had no transportation. They had no relatives to go to as all their families were living in the same poor section of town as they were. They had no money to go to hotels or any other place. These people were forgotten and left to die. Their was no disaster plan that stated how to evacuate the poor. Hundreds of school buses went underwater. These buses could have been used to evacuate the poor. I am ashamed to be a native of New Orleans. My city and state and country let us all down.

New Orleans was flooded because: 1) elevation there is about 7 feet BELOW sea level and 2)their levy system has NEVER been built to withstand cat 3 or greater storms. EVERY drop of rain that falls in New Orleans has to be pumped out, one way or the other. If the citizens of New Orleans had put more money into improving their levy system instead of the SuperDome, they might very well be living in dry and undamaged homes today instead of morning their dead and trying to put their city back together. New Orleans will be rebuilt someday and I hope and pray that they have learned and benefited from this disaster and won't make the same mistakes again.

That they remember everything: the final solution to the Jewish question, the Stalin era, the Churchill decision to bomb the civilians, the colonial wars for plunder and freedom (with chopped-off heads in Malaya, electrodes against the genitals in Algeria, napalm in Viet Nam), OAS, the lying politicians, everything. But I want to underline that it has been the European, the Western intellectuals that have led and fulfilled these actions in every phase. We have written the theories, we have filled the universities with learned men giving rational motivations and reasonable techniques for every crime. (...) And everything that has been done has been done with the most sincere desire to carry on the struggle for our ideals. This has been the century of the European intelligentsia.\\"Jan Myrdal, the radical son of famous economist Gunnar Myrdal and international dearmament activist Alva Myrdal, made a reckoning both with himself and his generation as well as the tradition of European intellectuals in the 20th Century in this memoir, \\"Confessions of a Disloyal European\\". Confessions, he writes, is meant not in the religious sense as much as in the old sense, as a statement of belief as well as apologia in one: Myrdal mercilessly dissects and criticizes his own psychology and actions, public and private, throughout his life, but also seeks to formulate an explanation of how he came to become one of the few intellectuals on the continent to systematically break with imperial traditions and become not just a Communist, but a Third Worldist, i.e. an anti-imperialist. (And he did not just become one, he stayed one, and even now in his old age campaigns against the present war in Afghanistan; honesty AND courage is even more uncommon.)The book is not easy to read, though it is merely 200-ish pages (in the reprint by Lake View Press, which includes a later afterword reaffirming the book). Some of the book is direct political commentary, based on the personal experiences of the author in foreign lands and with Swedish salon socialists, but most of it consists of opaque fragments written in a stream-of-consciousness-like style. These concern mostly his private affairs: his memories of poverty, of the death of his friends, of his own failures and flaws, his failed love affairs, his growing disillusionment with even the most 'social' of Western societies, his hatred of intellectual dishonesty. Much of this makes one wonder why a reader would want to know these intimate memories and self-criticisms, but Myrdal says he \\"wanted to get past the defense mechanisms of the reader by telling stories\\". One gets the feeling the stories still overwhelm the political purpose of raising consciousness to a greater degree than the author realized, probably because the mind of another is always a nocturnal marshland to the outside observer; but this is the most purposeful nonfictional account of one of Europe's few consistent intellectuals, and it touches from however odd an angle on the 'aufhebung' of our liberal tradition, and it is for that alone worth reading.\\"But we who are part of the tradition-the Europeans-and who carry on the tradition we have betrayed with awareness, insight and consciousness, we have carefully analyzed all the wars before they were declared. But we did not stop them. (...) Now we once more analyze the world situation and describe the wars and explain why the many are poor and hungry. But we do no more.\\""},{"Title":"Confessions of a Disloyal European","review":"This book deals with questions of guilt, memory, personal betrayal, and societal patterns.

Indeed, he was; and took real delight in his gifts and his exercise of them; he was a Celtic bard in the truest sense of that role -- the lonely public/private man who carried within him the lyric history of his race, the love of his language and a very vocal sense of wonder over his role in life; that he had song, yes; that he was funny, loud, boisterous, cautious, selfish, rude, unforgettable -- all of that and more; he was the poet's poet and the singer for those who longed for lost boyhood, who raged at death and who marvelled at the all the world's words rediscovered in a dewdrop; his stories, like his poems, should be read aloud; there is an incantatory quality to them -- as if something profoundly old and grandfatherly were suddenly shared with the reader; Thomas himself was a great reader; to hear him is to savor him at his best and to feel deeply and sweetly the majesty and holy compulsion of our mother tongue; the stories, while less charged than the poems, nonetheless captivate and break into a kind of lyricism that gladdens the heart and restores the ear.

Ethereal, mysterious, often confoundingly subjective, it's the work of a very lyrical writer who wasn't always interested in typical short-fiction concerns like plot and character.The plus side of this is represented right away in the first story, a bewitching child-like fable out of Ray Bradbury. \\"After The Fair\\" presents a girl named Annie who creeps into a fairground at night and makes friends with one of the human sideshows. \\"I've always been a fat man, and now I'm the Fat Man,\\" he tells her with a touch of pride. There's something deeply satisfying yet hard to explain about the pull of this story, of utterly different people connecting to one other in a way that seems natural to the very young and impossible to anyone else.Three stories later, \\"The Enemies\\" presents us with another kind of off-center meeting, this between a lost and somewhat barmy Welsh minister and a couple of otherworldly pagans who view him with concealed contempt.Conversation is elliptical, to say the least. \\"It is quiet here.\\" \\"We have no clock.\\"Dylan Thomas won fame for his poetry, but during a career from the early 1930s to 1953 he also wrote fiction. For the first few years, it was in the vein of \\"The Enemies\\" and even more inscrutable offerings like \\"The Lemon\\" and \\"The Mouse And The Woman\\". Any plot seems hidden behind dense layers of descriptive, run-on verbiage. I found myself grimly turning pages with the dumb persistence of an armadillo on a desert road.Thomas didn't stick to that style, fortunately. The middle of the book contains the text for his short-story collection \\"Portrait Of An Artist As A Young Dog\\" which is written in a more grounded way. The best of them, \\"The Peaches\\" and \\"One Warm Saturday\\", present both a lived-in feeling as well as a clear well-developed narrative and compelling central characters. Thomas still meanders, but with real purpose and a welcome infusion of humor. Not all the stories are great, yet they work together in a way that develops Thomas's fictional Wales as a place of real solidity.I'm still not sure what to make of the last third of the book. They include the three chapters of Thomas's aborted novel \\"Adventures In The Skin Trade\\", which mix fantasy and realism yet seem to go nowhere. There's also \\"A Child's Christmas In Wales\\", Thomas's best-known story but really more of an overstuffed inventory of things Thomas remembered from his Yuletide past. It's not a story so much as a hazy reminiscence in the same way as other later efforts like \\"Return Journey\\" and \\"The Crumbs Of One Man's Year.\\" I was underwhelmed.But just as I was settling back into armadillo-reader mode, I came to \\"The Followers\\". Again, like with \\"After The Fair\\", there was something compelling in the murky storyline, in which the title characters stalk a woman with no malicious intent for reasons even they can't quite understand. The ending is either a wicked cheat or a clever nod to O. Henry, but like the similarly fantastic \\"One Warm Saturday\\", I found it worked quite well.So I wound up reading a bunch of stories I was indifferent to and a few I couldn't stand in exchange for four or five that wove a rare kind of magic. It was the kind of bargain I'd happily make again. Alas, it's not one I can recommend unreservedly."},{"Title":"Collected Stories Pb (Everyman)","review":"This collection is a necessary part of the library of every Dylan Thomas aficionado. It contains all the stories fromDylan Thomas: Portrait Of The Artist As A Young Dogand fromAdventures in the Skin Tradeas well as the miscellaneous prose pieces found inQuite Early One Morning.By turns turgid and lucid -- sometimes morbidly surreal, at another times sunnily nostalgic -- Dylan Thomas could cast a spell on his reader or listener from the very first sentence. Perhaps his most famous prose-work, A Child's Christmas in Wales, is also included, making this collection the indispensable compendium of stories and memoirs by the Welsh master. Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"Collected Stories Pb (Everyman)","review":"With significant exceptions, &quot;The Collected Stories&quot; chronical the life, if read in that order, of a sad and melancholy man, who was aware of but unwilling to accept the burden on consciousness of the futility of modern life. Thomas lightened his load, by and by, with increasingly frequent jokes and essays into humour. In many ways the stories are an accurate account of the everyday absurdity of Everyman; by one who lived at the time personality was displaced by the development of commercial media hype. Thomas died at age 39 in 1953. If he'd lived a few more years he might have described to us the age of common emotion and undifferentiated humanity, which breaks down only under the influence of alcohol to anything interesting and never unique; that he interpolated and prophecied from his eavesdropping into the lives of his comtemporaries. (No, I don't think that sentence is too long and I think Dylan would have approved.) He didn't spare himself from his snooping. Much of the content is autobiographical. But like a reporter, he just tells us the facts. The inferences and insights are your own. You have to read this volume!

It's a fast read, filled with small, profound moments. Gus Perazzo is torn between his old girlfriends and his estranged wife, between his summer plumbing job and his full-time academic gig starting that Fall. Most of all, he's caught between his rational approach to his mother's terminal illness and his desire to keep her spirits high. Gus is a great protagonist. He's an honest, well-meaning character whose logic occasionally backfires in the face of \\"real life\\" - the kind of funny and perplexed person we can all relate to.The book paints a vivid portrait of a summer in NYC during the \`80s. Better yet, it's not a kitschy/trendy portrayal of the recent past. Instead, it's a lovingly rendered glimpse at the old neighborhoods and their denizens from an insider's perspective that allows for both nostalgia and sympathetic critique. (The scene where Gus' stockbroker buddy waxes philosophical about the power of grade-school nicknames is a personal favorite.)In the end, Gus Perazzo's success is also the novel's - each unsettling little event makes room for a bigger heart and a more encompassing perspective towards life. It's a \\"feel good\\" novel that doesn't try to make the world any less complicated than it really is. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Plumbing in Harlem","review":"I hastily threw this book into my suitcase on my way off to a two-week summer vacation. A friend had recommended the book and it didn't look too long or too serious, a seemingly perfect travel read. Turns out I couldn't put it down for two days, even to get in the pool!The main character Gus is on summer break and temping as a plumber's helper in New York City while he waits to become a professor at a small Midwestern college in the fall. Among other reasons, he chooses to move back \\"home\\" for a NYC summer to be with his terminally ill mother. This situation, along with a large Italian family, makes the perfect backdrop for the real-life moments and family dynamics the book presents. It's also the perfect setup for a good dose of hilarity in between.I loved the author's use of dialog in this book. Conversations made every character instantly believable so I truly felt I knew each one by the book's end. The writing is also spry and lyrical. Chapters are often miniature stories but each is flawlessly woven to the next as you are lead through the crossroads Gus suddenly faces in his life. And if you're like me, along the way you will surely identify your own family, friends and neighbors - even if you've never been in New York.A little suspense, a little humor, a little meaning of life - the perfect summer treat. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Plumbing in Harlem","review":"This book literally made me laugh out loud. It also deeply touched me. It's the story of one summer in the life of thirty year old Gus Perazzo who's about to finish up his Ph.D. in English and begin teaching literature. With a mother severely ill with cancer, Gus decides to spend his vacation back in Queens, New York, where most of his family members still live. It's not a good time to leave Michigan; his marriage with Angela, a Ph.D. candidate herself, is rocky. Decisions about jobs and moving must be made. But Gus decides his mother's illness merits the risk; he'll work for his brother-in-law, owner of Stavros Plumbing and Heating, and employer of Gus's younger brother, for one last summer at home.The story that unfolds is moving, funny and real. Chapters are short and engrossing enough to make you want to find out what happens next, but they also work as self-contained vignettes. Some concern working as a plumber's assistant in Harlem with a bunch of blue collar guys who have little use for Ph.D's in English. Some are about meeting up with old friends--and girlfriends--in a neighborhood where &quot;white flight&quot; has left its mark. And some are about the family Gus has come back to: brothers and sisters who argue and joke across the dinner table, a hardworking father who's still too shy to show affection to his son, a mother who's more comfortable, even now, giving than taking. In one of my favorite chapters, Gus wakes up early and goes downstairs to find Ana cooking for the family dinner. His intention is to talk with her, frankly, about her liver cancer. Instead, he receives a lesson about faith from his mother as she teaches her son very matter of factly how to make eggballs.Plumbing In Harlem is a pleasurable and fast read. Characters are believable and talk is the kind you've heard on the street and in family kitchens. But the novel is more than that. There's a real sweetness of heart in Benevento's writing that is never sentimental but made certain scenes stay with me long after I finished the book. One of the things Gus learns during his summer in Queens is to accept all gifts &quot;with pleasure and thanks.&quot; Think of this book as a little gift.

Grab this novel, crack open the first page, and learn how to be a plumber--Harlem stlye. The literary framework for this novel provides a combination of realms for the reader to flow easily and gaily in and out of.Accompany Gus, a 30 year-old college professor, first to the job sites, which include dilapidated apartment buildings minutes from the renovating Apollo Theatre, then to his home across town with his close-knit, mostly blue collar family, and finally through the terrain of gained and lost loves amid his anticipation of a new professorship in a remote town in the midwest. It is rare for novelists to pull off such generic premises with such ... fun.The comedy in the novel is charming, timely, and representative; the settings are also appropriate backdrops that represent the differences between the different lifestyles our protagonist, \\"Gus,\\" flows in and out of. Most intriguing of all, however, is Gus himself, a somewhat inept plumber, but overall highly intelligent and good-natured family man who reaches his destined epiphany near the novel's end through finally understanding just how important a strong, unified, and complete family is to him.Most readers will find this novel cheesy; it is. It definitely lacks the extent of intellectual probing the author is capable of. Do not expect an intellectual workout. Do expect a charming cast of characters in an engaging group of relationships and settings, a not-so-plumber guy you'll just love, and a uniquely fun dramatization of not-necessarily fun lives."},{"Title":"Plumbing in Harlem","review":"Plumbing in Harlem is an excellent book. A quick read, it is a &quot;slice of life&quot; in the complicated development of the main and other characters. It is a fine story in several respects. It has fine character development and strong dialogue. It is very much a New York City story, pulsing with the moods of New York City. It has portions that are both hilarious and bittersweet. I highly recommend Plumbing in Harlem."},{"Title":"Plumbing in Harlem","review":"The witty, light, and often lyrical writing style of this novel would be at odds with the obstacles facing its characters-irreparable relationships, exhausting renovations, the seeming inevitability of cancer-if it weren't for one undeniable fact: under Plumbing in Harlem beats the heart of optimism, of hope. The main character, Gus, wants to believe in something (anything, EVERYTHING) but at first cannot bring himself to accept the possibilities available to him. As I followed his journeys around New York, I found that the novel inspired me to want to believe; I began willing him to risk everything in order to hope. Gus is wonderfully realized; what's more, he's very, very human, in the sense that he comes alive on the page-passion, paranoia, and pet peeves intact.Most everything about this novel-dialogue, plot, setting, characters-is readily believable and inherently likeable. The fact that whole chapters could stand alone as short stories demonstrates Benevento's flair for creating self-contained scenes. At times the poetic turns of phrase in the novel caused me to linger at the end of a sentence or chapter, but the humor packed an even greater punch. The best and most memorable moments in the novel-the reunion with old neighborhood friends, the unpacking of an old woman's memorabilia and memories, the point at which Gus's mother shares recipes for living as she teaches him to cook-resonated with warmth and evoked in me the giddy pleasure of nostalgia. Inevitably, the novel reminds readers of something and someone familiar. I recognized Gus, his family and friends, his concerns and triumphs-and that recognition has allowed the novel to remain with me long after I closed the pages of the text itself."},{"Title":"Plumbing in Harlem","review":"This book literally made me laugh out loud.

I had read all of the Tales of the City series before this book was released and I worked at a library when I first saw it. I was briefly dissapointed that it wasn't more about our friends in Barbary Lane. Dissapointment gave way to wonder when I realized he was writing about a dwarf woman who was my exact age at that time!When I finally had the chance to read it, I was finding that he was expressing a lot of things that I'd felt in my life but I had not the eloquence to describe it! I can remember the quote about &quot;going through the tiresome ritual of explaining myself&quot; and there was another great quote about how a Little Person must honor other people's feelings over their own and forgive again and again just to be a part of the human race and not be corroded by their own anger.There were also very funny scenes that may not have happened to me (I love that bit with the dog in Rodeo Drive) but I sure can picture how it'd be if it did! Another cool thing, I do have a best friend named Renee who happens to be Average-sized!I love how he made Cady live and breathe and not be a character who moped all day because of her dwarfism but faced life head-on, as must we all. That is the gripe I have with &quot;Stones From The River&quot; and &quot;The Dork From Cork&quot;. These Average-Sized authors spend more time than necessary pointing out that their dwarf characters hate their condition and long to be tall. How one-dimensional! Armistead Maupin has the gift of seeing through the eyes of a dwarf woman and telling her tale and making her human. It helps that he actually was friends with a dwarf, the other two authors, Ursela Hegi and Chet Raymos, who are both very good in their field, had never met Little People before writing their books. The difference shows.I love, love, love this book and it tickles me to death that one of my favorite authors could get into my head and say stuff I've wanted to say all my life, and he understands. Read this book. It's fun, educational and you will get a different viewpoint that will, nonetheless be something that will be familiar to you!"},{"Title":"Maybe the Moon","review":"Armistead Maupin is better known for his Tales of the City series, but I liked Maybe the Moon much better. It is a very clever story of a dwarf who played an ET-like character in a movie years ago, and has not been able to advance her career since. (I heard somewhere that the book is actually based on the life of the short person who played inside of ET.) The character development is great, and the story takes some unexpected turns, including a surprise romance, which I found quite satisfying. My favorite books have sadness mixed in with humor, as does this one. I guess this reflects real life. This book is quick to read and thoroughly enjoyable"},{"Title":"Maybe the Moon","review":"MAYBE THE MOON by Armistead MaupinArmistead Maupin does a change of scenery from San Francisco, which was the center of his six books collectively known as TALES OF THE CITY, to Los Angeles with MAYBE THE MOON, Armistead Maupin's first full-length novel. Although TALES OF THE CITY had been written first, these books started out as newspaper columns and have a distinct feel to them. They are more lighthearted and the characters are not fully developed. MAYBE THE MOON is indeed a novel, the story of the life of a spirited woman who learned to deal with a type of disability. It was with great pleasure that I read this book and got to know the character that was Cadence Roth.Cadence Roth is a pint-sized person, legally classified as a dwarf, and although she is a very small person, her personality definitely is not minute or diminutive. In fact, she packs a punch and from such a little human being, she can shock others with her foul mouth and assertive ways.Maupin starts the novel with a blurb from a review: Mr. Woods (1981) C-112 m. ****. It's the start of a movie synopsis from the movie critic Leonard Maltin's book \\"TV Movies and Video Guide 1992 edition\\".Thus, the novel begins. Told via her journal, we are thrown into the world of Cady Roth, whose claim to fame was the starring (anonymous) role in the 2nd highest grossing movie of all time, MR. WOODS. She played an elf that befriends a young boy, but because of the type of role she played, she is behind a mask the entire time. The real world never learns who the actor behind Mr. Woods really was. She is forbidden to do any publicity for the movie except in costume, as the director feels the audience would lose the magic if they saw who actually played this beloved movie character. While other actors build their careers upon a breakthrough role, Cady is doomed to have this one big character haunt her till the day she dies.And so Cady lives on in frustration. She finds whatever work is available, which is not very much since the average movie doesn't usually call for a character that is less than 4 feet tall. She at one point breaks down and takes a job with a small group of people who entertain the rich and famous at parties held in towns like Beverly Hills. She dresses up as a clown, making children laugh at birthday parties and bar mitzvahs.References to THE WIZARD OF OZ are often made, as she relates to other dwarves who have been exploited or made it in the world of show biz. Her mother had a very important role in Cady's life, helping her become discovered and then pushing her on, making sure that her daughter's dreams were fulfilled despite the handicap of height. When her mother passes on, Cady is devastated but eventually hooks up with a new best friend, Renee, who latches on to Cady in a welcome way and the two become roommates and best friends for life.Cady's life seems to be on a downward spiral, as the jobs with the entertainment company become scarce, and there doesn't seem to be any hope in her securing an acting job, but she does not give up. When news that there will be a big Star Studded tribute in honor of a major anniversary of the release of MR. WOODS, Cady feels this is her last chance at being recognized. What happens on this big day leads to the climax of the book with an ending that I did not expect, although there were hints of it throughout the book.MAYBE THE MOON is probably Armistead Maupin's best work yet. The story of the life of Cady Roth touched me in many ways, and indeed I feel envious that Maupin knew the woman that this book was inspired by. Whoever she was, she was indeed a very special person. A story about people overcoming handicaps and differences in a world that abhors such people, MAYBE THE MOON gets five stars from me."},{"Title":"Maybe the Moon","review":"This is one of my favorite books of all time. I love Maupin's Tales of the City books, but those didn't prepare me for how much I'd love MAYBE THE MOON. When I think back on it, the first thing that comes to mind is the sadness. Overall, it's very bittersweet, and there are parts that are very sad. However, I think those parts are freshest in my mind because they have the strongest emotions associated with them. Although there are sad parts, I wouldn't call this a sad story. There are many parts that are a lot of fun. Most importantly, much of the book is very inspiring. When you combine these elements with an interesting plot and great characters, the result is a true winner. I've actually bought at least four copies of this book at different times. Besides my own copy, I've given copies as gifts to various people - friends with whom I want to share the message that dreams really can come true if we work for them. As far as I know, MAYBE THE MOON is the only stand-alone novel Maupin has written. So what have you been up to lately, Armistead? Get writing!"},{"Title":"Maybe the Moon","review":"Armistead Maupin has been one of my favorite writers since way back when his Tales of the City was serialized in the San Francisco Chronicle. I read all of them and then just kept going, reading everything he's ever written. Maybe the Moon is one of his most poignant and one of his best.For this masterpiece, we have a change of venue from SF to LA, and instead of the broad humor with which Maupin painted the characters in the Tales series, he's delved deeply into the development of his protagonist, Cadence Roth, a dwarf. Although teensy, there's nothing small about her personality, a personality that is thwarted only by the fact that she rose to movie fame wearing a highly-recognizable costume in a famous sci-fi movie - and by contract she's forbidden from revealing her real ID. We follow her from one career disappointment to the next, and her personal life isn't very hopeful, either. In spite of a bit of a shocker ending, Maybe the Moon (great title, very apt) is really a paean of hopefulness for people who are different, and you end up smiling thru your tears."},{"Title":"Maybe the Moon","review":"This is one of the best fiction books I have read. As an average sized person, I found this extraordinarily enlightening as to the difficulties and prejudices that little people go through each and every day. It was one of the most unique love stories ever and it really, truly made me feel the full gamut of emotions. If you buy one fiction book in your life, this is the one."},{"Title":"Maybe the Moon","review":"Received this book out of the blue from a seller on Amazon who bundled this with an order I placed. Tossed it aside for half a year before I sat down to read it last night and did NOT put it down until the last page -- then went back to the beginning once more. Touching, warm, creative, full of personality. At worst, it's entertaining. Do read it."},{"Title":"Maybe the Moon","review":"Don't take this wrong, but I read this book expecting it to be alot like 'Tales of the City' novels. They are incredibly entertaining books but light fare reading. This book was amazingly complex. Mr. Maupin wrote about Cadence with such love and respect. I can tell this novel came from alot of heart. I felt as if I knew Cady and was a close friend. She was far from being a victim or pitiful. She was very witty and although she encountered so much pain in her life, she lived life to its fullest.The ending was utterly heartbreaking. It reminded me a bit of the movie 'The Player'. Where the production staff has a story re-written because they find a persons appearance offensive or objectionable. By the time the filming starts, the entire story changed from what the author ever intended.I have this book on my shelf and plan on keeping it there. I do not plan on selling it or re-reading it, however, it made such an impression on me. I think I will keep it for a very long time to remind me to appreciate other peoples differences and be grateful for what I do have."},{"Title":"Maybe the Moon","review":"Having dutifully read through ALL of Maupin's *Tales of the City* novels, becoming increasingly grumpy as the formula become increasingly stale, I did not expect a lot out of *Maybe the Moon* except perhaps another quick, romp-ish read. I was pleasantly surprised, however, to find that this novel is inspired, witty, and socially ignificant without being excessively preachy. The narrative voice of Cadence Roth is convincing, the supporting characters are not just cardboard cutouts, and the story line has enough unpredictable twists and turns to keep a reader turning the pages with anticipation right up until the ending, which I found powerful, indeed.I liked this book a lot, and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a novel that is both entertaining and thoughtful."},{"Title":"Maybe the Moon","review":"This book was great! Armistead Maupin definately did it again! For someone known for his quirky tales of life in San Francisco he nailed the quirks of Hollywood perfectly!

What a wonderful surprise to be given a peek inside a world so different from my own! I am 6'2&quot; and have often felt the same way when being repeatedly questioned in my lifetime about my height. Though many may think it's not so unusual to be a woman this tall, I can say that many people like to ask me about it. Though I don't go as far to say I'm questioned nearly as often as Cadence, it was reassuring to hear Maupin's sympathetic story. I felt something so deep when she described climbing the stairs on her hands and knees. What a different world from my own, yet similar in an odd way too.Maupin's work flows so easily and is a lot of fun to read. I highly reccomend for anyone who wants a laugh and peek into the life of an everyday woman trying to build a career.BTW, Jillaroo, I live in Michigan too and would love to hear from you. You sound like a really fun person and your review is much better than mine. *smile*"},{"Title":"Maybe the Moon","review":"This book is simply wonderful. The radically odd group of characters are compelling, fascinating, and amazingly real and human. The underbelly of Hollywood--where the struggle is acute, the humiliations constant, and the fame and glitz a nearly-tangible mirage--is perfectly rendered. The story is wonderful, careening from hilarity to tragedy in abruptly jarring transitions yet managing with each event to draw you deeper into the heroine's world.And the heroine! Cadence Roth is THE most inspiring, aggravating, disturbing, and fascinating character ever written about. This is her story, as told through her journal entries--yet the novel isn't written with the jarring style that usually accompanies 'diary-narrative,' instead the dialog and descriptives are perfectly seamless, and the first person delivery is comforting through even the most trying times.The most fascinating thing about this novel is that it is clearly inspired by real events, real people, and a real life--and most of it is pretty easily identifiable. This just added to my enjoyment of this book--and I have some research to do to figure out the parts I couldn't identify.I can't recommend this book highly enough--it's simply wonderful on every level. This book is a huge departure, in many ways, from Maupin's other books (which are also wonderful), but Maupin's ability to create rich, complex characters and bring a subculture to life are in full evidence here."},{"Title":"Maybe the Moon","review":"This truly is one of the best books that I have ever read. It is one of those softly quiet stories about the experiences of one person and all those around her- and it is a story that a reader can enjoy again and again on many different levels. There is the obvious connection to the whole ET/Big Budget movie machine that is Hollywood, and then there are the abject prejudices of society that we have all been guilty of, but really, this is a well written story about the life of one woman who really made what she did count."},{"Title":"Maybe the Moon","review":"This is a thoroughly enjoyable novel that is both heartbreaking and hilarious. Cadence Roth is a dwarf living in Hollywood under the shadow of a famous character she onced played. She just wants to be an actress, but as you can imagine roles for dwarves are few and far between. Although it would be easy to feel sorry for Cadence we don't, she's just too resourceful, witty and strong for pity. Cadence's story is not always a happy one, but it is ultimately uplifting. A highly recommended novel."},{"Title":"Maybe the Moon","review":"Being a little person myself I can definately relate to this book. The character felt all the feelings I do as I go thru life. Its hard to be taken seriousely when your a little person, especially in the romantic department. This is a terrific story."},{"Title":"Maybe the Moon","review":"This is such a moving, heartrending story, filled with humor and sadness. The character of Cady is so well-developed I came to think of her as a real person. Her friends were also very likeable. I can't even begin to express how wonderful this book is."},{"Title":"Maybe the Moon","review":"I think the last pages of this book are the most depressing (but in a good way!) pages I have read so far! Just for what's written there, you've got to read Maybe the moon. It reveals America in its most obscene way, in a way that makes you shiver with rage. Mr Maupin has this talent to point very accurately what's wrong in the &quot;image culture&quot; today: he's a subtle activist for the great human cause!"},{"Title":"Maybe the Moon","review":"I agree with the previous reviewer, this is tight, funny, wicked writing, with a wonderful current of pathos and honesty. All the characters feel honest and real.Even with out all that, a major reason worth reading this book for is the &quot;added&quot; LAST chapter- a wonderful 'Take That!' to Hollywood. After all the 'trials and tribulations' Mr. Maupin went through getting Tales of the City (GREAT book!)made- make this chapter even more delicious and well, hysterical...and for all you Tales fans, one secondary (Ned) character from Tales makes an appearance briefly-Enjoy Maybe the Moon!"},{"Title":"Maybe the Moon","review":"My wonderful partner gave this book to me as a Christmas gift in 1993. I have probably read the book at least 5 or 6 times since then. I enjoyed Maupin's The Tales of the City series except the last two books which were dissapointing. I hated The Night Listener.I think that maybe the Moon is Maupin's best work. It's funny and very sad and moving at the same time. It's hard not to fall in love with the character of Cady."},{"Title":"Maybe the Moon","review":"Maybe the Moon: A NovelIt was a good read; but i like the Tales in the City books better.I am glad I read it though and must admit I sympathized with the main character. It is well written and I do recommend it."},{"Title":"Maybe the Moon","review":"I was given this book by my mother who knows I love Maupin's writing. What I don't think either of us knew is that once I starting turning the pages on this great book, I could not put it down and I stayed up all night reading about this character that touched my heart.I was so pleasantly surprised by this story. It actually has made a lasting impression on me. I was truly impacted in a positive way. Enjoy it. Make sure to have a free day or two to enjoy it fully. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Maybe the Moon","review":"My title says it all. I'm not going to write a long, involved review. Suffice to say, I read a lot. A LOT. And this one is definitely in my top 5.I noticed below under \\"tag suggestions\\" that it has \\"gay fiction\\" and \\"gay classic\\" (I assume because the author is gay), and I want to point out that (from what I remember) there is no homosexuality in this book. (Not that there's anything wrong with homosexuality, yada, yada, yada...)It's funny and touching. I've read it several times over the years, and it's always stayed with me.His \\"Tales of the City\\" books are great too, but this one just stood out for me as an all-time great."},{"Title":"Maybe the Moon","review":"I read Cadence's story with much discomfort. I felt sorry for her (though Cadence didn't at all feel sorry for herself) and wanted to be finished with the book though I didn't want to stop reading. The end absolutely stunned me. I just didn't see it coming and I was saddened and outraged and couldn't get Cadence off my mind for a few days.Cadence is probably the most unforgettable character I have ever met in my reading.I listened to Maupin's Tales of the City books on tape and though I enjoyed listening to them more than I enjoyed reading Maybe the Moon, the latter book, without a doubt, made a huge impact on me."},{"Title":"Maybe the Moon","review":"Here is Maupin at his best. He writes a great story, dropping subtle and not so subtle hints about a small person and their struggles in Hollywood. I was amazed at his detail, and how much it was believable. I constantly was thinking back to 1981, when I was 5 and watching a very famous movie! This was great. Makes me want to reread this book again. (the first time was 1998 and I still remember this book in great detail!)"},{"Title":"Maybe the Moon","review":"I too liked this novel better than the Tales of the City books. Maupin has such a unique gift of prose, and this novel shows how capable he is of narrating an account of someone who is completely opposite of himself. Cadence may not be tall in stature, but her heart and her soul are huge. The reader is never asked to feel sorry for Cadence and I never did. She is a plucky, resourceful, witty heroine who makes no apologies about who she is and what she's accomplished. Anyone who feels different, whether gay or straight, short or tall will cry and laugh along w/Cadence."},{"Title":"Maybe the Moon","review":"i really enjoyed this book -- it makes great reading material during changeovers.really boosts my second serve in the ad court.i recommend it to tennis players everywhere."},{"Title":"Maybe the Moon","review":"I did not care for this work about the drarf although I imagine she like so many people who are different had a very difficult time in life the suibject matter was not my cup of tea as to reading material.

What stood out for me was how \\"human\\" the popes are despite their role as the \\"Holy Father\\""},{"Title":"The Vatican empire","review":"I was speaking to a friend about the Catholic Church and how it seems to want to interfere in every government, especially the U.S., when it comes to \\"birth control\\" issues when I remembered this book so vividly. I decided to look it up on Amazon to see if it was still available along with any others for my friend to read. The first thing I noticed was only one customer review which I read and when I saw it was by a Catholic Priest I was especially interested in what he would have to say. Talk about \\"deflection\\"! This book is about the finances of the Catholic Church and it is an expose on how they exploit the public, especially the Catholics who contribute to the so called \\"poor box\\" in their own dioces. What goes in does not go back to the dioces but into the Vatican coffers and it DOES NOT go to the so called \\"poor\\" but to the massive investments whose returns go right back into the Vatican investments! Only 5% goes into any kind of charities. Mr. LoBello, a Catholic himself, was shocked while he served as their head accountant for from what I remember, at least 10 years. I was hoping to find more books on this subject but it would seem that the Catholic Church has sealed shut the doors after this one escaped!This book is still worth a read in 2012, as I am sure nothing has changed! I just heard a Catholic Priest pontificate about \\"Moral Responsibility\\" of the Catholic Church and what qualified for it and the U.S. Government. How dare him after what the \\"big business\\" entity the Catholic Church represents. Immorality at its best!"},{"Title":"Ways of Escape","review":"because this book leaves me feeling that he felt his life was unreal and his fiction was real.He lived in boredom punctuated by terror--manic/depressive, opium smoking, Russian roulette playing, suicidal.Was he a spy, even after he left the Foreign Office? Was writing his cover for travel? Does boredom fully explain his uncanny knack for being in troubled places in troubled times?No matter. He was a great stylist and craftsman. This autobiography (along with \\"A Sort of Life\\") is worth reading for his methods as a novelist and for portraits of friends, such as Waugh and Herbert Reed."},{"Title":"Ways of Escape","review":"Being a writer myself, I have a particular fondness for writer's memoirs. In particular, I've found memoirs written by Philip Caputo, William Manchester, and Stephen King to be particularly enjoyable to read. This one, by Graham Greene, is my favorite of them all. He led an event-filled, spectacular life. He went on patrols with Gurkha troops in Malaya, worked for British intelligence in Africa, lived and worked in Indochina/Vietnam during the French occupation, even reported from Dien Bien Phu. But beyond the subject matter, it's Greene's mastery of the language that is primarily responsible for the magnificence of this book. That, and the fact that he is honest, open, and utterly unapologetic about many things that someone less brave might have kept to himself.But as I said, more than anything, read it for the language. Greene was one of the greatest authors to ever work in the English language, and if you've never read anything of his you have a wonderful experience waiting for you, if you only pick up one of his books.Example? Here is Greene capturing a subjective experience in just a few words, one that is particularly difficult to explain to someone who has never experienced it first hand. Most authors who have tried have failed. About his first experience with opium, he says\\"It was like the first glimpse of a beautiful woman with whom, one realizes, a relationship is possible.\\"The book is full of gems like that. It is a joy to read."},{"Title":"Ways of Escape","review":"I'd have to agree with another reviewer who characterized this as \\"odd.\\" Greene was apparently writing this in his 70s, and the prose isn't always as pellucid as one would wish. His writing career spanned roughly 1930 to 1980, and in spite of my cavil on the datedness of his style he is unarguably a major 20th century literary figure. (Apparently there's a huge 3-volume biography on him available.)The essays really meander between the struggles he underwent in writing, his travels, his impressions of the political problems on the ground in Malaysia, Haiti, Vietnam and Cube between WWII and the 1970s.It's full of juicy anecdotes, including his mixed experiences with Hollywood trying to bring some of his work to film. If you've enjoyed some of his novels (which, sadly, are dated as to style now, inevitably), you should pick this up from the library or a used book store and get some background on Greene's demons and motivations..."},{"Title":"A cry in the jungle bar (Picador fiction)","review":"Having spent some time overseas as a bullish, big bloke in a strange land - and more than once - I think I was probably hardwired to like this book. For a couple of reasons, it seemed to really hit home with me.The story adeptly skewers the ex-pat community throughout Asia, and it captures the difficulty inherent in living in a place that's not your real home. The way Australia interacts with Asia - awkwardly, lumbering - is communicated curiously successfully through Dick Cullen, a beautifully melancholic Kim Beazley of a bloke.Cullen's traipsing through Asia - his attempts to fit into the culture, to fit in the different social circles, none of which appear to really work - and his relationship (or lack thereof) with his wife combine to provide a note-perfect portrait of a flawed, sad man. There's a lot to identify with, if you've experienced some of the things this contested character has.I've liked Robert Drewe's writing - particularly Grace and The Drowner - for some time, and have since been working my way through his back catalogue. And I have to say that A Cry In The Jungle Bar has exceeded any expectations. I think it's become my favourite of his works."},{"Title":"A cry in the jungle bar (Picador fiction)","review":"This is one of several Australian novels from the 1970s-80s which explore the plight of Australians in South-East Asia. Expatriate scientist and ageing rugby hero Dick Cullen has relocated to the Philippines with Margaret, his allegedly neurotic wife. Cullen works for the UN and is compiling a report about the use of the water buffalo in Asian agriculture. To complete the report, Cullen and two colleagues embark on a regional tour through an increasingly dangerous and Americanized Asia; a tour which, for Cullen, becomes ever more harrowing. Meanwhile, Margaret seeks relief in Eastern mysticism, fad diets and faith healing. Drewe's Asia is one of exotic-erotic charge and the danger of political unrest. He has constructed a very readable novel. It has action, psychological insight, intrigue and \`seedy foreigners': everything you could want in this kind of book. Yet it also raises at least three deeper issues: the relationship between masculine anxiety and games of power; the misrepresentation of Asian women as exotic, sexually-available playthings; and the conflict between scientific and spiritual perceptions of experience. Cullen is a man whose size, science and masculinity are being systematically attacked by Asia, and in the particular challenges it makes to him (physical, sexual and epistemological) it becomes a projection of some uniquely Australian concerns. More complex than it seems."},{"Title":"Alberta Brides: Unchained Hearts/The Heart Seeks a Home/Chastity's Angel/Crane's Bride (Heartsong Novella Collection)","review":"I wasn't Crazy About the First story in the book. but the other 3 were awesome.

On this book we really aren't given much to work with, just a very simple painting with very simple, non-detailed artwork. The gentlemen in the cover is either Fallon, or it depicts a stranger in the town of Fallon. I can't be sure because I didn't read the book. But based on the cover art, I probably don't want to."},{"Title":"Fallon","review":"Fallon is the best Louis L'Amour book I have read. It contains several shootouts, brawls, and poker games in addition to other exciting plot elements. Fallon also introduces some of L'Amour's best characters and zings the reader with an unexpected twist in the climax. It is truly a must-read for anyone who enjoys westerns!"},{"Title":"Fallon","review":"With Fallon Louis L'Amour comes up with a very different main character. Fallon isn't a gunfighter or cattleman; he's a gambler and a complicated individual. I've read a great many excellent books by Louis L'Amour, and have enjoyed all of them but to be honest, they are uneven. By this I mean that some of them are much better than others.Fallon is one that I flat out loved; one that I remember well, and of all of L'Amour's always fun to read Westerns, I think Fallon is one of the best."},{"Title":"Fallon","review":"I can't believe this was the first western I ever read, I'll defintely search out more. This is good fun right from the first paragraphs \\"Macon Fallon was a stranger to Seven Pines, and fortunately he was a stranger with a fast horse\\" - from the opening lines I was carried along.The story follows Macon Fallon, as you know from the above, a stranger to Seven Pines who manages to upset some gamblers and escapes from the lynching - but gets himself in a bad way travelling in the dry areas without water. Just in time he sees a small wagon train and hatches a plan. There is a deserted town up behind the trail, he realises if he can get the wagoners to set up the town again he can make a pile and start a new life out west. It is kind of a scam, but he feels some guilt, they are decent people and he doesn't swindle decent people.The hero is good fun, at once self-deprecating good humour, and next strong and able hero to the wagoners and against the local unsavoury and highly violent gang. One of the Wagoners, Ginia, an attractive young woman, smart and brave.the story bounded along, its a short and punchy novel, the only thing I found I disliked was the long discussion of poker hands. The hero and the writing reminded me strongly of Lee Child and I wondered if Child was a L'amour fan - maybe I need to read more of this sort of stuff.Loved it, will read more of Louis L'amour's books."},{"Title":"Fallon","review":"&quot;Fallon&quot;, by Louis L'Amour, was entertaining, fast reading, and lightly sprinkled with philosophical statements as are all the westerns I have read by him. Although there is romance in the novel, it is very light and occurs almost unexpectedly.Macon Fallon is a card player on the run, but seeing a sign for an old abandoned town and finding two families with a broken wagon wheel, he schemes to re-establish the town with a new name. Ultimately, he hopes to sell the claim to a mine nearby the town, and then flee with the profits. But Fallon grows to like the town and its people, which makes the choice for him to leave more difficult. A final gunfight seals Fallon's fate in several ways."},{"Title":"Fallon","review":"This western from Louis L'Amour was released in February, 1963, remaining in print every since. The locale of this western novel is Nevada pretty much in the center of the state. The fictional town of Red Horse is very close to Iron Mountain, sandwiched in between the Desatoya mountains and the Toiyabe mountain range to the east. With Red Horse about 100 miles east of both Carson City and Virginia City. The town, whose elevation is a little over 10,000 feet, also lays north of the Great Basin.As stated in the story, it takes place after a time that the wagon trains have pretty much played out, as true with many gold mines. The wagon trains coming through now are generally ones of merchandise and equipment to resupply the gold camps, rather than carrying settlers.The new name of the town that Macon helps establish is Red Horse, previously know as Buell's Bluff, a gold camp town that went bust and became deserted. The theme of this novel is much involved with town building explaining in simple terms just what it took to establish a western town of the mid to late 1800's, and the components of a typical mining town on the plains. Mr. L'Amour, in fact, had actually built a replica western town only a short time prior to his death.This town is directly situated in an area that the Ute Indians still claim, so there is a possiblity of Indian attack, and at one point in the story, Fallon comes under attack by a party of at least 6 Utes. Readers of Mr. L'Amour's books such as Bendigo Shafter, Passin Through, or Milo Talon, among others, will be reminded that he had great interest in western towns: what it took to build them and just what components comprised them. And though Fallon is a fictional treatment, the story offers great factual insight into both the elements of a western town and the various peoples who lived in them and made them survive.The story moves along very well and is humorous at certain spots, and while I don't rank this story with Shalako, Hondo, or some others, it is enjoyable.So if you are interested in Louis L'Amour and his work this one will offer a few hours reading. He spent his life writing these books and the enjoyment and practical knowledge he held readily comes through.So saddle a good horse, check the bullet loads in your pistol, and get a good supply of water before we hit the trail. Remember, those water holes can be very far apart. With bandit gangs and predatory Indians sprinkled along the trails.Semper Fi."},{"Title":"Fallon","review":"'Fallon' was a pretty interesting western by the late, great Louis L'Amour.

Could have some help by placing names on the page the animals are on would have been more exciting and would spark some interaction between reader and child.

It simply told of man walking along, observing animals, and naming them. It's not the only simple song that Dylan ever wrote, but with its island-like beat, it is infectious. This is a Bob Dylan song that can be shared with very young children, requiring little explanation. And it's a great one to get up and jump around to, or -- if you prefer -- dance.Award-winning children's illustrator Jim Arnosky has taken Dylan's lyrics and paired them with a beautifully vibrant storybook, \\"Man Gave Names to All the Animals,\\" that captures the happy, funky sound of the original song.Packaged with the book is a CD with the song performed by Bob Dylan. It warms my baby-boomer heart to imagine three-year-olds rocking to classic Dylan. Can \\"Maggie's Farm\\" be far behind?Arnsoky has populated his book with an astounding variety of animals (yes, even a flamingo) from all parts of the world. There are fish, birds, insects, and mammals that would never see each other in life (except on Animal Planet) gathered together on the pages of \\"Man Gave Names to All the Animals,\\" and the effect is enchanting.While most of the animals are familiar, there are sure to be a few that stump readers. There are more than 170 animals illustrated, and they are listed at the end of the book, alphabetically. Those who need clues so that they, too, can name the animals can go to [...].\\"Man Gave Names to All the Animals\\" is a fun book for adults and children to share, made even better by the inclusion of the CD, making it perfect for a sing-along -- or a silly-along if you prefer. Keep this lovely hardcover book in mind for holiday gift-giving...and don't forget the kazoos!Bottom Line: Would I buy \\"Man Gave Names to All the Animals\\"? You better believe it!

A cheetah, heron and zebra mix at the swirling water's edge, watching sailfish leap past salmon and a toothy tiger shark.Together, parents and children can play endless games of \\"I spy with my little eye\\" while reading this book. Children can also savor it alone by listening to the enclosed CD recording of Dylan's song."},{"Title":"Man Gave Names to All the Animals","review":"My son is only a few months old, and he really responds to the vivid colors in this book. More than any other book we have, the pictures truly excite him. We strongly recommend it."},{"Title":"Man Gave Names to All the Animals","review":"This book is beautifully illustrated, but the story/song is also fantastic. It's the Bob Dylan song (that many are familiar with!) and it comes with the CD with the song on it. It's actually a children's CD that I don't go crazy listening to after the 500th time! And trust me, we have probably really listened to it 500 times! My kids love it! I put it in and the first time they just dance around. Then the second time they sit and look at the gorgeous pictures in the book. And then, they usually play it about 10 more times before taking a break. They read the book alone as well. Well, they just look at the pictures since they can't read, but soon they will have it all memorized and can at least pretend to read it!I can say that as a parent this book is perfect. I can read/sing it to them pretty quickly and the illustrations are beautiful and you find new animals every time. Like I said, the CD isn't annoying (who doesn't like Bob Dylan?!) and I don't go crazy listening to it over and over. The book can keep the kids entertained by itself if the CD were to break.This has been THE BOOK for the past week since it arrived on our front porch. We got other books too but this is the one they are so focused on they haven't even paid attention to the others!I have the new edition illustrated by Jim Arnosky. I didn't even know about a previous edition but looking through reviews it becomes apparent that there was one!"},{"Title":"Man Gave Names to All the Animals","review":"Bob must appreciate the illustrations in this book. My nieces and nephews do. We get a kick out of listening to the song on the CD and reading the text along with it. The drawings are appealing and only a bit bizarre. Gives the kids an antidote to Berenstain Bears.Grown ups would like this books, too."},{"Title":"Man Gave Names to All the Animals","review":"This is a great book, but unfortunately out of print. I had been searching prices, and amazon had a vendor that was excellent. This is a great addition for a Bob Dylan collector."},{"Title":"Man Gave Names to All the Animals","review":"Bob Dylan's song \`Man Gave Names to All the Animals' from his album \`Slow Train Running' is the text in this illustrated book for children. The drawings by Jim Arnosky are colorful and eye catching sure to interest very young non-readers. Unfortunately Arnosky's presentations have creatures from different biomes appearing in the same pictures. Granted this is not a biology book but children w/b presented with a variety of misleading information in their young lives, why not at minimum present something factual? Also, the lyrics to the song are written phonetically. When Dylan pronounces \`I' as \`Ah', the printed text reflects the pronunciation. Again, why have misleading information in a children's book? Also, at the end of the book there is a listing by name of the animals that appear in the book but no cross-reference to help readers put names w/pictures. (There was one animal drawing I could not identify). One positive aspect of this volume is that the book does contain a cd of Dylan singing the original song so new readers can follow the text while listening to the words. Nice method for word recognition.Dylan fans will likely pick this item up, read it once, then consign it to their \`Dylan shelf'. Strictly for Bob Dylan fans.*This review refers to the 2010 edition.*"},{"Title":"Man Gave Names to All the Animals","review":"I've always liked the poetry of Bob Dylan and was happy for this form to share him with my little great-nephew.

Quick service, no problems."},{"Title":"Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats","review":"Axel Scheffler may be better known for illustrating the Julia Donaldson Gruffalo series. However, he has branched out to draw pictures for earlier works, including the T.S. Eliot cat poems. Scheffler has produced a marvellous edition, fit to stand alongside the previous illustrated editions of the whole book. Scheffler's illustrations are kid-friendly but yet they don't condescend or become overly cute and childish.His treatment of the poems is so different from the previous illustrations for these poems. The illustrations are in vignettes and accompany the poems in various stages. The Bentley and Gorey editions tended to have one or two large plates for each poem. Occasionally he illustrates individual lines, such as the fakir who stares at Macavity when he levitates. I also like his sequence of pictures that play like a succession of scenes when the poems can't provide any words. I see this twice, during the Rum Tum Tugger and the Pekes and the Pollicles. One really likes the sequence of vignettes that accompany the muddle that the Tugger poses when he disrupts a housewife's sewing chores.The cats themselves are well-characterised, and Scheffler illustrates the different cat characters and different moods with different facial expressions.I would have liked it if individual lines had had their own illustrations and it would have been good for the text to wrap itself around the pictures. For instance it would have been good if Scheffler had drawn Growltiger attacking each of the animals and creatures in his path. I'm not saying this to upset the dignity of the original book. It would be more interesting in a picture book if there were more interaction between text and illustration, even for classics like this.I tend to like this better than the Bentley and Gorey editions, and this edition is really well worth it. The binding is of a very high quality and the pictures are printed on thick semi-gloss paper.I hope that one day that Quentin Blake could do an illustrated edition of the Practical Cats poems. His temperament would be suitable for this material."},{"Title":"Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats","review":"This is a very entertaining, illustrated book which we purchased because we love the Broadway musical CATS which is based on the writings of T.S.

She adores my two cats, so we try to envision them in the stories, and have even had lengthy conversations about what my cats' secret names might be. She is a very smart 4 year old, so for all the words she doesn't know (there are quite a lot, even some that I didn't know!) I explain to her the meaning. I think this is a fun way to help her with her vocabulary. Everyone who is a cat lover, young and old, should have this book.

Still, the poems are engaging, especially if you like cats."},{"Title":"Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats","review":"As a mystery author with my debut novel in its initial release that features a private investigator who is also a poet, I love this book. This verse collection is perhaps T.S. Eliot's most accessible work, and it provided the raw material for the fabulous musical CATS. I enjoy reading these poems, and I've enjoyed attending the musical. I think I saw CATS three times during its Winter Garden run, twice in Los Angeles, and once each in San Francisco and the Palm Springs area.

It works."},{"Title":"Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats","review":"Unlike The Waste Land or Four Quartets, this book was written poem by poem to amuse friends and children of Eliot's. Put together, it is not something as marvelous as his other work, but it was not meant to be that. Instead, it is a fabulous piece of children's literature, with interesting rhyme and meter and tongue-tripping language. Definitely recommended, but not a good example of &quot;typical&quot; Eliot."},{"Title":"Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats","review":"Two intersecting paths brought me to read T.S. Eliot's whimsical 1939 book of poetry, \\"Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats.\\" First, I have been reading poetry the past few weeks and was browsing the library for a short, unusual work. Second, I adopted a pet cat -- a little calico -- some months ago after more that 15 years without one. I had almost forgotten how companionable a cat could be. The new kitty inspired my reading of a so-so book or two. Then, the poetry and the cat led me to T.S. Eliot. In his book of practical cats, Old Possum, (1888 -- 1965), a great modernist poet, let his hair down.This little book, consists of 15 poems with the last one, \\"Cat Morgan Introduces Himself\\", added in 1952. The poems are short, rhythmical and rhymed. Eliot intended them for young children. They are delightful poetry in their own right with varied use of language and phrasing and poetic devices.The book became a famous musical and it is about a varied, eccentric menagerie of cats. The cats are recognizably feline and also manage to stand in for human types. The fourteen original poems tell an organized story with the first poem, \\"The Naming of Cats\\" setting the stage and the now penultimate poem, \\"The Ad-dressing of Cats\\" summarizing the story and bringing matters to a close. In between are 12 poems featuring a range of now famous cat characters.Every cat has \\"THREE DIFFERENT NAMES\\" we are told in the first poem: its given name, its particular name, and the name the cat keeps to itself. Which of the three names does Eliot use in the poems which follow? The poems tells the stories of cats with names such as Jennyanndots, the old Gumbie cat, the ill-fated Growltiger and his lady Griddlebone, and the obstinate Rum Tum Tugger. Eliot says of Rum Tum Tugger\\"For he will doAs he do doAnd there's no doing anything about it\\"!Further named cats include Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer, full of destruction and mischief, Old Deuteronomy, the GREAT RUMPUSCAT, who defuses a dog fight, Mr. Mistoffelees, Macavity, the Mystery Cat,Asparagus, Bustopher Jones, the man about town, and Skimbleshanks, the railway cat. With the possible exception of (Aspara)gus, these names appear to be particular rather than given names of the creatures.Then, Eliot returns in the 14th poem to offer thoughts on the nature of cats, and their difference from dogs:\\"Before a cat will condescendTo treat you as a trusted friend,Some little token of esteemIs needed, like a dish of cream:XXXXXXX XXXXXXA Cat's entitled to expectThese evidences of respect.And so in time you reach your aim,And finally call him by his NAME.\\"These poems are a treat to read. I was able without much effort to project them on to my cat. The poems also reminded me of my young far away granddaughters. I hope to take and read this little book to them on my next visit.Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats","review":"I had hoped for a more extensive selection of these poems. I was wanting to use it to show a gradnchild how the musical was adapted from the poems."},{"Title":"Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats","review":"Not that it matters as far as this review goes (Or does it?), but I feel that it needs to be pointed out that T.S. Eliot spent his informative years in the state of Missouri and in his own words, \\"It is self-evident that St. Louis affected me more deeply than any other environment has ever done. I feel that there is something in having passed one's childhood beside the big river, which is incommunicable to those people who have not. I consider myself fortunate to have been born here, rather than in Boston, or New York, or London.\\" There is much truth to those words.Be-that-as-it-may....I love this little volume; a collection really, of whimsical poems by a man of whom a good argument could be made was one of the, if not the, most influential poets of the 20th Century. This collection of poems in linked of course by its common theme which of course is cats. These poems are not typical of Eliot's overall body of work by any means and were written for the simple delight of amusing friends and children, a fact that has been pointed out in several other reviews here and a fact that needs to be strongly considered when reading this little book. Hey, the poet was having some fun and in doing so has passed that fun on to us the readers.Of course the musical \\"Cats\\" was based on these poems (One of my all time favorites I might add) but I have to tell you that I enjoy these select poems as stand alones just as much as I enjoyed the musical.I do not get the impression that Eliot was trying to make some profound poetic statement in this work. This is a selection of poems that was cobbled together and was not meant to be a complete work as they were written. This is another fact that the reader needs to remember when reading this little book.Cat lovers will most certainly enjoy these poems and most people reading them will be able to find either themselves or friends among this collection of cats. I know I found my self quite well described in \\"Old-Gumbie Cat,\\" much to my chagrin...even if the gender is wrong.The collection consists of fifteen poems and the edition I am reviewing here has been illustrated with black and white drawings by Edward Gorey, which makes this little book not only a delight to the ear; but also the eye.This is a collection, in one form or another, that I like to read and reread every few years, but then I am rather fond of cats.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats","review":"This is an excellent edition of a classic poetry book for adults and children.

Also helps you learn the lyrics to many CATS songs!"},{"Title":"Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats","review":"Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats is a volume of children's poetry first published in 1939. Eliot initially wrote the poems for his god-children, but this is no simplistic children's literature. T.S. Eliot was a master of his craft. The poems are simple stories about a variety of cats, each with a distinct personality and behaviors. The poems have a rhythm all their own and it matches the personality of the cat being described. While a poem about Bustopher Jones has an arch, airy tone, the poem about Skimbleshanks speeds along like the train he is on. This is an absolutely delightful collection.It wasn't until recently, when I saw the musical for the first time, that I learned that this collection was the basis for the musical: Cats. Not only did the musical bring to life the cats described by Mr. Eliot, but I was surprised by just how many songs in the show took the lyrics directly from Eliot's poems. That is a mark of a great collection of poems: that when they are lifted into song, those poems can make a great musical with few changes. Whether you like poetry, or not, I would recommend this collection. I do not read a lot of poetry, but I loved this collection. Whether you like cats, or not, I would still recommend this book. The way Eliot tells about the cats, you would almost swear they were real people and not just an animal."},{"Title":"Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats","review":"This book is a must have for anyone that has ever seen the musical, even if you hated it, this book will change your views.

My favorite cat is Macavity. If you've seen the musical Cats (which I haven't), here's the inspiration. This is also a great first book to get younger people interested in poetry. The language Eliot uses is flowery and catchy, and the subject matter is centered on those cute furballs.

I am, of course, talking about Cats. Most of the poems went directly into the show without any change whatever in their wording, and only three songs were added. Let's give full credit to Mr. Webber, It took a musical genius to do that, and one of the added songs, Memories, could stand alone as a masterpiece in any company, but most of the delight of the show comes from the wonderful feline characters created in this book.Jennyanydots, Old Deuteronomy, Gus the theatre cat, Spindleshanks, Bustipher Brown, McCavity, Mr. Mistofflees, Mungo Jerry, and Rumpleteaser all moved effortlessly from page to stage with no changes. That has to be some sort of record. If you loved Cats (the show) you need to read this book. If you love cats (the critters) you'll want to read this book. If you like poetry, you should read this book. If you like dogs, read the battle of the Pekes and the Pollicles.

It was also the inspiration behind the musical Cats, and everybody can certainly see why!Between some of the cheerful and bubbly poems you'll find, a discussion/interpretation of the social issues surrounding Eliot at that time, giving the reader an insight into the inspiration behind his poetry and into his psychology.Garnished with lovely illustrations to feed and humor your imagination, Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats has everything to become something for all of the family, and all generations to behold. I couldn't put it down, and it always beckons a re-read!"},{"Title":"Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats","review":"Even if there weren't other reasons for buying this book...the Edward Gorey illustrations alone would make it worthwhile. No one beats a good Edward Gorey illustration. He's one of a kind and his art enhances Cats perfectly."},{"Title":"Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats","review":"A slender, sly and witty book. Edward Gorey's drawings enliven and illuminate T.S. Eliot's verse. I didn't particularly enjoy the stage production of \\"Cats\\", but I found this book a delight. A must for cat lovers."},{"Title":"Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats","review":"Book contains poems of T.S. Eliot that Andrew Lloyd Weber used for songs in his award-winning musical CATS. Book was very reasonably priced and quickly sent. Only negative was that cost of shipping exceeded cost of the book."},{"Title":"Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats","review":"I love the musical cats and have been naming my own little kitty babies from this book. I will only use the names in the book for my babies as I feel that they deserve \\"special\\" names that not every cat has had. To date, I have used 6 names and have 2 more in reserve for my other 2 babies I will be purchasing. This book is a must have for all cat lovers or those who just like cute poetry. I highly recommend"},{"Title":"Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats","review":"The poems are fun to read. The one warning that I would give to other buyers is that there is some racist language in the book, but it's just in a couple of poems. The subject of the poems is not racist though. I wouldn't let it prevent you from buying the book, but there are terms in the book that might need to be explained to children."},{"Title":"Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats","review":"I'm proud to say that T.S Elliot is from my home town St.Louis!!!I actually remember reading \\"The Nameing of Cats\\" when I was in grade school.Please remember that this was originally written in the 30s. Some terms like \\"Chinks\\"( Mentioned in Growl Tiger's Last Stand. ) might be a little offensive by today's standards.It's still a great and classic book.Oh FYI if you're looking for a really good CATS the musical sound track I recomend the Austrailan version. It pretty close to the book. It even has the \\"Ballad of Billy McCaw\\"."},{"Title":"Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats","review":"This CD was precisely what I wanted. I'd hoped to get it faster (for a birthday gift), but was pleased with the product, the packaging, and the reasonable arrival time."},{"Title":"Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats","review":"Lovers of cats will adore this book. I bought three of them and gave two of them as gifts. THe poems are quirky, funny, and totally about cats and their peculiarities."},{"Title":"Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats","review":"Of the many cat related books i have stumbled accross in my lifetime, i have never encountered one so brilliantly written as this one. Perhaps it is because it was written by T.S. Elliot, or maybe because of its equally intelligent and amusing pictures - drawn by the ever brilliant and dreary Edward Gorey - that this book is ultimately the pride and glory of my shelf. Even as a college student, living off of the most meager of neccessities, would i recommend this book as a definite buy. And this is coming from someone who is often too stingy to buy kleenex. For a scant $15 you can enjoy the cat related, heart warming, truthfull and hysterical lyrics of Elliot, in the slim and good looking orange edition jacket, forever and always. One of the best purchases of the decade."},{"Title":"Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats","review":"We saw the show recently at a community theater. It was wonderful. My 7-yr. old grandaughter loved it, so we decided to buy the DVD and the original book. Excellent!"},{"Title":"Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats","review":"Book was in good condition and arrived on time. Would buy from this seller again."},{"Title":"Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats","review":"I enjoyed the poems so much that I gave the book to a friend as a gift."},{"Title":"Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats","review":"Book, movie, soundtrack... all good but the book is the best. The book is filled with many cat poems (duh!). My personal favorite is Cat Morgan Introduces Himself, but there are many other good poems too."},{"Title":"Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats","review":"On the one hand the poems in this collection are a bit of light nonsense, on the other they do offer bits of practical advice, like the last lines of the final poem: \\"You'll save yourself time, and you'll spare yourself labour/If jist you make friends with the Cat at the door.\\" Bits like this pop up every now and then, but by and large the poems are observations in rhyme about various types of cats you may know and love (or hate depending on your feelings toward cats in general or specific): the fighting cat, the troublemaking cat, the streetwise cat, the lounging cat, etc. All of them very light, all of them very fun.Edward Gorey's illustrations are a perfect complement to these poems, demonstrating at once both the whimsical side and subtly sinister nature of our feline friends.If you're not into poetry - or you like poetry so long as it rhymes - this book won't disappoint. If you've tried Eliot before - you read \\"Prufrock\\" and \\"Waste Land\\" in school, but they made your head hurt - give the poems in this book a try, they're lighter both in theme and their demands upon you, the reader."}]`),E={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},C={class:"card-container"},H=["disabled"],B={key:0},D={key:1};function x(n,o,s,u,r,i){const c=f("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",C,[(e(!0),t(g,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),w(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",D,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",B,"See more"))],8,H)):p("",!0)])}const P=d(E,[["render",x],["__scopeId","data-v-78e136dc"]]),q=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotesmag/59.md","filePath":"quotesmag/59.md"}'),R={name:"quotesmag/59.md"},j=Object.assign(R,{setup(n){return(o,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(P)]))}});export{q as __pageData,j as default};
