While palaces, pictures, and jewels might reflect the choice of a monarch s predecessors or advisers, clothes reflected the preferences of the monarch himself. Being both personal and visible, the right costume at the right time could transform and define a monarch s reputation. Many royal leaders have known this, from Louis XIV to Catherine the Great and from Napoleon I to Princess Diana. This intriguing book explores how rulers have sought to control their image through their appearance. Mansel shows how individual styles of dress throw light on the personalities of particular monarchs, on their court system, and on their ambitions. The book looks also at the economics of the costume industry, at patronage, at the etiquette involved in mourning dress, and at the act of dressing itself. Fascinating glimpses into the lives of European monarchs and contemporary potentates reveal the intimate connection between power and the way it is packaged.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QCIxgIZ4w38C&dq=Dressed+to+Rule+:+Royal+and+Court+Costume+from+Louis+XIV+to+Elizabeth+II&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Eminent Victorians: Cardinal Manning, Florence Nightingale, Dr. Arnold, General Gordon","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Common Sense God","description":"Faced with the difficulties of growing up and choosing a religion, a 12-year-old girl talks over her problems with her own private God.

The trouble was, some of the people profiting were greedy politicians, and many of the \\"charity cases\\" were really only pampered Hollywood stars. It's a true-life spectacular that only Hollywood could produce. Now, the story that shook the industry will finally shatter the fa?ade of Hollywood's philanthropy and Washington's populism, once and for all exposing how empty are the real lifestyles of many of the rich and famous, and what really happens to charity money meant for the poor. When Aaron Tonken arrived in Los Angeles in the early nineties, he had nothing, not even a high-school education. Yet within just a few years, he was a friend and business associate of the leading lights of Hollywood and the most powerful people in Washington. Tonken produced many of the biggest charitable and political functions ever seen on either coast, honoring former presidents Ford and Clinton, and raising money for the preferred charities of some of the biggest names in showbiz. But hidden behind the glamour of these galas was a sordid tale, as Tonken became the central character in a tragicomedy featuring demanding stars and politicians grasping for big-dollar campaign donations. In King of Cons, you'll read how Aaron Tonken: Helped Hollywood darlings use money from their own charities Was mentored by Peter Paul-ex con, Fabio manager, and business partner of Spider-Man creator Stan Lee Got sucked into the criminal underworld of Los Angeles-the con artists, grifters, and porn kings.

Author Trapp suggests that, for those born after WWI, the world has been a remarkable evolving panorama of change, more extensive than that experienced by any other generation alive today. Unfortunately, there are few World War I Baby Boomers left, particularly those with WWII military service. Fortunately, one of those is Phil Trapp. Even more fortunately for the reader, he is a gifted story teller. \\"Memoirs of a World War I Baby Boomer\\" is an engaging collection of life stories and reflections that chronicle one man's unique journey through the 20th century into the 21st. The stories alone would be reason enough to read these memoirs. Some stories tell of seemingly mundane everyday experiences that turn out to be rich in life lessons and insights. Other stories are dramatic and moving, particularly incidents from his military service at Iwo Jima and Okinawa during WWII. While the chapters follow the chronology of his life, Trapp uses thoughtfully selected vignettes to shed light on the unique forces and context that shaped the WWI baby boomers and to personalize their impact. There is something for everyone in \\"Memoirs of a World War I Baby Boomer.\\" It is rich in historical and human detail and humor. Trapp's anecdotes about his family's history remind us of how few steps separate us from the early leaders of our country. For example, Phil's ancestor knew such remarkable historical figures as Washington and Jefferson. And Phil's grandfather was alive in the days of the Civil War. As Trapp's life is explored in subsequent chapters synchronized with major world changes and life stages, the Roaring Twenties and the Great Depression come to light in new personalized ways. We learn how both family and events shaped his thinking, and we come to treasure such unique characters as his mother and grandfather for their very specific views of how one is to live one's life and see the world. Admittedly, the World War II chapter is particularly powerful and poignant. His earlier novel \\"The Red-Ribboned Letters\\" captured elements of that experience. Larger issues of war and humanity are conveyed with honestly and pain here in the memoirs. The remaining chapters guide us through Phil's return from WWII to a world filled with educational opportunities and hope. Not surprisingly, he chose the route of clinical psychology. There are intriguing vignettes of the early stages of the psychology profession and graduate education in this field. Trapp explores his time at the University of Arkansas, painting a picture of how different the university world was in decades past. He also provides snapshots of his engagement in other events of state and national importance, reminding us how one individual can make a difference. The retirement years are presented in the context of how they have been informed by this remarkable life trajectory. The final chapter is direct and without apology in its offer of guidance and its predictions about the future. As a whole, the \\"Memoirs of a World War I Baby Boomer\\" is a delightful and thought-provoking account of one person's perspective on a life story that began with birth in the aftermath of WWI. Phil has no trouble sharing this story honestly and humorously. Ultimately, he has a message for us all--about the impact of history upon one's life and the lessons that can be learned after 95 years on this planet.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_C71vgEACAAJ&dq=Baby+Boomer+Memoirs&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Military Jets Aircraft Guide","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zL32AAAACAAJ&dq=The+Military+Jets+Aircraft+Guide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Letterbox, Ampersand, Lite","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GGiUOAAACAAJ&dq=The+Letterbox,+Ampersand,+Lite&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Mammoth Book of 20th Century Ghost Stories","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=utkfAQAACAAJ&dq=The+Mammoth+Book+of+20th+Century+Ghost+Stories&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Last Man Running (Doctor Who Series)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Star Gate","description":"Star Gate is the largest funded program in the history of psi research receiving about $19.933 million in funding from 1972 to 1995. Researchers from SRI International, and later at Science Applications International Corporation, in association with various U.S. intelligence agencies participated in this program. Using the remote viewing method, research focused on understanding the applicability and nature of psi in general but mostly upon informational psi. Volume 1: Remote Viewing (19721984) and Volume 2: Remote Viewing (19851995) include all aspects of RV including laboratory trials and several operational results. Volume 3 focuses on laboratory investigations on psychokinesis. Volume 4: Operational Remote Viewing: Government Memorandums and Reports includes an analysis of the applied remote viewing program and a selection of documents that provide a narrative on the behind the scenes activities of Star Gate. In a total of 504 separate missions from 1972 to 1995, remote viewing produced actionable intelligence prompting 89% of the customers to return with additional missions. The Star Gate data indicate that informational psi is a scientifically valid phenomenon. These data have led to the development of a physics and neuroscience based testable model for the underlying mechanism, which considers informational psi as a normal, albeit atypical, phenomenon. The Star Gate data found insufficient evidence to support the causal psi (psychokinesis) hypothesis.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vbylDwAAQBAJ&dq=Star+Gate&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Cambridge Companion to T.

How does this position vary from one realm religious, political, economic, domestic, or sexual to another? To examine these questions, Martin King Whyte draws on a cross-cultural sample of 93 preindustrial societies throughout the world. His analysis describes women's roles in historical perspective, offering a much-needed foundation for feminist scholarship as well as provocative thoughts about the future. To determine why women fare better in some societies than others, Professor Whyte compares data from cultures ranging from small, preliterate hunting bands to the capitals of the Inca and Roman empires. This ethnographic material makes possible a systematic review of the diverse roles of women and also enables the author to test many of the theories advanced to explain the situation of women today. Some of the specific questions considered are: Does male supremacy have its origins in the hunting way of life of our distant ancestors? Are women always inferior to men? Do women have superior status in cultures where they produce much food and thereby play an important economic role? Has the position of women improved over the course of human evolution?

Ancheta demonstrates how United States civil rights laws have been framed by a black-white model of race that typically ignores the experiences of other groups, including Asian Americans. When racial discourse is limited to antagonisms between black and white, Asian Americans often find themselves in a racial limbo, marginalized or unrecognized as full participants. Ancheta examines legal and social theories of racial discrimination, ethnic differences in the Asian American population, nativism, citizenship, language, school desegregation, and affirmative action. In the second edition of this influential book, Ancheta also covers post-9/11 anti-Asian sentiment and racial profiling. He analyzes recent legal cases involving political empowerment, language rights, human trafficking, immigrant rights, and affirmative action in higher education--many of which move the country farther away from the ideals of racial justice. On a more positive note, he reports on the progress Asian Americans have made in the corporate sector, politics, the military, entertainment, and academia. A skillful mixture of legal theories, court cases, historical events, and personal insights, this second edition brings fresh insights to U.S. civil rights from an Asian American perspective.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Uc_q6upNmugC&dq=Race,+Rights,+and+the+Asian+American+Experience:+Race,+Rights,+and+the+Asian+American+Experience,+second+edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Legal Research Illustrated, Seventh Edition (An Abridgement of Fundamentals of Legal Research, Seventh Edition","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=l6qRjgEACAAJ&dq=Legal+Research+Illustrated,+Seventh+Edition+(An+Abridgement+of+Fundamentals+of+Legal+Research,+Seventh+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Modern Ideal: The Rise and Collapse of Idealism in the Visual Arts, From the Enlightenment to Postmodernism","description":"This book does two things. First, it defines and explores the idea of modernity, returning it to its historical context and showing how theory and practice in the modern visual arts emerged over three centuries. Modernity is surprisingly easy to define, but profoundly difficult to describe; concepts central to its meaning will be explained, including: style, modernization, progress, ideology and universality. Movements across all disciplines from the Enlightenment onwards will be discussed, including: Neoclassicism, Romanticism, the Design Reform movement, Realism, Impressionism, Art Nouveau, Neo-Impressionism, the arts and Crafts movement, Cubism, Futurism, De Stijl, the International Style, Surrealism, Pop, Minimalism, Conceptualism and Postmodernism. Second, and more specifically, the book explores the rise of idealism in the modern visual arts. The book also deals with issues at large in the contemporary art and design scene. The author proposes that in real terms, the previous phase of modernist practice, and postmodernism, have come to an end. He identifies the collapse of idealism in the modern arts as being of central concern at this point in time, and speculates on what the next phase of modernity will be about.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eG1QAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Modern+Ideal:+The+Rise+and+Collapse+of+Idealism+in+the+Visual+Arts,+From+the+Enlightenment+to+Postmodernism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Far from the Madding Crowd (Oxford World's Classics)","description":"Far from the Madding Crowd was the first of Hardy's novels to give the name of Wessex to the landscape of the south-west of England, and the first to gain him widespread popularity.

Liv Constantine, bestselling author of The Last Mrs. Parrish  Sarah Langan is a phenomenal talent with a wicked sense of wry humor. Good Neighbors knocked me out. Like Shirley Jackson, Langan s work blends a bleak streak with an underlying sense of the humane that wrung my heart.   Victor LaValle, author of The Changeling Celeste Ng s enthralling dissection of suburbia meets Shirley Jackson s creeping dread in this propulsive literary noir, when a sudden tragedy exposes the depths of deception and damage in a Long Island suburb pitting neighbor against neighbor and putting one family in terrible danger. Welcome to Maple Street, a picture-perfect slice of suburban Long Island, its residents bound by their children, their work, and their illusion of safety in a rapidly changing world. Arlo Wilde, a gruff has-been rock star who s got nothing to show for his fame but track marks, is always two steps behind the other dads. His wife, beautiful ex-pageant queen Gertie, feels socially ostracized and adrift. Spunky preteen Julie curses like a sailor and her kid brother Larry is called  Robot Boy  by the kids on the block. Their next-door neighbor and Maple Street s Queen Bee, Rhea Schroeder a lonely community college professor repressing her own dark past welcomes Gertie and family into the fold. Then, during one spritzer-fueled summer evening, the new best friends share too much, too soon. As tensions mount, a sinkhole opens in a nearby park, and Rhea s daughter Shelly falls inside. The search for Shelly brings a shocking accusation against the Wildes that spins out of control. Suddenly, it is one mom s word against the other s in a court of public opinion that can end only in blood. A riveting and ruthless portrayal of American suburbia, Good Neighbors excavates the perils and betrayals of motherhood and friendships and the dangerous clash between social hierarchy, childhood trauma, and fear.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vy8SEAAAQBAJ&dq=The+very+good+neighbors&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The squirrel, the hare and the little grey rabbit","description":"Since publication of the first Little Grey Rabbit book in 1929, the series has become a classic of children's literature.

Bill Zender, a highly paid consultant to the gambling industry, is widely respected as an expert on game protection. Although cheating is rare in today's modern, highly-regulated casinos, the proliferation of casinos throughout the U.S. and around the world has created new opportunities for crooked dealers, and new dangers for honest players. Never before has any casino insider revealed the hidden tricks of the trade of the scam artists. Zender describes in vivid detail how slick blackjack dealers can rob you. None of this information has ever been made available to the general public in the past. The cheats aren't talking, and the casinos rarely disclose this sensitive information because they don't want to scare players away from their games. With blackjack now being dealt on riverboats, Indian reservations, and vacation resorts, as well as in high stakes private games all over the country, the time has come for players to know how to recognize cheaters and how to protect themselves.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iEMBAAAACAAJ&dq=How+to+Detect+Casino+Cheating+at+Blackjack&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Will You Please Be Quiet, Please?: Stories","description":"With this, his first collection of stories, Raymond Carver breathed new life into the American short story.

It served to synchronize calendars in antiquity and was the subject of many myths and legends, including some modern ones. It was perceived as a red star for more than 400 years, but such reports were relegated to the Mediterranean region. Astronomically, Sirius is a very bright star. This, and its present close distance to us, argues in favor of it being the target of detailed studies of stellar structure and evolution. Its binary nature, with a companion that is one of the more massive white dwarfs, is an additional reason for such studies.

But during the years that David John spent in prison for his part in a brutal hate crime, Jessup came to realize that his stepfather is also a source of lethal poison for his family. Now it's Jessup's senior year, and all he wants to do is lay low until he can accept one of the football scholarships that will be his ticket out of town. So when his stepfather is released from prison, Jessup is faced with an impossible choice: condemn the man who saved his family or accept his part in his family's legacy of bigotry. Before he can choose a side, Jessup will cause a terrible accident and cover it up--a mistake with the power to ruin them all. Told with relentless honesty and a ferocious gaze directed at contemporary America's darkest corners, Copperhead vibrates with the energy released by football tackles and car crashes and asks uncomfortable questions about the price we pay--and the mistakes we'll repeat--when we live under the weight of a history we've yet to reckon with.

The structure of the book and of the individual essays follows a pattern of recovery (analysis of the tradition), critique (consideration of special problems), and reconstruction (distinctive Christologies in the contemporary American context). Part I, devoted to historical recovery, treats Jesus of Nazareth and the significance of historical Jesus research for Christology today; Christological developments resulting in the conciliar definitions of Nicaea and Chalcedon; and diverse conceptions of Christ's redemption in the early and medieval church. Part II treats four problems in modern debate: religious pluralism and Christian exclusivist claims; theological anti-Semitism embedded in Christological formulations; legitimation of male privilege via appeals to the masculinity of Jesus and Christ's headship of the church; the use of the Christ symbol to legitimate colonialism and racial exploitation. Finally, Part III offers two examples of contemporary Christologies of social transformation: mujerista Christology and black Christology.

He had learned that the royal child possessed forbidden wisdom: a secret with which the bloodthirsty Vair intended to conquer the world. One single man posed a threat to Vair's vaunting ambition: the legendary warrior known as the Icefalcon.

Vision for Life presents an approach to eye health for people with 20/20 vision who wish to maintain their perfect vision as well as people who see poorly and would like to improve their eyesight. Clients of the Meir Schneider Self-Healing Method experience their own capacity to bring about recovery, reversing the progress of a wide range of degenerative conditions including eye disease. Based in part on the established Bates Method of eyesight improvement and in part on his own professional and personal discoveries, Meir Schneider's pioneering approach has helped thousands of people successfully treat a host of eye problems, including near- and farsightedness, astigmatism, lazy eye, double vision, glaucoma, cataracts, macular degeneration, retinal detachment, retinitis pigmentosa, and nystagmus. This revised edition includes a new chapter on children's eye health and new research and exercises for specific conditions, i.e., glaucoma and nystagmus, near- and farsightedness. Born blind to deaf parents, Schneider underwent a series of painful operations as a young child and was left with 99 percent scar tissue on the lenses of his eyes, resulting in his being declared incurably blind. At the age of seventeen, he discovered how to improve his vision from less than 1 percent to 55 percent of normal vision with the eye exercises presented in this book. Today Schneider drives a car, reads, and enjoys the benefits of full natural vision. He and his clients prove time and time again how much vision can improve with exercise. His contributions to the field of self-healing are recognized by alternative health practitioners and medical doctors alike. In Vision for Life, Schneider shares forty years of discoveries made on his personal and professional journey. The book details simple but effective techniques to gain great vision such as sunning and palming. Such exercises are not only strengthening but also restorative and deeply relaxing. The reader learns how to reverse developing issues before they cause damage or to remedy existing problems, including pathologies such as glaucoma, cataracts, macular degeneration, retinal detachment, and optic nerve neuropathy.

Enlisting the talents of Carolyn Jones, an award-winning filmmaker and creator of numerous photography books, and her producer, Lisa Frank, the project set out to capture and share the images and stories of nurses from all across America and to celebrate the role of the nurse in this country s health care system. In The American Nurse, readers are invited to think about nurses in a way that they may never have before, unless they have been under a nurse s care. This body of work will inspire audiences to focus their attention on the nurses who serve as healers in their community, and whose wealth of knowledge needs to be tapped in order to solve today s pressing health care issues. The challenge of creating a rich portrait of nursing in America began with a map of the U.S. and a red pen. Carolyn Jones wanted to cover as much territory as possible, with the hope that along the way she would capture stories touching on the kinds of issues that nurses are dealing with in every corner of the country. Some of the issues might be specific to a particular area, like the nurses who were charged with evacuating patients in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Others would be universal no matter where Jones visited, such as nurses providing emotional support to patients and families to help get them through the toughest times in their lives. The journey began in New York City, where Carolyn met nurses working in the district with the highest rate of hunger in the U.S., as well as nurses doing health outreach to at-risk teens. She moved southward, stopping in Baltimore to meet nurses on the cutting edge of healthcare and nurse educators training the next generation, and then travelled to San Diego, where she met nurses at a VA hospital that is home to the largest concentration of veterans from the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts. In Louisiana, she went behind bars and met nurses dealing with prisoners; and in Riverton, Wyoming she learned about the health needs of the Native American population there. Having crisscrossed the country, from rural Eastern Kentucky to Florida to New Orleans to Nebraska to Wisconsin to San Francisco and Chicago, Jones presents a compelling portrait of a key figure on the front lines of health care today: the American nurse.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0lVOEAAAQBAJ&dq=My+American+Nurse&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"SILLY SALLY: Silly Sally went to town, walking backwards, unside down.","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Nicholas the Naked Sicilian and Other Stories","description":"My ambition when I started this book was to allow the readers a chance to use their own imaginations and to come to their own conclusions.

For almost seventeen years, The Daily Show with Jon Stewart brilliantly redefined the borders between television comedy, political satire, and opinionated news coverage. It launched the careers of some of today's most significant comedians, highlighted the hypocrisies of the powerful, and garnered 23 Emmys. Now the show's behind-the-scenes gags, controversies, and camaraderie will be chronicled by the players themselves, from legendary host Jon Stewart to the star cast members and writers-including Samantha Bee, Stephen Colbert, John Oliver, and Steve Carell - plus some of The Daily Show's most prominent guests and adversaries: John and Cindy McCain, Glenn Beck, Tucker Carlson, and many more. This oral history takes the reader behind the curtain for all the show's highlights, from its origins as Comedy Central's underdog late-night program to Trevor Noah's succession, rising from a scrappy jester in the 24-hour political news cycle to become part of the beating heart of politics-a trusted source for not only comedy but also commentary, with a reputation for calling bullshit and an ability to effect real change in the world. Through years of incisive election coverage, passionate debates with President Obama and Hillary Clinton, feuds with Bill O'Reilly and Fox, and provocative takes on Wall Street and racism, The Daily Show has been a cultural touchstone. Now, for the first time, the people behind the show's seminal moments come together to share their memories of the last-minute rewrites, improvisations, pranks, romances, blow-ups, and moments of Zen both on and off the set of one of America's most groundbreaking shows.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Eq-TCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Word Biblical Commentary Vol. 50, 2 Peter, Jude (bauckham), 377pp","description":"In this passage-by-passage commentary, Robert Harvey and Philip H.

Not only was Merbecke a pioneer in setting English prose to music but also the compiler of the first Concordance of the whole English Bible (1550) and of the first English encyclopaedia of biblical and theological studies, A Booke of Notes and Common Places (1581). By situating Merbecke and his work within a broader intellectual and religio-cultural context of Tudor England, this book challenges the existing studies of Merbecke based on the narrow theological approach to the Reformation. Furthermore, it suggests a re-thinking of the prevailing interpretative framework of Reformation musical history. On the basis of the new contextual study of Merbecke, this book seeks to re-interpret his work, particularly BCPN, in the light of humanist rhetoric. It sees Merbecke as embodying the ideal of the 'Christian-musical orator', demonstrating that BCPN is an Anglican epitome of the Erasmian synthesis of eloquence, theology and music. The book thus depicts Merbecke as a humanist reformer, through re-evaluation of his contributions to the developments of vernacular music and literature in early modern England. As such it will be of interest, not only to church musicians, but also to historians of the Reformation and students of wider Tudor culture.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TusoDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"GRAY THUNDER: EXPLOITS OF THE CONFEDERATE STATES NAVY","description":"Provides a history of the Confederate navy, including blockades, raids, and other nautical undertakings","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yUZ3AAAAMAAJ&dq=GRAY+THUNDER:+EXPLOITS+OF+THE+CONFEDERATE+STATES+NAVY&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Sugar Creek Gang Goes Camping (A Sugar Creek Gang Story)","description":"The tales and travels of the Sugar Creek Gang have passed the test of time, delighting young readers for more than fifty years.

This fundamental fact has generally been overshadowed by popular and scholarly images of the plantation household as the source of slavery's redeeming qualities, where 'gentle' mistresses ministered to 'loyal' slaves. This book recounts a very different story. The very notion of a private sphere, as divorced from the immoral excesses of chattel slavery as from the amoral logic of market laws, functioned to conceal from public scrutiny the day-to-day struggles between enslaved women and their mistresses, subsumed within a logic of patriarchy. One of emancipation's unsung consequences was precisely the exposure to public view of the unbridgeable social distance between the women on whose labor the plantation household relied and the women who employed them. This is a story of race and gender, nation and citizenship, freedom and bondage in the nineteenth century South; a big abstract story that is composed of equally big personal stories.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=oMunAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mississippi Kiss","description":"Brianna Calhoun is outraged when she learns that her late father has appointed a guardian to watch over her and her family's Gulf Coast plantation.

The record of modern republics is not much more encouraging. How, then, did the United States manage to emerge victorious from the world wars of this century, including the Cold War, and still retain its fundamental liberties? For Karl-Friedrich Walling, this unprecedented accomplishment was the work of many hands and many generations, but of Alexander Hamilton especially. No Founder thought more about the theory and practice of modern war and free government. None supplied advice of more enduring relevance to statesmen faced with the responsibility of providing for the common defense while securing the blessings of liberty to their posterity. Hamilton's strategic sobriety led many of his contemporaries to view him as an American Caesar, but this revisionist account calls the conventional \\"militarist\\" interpretation of Hamilton into question. Hamilton sought to unite the strength necessary for war with the restraint required by the rule of law, popular consent, and individual rights. In the process, he helped found something new, the world's most durable republican empire. Walling constructs a conversation about war and freedom between Hamilton and the Loyalists, the Anti-Federalists, the Jeffersonians, and other Federalists. Instead of pitting Hamilton's virtues against his opponents' vices (or vice versa), Walling pits Hamilton's virtue of responsibility against the revolutionary virtue of vigilance, a quarrel he believes is inherent to American party government. By reexamining that quarrel in light of the necessities of war and the requirements of liberty, Walling has written the most balanced and moving account of Hamilton so far.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=btcPAQAAMAAJ&dq=Republican+Empire:+Alexander+Hamilton+on+War+and+Free+Government+(American+Political+Thought+(University+Press+of+Kansas))&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Heartfelt Stories About Beanie Babies(R) and Those Who Collect Them","description":"\\"There has never been a craze like Beanie Babies.

In the war-torn twentieth century, we rarely hear that one of the main costs of armed conflict is long-term loss of liberty to winners and losers alike. Beyond the obvious and direct costs of dead and wounded soldiers, there is the lifetime struggle of veterans to live with their nightmares and their injuries; the hidden economic costs of inflation, debts, and taxes; and more generally the damages caused to our culture, our morality, and to civilization at large. The new edition is now available in paperback, with a number of new essays. It represents a large-scale collective effort to pierce the veils of myth and propaganda to reveal the true costs of war, above all, the cost to liberty.Central to this volume are the views of Ludwig von Mises on war and foreign policy. Mises argued that war, along with colonialism and imperialism, is the greatest enemy of freedom and prosperity, and that peace throughout the world cannot be achieved until the central governments of the major nations become limited in scope and power. In the spirit of these theorems by Mises, the contributors to this volume consider the costs of war generally and assess specific corrosive effects of major American wars since the Revolution. The first section includes chapters on the theoretical and institutional dimensions of the relationship between war and society, including conscription, infringements on freedom, the military as an engine of social change, war and literature, and the right of citizens to bear arms. The second group includes reconsiderations of Lincoln and Churchill, an analysis of the anti-interventionist idea in American politics, a discussion of the meaning of the \\"just war,\\" an assessment of how World War I changed the course of Western civilization, and finally two eyewitness accounts of the true horrors of actual combat by","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MTgrDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"John Carroll Doyle: Portrait of a Charleston artist","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YgBQAQAACAAJ&dq=John+Carroll+Doyle:+Portrait+of+a+Charleston+artist&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bed Rest CD","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CScCKJiN-JwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Barren Revenge","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KsiutQEACAAJ&dq=Barren+Revenge&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"WHY MEN ARE THE WAY THEY ARE1","description":"Considers aspects of male-female relationships in America today to determine the motivations behind male behavior","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FgtXvgAACAAJ&dq=WHY+MEN+ARE+THE+WAY+THEY+ARE1&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"CliffsNotes on Dostoevsky's Notes from Underground","description":"Fyodor Dostoyevsky s  Notes from Underground  is considered by many to be the first existentialist novel.

Rosen explains how the practitioner identifies tensions in the body that point to the source of a problem and how that awareness guides the healing process. With the help of psychotherapist Susan Brenner, the director of Rosen Center East and one of Marion's first students, she describes the origins of her method; how people reveal their emotions in body postures; barriers they set up to love, self-expression, and intimacy, and how Rosen work enables a client to move beyond these barriers. Treatments for asthma, migraine headaches, heart problems, weak immune systems, and psychosomatic illnesses are chronicled. Essays by doctors, psychologists, and Rosen practitioners describe how this method of touch, words, and acceptance guides their work, and complete this remarkable tribute to a visionary woman.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6ZhHtuZqCw8C&dq=Rosen+Method+Bodywork:+Accessing+the+Unconscious+through+Touch&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Healing the Sick","description":"Never feel helpless again!

Yet sleep is full of untold mysteries eluding us when we seek it too fervently, throwing us into surreal dream worlds when we don t, sometimes even possessing our bodies so that they walk and talk without our conscious volition. Delving into the mysteries of his own sleep patterns, Bill Hayes marvels,  I have come to see that sleep itself tells a story.  An acclaimed journalist and memoirist and partner of the late neurologist Oliver Sacks Hayes has been plagued by insomnia his entire life. The science and mythology of sleep and sleeplessness form the backbone to Hayes s narrative of his personal battles with sleep and how they colored his waking life, as he threads stories of fugitive sleep through memories of growing up in the closet, coming out to his Irish Catholic family, watching his friends fall ill during the early years of the AIDS crisis in San Francisco, and finding a lover. An erudite blend of science and personal narrative, Sleep Demons offers a poignant introduction to the topics for which Hayes has since become famous, including art, eros, city life, the history of medical science, and queer identity.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=IjRKDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Faith and reason,: An introduction to modern Jewish thought (Schocken Paperbacks)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nYgYAAAAMAAJ&dq=Faith+and+reason,:+An+introduction+to+modern+Jewish+thought+(Schocken+Paperbacks)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Like Unto Like (Southern Classics (Univ of South Carolina))","description":"Originally published in 1878, this novel marked the emergence of a feminist critique of southern society.

After that \\"solemn festival of knowledge,\\" as he described it in his Autobiography, Steiner received ceaseless revelations about the significance of the Christ's incarnation. For the next twenty years, he spoke of the hidden background to all four gospels, the Book of Revelations, and even what he called the Fifth Gospel, read directly from the spirit worlds. These lectures present the most accessible and illuminating of Steiner's revelations about the significance of the Christ for the spiritual development of humanity. He discusses the link between the Buddha and the Christ, which unites Buddhism and Christianity--not in theory but in the spiritual activities of those two beings. Steiner also describes the relationship between the Greek Mystery traditions and the Mystery of Golgotha: \\"A sign was to be placed before them as well, a sign that would now be enacted before the eyes of all humankind. The 'mystical death, ' which had been a ceremonial act in the Mystery temples for hundreds and thousands of years, would now be presented on the great stage of world history. Everything that had taken place in the secrecy of initiation temples was brought into the open as a single event on Golgotha.\\" Utilizing a historical overview, revealing the relationship between the great religious traditions, and how they have conspired together for the good of humanity, Steiner never loses sight of the Gospel's great inner meaning, as echoed in the Gospel of St. Luke: \\"The revelation of the spiritual worlds from the Heights and its answering reflection from human hearts brings peace to all whose purpose upon the evolving Earth is to develop good will.\\" Contents: Introduction by Robert A.

Based on first-hand accounts from gang members, gang victims, community leaders, and law enforcement authorities, this pioneering study reveals the pervasiveness, the muscle, the longevity, and the institutionalization of Chinatown gangs. Chin reveals the fear gangs instill in the Chinese community. At the same time, he shows how the economic viability of the community is sapped, and how gangs encourage lawlessness, making a mockery of law enforcement agencies. Ko-lin Chin makes clear that gang crime is inexorably linked to Chinatown's political economy and social history. He shows how gangs are formed to become \\"equalizers\\" within a social environment where individual and group conflicts, whether social, political, or economic, are unlikely to be solved in American courts. Moreover, Chin argues that Chinatown's informal economy provides yet another opportunity for street gangs to become \\"providers\\" or \\"protectors\\" of illegal services. These gangs, therefore, are the pathological manifestation of a closed community, one whose problems are not easily seen--and less easily understood--by outsiders. Chin's concrete data on gang characteristics, activities, methods of operation and violence make him uniquely qualified to propose ways to restrain gang violence, and Chinatown Gangs closes with his specific policy suggestions. It is the definitive study of gangs in an American Chinatown.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7TEr5XRoSs0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mobil Travel Guide Canada, 2005: Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, Saskatchewan","description":"Provides information on driving and walking tours, what to see and do, special events, and side trips, including listings of lodgings, spas, and restaurants in Canada.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=U6KwYW5R21oC&dq=Mobil+Travel+Guide+Canada,+2005:+Alberta,+British+Columbia,+Manitoba,+New+Brunswick,+Nova+Scotia,+Ontario,+Prince+Edward+Island,+Quebec,+Saskatchewan&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"That Heaven Once was My Hell","description":"Millions of Christians have struggled with how to reconcile God's love and God's judgment: Has God created billions of people over thousands of years only to select a few to go to heaven and everyone else to suffer forever in hell? Is this acceptable to God? How is this \\"good news\\"? Troubling questions so troubling that many have lost their faith because of them. Others only whisper the questions to themselves, fearing or being taught that they might lose their faith and their church if they ask them out loud. But what if these questions trouble us for good reason? What if the story of heaven and hell we have been taught is not, in fact, what the Bible teaches? What if what Jesus meant by heaven, hell, and salvation are very different from how we have come to understand them? What if it is God who wants us to face these questions? Author, pastor, and innovative teacher Rob Bell presents a deeply biblical vision for rediscovering a richer, grander, truer, and more spiritually satisfying way of understanding heaven, hell, God, Jesus, salvation, and repentance. The result is the discovery that the \\"good news\\" is much, much better than we ever imagined.

Government and corporate policies to define and enforce fetal rights have become commonplace. These developments affect all women pregnant or not because women are considered \\"potentially pregnant\\" for much of their lives. In her powerful and important book, Rachel Roth brings a new perspective to the debate over fetal rights. She clearly delineates the threat to women's equality posed by the new concept of \\"maternal-fetal conflict,\\" an idea central to the fetal rights movement in which women and fetuses are seen as having interests that are diametrically opposed. Roth begins by placing fetal rights politics in historical and comparative context and by tracing the emergence of the notion of fetal rights. Against a backdrop of gripping stories about actual women, she reviews the difficulties fetal rights claims create for women in the areas of employment, health care, and drug and alcohol regulation. She looks at court cases and state legislation over a period of two decades beginning in 1973, the year of the Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion. Her exhaustive research shows how judicial decisions and public policies that grant fetuses rights tend to displace women as claimants, as recipients of needed services, and ultimately as citizens. When a corporation, medical authority, or the state asserts or accepts rights claims on behalf of a fetus, the usual justification involves improving the chance of a healthy birth. This strategy, Roth persuasively argues, is not necessary to achieve the goal of a healthy birth, is often counterproductive to it, and always undermines women's equal standing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8pNlDwAAQBAJ&dq=Making+Women+Pay:+The+Hidden+Costs+of+Fetal+Rights&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Zen flesh, Zen bones: A collection of Zen & pre-Zen writings","description":"When Zen Flesh, Zen Bones was published in 1957 it became an instant sensation with an entire generation of readers who were just beginning to experiment with Zen.

It was published on 8 June 1949 by Secker & Warburg as Orwell's ninth and final book completed in his lifetime. Thematically, \\"Nineteen Eighty-Four\\" centres on the consequences of totalitarianism, mass surveillance, and repressive regimentation of persons and behaviours within society. Orwell, himself a democratic socialist, modelled the authoritarian government in the novel after Stalinist Russia. More broadly, the novel examines the role of truth and facts within politics and the ways in which they are manipulated. The story takes place in an imagined future, the year 1984, when much of the world has fallen victim to perpetual war, omnipresent government surveillance, historical negationism, and propaganda. Great Britain, known as Airstrip One, has become a province of a totalitarian superstate named Oceania that is ruled by the Party who employ the Thought Police to persecute individuality and independent thinking. Big Brother, the leader of the Party, enjoys an intense cult of personality despite the fact that he may not even exist. The protagonist, Winston Smith, is a diligent and skillful rank-and-file worker and Outer Party member who secretly hates the Party and dreams of rebellion. He enters into a forbidden relationship with a colleague, Julia, and starts to remember what life was like before the Party came to power.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PEpoEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Autumn Sonata: Selected Poems of Georg Trakl","description":"A bilingual volume by an Austrian-born writer who suffered tragic experiences during World War I and who died at the age of twenty-seven evinces a romantically heightened interior world of suffering and hoped-for transcendence.

They are also the most expensive. Tuition has risen faster than the rate of inflation for the past thirty years. There is no indication that this trend will abate. Ronald G. Ehrenberg explores the causes of this tuition inflation, drawing on his many years as a teacher and researcher of the economics of higher education and as a senior administrator at Cornell University. Using incidents and examples from his own experience, he discusses a wide range of topics including endowment policies, admissions and financial aid policies, the funding of research, tenure and the end of mandatory retirement, information technology, libraries and distance learning, student housing, and intercollegiate athletics. He shows that colleges and universities, having multiple, relatively independent constituencies, suffer from ineffective central control of their costs. And in a fascinating analysis of their response to the ratings published by magazines such as \\"U.S. News & World Report,\\" he shows how they engage in a dysfunctional competition for students. In the short run, colleges and universities have little need to worry about rising tuitions, since the number of qualified students applying for entrance is rising even faster. But in the long run, it is not at all clear that the increases can be sustained. Ehrenberg concludes by proposing a set of policies to slow the institutions' rising tuitions without damaging their quality.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SVworMRrw-AC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Craft of Advice : Essays 1995-1998","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YNQwAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Craft+of+Advice+:+Essays+1995-1998&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Most Important Place On Earth : What a Christian Home Looks Like and How to Build One","description":"It all starts at home.

In important films such as The Birth of a Nation (1915), Roots (1977), Apocalypse Now (1979), and Saving Private Ryan (1998), how much is entertainment and how much is rooted in historical fact? In The Columbia Companion to American History on Film, more than seventy scholars consider the gap between history and Hollywood. They examine how filmmakers have presented and interpreted the most important events, topics, eras, and figures in the American past, often comparing the film versions of events with the interpretations of the best historians who have explored the topic. Divided into eight broad categories Eras; Wars and Other Major Events; Notable People; Groups; Institutions and Movements; Places; Themes and Topics; and Myths and Heroes the volume features extensive cross-references, a filmography (of discussed and relevant films), notes, and a bibliography of selected historical works on each subject. The Columbia Companion to American History on Film is also an important resource for teachers, with extensive information for research or for course development appropriate for both high school and college students. Though each essay reflects the unique body of film and print works covering the subject at hand, every essay addresses several fundamental questions: What are the key films on this topic? What sources did the filmmaker use, and how did the film deviate (or remain true to) its sources? How have film interpretations of a particular historical topic changed, and what sorts of factors technological, social, political, historiographical have affected their evolution? Have filmmakers altered the historical record with a view to enhancing drama or to enhance the \\"truth\\" of their putative message?","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iAMb9q7cqAgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"My Sister: A Treasury of Companionship (Miniature Editions Pop-Up Books)","description":"Our Miniature Editions \\"TM\\" collection continues to grow!

The Queene s Cure transports us into the shadowy world of sixteenth-century medicine, as an enlightened young queen seeks the cures that could heal a realm and transform a land.... In late summer of 1562, within a bedchamber at Whitehall Palace, Elizabeth Tudor prays for the recovery of the delirious, fever-racked friend who has served her for twenty-six of her twenty-nine years. Ten days later, with loyal, handsome Lord Robert Dudley by her side, the queen leads her retinue to London s Royal College of Physicians to enlist two learned doctors in the raging battle against disease and pestilence. She knows she has no trusted allies in Peter Pascal and John Caius, ardent Papist sympathizers with long-standing grievances against the Tudors. Yet even the stalwart queen is shaken when a frighteningly lifelike effigy of herself ravaged by pox turns up in her royal coach. Elizabeth s fear that the counterfeit corpse is a harbinger of impending tragedy comes to fruition when ever more terrifying transgressions penetrate the very heart of her royal precincts. With the help of her Privy Plot Council and an intriguing healer whose curative arts are at odds with the dangerous Royal College, Elizabeth resolves to unmask a murderer who wears a false face and is beset by the vilest humours of the soul. But when she herself falls ill, an entire realm is caught in the grip of a treasonous conspiracy to take a queen s life and throne. Peopled by a rich cast of fascinating figures from the swirling mists of history, The Queene s Cure brings a vibrant, violent age unforgettably to life. Racing to a chilling climax where ordinary men play God and where Elizabeth Tudor could meet the same fate as her mother, Anne Boleyn, this is a gripping and captivating story of an indomitable young monarch...fighting for her life, her realm, and her rightful crown.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-HGyUIFFE7kC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Homeschool Your Child for Free: More Than 1,200 Smart, Effective, and Practical Resources for Home Education on the Internet and Beyond","description":"Collects curriculum plans, legal guidelines, online resources, teaching tips, and lesson plans for teaching art, music, language, mathematics, history, social studies, and science to homeschooled students.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bT8olZ9Gvx4C&dq=Homeschool+Your+Child+for+Free:+More+Than+1,200+Smart,+Effective,+and+Practical+Resources+for+Home+Education+on+the+Internet+and+Beyond&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Information Exchange","description":"Health Information Exchange (HIE): Navigating and Managing a Network of Health Information Systems allows health professionals to appropriately access, and securely share, patients  vital medical information electronically, thus improving the speed, quality, safety, and cost of patient care.

This question has fueled a long-running debate. Some have argued that humans are fundamentally competitive, and that pursuing self-interest is the best way to get ahead. Others claim that humans are born to cooperate and that we are most successful when we collaborate with others. Here, researchers Galinsky and Schweitzer explain why this debate misses the mark. Rather than being hardwired to compete or cooperate, we have evolved to do both. In every relationship, from co-workers to friends to spouses to siblings, we are both friends and foes. Only by learning how to strike the right balance between these two forces can we improve our long-term relationships and get more of what we want. Galinsky and Schweitzer draw on original research from their own labs and from across the social sciences to show how to maximize success in work and in life by deftly navigating the tension between cooperation and competition. They offer insights and advice ranging from gaining power and keeping it, building trust and repairing trust once it's broken, and diffusing workplace conflict and bias, to finding the right comparisons that motivate us and make us happier, and succeeding in negotiations--ensuring that we achieve our own goals and satisfy those of our counterparts.--Adapted from book jacket.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wnvZCwAAQBAJ&dq=Friend+or+Foe&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Union of Dzogchen and Bodhichitta","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"An Introduction to High-Frequency Finance","description":"Provides a framework for the analysis, modelling, and inference of high-frequency financial time series.

Almost one hundred years after Congressmen and lawmakers in every state first debated, ridiculed, and then passionately embraced the possibility of saving an hour of daylight, no one can say for sure why we are required by law to change our clocks twice a year. Who first proposed the scheme? The most authoritative sources agree it was a Pittsburgh industrialist, Woodrow Wilson, a man on a horse in London, a Manhattan socialite, Benjamin Franklin, one of the Caesars, or the anonymous makers of ancient Chinese and Japanese water clocks. Spring Forward is a portrait of public policy in the 20th century, a perennially boiling cauldron of unsubstantiated science, profiteering masked as piety, and mysteriously shifting timezone boundaries.

However, as Peter Crawford shows, Constantius deserves to be remembered as a very capable ruler in dangerous, tumultuous times. When Constantine I died in in 337, the twenty-year-old Constantius and his two brothers, Constans and Constantine II, all recieved the title of Augustus to reign as equal co-emperors. In 340, however, Constantine II was killed in a fraternal civil war with Constans. The two remaining brothers shared the Empire for the next ten years, with Constantius ruling Egypt and the Asian provinces, constantly threatened by the Sassanid Persian Empire. However, Constans in turn was killed by the usurper Magentius in 350. Constantius refused to accept this fait accompli, made war on Magentius and defeated him at the battles of Mursa Major and Mons Seleucus, leading him to commit suicide.Constantius, was now sole ruler of the Empire but it was an empire beset by external enemies. Constantius campaigned successfully against the Germanic Alamanni along the Rhine and the Quadi and Sarmatians across the Danube, as well as against the Persians in the East, though with more mixed results. In 360 he elevated his cousin Julian to the rank of Caesar (effectively deputy emperor) and left him to govern the West, while he concentrated on the Persian threat. Julian defeated the Alamanni in battle but was then proclaimed Augustus by his troops. Constantius was marching back to meet this threat to his rear when he fell ill and died. Having done so much to defend and preserve the empire, his dying act was to attempt to avert further civil war by declaring Julian his rightful heir.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_aJBDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Christopher Columbus and the First Voyages to the New World (World Explorers)","description":"Examines the life and times of Christopher Columbus and describes his voyages to the New World.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7kzqOACupysC&dq=Christopher+Columbus+and+the+First+Voyages+to+the+New+World+(World+Explorers)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Spirit Flyer Series Gift Set, Books 1-4 the Spirit Flyer Series Gift Set, Books 1-4 the Spirit F","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KREWIoE8DGgC&dq=The+Spirit+Flyer+Series+Gift+Set,+Books+1-4+the+Spirit+Flyer+Series+Gift+Set,+Books+1-4+the+Spirit+F&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Competitive Leadership: Twelve Principles for Success","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Language of Baklava","description":"Diana Abu-Jaber s vibrant, humorous memoir weaves together delicious food memories that illuminate the two cultures of her childhood American and Jordanian.

The Language of Baklava irresistibly invites us to sit down at the table with Diana s family, sharing unforgettable meals that turn out to be as much about  grace, difference, faith, love  as they are about food.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EmPCP4hbVuQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Profiles of American Colleges with CD-ROM (2003 Edition)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-m4OAQAAMAAJ&dq=Profiles+of+American+Colleges+with+CD-ROM+(2003+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Clarence Darrow on the death penalty","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HIkrAQAAMAAJ&dq=Clarence+Darrow+on+the+death+penalty&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Decoration on Fabric: A Sourcebook of Ideas","description":"From stitching and applique, through to silk painting, dyeing and printing, Pauline Brown gives step-by-step advice for achieving professional decorating results with fabric.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8t3twAEACAAJ&dq=Decoration+on+Fabric:+A+Sourcebook+of+Ideas&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Eclipse in Action: A Guide for the Java Developer","description":"Provides a thorough guide to using Eclipse features and plugins effectively in the context of real-world Java development.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AGVdQis0obMC&dq=Eclipse+in+Action:+A+Guide+for+the+Java+Developer&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Contemporary Machine Embroidered Quilts: Innovative Techniques and Designs","description":"Now quilters can successfully combine the two great arts of embroidery and quilting, with amazing results!

Practice is an essential part of preparing for a test and improving a test taker's chance of success. The best way to practice taking a test is by going through lots of practice test questions. If someone has never taken a practice test, then they are unprepared for the types of questions and answer choices that they will encounter on the official test. There is a tremendous advantage to someone taking the test that is already familiar with the questions and answer choices. Another advantage of taking practice tests is that you can assess your performance and see if you need to study and practice more, or if you're already prepared enough to achieve success on your test day. If you do well on the practice test, then you know you're prepared. If you struggle on the practice test, then you know you may still have more work to do to get prepared. Taking lots of practice tests helps ensure that you are not surprised or disappointed on your test day. Our Cosmetology Exam Practice Questions give you the opportunity to test your knowledge on a set of questions. You can know everything that is going to be covered on the test and it will not do you any good on test day if you have not had a chance to practice. Repetition is a key to success and using practice test questions allows you to reinforce your strengths and improve your weaknesses. Detailed answer explanations are also included for each question. It may sound obvious, but you have to know which questions you missed (and more importantly why you missed them) to be able to avoid making the same mistakes again when you take the real test. That's why our Cosmetology Exam Practice Questions include answer keys with detailed answer explanations. These in-depth answer explanations will allow you to better understand any questions that were difficult for you or that you needed more help to understand.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=q2NZngEACAAJ&dq=The+Complete+Cosmetology+Practice+Test+Book&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cripple Nation","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LnyatQEACAAJ&dq=Cripple+Nation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The New Testament and the People of God: Christian Origins and the Question of God v. 1","description":"Why did Christianity begin, and why did it take the shape it did? To answer this question -- which any historian must face -- renowned New Testament scholar N. T. Wright focuses on the key points: what precisely happened at Easter? What did the early Christians mean when they said that Jesus of Nazareth had been raised from the dead? What can be said today about this belief? This book, third in Wright's series Christian Origins and the Question of God, sketches a map of ancient beliefs about life after death, in both the Greco-Roman and Jewish worlds. It then highlights the fact that the early Christians' belief about the afterlife belonged firmly on the Jewish spectrum, while introducing several new mutations and sharper definitions. This, together with other features of early Christianity, forces the historian to read the Easter narratives in the gospels, not simply as late rationalizations of early Christian spirituality, but as accounts of two actual events: the empty tomb of Jesus and his \\"appearances.\\" How do we explain these phenomena? The early Christians' answer was that Jesus had indeed been bodily raised from the dead; that was why they hailed him as the messianic \\"son of God.\\" No modern historian has come up with a more convincing explanation. Facing this question, we are confronted to this day with the most central issues of the Christian worldview and theology.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RoD5_bN-WxUC&dq=The+New+Testament+and+the+People+of+God:+Christian+Origins+and+the+Question+of+God+v.+1&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Texas Mutiny","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=a7XGAAAACAAJ&dq=Texas+Mutiny&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Living By Zen: A Synthesis of the Historical and Practical Aspects of Zen Buddhism","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lr-fAAAAMAAJ&dq=Living+By+Zen:+A+Synthesis+of+the+Historical+and+Practical+Aspects+of+Zen+Buddhism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Short Course in Choosing & Using a Digital Camera (Short Courses)","description":"02","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mX86BAAAQBAJ&dq=A+Short+Course+in+Choosing&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Garden Color Book","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"At This Same Hour","description":"Annotation Founded in Baltimore in 1828, the Oblate Sisters of Providence formed the first permanent African-American Roman Catholic sisterhood in the United States.

Known for his barbed wit, he was one of the most successful playwrights of late Victorian London, and one of the greatest celebrities of his day. Wilde made his reputation in the theatre world with a series of highly popular plays. Lady Windermere's Fan (1893) like many of Wilde's comedies is a biting satire on the morals of Victorian society, particularly marriage. A Woman of No Importance (1893) is a testimony of Wilde's wit and his brand of dark comedy. An Ideal Husband (1895) revolves around blackmail and political corruption, and touches on the themes of public and private honour.

In his writing, Luke records the story of God working through Jesus to usher in a new era of promise and Spirit-enablement so that the people of God can be God s people even in the midst of a hostile world. It is a message the church still needs today. Bock both covers major Lukan themes and sets forth the distinctive contribution of Luke-Acts to the New Testament and the canon of Scripture, providing readers with an in-depth and holistic grasp of Lukan theology in the larger context of the Bible. I. Howard Marshall:  A remarkable achievement that should become the first port of call for students in this central area of New Testament Theology.  Craig S. Keener:  Bock s excellent exploration of Luke s theological approach and themes meets an important need in Lukan theology.

Travel has always featured heavily in textile art, from artists   travelling sketchbooks  to large-scale installations mapping coastal erosion or the effects of climate change. In this book, renowned textile artist Anne Kelly shows how to capture your travels, past and present, in stitch, with practical techniques sitting alongside inspiring images. She begins the book by discussing maps in textile art, including their iconography as well as incorporating actual maps into textile work. She then goes on to explore the influence of different cultures from across the globe on textile art. From India and Peru to Scotland and Scandinavia, the book shows how to harness traditional techniques, fabrics, motifs and colours for use in your own work. The chapter  Stopping Places  captures the moments in time on a journey that can be distilled, remembered and documented to create stitched postcards, sketchbooks and other pieces. The final chapter,  Space and the Imagination , explores the possibilities of space travel as a source of inspiration, and covers inner space too, with artists mapping their own emotional journeys. Including a wealth of practical tricks and techniques as well as exquisite photography of both Anne s own work and that of other leading textile artists, this fascinating book will inspire all textile artists, embroiderers and makers to use past travels to influence their work.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Hk0mEAAAQBAJ&dq=Travels+with+Anne&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE WOUNDED HEART: St. Charles of Sezze.","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TGZNAQAAMAAJ&dq=THE+WOUNDED+HEART:+St.+Charles+of+Sezze.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dictionary of the Sport and Exercise Sciences","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Self Expressions: Mind, Morals, and the Meaning of Life (Philosophy of Mind Series)","description":"Human beings have the unique ability to consciously reflect on the nature of the self. But reflection has its costs. We can ask what the self is, but as David Hume pointed out, the self, once reflected upon, may be nowhere to be found. The favored view is that we are material beings living in the material world. But if so, a host of destabilizing questions surface. If persons are just a sophisticated sort of animal, then what sense is there to the idea that we are free agents who control our own destinies? What makes the life of any animal, even one as sophisticated as Homo sapiens, worth anything? What place is there in a material world for God? And if there is no place for a God, then what hold can morality possibly have on us--why isn't everything allowed? Flanagan's collection of essays takes on these questions and more. He continues the old philosophical project of reconciling a scientific view of ourselves with a view of ourselves as agents of free will and meaning-makers. But to this project he brings the latest insights of neuroscience, cognitive science, and psychiatry, exploring topics such as whether the conscious mind can be explained scientifically, whether dreams are self-expressive or just noise, the moral socialization of children, and the nature of psychological phenomena such as multiple personality disorder and false memory syndrome. What emerges from these explorations is a liberating vision which can make sense of the self, agency, character transformation, and the value and worth of human life. Flanagan concludes that nothing about a scientific view of persons must lead to nihilism.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KojmCwAAQBAJ&dq=Self+Expressions:+Mind,+Morals,+and+the+Meaning+of+Life+(Philosophy+of+Mind+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lectures on Quasiconformal Mappings (Kent Human Resource Management Series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PO08AQAAIAAJ&dq=Lectures+on+Quasiconformal+Mappings+(Kent+Human+Resource+Management+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Winds of Change: A Guided Journey with Healing Music through Grief, Loss & Transformation","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QxQQAQAAMAAJ&dq=The+Winds+of+Change:+A+Guided+Journey+with+Healing+Music+through+Grief,+Loss&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Quebecois: The Virgin Forest (Le Quebecois)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yCfHNwAACAAJ&dq=Quebecois:+The+Virgin+Forest+(Le+Quebecois)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Born in Exile","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"An Introduction to Law Enforcement: An Insider's View","description":"Introduction to Law Enforcement: An Insider s View (5th Edition) is a very unique textbook. It draws upon the author s dual set of experiences as a member of the academic world and also as a sworn police officer. The author, Dr. William G. Doerner, has been a faculty member in the College of Criminology and Criminal Justice at The Florida State University, one of the premiere programs in the country, since 1977. He retired from active duty with the Tallahassee Police Department after 29 years of service as a part-time sworn law enforcement officer. Balancing these two perspectives enables readers to peek into the law enforcement world through the eyes of a cop and the mind of a professor. The book is divided into four major units. The first part, The Context of Law Enforcement, helps the reader assemble a picture of how this formal institution came into being, recognize some of the more prominent issues that surfaced with this new arrangement, assess various reform efforts, and understand how agencies are structured. The second portion, Behind the Badge, explores what it takes to become a police officer. Topics here range from how agencies select candidates from the applicant pool, what recruits experience during the police academy and rookie training phases, as well as lessons in criminal law, search and seizure, and interrogation standards. The next segment focuses on how officers work the streets. The emphasis here is on the decision-making processes that surround the arrest option and reliance upon the use of force. The final part trails officers after they complete their tours of duty and are Off the Streets. It raises questions about whether law enforcement is as stressful as some portray it, the adjustments officers must make in their personal and occupational lives, the perennial question of who polices the police, and whether policing is a profession or simply another job. The author has compiled a distinguished career in both law enforcement and academia. In addition to being decorated for meritorious service and honored by his agency as Officer of the Year, Dr. Doerner also served two terms as the editor of the American Journal of Criminal Justice. The Southern Criminal Justice Association bestowed its Criminal Justice Educator of the Year Award on him in recognition of his accomplishments in teaching, research, and service. In addition, the American Society of Victimology selected Professor Doerner as the recipient of its 2009 John P.J. Dussich Award, which recognizes excellence in research and the provision of services to crime victims over a substantial length of time. An article examining accreditation patterns among Florida municipal police agencies, published with his son who holds a doctorate in economics, recently won accolades for its incisive insights from the editors at Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies & Management. \\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3uE4DQEACAAJ&dq=An+Introduction+to+Law+Enforcement:+An+Insider%27s+View&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Are you a genius?","description":"Do you feel like you re doing it all and it s still not enough?

Known collectively as Apaches, these Indians lived in diverse, widely scattered groups with many names--Mescaleros, Chiricahuas, and Jicarillas, to name but three. Much has been written about them and their leaders, such as Geronimo, Juh, Nana, Victorio, and Mangas Coloradas, but no one wrote extensively about the greatest leader of them all: Cochise. Now, however, Edwin R. Sweeney has remedied this deficiency with his definitive biography. Cochise, a Chiricahua, was said to be the most resourceful, most brutal, most feared Apache. He and his warriors raided in both Mexico and the United States, crossing the border both ways to obtain sanctuary after raids for cattle, horses, and other livestock. Once only he was captured and imprisoned; on the day he was freed he vowed never to be taken again. From that day he gave no quarter and asked none. Always at the head of his warriors in battle, he led a charmed life, being wounded several times but always surviving. In 1861, when his brother was executed by Americans at Apache Pass, Cochise declared war. He fought relentlessly for a decade, and then only in the face of overwhelming military superiority did he agree to a peace and accept the reservation. Nevertheless, even though he was blamed for virtually every subsequent Apache depredation in Arizona and New Mexico, he faithfully kept that peace until his death in 1874. Sweeney has traced Cochise's activities in exhaustive detail in both United States and Mexican Archives. We are not likely to learn more about Cochise than he has given us. His biography will stand as the major source for all that is yet to be written on Cochise.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1hsYu9DUXWgC&dq=Cochise:+Chiricahua+Apache+Chief+(Civilization+of+the+American+Indian)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Introduction to Security, Sixth Edition","description":"Bullock, Haddow, and Coppola have set the standard for homeland security textbooks, and they follow up best-selling third edition with this substantially improved version.

Reich presents a new way of seeing the parental compulsion to teach. In other chapters, Reich examines attitudes toward infantile masturbation, the source of the human no, and special disturbances of the young.

Hailed as a masterpiece by critics worldwide, The Last Temptation of Christ is a monumental reinterpretation of the Gospels that brilliantly fleshes out Christ s Passion.

He is a figure who is gloriously divine but earthy and human, a man like any other subject to fear, doubt, and pain. In elegant, thoughtful prose Nikos Kazantzakis, one of the greats of modern literature, follows this Jesus as he struggles to live out God s will for him, powerfully suggesting that it was Christ s ultimate triumph over his flawed humanity, when he gave up the temptation to run from the cross and willingly laid down his life for mankind, that truly made him the venerable redeemer of men.

Controlling Accounts.--The addition of special columns in books of original entry makes possible the keeping of Controlling Accounts. The most common examples of such accounts are Accounts Receivable account and Accounts Payable account. These summary accounts, respectively, displace individual customers' and creditors' accounts in the Ledger. The customers' accounts are then segregated in another book called the Sales Ledger or Customers' Ledger, while the creditors' accounts are kept in the Purchase or Creditors' Ledger. The original Ledger, now much reduced in size, is called the General Ledger. The Trial Balance now refers to the accounts in the General Ledger. It is evident that the task of taking a Trial Balance is greatly simplified because so many fewer accounts are involved. A Schedule of Accounts Receivable is then prepared, consisting of the balances found in the Sales Ledger, and its total must agree with the balance of the Accounts Receivable account shown in the Trial Balance. A similar Schedule of Accounts Payable, made up of all the balances in the Purchase Ledger, is prepared, and it must agree with the balance of the Accounts Payable account of the General Ledger.\\" The Balance Sheet.--In the more elementary part of the text, the student learned how to prepare a Statement of Assets and Liabilities for the purpose of disclosing the net capital of an enterprise.

The World the Plague Made is a panoramic history of how the bubonic plague revolutionized labour, trade, and technology and set the stage for Europe s global expansion. James Belich takes readers across centuries and continents to shed new light on one of history s greatest paradoxes. Why did Europe s dramatic rise begin in the wake of the Black Death? Belich shows how plague doubled the per capita endowment of everything even as it decimated the population. Many more people had disposable incomes. Demand grew for silks, sugar, spices, furs, gold, and slaves. Europe expanded to satisfy that demand and plague provided the means. Labour scarcity drove more use of waterpower, wind power, and gunpowder. Technologies like water-powered blast furnaces, heavily gunned galleons, and musketry were fast-tracked by plague. A new  crew culture  of  disposable males  emerged to man the guns and galleons. Setting the rise of Western Europe in global context, Belich demonstrates how the mighty empires of the Middle East and Russia also flourished after the plague, and how European expansion was deeply entangled with the Chinese and other peoples throughout the world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FStaEAAAQBAJ&dq=The+black+death&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE AMERICAN COVENANT THE UNTOLD STORY","description":"As our national fabric unravels before a watching world, the unanswered question of the twenty-first century cries for a response: What happened to the America that once led the world by example?To put it bluntly, we have forgotten the covenant that our Founders made with our Creator.

But if, with Jonathan Lear, we scrutinize these thinkers' attempts to explain human behavior in terms of a higher principle--whether happiness or death--the pictures fall apart. Aristotle attempted to ground ethical life in human striving for happiness, yet he didn't understand what happiness is any better than we do. Happiness became an enigmatic, always unattainable, means of seducing humankind into living an ethical life. Freud fared no better when he tried to ground human striving, aggression, and destructiveness in the death drive, like Aristotle attributing purpose where none exists. Neither overarching principle can guide or govern \\"the remainder of life,\\" in which our inherently disruptive unconscious moves in breaks and swerves to affect who and how we are. Lear exposes this tendency to self-disruption for what it is: an opening, an opportunity for new possibilities. His insights have profound consequences not only for analysis but for our understanding of civilization and its discontent.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=o5POiFt50N8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Terrorists of Irustan","description":"On the planet of Irustan, where women have few rights, medicant Zahra IbSada helps her friend Kalen retrieve Kalen's daughter from an abusive marriage, an act that has life-changing consequences for the women of the planet.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=s_CPhhvpmdgC&dq=The+Terrorists+of+Irustan&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Simple Wealth, Inevitable Wealth: How You and Your Financial Advisor Can Grow Your Fortune in Stock Mutual Funds","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EEheKqbq9k8C&dq=Simple+Wealth,+Inevitable+Wealth:+How+You+and+Your+Financial+Advisor+Can+Grow+Your+Fortune+in+Stock+Mutual+Funds&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hurry Up, Molly /Aprate, Molly (English and Spanish Edition)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6ABEDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Toma!

Its stars have gone from being virtual unknowns in the early 70s to doing appearances on Jay Leno and television talk shows. The adult film business has grown by leaps and bounds. In 1984 alone more people rented or bought an X-rated movie than voted for Ronald Regan. In this book, I have given the reader an uncensored, inside look at all the workings of the sex industry from movies and magazines to mens clubs and all the emotions that go along with it. By reading these excerpts from my personal diary, I share with you the anger, elation, sadness and fear that have comprised my life. I give an inside look at the many famous people Ive met and their personal quirks. As the first Native American porn star, I show you how this line of work is seen in the eyes of my religion and culture, and I share some of the healing ceremonies I have experienced. Why would a young woman decide to get into such a business? What is it like to make an X-rated movie or to dance nude on stage in a gentlemens club? Many women say it is empowering. What kind of lives did these women have before entering the world of X? Why do they say it increases their self-esteem? Is it REALLY healthy emotionally? Why have five of my colleagues committed suicide? Whats it like when your friends (and the Godmother of your children) are dropping like flies?

The theist belief that God exists as a conscious entity in some form other than that of matter or energy denies, by definition, the actual existence of God. Atheism denies the belief in God existing as a conscious entity. Neither theists nor atheists rely upon evidence to support their belief. This thesis proposes that God either exists or doesn't exist and belief does not change the ultimate fact. Syllogistically, if God exists, God exists as some form of matter or energy and God is infinite by definition, and since matter and energy can be neither created nor destroyed according to the Law of Conservation, God and matter and energy are identical and everything that exists in the cosmos is God. Omnideism proposes a logical explanation for the actual existence of God consistent with the laws of physics and theistic purpose for human existence . . . if God exists.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=IkPdDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Ultimate Breathing Workout (Revised Edition)","description":"The owner's guide to the voice, this book will help you develop an understanding of the voice and how it works.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=I0e-b3xDwo8C&dq=The+Ultimate+Breathing+Workout+(Revised+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mamm Bk Historical Erotica(tr)","description":"The long-awaited magnum opus from Haruki Murakami, in which this revered and bestselling author gives us his hypnotically addictive, mind-bending ode to George Orwell's 1984.

The authors, a brain scientist and a theoretical physicist, present a new quantum framework for investigating advanced functions of the brain such as consciousness and memory. The book is the first to give a systematic account, founded in fundamental quantum physical principles, of how the brain functions as a unified system. It is based on the quantum field theory originated in the 1960s by the great theoretical physicist, Hiroomi Umezawa, to whom the book is dedicated. It poses an alternative to the dominant conceptions in the neuro- and cognitive sciences, which take neurons organized into networks as the basic constituents of the brain. Certain physical substrates in the brain are shown to support quantum field phenomena, and the resulting strange quantum properties are used to explain consciousness and memory. This change of perspective results in a radically new vision of how the brain functions.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iNUvcniwvg0C&dq=Quantum+Brain+Dynamics+and+Consciousness:+An+introduction+(Advances+in+Consciousness+Research)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Raising Awesome Kids in Troubled Times","description":"A North Carolina minister's point-of-view on how parents should raise their children.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_nxUsVy_FWkC&dq=Raising+Awesome+Kids+in+Troubled+Times&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Claro With Student Audio C D Fourth Edition","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jvhuAAAACAAJ&dq=Claro+With+Student+Audio+C+D+Fourth+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"William Branham: Man Sent From God","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=m6pqngEACAAJ&dq=William+Branham:+Man+Sent+From+God&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Choosing a College","description":"Cut through the noise and make better college and career choices This book is about addressing the college-choosing problem.

Author Robert Friedmann ably links hate, vilification, and dehumanization, with terrorism. Starting with incidents of anti-Semitism in early 2000, he brings a \\"play-by-play\\" account of the recent wave of Palestinian terrorism, the horrendous terror atrocities such as 9-11, and the war in Afghanistan and Iraq. Spanning over the first four years of the new millennium, Friedmann points out the perpetrators, the victims, the supporters of terror, and the problematic media coverage. The two volumes of A Diary of Four Years of Terrorism and Anti-Semitism 2000-2004 cover the most sensitive period in modern history, demonstrating how false ideologies turn victims to perpetrators, how the industry of death is glorified, and the challenges to the very existence of Israel, the West, and to freedom.

Vatican correspondent for German newspaper Die Welt, journalist Paul Badde was intrigued when he heard of a mysterious image in a remote Italian village--an image of a man's face on byssus cloth. Byssus, or sea silk, is a rare and delicate fabric woven from a silky filament produced by mollusks. It is claimed that the fabric is so thin and delicate that it is impossible to paint on--yet the image in Manoppello is clearly visible and, moreover, when laid over the image of the face on the Shroud of Turin forms a perfect match. Experts determined that the cloth of Manoppello is not Veronica's veil, but rather the face cloth layed over the face of Jesus in the tomb. Unlike the Shroud of Turin, which is a negative of the image, the image on the face cloth is a positive of the face of Christ. Paul Badde takes the reader along on a thrilling journey of discovery as he travels to research this remarkable relic, tracing the turbulent history of the Holy Face from ancient times up to the historic 2006 visit to Manoppello by Pope Benedict XVI. Illustrated with 16 pages of color photos.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xuiYEOyEOQ8C&dq=The+True+Face+of+God&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Read me or rue it","description":" Read Me or Rue It.

What he learned from Aquinas reinforced the basis of a theological paradigm whose main lines would remain intact throughout all of his subsequent work. The Divine Initiative explores Lonergan's comprehensive position on the doctrines of grace and providence formulated in his early writings, paying particular attention to the unpublished treatise De ente supernaturali (On Supernatural Being). J. Michael Stebbins' investigation uncovers a theological synthesis of remarkable assimilative capacity. A key to Lonergan's position is his sophisticated understanding of the structured but dynamic process that characterizes the order of the created universe. Lonergan characterizes grace as a particular instance of God's providential activity in human living and in the cosmos as a whole. On the strength of his inquiries into Aquinas' positions on the meaning of causality, free will, sin, and divine transcendence, Lonergan explains why God's governance of all created activity is compatible with the contingence of created events in general and with human freedom in particular. Lonergan's conclusions are made possible by his insistence that the elements of Thomist metaphysics are grounded in corresponding activities of human cognitional process.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=z811QgAACAAJ&dq=The+Divine+Initiative+:+Grace,+World-Order,+and+Human+Freedom+in+the+Early+Writings+of+Bernard+Lonergan+(Lonergan+Studies)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Modern Blackness: Nationalism, Globalization, and the Politics of Culture in Jamaica (Latin America Otherwise)","description":"DIVAn ethnographic study of cultural policy in Jamaica as seen from above and below in relation to race, class, and nation./div","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=76f5UQgNll0C&dq=Modern+Blackness:+Nationalism,+Globalization,+and+the+Politics+of+Culture+in+Jamaica+(Latin+America+Otherwise)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beyond the Wrinkles: Inspiration from a Nursing Home","description":"Beyond the Wrinkles is a collection of short stories about people living in a nursing home.

As a teenager she hitchhiked to India and later to Afghanistan and Thailand. In Malaysia, at age nineteen, she fell in love with Eddy Tan Kim Soo, a handsome, wealthy Chinese man. They planned to meet in Europe and marry. But at the airport on her way home, her spanking new Samsonite suitcase a gift from Eddy  was ripped apart by custom officials. Beatrice was horrified to see that it contained several kilos of heroin. Clearly she had been set up by Eddy, who, it turned out, was a member of a powerful drug cartel. Arrested, Beatrice languished in prison for two years before she was tried. Her sentence: death by hanging. On appeal, her sentence was reduced to life in prison. Efforts on the part of her grandmother and an impassioned attorney managed to stir up public opinion, finally leading to Beatrice s release after ten years. But however terrible, these years were not lost. While in prison, her spirits were never broken: she taught herself Malaysian and Cantonese, and became a model prisoner and a leader as well as a medical supervisor, caring for her fellow inmates.

Cohen and Howard Eichenbaum bring togetherconverging findings from neuropsychology, neuroscience, and cognitive science that provide thecritical clues and constraints for developing a more comprehensive understanding of memory.Specifically, they offer a cognitive neuroscience theory of memory that accounts for the nature ofmemory impairment exhibited in human amnesia and animal models of amnesia, that specifies thefunctional role played by the hippocampal system in memory, and that provides further understandingof the componential structure of memory.The authors' central thesis is that the hippocampal systemmediates a capacity for declarative memory, the kind of memory that in humans supports consciousrecollection and the explicit and flexible expression of memories. They argue that this capacityemerges from a representation of critical relations among items in memory, and that such arelational representation supports the ability to make inferences and generalizations from memory,and to manipulate and flexibly express memory in countless ways. In articulating such a descriptionof the fundamental nature of declarative representation and of the mnemonic capabilities to which itgives rise, the authors' theory constitutes a major extension and elaboration of the earlierprocedural-declarative account of memory.Support for this view is taken from a variety ofexperimental studies of amnesia in humans, nonhuman primates, and rodents. Additional support isdrawn from observations concerning the neuroanatomy and neurophysiology of the hippocampal system.The data taken from divergent literatures are shown to converge on the central theme of hippocampalinvolvement in declarative memory across species and across behavioral paradigms.Neal J. Cohen isAssistant Professor in the Amnesia Research Laboratory at Beckman Institute for Advanced Science andTechnology, and in the Department of Psychology at the University of Illinois.

His explication covers, as another useful special case, the multiplicity theory of unitary representations of locally compact abelian groups.

You are more loving than your relationships allow, more brilliant than your career suggests. In your secret depth of being, you are infinite, creative, boundless and utterly unable to press your full glory into the world. Or so it seems. In Blue Truth, David Deida presents a treasury of skills and insights for uncovering and offering your true heart of purpose, passion, and unquenchable love. In Part One, Deida shows you how to open as the entirety of the moment, feeling as deep inside and as far outside as you can, for as long as now opens. In Part Two, he reveals how to walk this path in the wilderness of intimate relationship, illuminating the art and play of sexual gifting, including how to expertly navigate the tangle of anger, jealousy, fear, lust, and much, much more.  Knowing the truth is fairly useless; feeling it is profound; living it makes all the difference,  teaches David Deida. With Blue Truth, you have an unprecedented guide for living your own deep truth, and awakening  as the bare openness you are, in the free offering of love to all.  Blue Truth was named by Spirituality & Health Magazine (June 2006 issue) as one of the Best Spiritual Books of 2005, in the Personal Growth category. Praise  Blue Truth is a brilliant book, absolutely gorgeous. Ancient wisdom on sacred sexuality, freed of historical and cultural trappings, glows from these pages in exhilarating, luminous prose. Deida brilliantly lays bare the hidden psychology of feminine and masculine and offers clear instructions for tapping into our deepest core and achieving true harmony through sexual intimacy. I feel that Deida has reached a new level of poetic genius in his writing, and his understanding of feminine psychology astounds me. I am just knocked out by this book.   Miranda Shaw, PhD, author of Passionate Enlightenment: Women in Tantric Buddhism  David Deida is in the dynamic living oral tradition of maverick spiritual teachers who, like free-jazz musicians, can riff directly on Reality, outside of established forms. Mark my words: in a future that I hope is not too far off, David Deida s original Western Dharma will be widely known as one of the most sublime and accessible expressions of the essence of spiritual practice that is freely offered today.

Publishers Weekly High school is brutal, but Jen B. has learned to pick her battles. Except the first one that one is mandatory. At the Good Reverend Doctor Martin Luther King High School, aka  Kung Fu,  everyone gets beaten to a pulp in their first week. Getting  kicked in  helps Ridley, the drug kingpin who runs the school and everyone in it, maintain order. He's the reason that 99.5 percent of the students know some form of martial art, and why they suit up in body armor and blades before class. Jen s life is savage but simple until the day her cousin Jimmy, a world-famous kung fu champion, shows up. Everyone at Kung Fu wants a piece of him, especially Ridley, but Jimmy s made a promise never to fight again a promise that sends the whole school hurtling toward a colossal clash, ending in an epic bloody showdown. Ryan Gattis s dystopian satire, Kung Fu High School, is a cult classic in the making a darkly comic, gleefully graphic, barbaric opera about loyalty, survival, and the horrors of high school, which earned comparison with the works of such icons as Chuck Palahniuk, Richard Price, and Anthony Burgess.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_Gs6DgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fifty Candles","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Invitation to Discrete Mathematics","description":"Invitation to Discrete Mathematics is an introduction and a thoroughly comprehensive text at the same time.

Most importantly, Prose cautions readers to slow down and pay attention to words, the raw material out of which all literature is crafted, and reminds us that good writing comes out of good reading. /div","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ytjYAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Better Than Chocolate: The Wrong Bed (Harlequin Temptation)","description":"Better Than Chocolate... by Jennifer LaBrecque released on Aug 25, 2004 is available now for purchase.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=POq1Mfm4Xr4C&dq=Better+Than+Chocolate:+The+Wrong+Bed+(Harlequin+Temptation)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Manual of Pain Management","description":"This pocket manual is intended as a concise resource for pain practitioners, residents rotating through or interested in Pain Management, and for Pain Fellows- especially those training at an ACGME-accredited pain fellowship.

The documents, too, from which the doctrine is to be drawn, charmed my fancy by their endless variety, and lay always before me, even in sleep; for they are the tools in our hands, the bread in our basket, the transactions of the street, the farm, and the dwelling-house, greetings, relations, debts and credits, the influence of character, the nature and endowment of all men. It seemed to me, also, that in it might be shown men a ray of divinity, the present action of the soul of this world, clean from all vestige of tradition, and so the heart of man might be bathed by an inundation of eternal love, conversing with that which he knows was always and always must be, because it really is now. It appeared, moreover, that if this doctrine could be stated in terms with any resemblance to those bright intuitions in which this truth is sometimes revealed to us, it would be a star in many dark hours and crooked passages in our journey that would not suffer us to lose our way.Ralph Waldo EmersonLife Transformation Publishing / www.lifetransformationpublishing.com selected this book to publish because it was recommended by Napaloeon Hill who wrote Think and Grow Rich of which we have published also.

The marriage of this charismatic, ambitious statesman to twenty-year-old Eliza Allen, the daughter of a prominent landholder, seemed to form the perfect social foundation on which Houston would build his glittering career. But just eleven weeks after the wedding, Eliza suddenly and inexplicably left her new husband, creating a scandal that caused the governor to resign his office in disgrace and embark on an exile that would ultimately deliver him to Texas, and a destiny even grander and more improbable than anyone could have imagined. Through decades of rumor and speculation, Sam Houston and Eliza Allen never revealed the source of their unhappiness, and carried the secret with them to their graves. The Raven s Bride is a brilliantly original novel that unravels this dark romantic mystery while illuminating a vivid and fascinating moment in America s past. In these pages, Sam Houston is presented as he must have been a heroic figure (called the Raven by the Cherokee), vain, flamboyant, magnetic, his outsized personality fueled by a desperate need for love. And Eliza Allen is his match: a prideful, magnificent young woman, both drawn to and disturbed by her husband s grand aspirations. With the investigative acuity of a historian and the profound empathy of a gifted novelist, Elizabeth Crook has created an enthralling portrait of these star-crossed lovers and the vibrant, restless world that brought them together. Richly detailed and splendidly imagined, The Raven s Bride turns a baffling historical conundrum into a complex and deeply affecting love story.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RcIHAQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Our Continent: Natural History of North America","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=d-8smgEACAAJ&dq=Our+Continent:+Natural+History+of+North+America&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Directing For Theater: A Personal Approach","description":"\\"This book is as close as one gets to an attempt to define that elusive gift and talent for directing theater.

This book investigates how the newcomers interacted with Algonquian groups in the Chesapeake Bay area and New England, describing the role that original Americans occupied in England's empire during the critical first century of contact. Michael Leroy Oberg considers the history of Anglo-Indian relations in transatlantic context while viewing the frontier as a zone where neither party had the upper hand. He tells how the English pursued three sets of policies in America securing profit for their sponsors, making lands safe from both European and native enemies, and \\"civilizing\\" the Indians and explains why the British settlers found it impossible to achieve all of these goals. Oberg places the history of Anglo-Indian relations in the early Chesapeake and New England in a broad transatlantic context while drawing parallels with subsequent efforts by England as well as its imperial rivals the French, Dutch, and Spanish to plant colonies in America.

Mendels begins with a concise discussion of the historical canon that emerged in Late Antiquity and brought with it the (distorted) memory of ancient history in Western culture. The following nine chapters each focus on a different source of collective memory in order to demonstrate the patchy and incomplete associations ancient societies had with their past, including discussions of Plato's Politeia, a \\"site of memory\\" of the early church, and the dichotomy existing between the reality of the land of Israel in the Second Temple period and memories of it. Throughout the book, Mendels shows that since the societies of Antiquity had associations with only bits and pieces of their past, these associations could be slippery and problematic, constantly changing, multiplying and submerging. Memories, true and false, oral and inscribed, provide good evidence for this fluidity.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EbBCUbUFPBYC&dq=Memory+and+History+in+Christianity+and+Judaism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bessie","description":"Considered by many to be the greatest blues singer of all time, Bessie Smith was also a successful vaudeville entertainer who became the highest paid African-American performer of the roaring twenties.

Within the last ten to fifteen years there has been a dramatic change. Engineers and designers recognise the scope that rotational moulding offers for the production of relatively inexpensive, complex shapes with low levels of moulded-in stress. Materials suppliers are continually developing new grades of plastics as well as a wider selection of materials suited to the process. In addition, machinery suppliers are producing more sophisticated moulding equipment so that the moulder now has control over the process that was previously thought impossible. For its second edition, this book has been updated and expanded by the authors, who are leaders in their specialties within the field of rotational moulding. It continues to provide an introduction to the subject, as well as giving comprehensive coverage of the state-of-the-art. Two new chapters have been added. These cover the important areas of pin-hole removal from rotomoulded products and the rotational moulding of liquid polymers. In both cases the new material is the result of extensive research, and the results will be of considerable practical interest to moulders. The book will surely be welcomed again by moulders, materials and equipment suppliers, engineers and designers, and by lecturers looking for up-to-date information to include in their courses.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FL1TAAAAMAAJ&dq=Simulation+of+non-isothermal+melt+densification+of+polyethylene+in+rotational+molding.:+An+article+from:+Polymer+Engineering+and+Science&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tomas Rivera (Green Light Readers Level 2)","description":"Tomfs Rivera wants to tell stories, just like his grandpa.

Focusing each chapter on the culinary and social history of one dish--such as fried chicken, chitlins, yams, greens, and \\"red drinks--Miller uncovers how it got on the soul food plate and what it means for African American culture and identity. Miller argues that the story is more complex and surprising than commonly thought. Four centuries in the making, and fusing European, Native American, and West African cuisines, soul food--in all its fried, pork-infused, and sugary glory--is but one aspect of African American culinary heritage. Miller discusses how soul food has become incorporated into American culture and explores its connections to identity politics, bad health raps, and healthier alternatives. This refreshing look at one of America's most celebrated, mythologized, and maligned cuisines is enriched by spirited sidebars, photographs, and twenty-two recipes.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Od8VAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Reach","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Bodywise","description":"Bodywise is based on Joseph Heller's own brand of deep-tissue bodywork, which makes the connection between life issues and natural bodily alignment, and shows how to restore the body's natural balance.

He was a rebel and nonconformist from boyhood days. His character, creativity and imagination were related, and they drove both his life and his science. In this marvellously clear and accessible narrative, Walter Isaacson explains how his mind worked and the mysteries of the universe that he discovered. Einstein's success came from questioning conventional wisdom and marvelling at mysteries that struck others as mundane. This led him to embrace a worldview based on respect for free spirits and free individuals. All of which helped make Einstein into a rebel but with a reverence for the harmony of nature, one with just the right blend of imagination and wisdom to transform our understanding of the universe. This new biography, the first since all of Einstein's papers have become available, is the fullest picture yet of one of the key figures of the twentieth century. This is the first full biography of Albert Einstein since all of his papers have become available -- a fully realised portrait of this extraordinary human being, and great genius. Praise for EINSTEIN by Walter Isaacson:- 'YOU REALLY MUST READ THIS.' Sunday Times 'As pithy as Einstein himself.

Down-to-earth and perfectly realistic in scale, this is not an over-the-top Blade Runner tale. It is not science fiction. In 2029, the United States is engaged in a bloodless world war that will wipe out the savings of millions of American families. Overnight, on the international currency exchange, the  almighty dollar  plummets in value, to be replaced by a new global currency, the  bancor.  In retaliation, the president declares that America will default on its loans.  Deadbeat Nation  being unable to borrow, the government prints money to cover its bills. What little remains to savers is rapidly eaten away by runaway inflation. The Mandibles have been counting on a sizable fortune filtering down when their ninety-seven-year-old patriarch dies. Once the inheritance turns to ash, each family member must contend with disappointment, but also as the U.S. economy spirals into dysfunction the challenge of sheer survival. Recently affluent, Avery is petulant that she can t buy olive oil, while her sister, Florence, absorbs strays into her cramped household. An expat author, their aunt, Nollie, returns from abroad at seventy-three to a country that s unrecognizable. Her brother, Carter, fumes at caring for their demented stepmother, now that an assisted living facility isn t affordable. Only Florence s oddball teenage son, Willing, an economics autodidact, will save this formerly august American family from the streets. The Mandibles is about money.

The New York Review of Books If there s one thing Americans agree on, it s the value of diversity. Our corporations vie for slots in the Diversity Top 50, our universities brag about minority recruiting, and every month is Somebody s History Month. But in this  eloquent  (Chicago Tribune) and  captivating  (Los Angeles Times) book, Walter Benn Michaels argues that our enthusiastic celebration of  difference  masks our neglect of America s vast and growing economic divide. When it was first published in 2006, The Trouble with Diversity provoked a firestorm of praise and condemnation not only hailed as  genius  (The Economist),  cogent  (The New Yorker), and  impossible to disagree with  (The Washington Post) it was excoriated as a  wildly implausible  product of  the  shock and awe  school of political argument  (Slate) and  Seething, misplaced, amnesiac resentment  (The Nation). Now, a decade later, Michaels offers a new afterword on how our regime of equal-opportunity exploitation has only intensified. Magnificently iconoclastic, he demonstrates that commitments to diversity fail to offer a premise for social justice and in fact legitimize the economic forces that drive inequality rather than offering a resistance or even a critique. Most importantly, he makes the case that we should pay less attention to the illusory distinction of culture, and more attention to the real discrepancies of class and wealth.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nogfDAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Trouble+with+Diversity:+How+We+Learned+to+Love+Identity+and+Ignore+Inequality&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Holes and Other Superficialities (Bradford Books)","description":"\\"This is an exciting epistemological experiment.

The book describes a grand variety of holes -- holes in doughnuts, tunnels through blocks, flowing gaps in regularly-spaced flowerbed, and hundreds more.

And if so, what are they? Holes are among entities that down-to-earth philosophers would like to expel from their ontological inventory. Casati and Varzi argue in favor of their existence and explore the consequences of this unorthodox approach -- odd as these might appear.

Lauren Stratford lived a life of unending nightmares. As a small child she was offered sexually to strange men. Soon after, she was forced into a torturous routine of pornography, was controlled by mind- and body-altering drugs, and constantly received threats to her life. Though she sought help several times from adults she thought could be trusted with her secrets, no one was willing to risk becoming involved. After years of suffering what many would call the ultimate evil of sexual abuse, Lauren was held captive in the even more appalling world of Satanism and ritual abuse. Forced to participate in some of the most evil satanic rituals imaginable, Lauren was witness to shocking crimes against children and others, all performed in the name of Satan. Tormented sexually and mentally by the cult members, Lauren survived the torture because of her strong faith in God and her belief that He would deliver her from the evil of which she had become a part. It is an undisputed fact that this type of abuse occurs in the world today. Through this shocking story, anyone who is caught in the trap of sexual or ritual abuse can learn that there is a way out--that with the help of God and others, victims like Lauren can break free. Parents, counselors, law-enforcement personnel, and anyone who may know of or suspect a case of abuse will find in this book invaluable advice.

But when a tragic event in Emily's present too closely echoes her past, and parts of her story that she'd hoped never to share come to light, her perfect life is suddenly upturned. Then Emily hears a song on the radio about the woman who got away. The melody and voice are hauntingly familiar. Could it be?

Were they meant to be read comically, philosophically, allegorically, symbolically, or realistically? And is God godly when acting beyond the comprehension of prophets, let alone ordinary human beings? These issues, and many more, are thoughtfully considered in this meticulously detailed and insightful translation of the original Hebrew text of Jonah as created by Jewish authorities during the second half of the first millennium B.C.E. In these profound and enduring tales, realistic events and miraculous incidents merge, and we never have to wait long to witness the power of God's love or wrath. One of the twelve prophets, Jonah faced more challenges in a short span of time than any other biblical hero. He went to sea and nearly drowned in the belly of a great fish. On land, Jonah journeyed east to Nineveh, where his mission was to spread the word of God in a city plagued by evil. He was tested by God at every tum. But even during his darkest hours, his faith never wavered and through all the tumult, he always listened for the comforting voice of the Lord. Author Jack M. Sasson employs the very latest information in biblical scholarship to interpret the many nuances in Jonah's seemingly simple story. Providing Greek, Hebrew, Latin, Aramaic, and, occasionally, Syriac and Arabic translations, this work is an exciting addition to the world-acclaimed Anchor Bible commentaries.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0rbYAAAAMAAJ&dq=Jonah:+A+New+Translation+with+Introduction,+Commentary,+and+Interpretation+(Anchor+Bible)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gone From My Sight: the Dying Experience","description":"\\"The biggest fear of watching someone die is fear of the unknown; not knowing what dying will be like or when death will actually occur.

As a celebrity personality, he was heralded for everything from his unwavering stance against Hitler and Mussolini and his cataclysmic tantrums, to his \\"democratic\\" penchants for television wrestling and soup for dinner. During his years with the Metropolitan Opera (1908-15) and the New York Philharmonic (1926-36) he was regularly proclaimed the \\"world's greatest conductor .\\" And with the NBC Symphony (1937-54), created for him by RCA's David Sarnoff, he became the beneficiary of a voracious multimedia promotional apparatus that spread Toscanini madness nationwide. According to Life, he was as well-known as Joe Dimaggio; Time twice put him on its cover; and the New York Herald Tribune attributed Toscanini's fame to simple recognition of his unique \\"greatness.\\" In this boldly conceived and superbly realized study, Joseph Horowitz reveals how and why Toscanini became the object of unparalleled veneration in the United States. Combining biography, cultural history, and music criticism, Horowitz explores the cultural and commercial mechanisms that created America's Toscanini cult and fostered, in turn, a Eurocentric, anachronistic new audience for old music.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PYVoi8JK0WMC&dq=Understanding+Toscanini&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE HALCYON DRIFT","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Psi-Man 04: The Chaos Kid","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VOro0sfUCikC&dq=Psi-Man+04:+The+Chaos+Kid&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Playboy Magazine: April 2001 (Playboy Magazine, April 2001)","description":"From the New York Timesbestselling author and Dear Sugars columnist, an arousing story collection exploring modern love in the age of hook-up culture.

Distinct from IQ, this type of expertise consists of practical wisdom: accumulated knowledge, know-how, and intuition gained through extensive experience. How do such smarts develop? And what happens when people with deep smarts leave a particular job or the organization? Can any of their smarts be transferred? Should they be? Basing their conclusions on a multi-year research project, Dorothy Leonard and Walter Swap argue that cultivating and managing deep smarts are critical parts of any leader's job. The authors draw on examples from firms of all sizes and types to illustrate the connection between deep smarts and organizational viability and continuous innovation. Leonard and Swap describe the origins and limits of deep smarts and outline processes for cultivating and leveraging them across the organization. Developing an experience repertoire and receiving strategic guidance from wise coaches can help individuals move up the ladder of expertise from novice to master. Addressing a topic of increasing importance as the Boomer generation retires, Deep Smarts challenges leaders to take a hands-on approach to managing the experience-based knowledge shaping the future of their organizations.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kmjoBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mandelstam","description":"Osip Mandelstam is a central figure not only in modern Russian but in world poetry, the author of some of the most haunting and memorable poems of the twentieth century.

Recalling his experiences as a student in Texas, Jos  Lim n examines the politically motivated Chicano poetry of the 60s and 70s. He bases his analyses on Harold Bloom's theories of literary influence but takes Bloom into the socio-political realm. Lim n shows how Chicano poetry is nourished by the oral tradition of the Mexican corrido, or master ballad, which was a vital part of artistic and political life along the Mexican-U.S. border from 1890 to 1930. Lim n's use of Bloom, as well as of Marxist critics Raymond Williams and Fredric Jameson, brings Chicano literature into the arena of contemporary literary theory. By focusing on an important but little-studied poetic tradition, his book challenges our ideas of the American canon and extends the reach of Hispanists and folklorists as well.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZUvtMESMaE8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bottom Line's Nutrition Secrets","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Shipping Semen?

The authors have used their wealth of experience to produce an excellent and insightful collection of detailed examples, explanations, and advice on how to work with use cases.\\" Maria Ericsson The toughest challenge in building a software system that meets the needs of your audience lies in clearly understanding the problems that the system must solve. Advanced Use Case Modeling presents a framework for discovering, identifying, and modeling the problem that the software system will ultimately solve. Software developers often employ use cases to specify what should be performed by the system they're constructing. Although use case-driven analysis, design, and testing of software systems has become increasingly popular, little has been written on the role of use cases in the complete software cycle. This book fills that need by describing how to create use case models for complex software development projects, using practical examples to explain conceptual information. The authors extend the work of software visionary Ivar Jacobson, using the Unified Modeling Language (UML) as the notation to describe the book's models. Aimed primarily at software professionals, Advanced Use Case Modeling also includes information that relates use case technique to business processes. This book presents a process for creating and maintaining use case models in a framework that can be fully customized for your organization. The authors, pioneers in the application of use cases in software development, bring their extensive experience to cover topics such as: A process model for applying a use case model How to keep your use case modeling effort on track Tips and pitfalls in use case modeling How to organize your use case model for large-system development Similarities between Advanced Use Case Modeling and the Rational Unified Process framework Effect of use cases on user interface design Guidelines for quality use case modeling","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=V5eER53NWJYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"133 Blame Will Kill Your Soul","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Otherwhens, Otherwheres: Favorite Tales","description":"This is a one-of-a-kind collection of short stories by Dalmas that he has selected as his personal favorites.

Assigned to head the search, Cam finds himself resented by some of his fellow officers and subtly threatened by others. His job is further complicated by the fact that the offending judge is also his ex-wife and now---after years apart, and an uneasy reconciliation---his sometime lover. Cam's questions lead him to a remote mountain area in western North Carolina and a group of daredevils who call themselves \\"the cat dancers\\"---so named because they have tracked the last wild mountain lions in the region to their dens, where they have photographed the animals face-to-face, or died trying. Cam must hunt this group and the cats they seek, or become their next target.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gC62xFvJWq8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Journeys: Lost Japan","description":"An enchanting and fascinating insight into Japanese landscape, culture, history and future. Originally written in Japanese, this passionate, vividly personal book draws on the author's experiences in Japan over thirty years. Alex Kerr brings to life the ritualized world of Kabuki, retraces his initiation into Tokyo's boardrooms during the heady Bubble Years, and tells the story of the hidden valley that became his home. But the book is not just a love letter. Haunted throughout by nostalgia for the Japan of old, Kerr's book is part paean to that great country and culture, part epitaph in the face of contemporary Japan's environmental and cultural destruction. Winner of Japan's 1994 Shincho Gakugei Literature Prize. Alex Kerr is an American writer, antiques collector and Japanologist. Lost Japan is his most famous work.

Exquisitely illustrated, this series serves as a contemporary matrix for illuminating our human experience and offers insightful access into Eastern spirituality. In India, statues of Ganesh are placed at the inner-gates of many temples, symbolizing his role as a keeper of sacred spaces. Here, pilgrims and passersby pay homage and seek his blessings. It is this symbolic presence at the entrance of our most holy places that makes Ganesh such a vital figure in our lives. Stationed at the threshold of sacredness and awareness, mediating between the possibility of the profound and our often habitual, mundane perception of the world, Ganesh is the guiding force behind this very moment of experience  where desire meets possibility. Ganesh: Removing the Obstacles offers practical and meaningful interpretations of folk narratives and sacred texts concerning the larger-than-life elephant-headed god, Ganesh. James H. Bae is a practitioner of both Hindu and Buddhist yoga systems. For years Bae has lived in India investing himself in his spiritual study and training as a monk.

Her detailed discussion of the development of hair and headwear styles throughout this era is accompanied by period photographs known as cartes de visite, as well as numerous illustrations from fashion periodicals of the time such as Godey's Lady's Book, Harper's Bazar and Peterson's Magazine. It was during these years that the luxurious French lady dolls, so ardently collected today, assumed their great popularity. Collectors of these dolls have long been frustrated by the lack of accessible instructions and patterns for headwear for their elegant models. This is the first book to teach methods of constructing historically correct hats, caps and bonnets for French fashion dolls of the mid-to-late nineteenth century. The methods of assembly taught pertain to styles for dolls of more contemporary periods, as well. Ms. Burke offers instruction in the practical matters of millinery construction; chapters on tools, materials, making bonnet frames and working with straw and felt provide step-by step directions and culminate in the presentation of twelve fully illustrated patterns for making hats, caps and bonnets for lady dolls. Doll costumers, restorers and collectors will find this invaluable compendium an essential resource, while lovers of fashion history will revel in its visual delights.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hqJjPgAACAAJ&dq=Hat+Making+for+Dolls+1855+-1916&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sibling Rivalry: The Truth About the Family Favorite","description":"Explains how family dynamics shapes a person's character, and discusses the impact of parental favoritism","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BXFEAAAAYAAJ&dq=Sibling+Rivalry:+The+Truth+About+the+Family+Favorite&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"ALWAYS THE YOUNG STRANGERS","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VXGhngEACAAJ&dq=ALWAYS+THE+YOUNG+STRANGERS&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Second Great Depression","description":"This book provides a comprehensive political, economic, and historical analysis of the events and circumstances from the 1920s to 2010 that impacted the rise of today s  Global Capitalist Crises,  Global Economic Crises, and the U.S. s   Second Great Depression.

That will do the job.\\" But, in fact, it won't, for some very simple reasons. First, long-term studies have already shown that, in spite of all the media hype, most convicted sex offenders (up to 75% of them) do not re-offend. (Hanson, 1999). To castrate them is a waste of time. Secondly, most children are not molested by them. Most children are molested by someone they know and trust: like a friendly neighbor, down the street, or a school teacher, volunteer in some youth group or at the church. Often, unfortunately, by a relative in the family, be that an older brother, cousin, an inlaw or step-parent. Because none of them have been caught, we don't call them \\"sex offenders\\" and, as a result, 'castrating all the sex offenders' won't get them. They will still be left just as free as before. There is a better answer. Records now show that when convicted sex offenders are given exactly the kind of treatment and counseling in that is described in this book, re-offense rates are cut by 60%. (Alexander 1999). It is not terribly complicated. It isn't just a lot of theories. It is just simple, blunt honesty: making men face the reality of what they are doing, and how it is also wrecking their own lives, then training them in the steps it takes to stop doing so. That is what does it, right there. Here is the book that tells it all. In ten chapters, I relate how it happened that I became a child molester and got over it. That was almost 20 years ago now and I remain re-offense free, with no further convictions or arrests. The lessons from it that you can use to protect your children are given at the end of each chapter. If you follow them, your child will be safer than ever before. Steps that sex offenders can take to earn their way back into the community and a prescription for the healing of America conclude the work.The readers' resources section includes a listing of further books, journals, websites, referral agencies and self-recovery organizations that may also be of use to those who want more information. Fully indexed, the book will be a useful guide in all future child sex abuse trials.

When Machiavelli's brief treatise on Renaissance statecraft and princely power was posthumously published in 1532, it generated a debate that has raged unabated until the present day. Based upon Machiavelli's first-hand experience as an emissary of the Florentine Republic to the courts of Europe, The Prince analyses the usually violent means by which men seize, retain, and lose political power. Machiavelli added a dimension of incisive realism to one of the major philosophical and political issues of his time, especially the relationship between public deeds and private morality. His book provides a remarkably uncompromising picture of the true nature of power, no matter in what era or by whom it is exercised. This fluent new translation is accompanied by comprehensive notes and an introduction that considers the true purpose of The Prince and dispels some of the myths associated with it. ABOUT THE SERIES: For over 100 years Oxford World's Classics has made available the widest range of literature from around the globe.

CGI is a generic interface for calling external programs to crunch numbers, query databases, generate customized graphics, or perform any other server-side task. There was a time when CGI was the only game in town for server-side programming; today, although we have ASP, PHP, Java servlets, and ColdFusion (among others), CGI continues to be the most ubiquitous server-side technology on the Web.CGI programs can be written in any programming language, but Perl is by far the most popular language for CGI. Initially developed over a decade ago for text processing, Perl has evolved into a powerful object-oriented language, while retaining its simplicity of use. CGI programmers appreciate Perl's text manipulation features and its CGI.pm module, which gives a well-integrated object-oriented interface to practically all CGI-related tasks. While other languages might be more elegant or more efficient, Perl is still considered the primary language for CGI.CGI Programming with Perl, Second Edition, offers a comprehensive explanation of using CGI to serve dynamic web content.

Chances are that you have never met a real  Jehovah s Witness.  While those at your door may claim to be one of Jehovah s Witnesses, their own publications plainly teach otherwise. So, who are the real Jehovah s Witnesses? The Watchtower Society teaches that they are members of the 144,000 who will be the only ones going to heaven. Membership in this group began with the early apostles. Over the centuries others have been added but the Watchtower declared that the number was completed in 1935. Anyone who claims to be one of Jehovah s  Witnesses has to be one of the 144,000 and must be very old now. However, the Watchtower Society teaches that these are the only ones who hear from God and are responsible for Watchtower teaching and leadership. Because these people are dying, the Watchtower is facing a credibility crisis. So, the Watchtower is quietly manipulating these death figures to keep the Watchtower organization alive! And now, just last year, Watchtower literature quietly began to try to wiggle out of the 1935 closing date for the 144,000. But this only adds further opportunity for you to show the  JW  who comes to your door that he cannot trust the Watchtower with his precious eternal life. The Watchtower representative at your door believes he will remain on  Paradise Earth  after the coming Armageddon, since only the original 144,000 have any hope of going to heaven. In fact, they are the only ones allowed to take communion. He does not believe he can understand Bible truths without the Watchtower. He is dependent on a publication that, one day soon, will be left without writers to reveal God s truths. Who are those writers? Those who remain of the original 144,000 and they are dying! Oddly enough, their founder, Charles Taze Russell, never taught the doctrine of the 144,000. In this book, you will learn the true history of this false Watchtower doctrine. You will be surprised to discover that this doctrine is not just a Bible issue. It is also a historical issue and a numbers game that the Watchtower Society has had to manipulate throughout the years to keep that organization alive! With the information and witnessing strategies in this book, you will be able to plant seeds of doubt and undermine the authority of the Watchtower. The Watchtower knows it is essential that this cornerstone doctrine remain alive if it is going to continue to exist as the spiritual leader for its followers. Time is the enemy of this teaching and they know it.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wrNugxFWuHUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Diplomat's folly,: A police novel","description":"Aylwin Hundrych is a diplomat with political aspirations, who was once involved with a French girl, Antoinette, with whom he unwittingly shared details about a royal visit to Paris - details which put the King's life in danger.

Yet at the same time the law created the means to escape that relationship. How was this possible? And how did wives and husbands experience marriage within that legal regime? These are the complexities that Hendrik Hartog plumbs in a study of the powers of law and its limits. Exploring a century and a half of marriage through stories of struggle and conflict mined from case records, Hartog shatters the myth of a golden age of stable marriage. He describes the myriad ways the law shaped and defined marital relations and spousal identities, and how individuals manipulated and reshaped the rules of the American states to fit their needs. We witness a compelling cast of characters: wives who attempted to leave abusive husbands, women who manipulated their marital status for personal advantage, accidental and intentional bigamists, men who killed their wives' lovers, couples who insisted on divorce in a legal culture that denied them that right. As we watch and listen to these men and women, enmeshed in law and escaping from marriages, we catch reflected images both of ourselves and our parents, of our desires and our anxieties about marriage. Hartog shows how our own conflicts and confusions about marital roles and identities are rooted in the history of marriage and the legal struggles that defined and transformed it.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cRjXELrzCuMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Changeling Garden","description":"In The Changeling Garden by Winifred Elze, when Annie and Mark and their five-year-old son, David, move into a grand old Victorian house surrounded by a jumble of gardens, they are not prepared for the terrifying adventure that awaits them.

These houses of memorabilia enhance the lessons learned in school while allowing the opportunity to stand in their shadows. The displays bring alive the romance of a bygone era, and a good museum inspires each visitor to look with more enthusiasm toward the promises of the future. The Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D. C., is the one museum best equipped to provide all of these elements. Within the halls of the Smithsonian, visitors can see, under one roof, items like the Flyer, the actual first airplane that lifted off the sands at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, and Friendship 7, the capsule that, less than one century later, carried astronaut John Glenn on his orbit around the earth. Meanwhile, young children point and scream with delight when spotting a sweater worn by \\"Mister Rogers.\\" Standing just a few feet away, their grandparents gaze with fond remembrance at the \\"Charlie McCarthy doll\\" and \\"Archie Bunker's chair.\\" The Smithsonian highlights a variety of remarkable accomplishments. Visitors report that they have been moved by a variety of emotions when viewing the exhibits. Some of the artifacts rekindle pleasant memories of childhood, while others bring a tear of sadness. Each of them, however, is a piece of thread that has become woven into the fabric of this great nation. In a sense, the Smithsonian Institution is a reflection of the real United States of America, boldly showing America for what it really is--far from being perfect, yet determined to remain a nation that perpetuates the state of \\"becoming.\\" The stories in Echoes from the Smithsonian: America's History Brought to Life reveal both the triumphs and foibles of this great land.They will help readers appreciate all the more the devotion and accomplishments of those dedicated men and women who gave their time, their talent, and sometimes their lives in order to create and preserve this experiment Americans call a democracy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=akFN_Gccd64C&dq=Echoes+from+the+Smithsonian:+America%27s+History+Brought+to+Life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Survival: Diary of an American POW in World War II (Hellgate Memories World War II)","description":"This is the story of an American POW from his own memories, his fellow POW's recollections, and a secret diary he kept on the margins of his Bible.

A pioneer of physiology and physics, he was also deeply concerned with the implications of science for philosophy and culture. From the 1850s to the 1890s, Helmholtz delivered more than two dozen popular lectures, seeking to educate the public and to enlighten the leaders of European society and governments about the potential benefits of science and technology to a developing modern society. David Cahan has selected fifteen of these lectures, which reflect the wide range of topics of crucial importance to Helmholtz and his audiences. Among the subjects discussed are the origins of the planetary system, the relation of natural science to science in general, the aims and progress of the physical sciences, the problems of perception, and academic freedom in German universities. This collection also includes Helmholtz's fascinating lectures on the relation of optics to painting and the physiological causes of harmony in music, which provide insight into the relations between science and aesthetics. Science and Culture makes available again Helmholtz's eloquent arguments on the usefulness, benefits, and, intellectual pleasures of understanding the natural world. With Cahan's Introduction to set these essays in their broader context, this collection makes an important contribution to the philosophical and intellectual history of Europe at a time when science played an increasingly significant role in social, economic, and cultural life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xTxcgGX9dicC&dq=Science+and+Culture:+Popular+and+Philosophical+Essays&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Old-Time Tools & Toys of Needlework","description":"More than 200 illustrations of hoops, frames, pins, pincushions, punches, bobbins, bodkins, shuttles, spinning wheels, sewing machines, and more from a wide array of cultures.

The book demonstrates that, contrary to the perceptions of many New Testament scholars, the overwhelming majority of first-century Galileans were Jews. Utilizing the gospels, the writings of Josephus, and published archaeological excavation reports, Mark A. Chancey traces the historical development of the region's population and examines in detail specific cities and villages, finding ample indications of Jewish inhabitants and virtually none for gentiles. He argues that any New Testament scholarship that attempts to contextualize the Historical Jesus or the Jesus movement in Galilee must acknowledge and pay due attention to the region's predominantly Jewish milieu.

During this trip, he found an island of epic beauty and decided to purchase it. His story tells of his difficulty trying to adapt to such the harsh environment. The local population were Native Americans who gave him the name  Crazy White Man  for making the changes that he did.

This major commentary by Robert L. Hubbard Jr. shows how the author of Ruth used, with great literary artistry, the story of Ruth and Naomi to convey important theological themes. In his introduction Hubbard discusses the issues of text, canonicity, literary criticism, authorship, date, purpose, setting, genre, legal background, themes, and theology, concluding with an outline of the book and a thorough bibliography. The commentary proper is based on Hubbard's own fresh translation and accented by copious footnotes on textual, philological, and literary matters. Gleaning the best from recent research on Ruth, Hubbard gives the story's rich literary, grammatical, and theological dimensions a careful, rigorous treatment. He allows for the possibility that the anonymous author was a woman and argues that the narrative itself aims to counter opposition to the Davidic monarchy in Israel and Judah during Solomon's reign. Throughout, Hubbard's sensitivity to the literary genius of Ruth's author and his coherent explication of the outworking of the book's theological themes make this volume an invaluable tool for anyone desiring to explore the intriguing story of Ruth in depth.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iWRyCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Reflections on community development education","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YT62twEACAAJ&dq=Reflections+on+community+development+education&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Literacy Primer","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yL9bAAAACAAJ&dq=Literacy+Primer&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Real Messiah?

Was not hostility part of the interaction between the two groups? On the contrary, Hans A. Schmitt's compelling story describes American, British, and German Quakers' attempts to mitigate the suffering among not only victims of Nazism but Nazi sympathizers in Austria and Lithuania as well. With numerous poignant illustrations of the pressure and social cost involved in being a Quaker from 1933 to 1945, Quakers and Nazis: Inner Light in Outer Darkness reveals a facet of Nazi Germany that is entirely unknown to most people. The book focuses on the heroic acts foreign and German Quakers performed under the Nazi regime, offering fully documented and original information regarding the Quakers' commitment to nonviolence and the relief of the victims. Schmitt's narrative reveals the stress and tension of the situation. How should a Quaker behave in a meeting for worship with a policeman present? Spies did not stop Friends in worship services from openly criticizing Hitler and G?ring, but Nazis did inflict torment on Friends. Yet Friends did not, could not, respond in like manner. Olga Halle was one Friend who worked to get people, mostly Jews, out of Germany until America entered the war. When emigration was outlawed, twenty-eight were stranded. Years later her distress was still so deep that even on her deathbed she recited their names. Schmitt reminds us that virtually all the Berlin Quakers secreted Jews throughout the war. He shows how these brave Quakers opposed the Nazis even after they lost their jobs and had been harassed by the Gestapo. Risking their lives, the Friends persisted in their efforts to alleviate suffering. At a time when the scholarly world is divided as to whether all Germans knew and approved of the Final Solution, this book makes a valuable contribution to the discussion. Quakers--despite their small numbers--played, and continue to play, an important role in twentieth-century humanitarian relief. Quakers and Nazis: Inner Light in Outer Darkness, a study of how Friends performed under the extreme pressure of a totalitarian regime, will add significantly to our general understanding of Quaker and German history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nQpoAAAAMAAJ&dq=Quakers+and+Nazis:+Inner+Light+in+Outer+Darkness&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Case Of The Stolen Dummy - Brains Benton Mystery","description":"Five thousand dollars, collected in the community to build a summer camp for youngsters, have disappeared.

Both science and faith, the author suggests, compel us now to move beyond materialism toward an understanding of the world that includes the realities of consciousness and spirit. In the twenty-first century, human beings have less reason than before to feel they hold a privileged or special position in the cosmos, but more cause than ever to feel connected and akin to all that is.

After The Bachelorette broke his heart, Sean Lowe suspected his  nice guy  image hurt him. The show never emphasized it, but Sean committed to living according to biblical standards of sexuality, even as producers emphasized the risqu  and promiscuous. A Texas boy from a Baptist home, Sean tells the story of how he went from a Division I college football player to a fan favorite on reality television, taking readers behind the scenes of The Bachelor and The Bachelorette to see the challenges of living out his values and faith and ultimately winning his true love s heart. For the Right Reasons is about the journeys we all have to take in the real world, where being  good  is the right thing to do but sometimes doesn t seem to be enough; where betrayal is commonplace; and where that thing called perfection is actually just a cruel myth. Sean learned a few things from his two seasons on the hottest romance shows on television, and he wants others to benefit from those lessons: good does eventually win, lies will be discovered, and  nice guys  do ultimately finish first.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1k7dAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In Search of Wales","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Y1YHkAEACAAJ&dq=In+Search+of+Wales&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Claddagh Mission","description":"It is 1942 and Army Lt.

In a briefing before heading overseas, Tommy is warned to keep his eyes open for two potential adversaries: The Irish Blueshirts, a Fascist organization, and the Danann Brotherhood and Auxiliary. The DB&A is believed to the political wing of the Faerie World. Tommy travels to Galway, on Ireland's west coast, where he experiences an extraordinary series of adventures in which he combats Nazi spies, is pursued by a Faerie Princess, meets a priest who practices Druidism on the side, and attends a gigantic Faerie rally at Blarney Castle. The story reaches its climax atop legendary Dun Aengus, an early Celtic fortress guarding Galway Bay. Can Tommy prevent a German invasion that could knock Britain out of the war?

It is an altogether na?ve and fanciful account of human progress. Innovations emerge from a much less mysterious combination of historical, circumstantial, and accidental influences. This book explores the origin and evolution of several important behavioral innovations including the high five, the Heimlich maneuver, the butterfly stroke, the moonwalk, and the Iowa caucus. Such creations' striking suitability to the situation and the moment appear ingeniously designed with foresight. However, more often than not, they actually arise 'as if by design.' Based on investigations into the histories of a wide range of innovations, Edward A. Wasserman reveals the nature of behavioral creativity. What surfaces is a fascinating web of causation involving three main factors: context, consequence, and coincidence. Focusing on the process rather than the product of innovation elevates behavior to the very center of the creative human endeavor.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wQg3EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Managing Software Requirements: A Unified Approach (The Addison-Wesley Object Technology Series)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Wellington: The years of the sword","description":"Wellington is one of the best known commanders of British History.

Minnesota Archive Editions uses digital technology to make long-unavailable books once again accessible, and are published unaltered from the original University of Minnesota Press editions. Leaving their depleted fields for better prospects, Senegalese immigrants have made their way to Italy in significant numbers. What this migration means, in the context of both the migratory traditions and conditions of Africa and the history and future of the European nation-state, is the subject of this timely and ambitious book. Focusing on Turin, the northern Italian point of entry for so many Senegalese, States of Grace chronicles the arrival and formation of a transnational African Islamic community in a largely Catholic Western European country, one that did not have immigrant legislation until 1991. With no colonial relation to Italy, the Senegalese represent the vanguard of population movements expanding outside of the arch of former colonial powers. Donald Martin Carter locates the Senegalese migration in the context of past African internal and international migration and of present crises in West African agriculture. He also shows how the Senegalese migration, constituting a \\"phenomenon\\" and catalyzing new immigration restrictions among European states, calls into question the European interstate system, the future of the nation-state, and the nature of its relationship with non-European states. Throughout Europe, protectionist immigration policies are often crafted in chauvinist and racist tones in which \\"migrants\\" is a euphemism for blacks, Arabs, and Asians. States of Grace uses Senegalese migration to demonstrate that racial conceptions are crucial to understanding the classifications of non-national \\"outside\\" and internal \\"other.\\" The book is a bracing encounter with the ever-increasing cultural and ethnic heterogeneity that is the new and pressing reality of European society. Donald Martin Carter is visiting assistant professor of anthropology at Johns Hopkins University.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=x_zzu6-PipoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Punxsutawney Phyllis","description":"Although she can predict the weather much better than the boys in her family, no one thinks that Phyllis the groundhog has a chance of replacing the aging Punxsutawney Phil when Groundhog Day's official groundhog retires.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6F8rAQAAMAAJ&dq=Punxsutawney+Phyllis&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Irish Conversation (3CDs + Guide) (TY: Conversation)","description":"Colloquial Vietnamese: The Complete Course for Beginners has been carefully developed by an experienced teacher to provide a step-by-step course to Vietnamese as it is written and spoken today.

The Soviet Union's demise and Russia's ensuing troubles have led many to wonder. But this is to look through a skewed prism indeed. In this provocative and elegantly written short history of Russia, Marshall Poe takes us well beyond the Soviet haze deep into the nation's fascinating--not at all inevitable, and in key respects remarkably successful--past. Tracing Russia's course from its beginnings to the present day, Poe shows that Russia was the only non-Western power to defend itself against Western imperialism for centuries. It did so by building a powerful state that molded society to its military needs. Thus arose the only non-Western path to modern society--a unique path neither \\"European\\" nor \\"Asian\\" but, most aptly, \\"Russian.\\" From the fifteenth to the eighteenth centuries, Russia prevailed despite unparalleled onslaughts by powerful Western armies. However, while Europe nurtured limited government, capitalism, and scientific and cultural revolution, early Russian society cultivated autocracy and command economics. Both Europe and Russia eventually created modern infrastructures, but the European model proved more productive and powerful. The post-World War I communist era can be seen as a natural continuation of Russia's autocratic past that, despite its tragic turns, kept Russia globally competitive for decades. The Russian moment in world history thus began with its first confrontations with Europe in the fifteenth century, and ended in 1991 with the Soviet collapse. Written with verve and great insight, The Russian Moment in World History will be widely read and vigorously debated by those who seek a clear and unequivocal understanding of the complex history that has made Russia what it is today.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RTvBklD5ehsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"World in Their Web (Imperialism series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=B2S2AAAAIAAJ&dq=World+in+Their+Web+(Imperialism+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sappho Is Burning","description":"To know all we know about Sappho is to know little. Her poetry, dating from the seventh century B.C.E., comes to us in fragments, her biography as speculation. How is it then, Page duBois asks, that this poet has come to signify so much? Sappho Is Burning offers a new reading of this archaic lesbian poet that acknowledges the poet's distance and difference from us and stresses Sappho's inassimilability into our narratives about the Greeks, literary history, philosophy, the history of sexuality, the psychoanalytic subject. In Sappho is Burning, duBois reads Sappho as a disruptive figure at the very origin of our story of Western civilization. Sappho is beyond contemporary categories, inhabiting a space outside of reductively linear accounts of our common history. She is a woman, but also an aristocrat, a Greek, but one turned toward Asia, a poet who writes as a philosopher before philosophy, a writer who speaks of sexuality that can be identified neither with Michel Foucault's account of Greek sexuality, nor with many versions of contemporary lesbian sexuality. She is named as the tenth muse, yet the nine books of her poetry survive only in fragments. She disorients, troubles, undoes many certitudes in the history of poetry, the history of philosophy, the history of sexuality. DuBois argues that we need to read Sappho again.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zXYzNWfwiCsC&dq=Sappho+Is+Burning&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Liber Amoris: Or, the New Pygmalion (Lives & Letters)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PJKiswEACAAJ&dq=Liber+Amoris:+Or,+the+New+Pygmalion+(Lives&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Competitive limit pricing under imperfect information (Discussion paper)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Carl Erskine's Tales from the Dodgers Dugout","description":"To baseball fans of today, the name  Dodgers  is synonymous with Hollywood, the warm California sun, and names like Tommy Lasorda, Kirk Gibson, Steve Garvey, and Orel Hershiser. The Dodgers mean much more than that to fans of baseball history, however. Namely, these fans remember the famed  Boys of Summer,  otherwise known as the Brooklyn Dodgers, a team that included some of the most storied players in baseball history, such as Hall of Famers Duke Snider, Roy Campanella, Gil Hodges, Pee Wee Reese, and Jackie Robinson. Although they eventually moved out west, the Brooklyn Dodgers provided some of the greatest moments the game has ever seen and some of the greatest personalities to ever take the field. Carl Erskine, another member of that legendary team, relates memories about his days with the Dodgers in a book full of true stories and revealing anecdotes. The result is Tales from the Dodgers Dugout, first published in 2004 and newly updated to provide a delightfully interesting trip through the world of baseball in the 1950s. Among Erskine s many tales are his dealings with immortal team official Branch Rickey, his view from the Dodgers bench during Don Larsen s perfect game in the 1956 World Series, and his firsthand experiences when Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier and became the first black player in Major League Baseball history. During his frequent speaking engagements, people often ask Erskine if all of his stories are true. His standard response has been,  Yes, I couldn t possibly make them up the way they actually happened.  Now fans can read all of those great stories in Tales from the Dodgers Dugout.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rzGCDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Honeymoon, Keepsake Journal","description":"You'll only ever have one first trip as a married couple.

Yet this fascinating exploration of how scientific work proceeds argues that however sudden the moment of discovery may seem, the discovery process can be described and modeled. Using the methods and concepts of contemporary information-processing psychology (or cognitive science) the authors develop a series of artificial-intelligence programs that can simulate the human thought processes used to discover scientific laws. The programs--BACON, DALTON, GLAUBER, and STAHL--are all largely data-driven, that is, when presented with series of chemical or physical measurements they search for uniformities and linking elements, generating and checking hypotheses and creating new concepts as they go along. Scientific Discovery examines the nature of scientific research and reviews the arguments for and against a normative theory of discovery; describes the evolution of the BACON programs, which discover quantitative empirical laws and invent new concepts; presents programs that discover laws in qualitative and quantitative data; and ties the results together, suggesting how a combined and extended program might find research problems, invent new instruments, and invent appropriate problem representations. Numerous prominent historical examples of discoveries from physics and chemistry are used as tests for the programs and anchor the discussion concretely in the history of science.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VPxc-uPB7LEC&dq=Scientific+Discovery:+Computational+Explorations+of+the+Creative+Processes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Master the GMAT CAT 2004 (Book & CD-Rom)","description":"Provides materials and advice for students preparing to take the Graduate Management Admission Test, including a diagnostic test, suggestions for each section of the test, five practice tests, and a math review.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iNu8h7RVUgIC&dq=Master+the+GMAT+CAT+2004+(Book&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Powwow: Directory of Native American Gatherings in the USA and Canada (Powwow Calendar: Guide to Native American Gatherings in the U.S.A. & Canada)","description":"For more than 20 eyars the Powwow Calendar has featured public events that showcase the beauty and heart of American Indian culture.

It provides step-by-step instructions for each phase of the writing process, from formulating a thesis, to creating an outline, to writing a final draft, supplementing this tutorial approach with model essays, outlines, introductions, and conclusions. Skills essential to evaluating arguments, citing sources, avoiding plagiarism, detecting fallacies, and formatting final drafts are dealt with in detail. The final two chapters serve as a reference guide to common mistakes and basic skills in sentence construction, writing style, and word choice. Employing a rulebook format similar to that of the classic Elements of Style (by Strunk, White, and Angell), Lewis Vaughn distills helpful writing advice into simple rules that students can easily remember and apply--and that instructors can refer to when reviewing student papers.

M. Forster's A Passage to India, and Evelyn Waugh's A Handful of Dust explore the relationship between Britain and its colonies when the British Empire was at its height. David Adams observes that, because of their structure and specific literary allusions, they also demand to be read in relation to the epic tradition. The elegantly written and powerfully argued Colonial Odysseys focuses on narratives published in English between 1890 and 1940 in which protagonists journey from the familiar world of Europe to alien colonial worlds. The underlying concerns of these narratives, Adams discovers, are often less political or literary than metaphysical: in each of these fictions a major character dies as a result of the journey, inviting reflection on the negation of existence. Repeatedly, imaginative encounters with distant, uncanny colonies produce familiar, insular presentations of life as an odyssey, with death as the home port. Expanding postcolonial and Marxist theories by drawing on the philosophy of Hans Blumenberg, Adams finds in this preoccupation with mortality a symptom of the failure of secular culture to give meaning to death. This concern, in his view, shapes the ways modernist narratives reinforce or critique imperial culture the authors project onto British imperial experience their anxieties about the individual's relation to the absolute.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AJRlDwAAQBAJ&dq=Colonial+Odysseys:+Empire+and+Epic+in+the+Modernist+Novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Miracles of Your Mind","description":"Whether you wish to overcome a bad habit, become successful have harmonious relationships or achieve your long cherished goal, your subconscious mind can guide you to accomplish that.

Introduction by Dean Koontz Welcome to Florida s Golden Sands, the dream condominium complex built on a weak foundation and a thousand dirty secrets. The real estate was a steal literally. The maintenance charges run high as the locals are run out. It s the home of shortcuts, crackdowns, breakups, oversights, and payoffs. Add it all up, and the new coastline community doesn t stand a chance against the ever-present specter of disaster: the dreaded hurricane. The big one is coming. Golden Sands is right in its path. And only a few brave souls have the power to stop this towering eyesore from going underwater for good. Praise for John D. MacDonald and Condominium  Most readers loved John D. MacDonald s work because he told a rip-roaring yarn. I loved it because he was the first modern writer to nail Florida dead-center, to capture all its languid sleaze, racy sense of promise, and breath-grabbing beauty.

Mansilla (18311913), the widely traveled and cultured scion of a famous family, was a colonel in the Argentine army when he undertook an  excursion  to the Argentine interior in 1870 to visit natives in areas then largely unknown. Mansilla s uncle, dictator Juan Manuel de Rosas, dominated most of Argentina from 1829 to 1852 and had led successful military expeditions against the frontier Indians in 1852. Mansilla set out for a reconnaissance into the tense border region just after a peace treaty had been signed with the Indians. Over the course of this expedition, Mansilla sent to a friend in the capital a series of letters which were then serially published in a leading Buenos Aires newspaper. His careful observations offer valuable ethnographic data, as Argentina s Indians were almost totally extinguished or assimilated within a few generations of Mansilla s expedition. Furthermore, his account, which contains thoughtful perspectives on the  Indian question  and the dichotomy of civilization and barbarism, stands as a lasting contribution to Argentine and Spanish-American literature. Mansilla s work both in this account and elsewhere made him a leading figure in the Argentina  Generation of 1880,  a group crucial in the development of Argentine literary and intellectual life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=01N-QCn_Z_oC&dq=A+Visit+to+the+Ranquel+Indians&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Apple Kitchen Cook Book","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Silver Citadel (Pentagram)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EMZlJQAACAAJ&dq=The+Silver+Citadel+(Pentagram)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Green Book","description":"The idea of \\"The Green Book\\" is to give the Motorist and Tourist a Guide not only of the Hotels and Tourist Homes in all of the large cities, but other classifications that will be found useful wherever he may be.

Since each of us is part of the same one consciousness, this is a holographic \\"journey\\" that unifies us all. The card system uses the holographic concept that we are experiencing both unity and separation simultaneously. The components of the cards explore this journey in a variety of ways, including: SPECIES or STAR SYSTEM: Twenty-one different species or star systems are represented in the four suits (or time streams) of cards to symbolize the main archetypal groups who have influenced the development of our galactic family. THEME: Each card has a theme or lesson that is connected to the civilization it depicts. Contemplative text and deeper commentary are presented for each card to help users understand how to apply this wisdom in their current lives. ARTWORK: The architect of these cards, the multidimensional consciousness Germane channeled through Lyssa, also assisted Hong Kong artist David Cow in the channeling of the images. Contemplating the artwork allows more information and energy to be transmitted that goes beyond the text for each card. The art works deeply with the subconscious and adds a powerful dimension to the user's inner work with the cards. In addition to the individual card art, an underlying image spans all the cards when they're laid out on a grid with 18 cards per row. This image represents our journey back to integration, and thus each card carries an embedded energy of unity even within the uniqueness and \\"separate journey\\" of each card. When the final card was channeled, the total number was 108 -- a sacred number in many traditions that reflects the idea of wholeness and completion. GETTING STARTED: In the accompanying booklet we offer more information, the text and commentary for each card, and several recommended spreads to help you get started.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yfwCAQAAQBAJ&dq=Heritage&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Meddling Kids","description":"\\"The summer of 1977.

Then What","description":" A must-read a gorgeous literary novel that asks us to imagine all the possible versions of ourselves that might exist.  J. Courtney Sullivan, New York Times bestselling author of Saints for All Occasions The residents of a sleepy mountain town are rocked by troubling visions of an alternate reality in this dazzling debut that combines the family-driven suspense of Celeste Ng s Little Fires Everywhere with the inventive storytelling of The Immortalists. In the quiet haven of Clearing, Oregon, four neighbors find their lives upended when they begin to see themselves in parallel realities. Ginny, a devoted surgeon whose work often takes precedence over her family, has a baffling vision of a beautiful co-worker in Ginny s own bed and begins to doubt the solidity of her marriage. Ginny s husband, Mark, a wildlife scientist, sees a vision that suggests impending devastation and grows increasingly paranoid, threatening the safety of his wife and son. Samara, a young woman desperately mourning the recent death of her mother and questioning why her father seems to be coping with such ease, witnesses an apparition of her mother healthy and vibrant and wonders about the secrets her parents may have kept from her. Cass, a brilliant scholar struggling with the demands of new motherhood, catches a glimpse of herself pregnant again, just as she s on the brink of returning to the project that could define her career. At first the visions are relatively benign, but they grow increasingly disturbing and, in some cases, frightening. When a natural disaster threatens Clearing, it becomes obvious that the visions were not what they first seemed and that the town will never be the same. Startling, deeply imagined, and compulsively readable, Kate Hope Day s debut novel is about the choices we make that shape our lives and determine our destinies the moments that alter us so profoundly that it feels as if we've entered another reality. Praise for If, Then  Hope Day has a lot of sly, stealthy fun with time-bending and parallel universes, but she also has serious things to say on urban paranoia, climate change and the atomized nature of modern life.  Daily Mail  If, Then has the narrative propulsion of a television show . . . [It s] a whirlwind of a story.

Quentin Tarantino (Pulp Fiction), Kevin Smith (Dogma), David Fincher (Fight Club), M. Night Shyamalan (The Sixth Sense), Ben Stiller (Reality Bites), Michael Bay (Pearl Harbor), and dozens of others are all members of Generation X, the much talked about but much misunderstood successors to baby boomers. This book is a critical study of the films directed by Gen Xers and how those directors have been influenced by their generational identity. While Generation X as a whole sometimes seems to lack direction, its filmmakers have devoted their careers to making powerful statements about contemporary society and their generation s role in it. Each section of the book deals with an aspect of Gen X filmmaking, including the influence of popular culture, postmodern narrative devices,  slackerdom  and the lack of direction, disenfranchisement and nihilism, the ever-evolving role of technology, gender issues and sexuality, the question of race, the influence of older filmmakers, and visions of the future.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mYWCRWWso_cC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dough Boy","description":"In the companion to her acclaimed So Done, Paula Chase follows best friends Simp and Rollie as their friendship is threatened by the pressures of basketball, upcoming auditions, middle school, and their growing involvement in the local drug ring.

It depicts the fall and rise of the Primrose family, presided over by the benevolent vicar, the narrator of a fairy-tale plot of impersonation and deception, the abduction of a beautiful heroine and the machinations of an aristocratic villain. By turns comic and sentimental, the novel's popularity owes much to its recognizable depiction of domestic life and loving family relationships. New to this edition is an introduction by Robert L. Mack that examines the reasons for the novels enduring popularity, as well as the critical debates over whether it is a straightforward novel of sentiment or a satire on the social and economic inequalities of the period and the very literary conventions and morality it seems to embody. This edition also includes a new, up-to-date bibliography and expanded notes, and contains reprints of Arthur Friedman's authoritative Oxford English Novels text of the corrected first edition of 1766. About the Series: For over 100 years Oxford World's Classics has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

Martin argues that the mainstream news media (and the large corporations behind them) put the labor movement in a bad light even while avoiding the appearance of bias. Martin has found that the news media construct \\"common ground\\" narratives between labor and management positions by reporting on labor relations from a consumer perspective. Martin identifies five central storytelling frames using this consumer orientation that repeatedly emerged in the news media coverage of major labor stories in the 1990s: the 1991-94 shutdown of the General Motors Willow Run Assembly Plant in Ypsilanti, Michigan; the 1993 American Airlines flight attendant strike; the 1994-95 Major League Baseball strike, the 1997 United Parcel Service strike, and the 1999 protests against the World Trade Organization's conference in Seattle. In Martin's view, the news media's consumer \\"take\\" on the labor movement has the effect of submerging issues of citizenship, political activity, and class relations, and elevating issues of consumption and the myth of a class-free America. Instead of facilitating a public sphere, the democratic ideal in which the public can engage in discovery and rational-critical debate, Martin says, news organizations have fostered a consumer sphere, in which public discourse and action is defined in terms of consumer interests--the impact of strikes, lock-outs, shut-downs, and protests on the general consumer economy and the price, quality, and availability of things such as automobiles, airline flights, and baseball tickets.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Y69JiE7V-MIC&dq=Framed!:+Labor+and+the+Corporate+Media+(Ilr+Press+Book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Build Real Hot Rods (Hot Rod How to)","description":"Low-cost how-to's for home builders.

She had never held elective office. She had not even been to many city council meetings before she declared her candidacy. The product of a conservative business family, the sorority scene at the University of California, Berkeley, and the somewhat genteel world of Junior Aid and the United Way, Darrah, a committed Democrat, soon discovered she would have to master the confrontational ways of politicians and learn to maneuver among the competing pressure groups that throw their weight around in city governments if she were to function as an effective mayor. The learning curve was not without bumps. Early on a newspaper headline labeled her a racist, city council politics provoked the city manager's resignation, and frightening homophobic rhetoric filled the council's chambers after Darrah voiced support of a Stockton gay pride march. Darrah eventually discovered that \\"one of the hardest tasks of practical politics is that of choosing those issues on which principle needs to yield to expediency if the politician is to remain viable and live to fight another day.\\" In the end, Darrah's two terms as Stockton's mayor spanned a pivotal period in the city's history. A period in which the city began to change from a scandal-racked, crime-ridden municipality with a rotting downtown core to one where city leadership is respected, the streets safer, and the downtown area has been launched on a journey of revitalization.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Nk8KAAAACAAJ&dq=Getting+Political:+Stories+of+a+Woman+Mayor&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sex and the Supremacy of Christ","description":"The Bible has a way of shocking us.

So we can't just celebrate sex for what God made it to be; we have to fight what sin turned it into. The contributors to this unique volume encourage you to do both: celebrate and struggle.

Renowned for their architecture, agriculture, jewellry and textiles, the Aztecs also developed a form of pictographic writing and a complex calendar system. However, they are chiefly, if unfortunately, remembered for their human sacrifices; tearing the heart from the living body to offer to their Sun god. This introduction to one of the world's most fascinating lost civilizations examines its history and culture, and concludes with an account of its violent destruction by the Spaniards in 1521.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NMYRAQAAIAAJ&dq=Early+Man+(Sutton+Pocket+Histories)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bishop's Reckoning","description":"Neil Bishop is in trouble  A chance meeting with his old rival spurs a twelve hour tailspin of memory and conflict.

Over the course of one night, his struggle to bring life into focus comes full circle. Before he can face the impending confrontation with his nemesis, however, Neil must first brave forced maturity, romantic ineptitude, parking lot hoods and a strangely philosophical tough guy. Most importantly, he is compelled to attempt reconciliation with the only woman he ever loved the woman that left him as suddenly as she appeared. Bishop s Reckoning is a roller coaster ride of frenetic humor, stark sadness, and insightful looks into the reality of life, love and loss. A modern day parable of redemption, Neil s journey illustrates the continuance of life and the struggle to understand its permutations.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qTroSHjg--IC&dq=Bishop%27s+Reckoning&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Finding Consciousness in the Brain: A neurocognitive approach (Advances in Consciousness Research)","description":"How does the brain go about the business of being conscious?

Thiselton delves deeply into the context and text of Paul's first Corinthian letter as he suggests, section by section, how the book applies to pastoral and practical issues. He draws vivid parallels between the growing church in Corinth and the twenty-first-century church, demonstrating that today's church also faces a seductive culture of competition and consumerism. The church in Corinth preferred its self-centered theology to the Christ-centered gospel of the wider apostolic church. Paul's response in 1 Corinthians, amplified by Thiselton's commentary, becomes a living, practical, transforming word from God for Christians today.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CRbb9_QLVh8C&dq=1+Corinthians:+A+Shorter+Exegetical+and+Pastoral+Commentary&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Little Lord Fauntleroy (Signet Classics)","description":"Cedric, a poor American boy, is summoned to England when he becomes the heir to the Earl of Dorincourt, his ill-tempered grandfather","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=G2E-PgAACAAJ&dq=Little+Lord+Fauntleroy+(Signet+Classics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Law 101: Everything You Need to Know about the American Legal System","description":"\\"[A] fully updated survey of American law that incorporates fresh materials on recent Supreme Court cases, the latest developments in Internet law, and sensational criminal trials\\"--Flap page 1 of dust jacket.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7WfrAwAAQBAJ&dq=Law+101:+Everything+You+Need+to+Know+about+the+American+Legal+System&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lorna Doone (Abridged)","description":"First published in 1869, Lorna Doone is the story of John Ridd, a farmer who finds love amid the religious and social turmoil of seventeenth-century England.

More than anything else, he argues, it is the neglect of consciousness that results in so much barrenness and sterility in psychology, the philosophy of mind, and cognitive science: there can be no study of mind that leaves out consciousness. What is going on in the brain is neurophysiological processes and consciousness and nothing more no rule following, no mental information processing or mental models, no language of thought, and no universal grammar. Mental events are themselves features of the brain, \\"like liquidity is a feature of water.\\" Beginning with a spirited discussion of what's wrong with the philosophy of mind, Searle characterizes and refutes the philosophical tradition of materialism. But he does not embrace dualism. All these \\"isms\\" are mistaken, he insists. Once you start counting types of substance you are on the wrong track, whether you stop at one or two. In four chapters that constitute the heart of his argument, Searle elaborates a theory of consciousness and its relation to our overall scientific world view and to unconscious mental phenomena. He concludes with a criticism of cognitive science and a proposal for an approach to studying the mind that emphasizes the centrality of consciousness to any account of mental functioning. In his characteristically direct style, punctuated with persuasive examples, Searle identifies the very terminology of the field as the main source of truth. He observes that it is a mistake to suppose that the ontology of the mental is objective and to suppose that the methodology of a science of the mind must concern itself only with objectively observable behavior; that it is also a mistake to suppose that we know of the existence of mental phenomena in others only by observing their behavior; that behavior or causal relations to behavior are not essential to the existence of mental phenomena; and that it is inconsistent with what we know about the universe and our place in it to suppose that everything is knowable by us.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0L5NEAAAQBAJ&dq=THE+REDISCOVERY+OF+THE+MIND&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Multihull Cruising Fundamentals: The Official American Sailing Association Guide to Cruising Multihulls","description":"The official learn-to-sail manual of the American Sailing Association and the United States Coast Guard Auxiliary, with over 150 line drawings and photographs.

Comics Reprint, No .4)","description":"When many think of comic books the first thing that comes to mind are caped crusaders and spandex-wearing super-heroes. Perhaps, inevitably, these images are of white men (and more rarely, women). It was not until the 1970s that African American superheroes such as Luke Cage, Blade, and others emerged. But as this exciting new collection reveals, these superhero comics are only one small component in a wealth of representations of black characters within comic strips, comic books, and graphic novels over the past century. The Blacker the Ink is the first book to explore not only the diverse range of black characters in comics, but also the multitude of ways that black artists, writers, and publishers have made a mark on the industry. Organized thematically into  panels  in tribute to sequential art published in the funny pages of newspapers, the fifteen original essays take us on a journey that reaches from the African American newspaper comics of the 1930s to the Francophone graphic novels of the 2000s. Even as it demonstrates the wide spectrum of images of African Americans in comics and sequential art, the collection also identifies common character types and themes running through everything from the strip The Boondocks to the graphic novel Nat Turner. Though it does not shy away from examining the legacy of racial stereotypes in comics and racial biases in the industry, The Blacker the Ink also offers inspiring stories of trailblazing African American artists and writers. Whether you are a diehard comic book fan or a casual reader of the funny pages, these essays will give you a new appreciation for how black characters and creators have brought a vibrant splash of color to the world of comics.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Ik4DCgAAQBAJ&dq=The+Haunt+of+Fear+(E.C.+Comics+Reprint,+No+.4)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"SCHEDULING ALGORITHMS","description":"Besides scheduling problems for single and parallel machines and shop scheduling problems, the book covers advanced models involving due-dates, sequence dependent change-over times and batching.

Today we find ourselves in the midst of the greatest crisis in the history of the human race. Technology has placed in our hands almost unlimited power at the very moment when we have run up against the limits of our resources aboard Spaceship Earth, as the crises of the late twentieth century political, economic, environmental, and ethical determine whether or not humanity survives. In this masterful summing up of an entire lifetime s thought and concern, R. Buckminster Fuller addresses these crucial issues in his most significant, accessible, and urgent work. Critical Path traces the origins and evolution of humanity s social, political, and economic systems from the obscure mists of prehistory, through the development of the great political empires, to the vast international corporate and political systems that control our destiny today to show how we got to our present situation and what options are available to man. With his customary brilliance, extraordinary energy, and unlimited devotion, Bucky Fuller shows how mankind can survive, and how each individual can respond to the unprecedented threat we face today. The crowning achievement of an extraordinary career, Critical Path offers the reader the excitement of understanding the essential dilemmas of our time and how responsible citizens can rise to meet this ultimate challenge to our future.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mkvoDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"America Offline: PSI Order Orgotek & FSA Sourcebook) (A Sourcebook for Trinity)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Intro Wagners Der Ring 2Nd Revised","description":"Today, more than a century after its first performance, Richard Wagner's The Ring of Nibelung endures as one of the most significant artistic creations in the history of opera. This monumental work not only altered previously accepted concepts of music and drama but also inspired creative and intellectual efforts far beyond the field of opera. Previous studies of the Ring have appealed only to those already acquainted in some way with the Wagnerian art. For the uninitiated, Wagner and his landmark creation have seemed forbidding, and those eager to learn about the masterpiece have faced a vast and frequently esoteric body of commentary. Professor Cord addresses the interests of the non-specialist by taking the reader first into Wagner's unique intent, and then through the complete history of the Ring. Cord, who has attended forty performances of the Ring, considers the conception of the poem, its development into a music-drama exemplifying Wagnerian thought, its introduction to the world, and the reactions and interpretation it elicits.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=F2MIAQAAMAAJ&dq=Intro+Wagners+Der+Ring+2Nd+Revised&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Spiritual Bathing: Healing Rituals and Traditions from Around the World","description":"Bestselling authors Arvigo and Epstein explore the lost art of spiritual bathing and its fascinating history, with information on where sacred baths are currently offered and easy recipes to create bathing rituals in the home.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZxTgwAEACAAJ&dq=Spiritual+Bathing:+Healing+Rituals+and+Traditions+from+Around+the+World&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Let It Be Me","description":"The one woman he wants is the one he cannot have.

He falls hard, only to make a devastating discovery--Leah is the woman his best friend set his heart on months before. Leah's a math prodigy who's only ever had one big dream--to earn her PhD. Raising her little brother put that dream on hold. Now that her brother will soon be college bound, she's not going to let anything stand in her way. Especially romance . . . which is far less dependable than algebra. When Leah receives surprising results from the DNA test she submitted to a genealogy site, she solicits Sebastian's help.

The more powerfully they're drawn to each other, the more strongly Sebastian must resist, and the more Leah must admit that some things in life--like love--can't be explained with numbers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YJcHEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Alarm Starboard!","description":"The author's naval war experiences make the most exciting reading.

Now in Fashionable Nonsense: Postmodern Intellectuals' Abuse of Science, Sokal and his fellow physicist Jean Bricmont expand from where the hoax left off. In a delightfully witty and clear voice, the two thoughtfully and thoroughly dismantle the pseudo-scientific writings of some of the most fashionable French and American intellectuals. More generally, they challenge the widespread notion that scientific theories are mere \\"narrations\\" or social constructions.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=x6spAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sentence Composing for College: A Worktext on Sentence Variety and Maturity","description":"Unlike traditional grammar books that emphasize sentence analysis, this worktext asks students to imitate the sentence styles of professional writers, making the sentence composing process enjoyable and challenging.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9oJYNQAACAAJ&dq=Sentence+Composing+for+College:+A+Worktext+on+Sentence+Variety+and+Maturity&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Can You Drink the Cup?","description":"Explores the deep spiritual impact of the question Jesus asks his friends James and John.

A. Romanov's vigorous defense of the people and institutions that built the ill-fated Soviet nuclear attack submarine Komsomolets which caught fire and sank in the Norwegian Sea on April 7, 1989, while on its first patrol. Afterward, the Soviet Navy claimed that numerous technical imperfections had caused the accident. In addition, official investigators portrayed the crew as self-sacrificing and well trained, upheld the commanding officer's actions, and found no fault in behavior among the dead or surviving crew members. Buoyed by Mikhail Gorbachev's glasnost, dissident voices challenged the official view. The resulting controversy ruined careers, damaged personal and professional relationships, and divided the Navy itself. Romanov refutes the Soviet Navy's claim that from the very beginning it had done everything to ensure that Komsomolets was well prepared for independent patrolling, that it had trained the crew well, and that the submarine's personnel had performed capably during the accident. Observers familiar with the issues and the acrimony that surround the loss of the Russian submarine Kursk in August 2000 will find startling antecedents in the Komsomolets incident. Readers interested in submarine operations and technology, Cold War navies, Russia, and the dark side of personal and bureaucratic behavior will be thoroughly satisfied by this comprehensive study of what really happened and the ensuing cover-up.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6Y11joX5XnoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"INSIDE MS","description":"Chronicles twenty-five years of \\"Ms.\\" magazine and its impact on women's publishing and the recent history of feminism in America and addresses such issues as battered women and the struggle for reproductive rights","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PMFFGwAACAAJ&dq=INSIDE+MS&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pitching Hollywood: How to Sell Your TV and Movie Ideas","description":"Two successful movie and TV producers provide the reader with the tools needed to create, develop, and sell ideas to Hollywood.

Neither an apology nor a condemnation, it presents instead a meticulous exploration into the mind and vision of a man who galvanized a generation and challenged an entire literary and world establishment. Although he enjoyed little fame in his lifetime, Pound s notoriety and influence were enormous, as he arrogantly slashed away at convention and almost single-handedly brought about the twentieth-century revolution in poetry known as modernism. Ultimately, outrage and scandal turned his art to madness, and Pound s last years saw him fall tragically silent.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=e4klvcXunfwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Films of Robert Taylor","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aQQvAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Films+of+Robert+Taylor&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Spinoza Reader: The Ethics and Other Works","description":"This anthology of the work of Baruch de Spinoza (1632-1677) presents the text of Spinoza's masterwork, the Ethics, in what is now the standard translation by Edwin Curley. Also included are selections from other works by Spinoza, chosen by Curley to make the Ethics easier to understand, and a substantial introduction that gives an overview of Spinoza's life and the main themes of his philosophy. Perfect for course use, the Spinoza Reader is a practical tool with which to approach one of the world's greatest but most difficult thinkers, a passionate seeker of the truth who has been viewed by some as an atheist and by others as a religious mystic. The anthology begins with the opening section of the Treatise on the Emendation of the Intellect, which has always moved readers by its description of the young Spinoza's spiritual quest, his dissatisfaction with the things people ordinarily strive for--wealth, honor, and sensual pleasure--and his hope that the pursuit of knowledge would lead him to discover the true good. The emphasis throughout these selections is on metaphysical, epistemological, and religious issues: the existence and nature of God, his relation to the world, the nature of the human mind and its relation to the body, and the theory of demonstration, axioms, and definitions. For each of these topics, the editor supplements the rigorous discussions in the Ethics with informal treatments from Spinoza's other works.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Yf3RDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{visibleCount:6,booksData:L,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visibleBooks(){return this.booksData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMoreBooks(){return this.visibleCount<this.booksData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},I=["disabled"],E={key:0},P={key:1};function q(s,i,t,u,r,a){const g=m("PoemCard");return e(),o("section",null,[i[1]||(i[1]=n("div",{class:"top-banner"},[n("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[n("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your Books 📚")])],-1)),n("div",M,[(e(!0),o(f,null,b(a.visibleBooks,(l,p)=>(e(),y(g,{key:p,poem:l},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMoreBooks?(e(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:i[0]||(i[0]=(...l)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...l))},[r.isLoading?(e(),o("span",P,"Loading...")):(e(),o("span",E,"See more"))],8,I)):c("",!0)])}const x=d(B,[["render",q],["__scopeId","data-v-9a8665b1"]]),H=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/56.md","filePath":"glossary/56.md"}'),W={name:"glossary/56.md"},J=Object.assign(W,{setup(s){return(i,t)=>(e(),o("div",null,[k(x)]))}});export{H as __pageData,J as default};
