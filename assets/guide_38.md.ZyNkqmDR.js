Other reviewers suggested reading aloud, which is good advice, but this excellent audio version of the book will greatly improve your reading experience and understanding."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I can offer little in the way of literary criticism that has not been expounded by scholars about Joyce's masterpiece. What I can offer is the viewpoint of an 'average' reader.My edition was the 1922 text, and it was prefaced by the original publisher with a simple disclaimer: \\"The publisher asks the reader's indulgence for typographical errors unavoidable in the exceptional circumstances.\\" And it certainly is understandable and necessary: the text is rife with punctuation, spelling and word issues - but it is nearly impossible to tell which are deliberate and which came courtesy of the type setter.The structure itself is almost more of a literary experiment than a novel. It switches presentations, from interior monologue to grandiose play to question and answers to stream of consciousness. At least that happens in sections, so the reader has some chance of keeping within the structure presented.I read that Joyce wanted someone to be able to recreate Dublin from the text of this book - that's probably a good way to describe the essence of it. While not every street is named, the character of the city through its inhabitants comes through (often more clearly than what the event does that he is writing about).It was a struggle to get through this book on my own, and I think I would have gotten a lot more out of it if read as part of a class or discussion group, particularly if there were participants with knowledge of Irish history and specifically Joyce's background. The failings however are more my own versus the text itself."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I'm not sure if I would have been able to get into this book so much if I hadn't been taught by an amazing Joyce scholar in a Ulysses seminar, but please, buy a couple of Ulysses supplements if you are unable to take an accompanying class. It is well worth it. This book has marked my life indelibly."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I feel myself quite inadequate to write even a small review on such a masterpiece.

The last few lines are truly the most extraordinay I have ever read."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I know that I'm being sacrilegious here (especially considering that I live in Dublin, and Joyce is our Patron Saint of Literature and Literary Pub Tours), but how this novel is always ranked among the top of the 'Greatest of the Greatest' lists totally escapes me. I personally don't think that Joyce can lay claim to writing a true literary masterpiece simply because the language is immensely challenging. I strongly suspect that the accolades come in part precisely because of the fact that Ulysses rises far above the language of the less-intellectual novels that grace today's best-seller lists, and there is only a certain breed of reader that will wrestle with such a monster and live to tell about it. Not to down-play the other reviews here (which I think are all valid), but this veneration of Joyce seems to have a slight odor of literary snobishness. I can think of many more modern classics that are written with such clarity that even the less 'intellectual' can grasp the depth of the work...and isn't that truly the hallmark of a premiere author?"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Masterly done. One of the greatest novels I have ever read. James Joyce always hides another story, an image that passes us during the first read, that envokes us to read the novel a second time. And as soon as we pick the book up again, just when we thought we knew the allegory, another story surfaces itself from the pages. Stunning. An example of this two-sided method Joyce uses in his story is the first chapter. We see Stephen Dedalus shaving himself while he talks to his friend Buck Mulligan, but after a second read of the chapter we don't see Stephen Dedalus shaving but as a reciever of communion from Buck Mulligan who is actually a Protestant priest that consecrates the host at the beginning of the chapter. Only a master can put two stories in one chapter."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"If you want to understand Ulysses, you HAVE to read Portrait first, by JOyce of course. Try to get some portrait commentary so you know where Joyce is coming from, preferably an essay or two on JOyce's aesthetic theory and on the role of Stephen. If you can, read Dubliners too. I listened to an audio book lecture series on Joyce before i began his work ... it spoke of how the book begins in this oddly shaped tower the likeness of which can only be found in Ireland, hence, an American reader would most likely be ignorant as to where the books begins. As you read, consult the ANNOTATED ULYSSES for vocab and sentences that just seem too complex ... like the first sentence of the Bloom section and the ineluctable modality... - most people would not pick up the Jakob Boehme reference in the sentence, and when you do, if you dig Boehme as i have, let's just say it is a pleasant experience. I suggest the Everymna LIbrary series edition, it is a beautiful edition and has some very insightful supplements, including an introduction, the statement by an American judge that has become so renowned, a history of how the book has been printed(and more oft, destroyed) and a helpful chart on the structure of the book. I suggest one reads as much of this book as one can, even if it is just the Stehpen section, else one might die without at least experiencing part of this genius. Knowing a dash about Aquinas and Aristotle and reading some Berkeley will also sharpen one's mind to what's going on here."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Joyce was a great writer.

In addition his life history is also important) to approach because the scene is a century ago and the references many.

The simple fact that a novel must be digested and thought about does not make it &quot;obscure,&quot; nor is it, &quot;worthless.&quot; It can be enjoyed by all who are willing to think about it. Writers like Carver who can demonstrate beauty in the simplicity of their writing have their place in the corpus of the English language, but so do writers like Joyce, whose complexities weave around themselves and ask us to consider the possibilities of our language in a different sense.

So here's my explication/review:Ulysses : Political Commentary And SensualityJames Joyce was a famous contributor to the 18th century literary tradition. Nevertheless, Joyce's use of the supernatural is all too often mistaken for social commentary in Ulysses. Below, it will be proven that Ulysses's Surrealist overtones and views on hate are not evidence of Joyce's surrender to love. This claim is buttressed by three points: (1) the Surrealist views of Ulysses's protagonist, Tom Joad, (2) Joyce's triumphant use of satire in the work, and (3) the author's employment of human nature, showing the influence of the the British Modernist school.First, Joyce's male sympathies are evident in Ulysses. To indicate that Ichabod Stephenson is the work's villain, the author makes his dialogue simple. Ishmael Maxwell is a famous character for this very reason; it is also meaningful that scholars--by seeing him as an avatar of Joyce's Minimalist views--have misinterpreted the character King Adams's role in the book.Furthermore, consider that Ulysses was not so much written by Joyce as belched forth in a fit of sublime inspiration. Ulysses's use of incest is in keeping with its Constructivist point-of-view. Captain Stephenson is a far from marginal character; in fact, it is through him that many of Joyce's 18th century influences show through.Last, Ulysses cannot be fully understood without examination of the post Minimalist school of Roman literature. Many teens see the book's closing scene as the most enduring; I, however, do not. Nick Daniel is a witless character for this very reason; this is definitely why One-Eyed Caulfield is such a monumental character.It's easy to forget that Ulysses was the most brilliant work of its time. Perhaps it's time that scholars reevaluated their estimation of the book. Though contemporaries found Joyce's use of dystopic future-vision ponderous, history will vindicate Ulysses. Q. E. D. -- Quite easily done.The End"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"So we all know that Ulysses is amazing, best novel of the 20th century. And the Gabler edition is the most accurate version out there. But let's talk about the quality of the Gabler edition. While I was reading a brand new copy of this book, 20 of the pages completely fell out! I had to be careful not to bend the binding too much while reading it. I would suggest looking for this in hardcover or see if any other publisher has printed a copy of Gabler."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Imaginative literature can't afford to dissociate itself from its readership because the &quot;lay-reader&quot; is the very rationale for its existence! Joyce is not a model to be followed by any writer. Granted that it is the reader's prerogative to choose and pick - it is not up to the author of imaginative literature to be selective about his readers. This extremely gifted man had set out to surpass everything produced in literature up to his time, and if his goal had been tedium to the max, he achieved it. I am the first to give Joyce due credit for the linguistic scope and the skill with which he engineered the plot in Ulysses - but answer me honestly: does any of the characters come to live the way - say - Tolstoy manages to animate his people with a much more primitive technique? I seriously doubt it. Joyce the human being had limitations which got in the way of Joyce the writer which prevented Joyce the artist from living up to the full potential of Joyce the talent. Style is a direct reflection of an artist's temperament - obviously the writer of &quot;Ulysses&quot; could never make up his mind what kind of style it is going to be - the book lacks unity and appears in places unnecessarily oracular due to the style, but not necessarily for the subject matter, which can be looked up in a good reference! And if that wouldn't be bad enough, more than once Joyce went off on a rather revealing tangent: take for instance the masturbation scene in &Ograve;Nausicaa.&Oacute; Superbly written as it is, it gives us the whole deficiency of Joyce in a nutshell. He imitates the presumptuous and pompous phrasing in certain fashion magazines of the period, but just tell me to what end? Is it to poke fun on the cliche beset thought-process of the crippled girl? Well I fail to see the joke, this is just cruel. Satire either attacks a subject that has the capacity to bite back, or it is merely an act of a certain and in Joyces time very fashionable &quot;anti-philistine&quot; snobbery. Or perhaps the only reason for writing this way was that Mr. Joyce wished to flaunt his stylistic versatility? I am not objecting to have readers making an effort to get into a difficult text - not at all. But the reward should offer better things than the gratification of a crossword puzzle. We talk about participation. Participation in the artist's temperament to see things the way they present themselves to the artist. This does not prevent us from disagreeing. (I disagree with many things Tolstoy had to say when he couldnt resist to step on his collapsible soap box. But I also appreciate his artistic genius whenever he spares us the lecture.) To give another example: Compare &Ograve;Oxen of the Sun&Oacute; in Ulysses with the moments when women break their water in Tolstoys novels. Giving birth is not a linguistic exercise. Joyce's choice of style (in fact a display of 60 different styles and modes of speech) is just clever but completely detached from the event. What is to be expected at the very least, is a certain coherence of artistic vision, which I find utterly lacking in Joyce. He can't make up his mind, so he throws at us all the imitative bits and pieces from a (very talented) schoolboy's exercise book. Ulysses is the portfolio of a writer's versatility - it is not a work of art. When I was much younger and naive, I had read every single line of Joyce, including his letters and poems and even Finnegan's Wake (what a waste of time). I can't help it, the man was an amateur for all his life, a typical tinkerer and home improvement guy who probably never really found the kind of subject matter that could have distracted him from his self-consciousness. His short stories wouldn't be barely remembered these days if there wasnt his name under the title. They are imitation pieces, ventriloquistic exercises, and pretty flat and lifeless if held against Chekhov and Kipling, or Flaubert and Kathleen Mansfield. Apparently &quot;Dubliners&quot; and &quot;Portrait&quot; and especially &Ograve;Ulysses&Oacute; were written by an author who went on a quest for his own style. If Finnegan's Wake eventually was the place where the eagle landed, then, I am sorry to say, the game wasn't worth the candles. Joyce had tons of talent to burn, but something went seriously wrong here. I am all for modern art, and consider &quot;post modern&quot; a phony contradiction in terms. But lesser talents accomplished more - DosPassos, O'Neil, Kafka, Proust, Marianne Moore, Auden, Hemingway, Nabokov, they all have their moments, even clowns like Bukowski and Douglas Adams (who is a linguistic genius in his own right.) Borges could put in 3 lines what took a Joyce 30 strenuous pages without ever achieving a comparable impact. In the end, all I ask for, is the readers honesty. Don't just think something is great because a certain establishment says so. Real great artists (like Dickens or Shakespeare) can do without this sort of approval. Don't make it a mission to reach for an icon for no other reason than seeing it hanging high. A failure is a failure even if it is a great man's failure. And Joyce wasn't made of the stuff of greatness. But this is a different story. Approaching Joyce is an experience not unsimilar to &Ograve;The Approach to Al-Mutasim.&Oacute;"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I can not see why everyone thinks this book is so great. It reminds me of modern art, where a so called artist splashes paint on a canvas in ten minutes and then passes it off as a masterpiece.

Joyce, Faulkner (in some cases), and others of the &quot;I'm too deep for you, dummy&quot; school have massive good press from academics. Books like this keep them in tenure, one can devote a whole semester to explaining what is happening on Bloomsday. If you don't have to read this book, you shouldn't bother.

I'll just say one thing to that; if you need to read a piece of research (\\"The New Bloomsday Book\\", etc) in order to appreciate a work of art, visual, literary or otherwise, then the work of art in question has no value whatsoever. I do not need to buy a thick volume on the history, theory and imagery of surrealism to appreciate Dali's paintings, and I sure don't need it to appreciate a work of literature.And of course there is the \\"you didn't like/understand it, you're a fool\\" attitude, very common between so called intellectuals and college poseurs, but, what could anyone do but laugh at that?"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I just finished Ulysses (five minutes ago) and was blown away with the psychological insights Joyce was able to display through the characters thought processes' and interactions, both male and female.

Okay, I'll admit I'm used to blatant ignorance, I live in the United States, but when I saw that two of the most juvenile and mindless responses were from teachers, and one taught literature, I was once again blown away. Luckily, I was able to find some tonic by reading some of the other responses.

You'll never finish it if you don't start it. It's definitely one of the more rewarding books I've read."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"It's a daunting and difficult prospect, contemplating the reading of ULYSSES. Much like Proust's IN SEARCH OF LOST TIME, this is a book more quoted than read. It comes freighted with the most serious of professorial endorsements and a reputation for \`difficulty' hardly belied by its length.Does it justify its reputation as difficult? Yes. Does that hamper one's enjoyment reading it? Hardly at all. Jonathan Franzen's intervention in a debate about the differences between obtuse and clear writing is hardly helpful when considering ULYSSES. There should be a place for the products of literature, as for any art form, which requires the active participation of a reader, without succumbing to the charge of \`elitism'. Most great writers teach their readers how to read. The same applies to Joyce and ULYSSES (does the same apply to FINNEGAN'S WAKE? I don't know. I'm too scared to read it ...).My advice to any would-be reader - don't be intimidated by this book's reputation. Don't worry if at points, you find yourself confused or lost. Yes, there's a chapter in which Joyce recapitulates the evolution of written English to mirror embryonic development in humans. And yes, the chapter commonly known as \`Circe' is a bit long-winded. Despite that, the novel is a joy to read and to spend time with. Joyce's concerns in writing one day in the life of Leopold Bloom are life-fulfilling. There is tremendous joy, wit, fun and compassion in his portrayal of this most (un?)usual of heroes. It may help to avail yourself of the many resources available on the web. I found a lengthy pr&eacute;cis of each chapter particularly helpful at the start of my journey; and found that, about half-way through the book, I didn't need it any more. It is true that Joyce relied on allusions and references that are now all-but-lost to any modern reader. Again, don't worry. Any annotated edition will carry you through; and/or you'll find that the need to know each reference declines the further you journey along with Bloom.Have courage and you'll be rewarded. The book is life-affirming and very down-to-earth in its concerns. Joyce borrows the structure of Homer's epic in order to lampoon its myth-making and to play with its martial obsessions. Bloom is no hero. And that's the point."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I can't watch The Producers now without thinking of James Joyce. This stream of consciousness stuff is fun to read."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"It has taken something like a month, but Ulysses is finally done. I have conquered one of the Literary Behemoths (with Moby Dick and Middlemarch often considered as the other 2 of the Great Big Scary 3).Many aspects of this book are very, very challenging, and in my opinion you may want a little exposure to Joyce (like Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man) before you attempt this book. The other thing I strongly suggest is the new book Ulysses and Us by Declan Kiberd. Kiberd is essentially THE Joycean and spells out important literary concepts for each chapter of Ulysses.There are so many things the book brings up, but my personal favorite discussion has been the balance between art and obscenity within the eyes of the law.I remember touring NYU when I was between junior and senior year of high school. Right there, in the middle of the Art Department main office, was a black and white photograph of a woman sitting on the toilet. I was shocked. She had a faraway look in her eyes, and she was clearly thinking about something else-- the grocery list, all the things she had to do, something overwhelming. I was... confused but mentally intrigued. I had never seen anyone on the toilet before, and it's not something I actively think about other people doing. Ulysses is a lot like that. Almost as soon as Leopold Bloom, the main character, is introduced, we see him on the toilet. It's not particularly gross or graphic, but it's a private moment and there the reader is-- hovering. The book spans the course of one day, June 16th, and we see Leopold do pretty much everything. He eats, farts, has lustful thoughts... sure, some of the lustful thoughts might be creepy out of context, but in the 700 pages of context given, the reader becomes aware that this persistent lust is mostly due to the fact that he and his wife don't get down to the hanky-panky very much since their infant son died ten years ago.Joyce shows every aspect of life in such away that the reader realizes exactly what it it to be a human, full of conflict, obsessive thoughts and bodily needs (that goes back to the eating and farting). Just be prepared, because you have to find that beauty among a load of experimental styles and prose that can get very heavy at times."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ignoring the fact that I've had it a year and only made it to page 100...the format of the book is a bit odd.

This copy is a good size, fits in a bag easily, and is easy to carry. Some editions of U have a table of contents with the Greek parallels noted--did Joyce do this at some point? Anyhow, there is no table of contents (which it typical for most editions). This makes it difficult to study, esp. to link it with annotations. I find myself going from text to text trying to find my place in U and the annotations (I use Don Gifford's text). If you aren't willing to put in the time to study the text, I would suggest a text with a table of contents, if you know U and/or like the game of the book, I would highly recommend this edition."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"If you've ever wanted to join the intrepid few to have done \\"Ulysses\\" from cover to cover - but have found the task too forbidding - then this is probably the easiest and most palatable way of accomplishing your wish. The two narrators bring the work to life in a way that the printed work can only hint at; with the aid of their command of a dizzying variety of languages, accents, and dialects, you grasp (fairly often at least) what the flat-looking verbiage of the text only intermittently suggests.There are, however, inherent problems with a spoken-word reading of this work. The flitting from thought to thought that characterizes much of the text is slowed down and made too deliberate. The stream of consciousness is slowed to a trickle. Eighteen hours is stretched out to forty two in this reading and the sensation of a flurry of impressions that an ideal inner reading might capture (in Heaven?) is missing. In practice, however, only somebody utterly familiar with all the recondite allusions of the text could possibly read it so rapidly and you will probably get through the work more quickly by hearing this version than by reading it silently.I thought the \\"Circe\\" episode was the most compromised in this reading. It seems to go on for ever with the narrator having to announce the identity of the speaker every couple of sentences and the sense of whirling delirium goes missing because it drags so much. I don't know if this problem can be solved but I wonder if an ensemble of voices in this episode might more closely capture its atmosphere. Another gripe is that Donal Donnelly has a tuneless singing voice and the many musical snatches lose their point as a result. Joyce was highly musical but you'd never know it from this audiobook.But I moan too much. \\"Ulysses\\" is highly problematic - I would say self-contradictory - and I can't imagine any version in any medium could possibly elucidate it completely. This version comes relatively close to giving it point and for that I'm grateful.

Certainly, simply sitting down and trying to read it cold turkey is much too daunting for anyone who is not a literary scholar (and even some of those, too).The way I did it was to listen to these wonderful CDs while following along word-for-word in the Gabler Edition, published by Vintage, which is the version used by Irish actors Donal Donnelly and Miriam Healy-Louie. (Purists may cavil that this is not the approved edition, but it's one that matches the audiobook.) The reading is very clear and understandable to non-Irish listeners, and journeys through Gaelic, Latin, French, and even a bit of cat language, if I heard right.Yes, indeed -- one chapter every day or two, followed by an analysis by a professor from one of those CD/DVD college lecture series, and I not only finished the thing but understood it rather well, enjoyed it immensely, gave it as a birthday present to a friend, and now plan to take a second run-through.I must caution that the book and the audio should be used together, or the reader will get lost in the stream-of-consciousness writing that seems almost schizophrenic. In other words, it's not to be listened to in the gym while jogging on the treadmill (I found that out pretty quickly)."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Jim Norton, the actor reading this rendition, is fabulous in all his characters.

But it's worth it!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"To read Joyce's ULYSSES takes the preparation and dedication of a scholar, but the rewards in successfully completing the challenge of this masterpiece are immeasurable , in not only experiencing Joyce's prose genius, but also in the sense of personal triumph which accompanies it. If reading this tome while flying, don't be surprised if an attendant comments on your \\"light reading\\". A summer novel for the beach, it ain't. Start preparation with a visit or revisit to Homer's ODYSSEY which forms the circuitous modern adventures of Leopold Bloom in this one-day Dublin \\"odyssey\\" paralleling Homer's hero Odysseus. There are many excellent critical treatments of ULYSSES, which are recommended as guides once the ODYSSEY episodes have been (re)familiarized. These critical guides are not in the nature of the high school/college crib sheets CLIFF'S NOTES, which are to be avoided as the plague, but are scholarly treatments linking the classical approaches with those of Joyce's Bloom. One is advised to read one chapter of Joyce first, consider what was read and how it connects to characters and actions in Homer. If foggy, or puzzling, the treatment of this chapter in the critical treatment should be visited. Then the Joyce chapter should be reread and contemplated. So, on to the next chapter. Sounds challenging and time consuming? Yes , but what a reward awaits those who persevere. Understanding and the layered richness of Joyce will unfold. And then, you are off on the ride of your life. Enjoy. One might also rent the movie O,BROTHER WHERE ART THOU? after the ODYSSEY refresher since it presents a Hollywood comic approach to Odysseus' adventures. It' fun applying the Homer \\"identifications\\" to O'BROTHER..."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This is a masterpiece. It took me over a year to read it, and I am glad I didn't rush through it. Although I have spent a great deal of time thinking about the different passages, there are still many that are incomprehensible. I have only scratched the surface of this magnificent work. The book, based on the Odyssey, follows a day in the life of the ordinary/extraordinary Leopold Bloom as he wanders through Dublin. There are many historical and literary descriptions and allusions that make that day come alive. Many of the supporting characters, especially Stephen Dedalus and Molly Bloom, are fully realized. The final stream of consciousness passage ends with what I think is a triumphant line.If you want to tackle this book, take your time and think."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"First of all, I won't even begin to say what this giant hulk of a book was about, but it still remains my favorite work of literature of all time. The trick to enjoying this one, if you can use a verb like enjoying to describe it, is to simply let it flow and seep into you. It is like Gravity's Rainbow by Thomas Pynchon in that, there's so much knowledge stuffed into the narrative you'll never be able to grasp every word... And that's okay. You don't have to. It would probably take you decades anyhow. Just sit back and take your time with this one and somehow, it will become clear to you, the same time it's confusing the hell out of you. A definite challenge between love and hate and both of them will win out by the end. But you will feel rewarded when you're finished, if only to say: &quot;Yeh, I actually got thru the whole thing... Finnegan's Wake, which is really mindboggling, may be more of an experiment but this book is the more satisfying work. Don't let it discourage you. It wasn't meant to be read in one week, or even one month. Personally, I read passages of it in different locations, and somehow, that actually helped..."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Since I would hope most people are convinced of the merits of the book, let me talk about the edition. Academic infighting notwithstanding, I think the Gabler edition is as close to a &quot;correct&quot; Ulysses as we're going to get. The work he has put into studying each word is really astounding, and he's cleaned up a lot of sentences that never made sense earlier (I'm sure plenty of graduate students wrote long papers on how brilliant those nonsensical fragments were), and restored several sections that make it a much richer read - the telegram to Stephen, especially, opened up a lot of things for me.The book itself can get infuriating if one doesn't read it with a guide. Reading it beside the Bloomsday book allowed me to enjoy it the first time I went through it; if I hadn't done that, I doubt I would have enjoyed it much at all. It occasionally seems like he is just throwing in a different gimmick each chapter just to make it opaque - Oxen of the Sun, especially, just annoyed the hell out of me.But there are moments in this book that are unequalled by any other writer in English, and everyone should at least read it once - no matter how many people have ripped Joyce off, no one can get his style just right. Honestly, it is difficult to love this book as much as one might love Portrait, or even Dubliners, but there are moments of great compassion and insight here - you just have to cut through some of his tricks first. And the tricks usually aren't without purpose - most of them do need to be there. I find myself flipping through the book and reading some of the chapters again and again - the first two, Hades, Nausicaa, Circe, and Penelope, especially - and they're rewarding no matter how many times I read them. Beat through the whole book. And get this edition. It's worth the effort."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I've always laughed at X-Files fans, but I'm beginning to suspect a conspiracy. For years now, all I've ever heard is 'Ulysses' is unreadable, obtuse, unwieldly. It is anything but, being outrageously funny, unstoppably readable, dementedly inventive. Why would 'they' want us not to read it? Although it has saturated modern culture, Joyce's frightening lessons have been ignored or emasculated - film, literature, art, music are as timid and cliched today as they ever were, as if 'Ulysses' had never existed. 'Ulysses' demands that we think for ourselves, it bursts with inchoate possibilities we must take up for ourselves. Of course we shouldn't read it. But you really must get this edition (Oxford World Classics, edited by Jeri Johnson). go to 'Ulysses' bald, as I have done so many times, and you will probably throw it down after three pages, frustrated, annoyed, anchorless in a river of unfamiliar words, ideas, style. Johnson's annotation here is scrupulous. For each chapter, she registers the Homeric paralells, she discusses the various schema (each chapter has its own colour, art (eg literature, medicine), body organ etc.), she offers a brief critical precis of what is going on. Her notes, explaining historical literary, popular etc. allusions, are indispensible. With the exception of the (mercifully few) Stephen Daedalus chapters, as dense and (generally) dull as their hero, the book is a joyous breeze (well, almost). This in itself is a betrayal of Joyce - we are supposed to be jolted, confused, lost, such is the nature of modern life Joyce wanted us to taste. But he provided all his friends with clues, and we're just as good as them, right? There's no point talking about the discrete ingenuity of each episode, the depth of character, the unheard-of realism in describing their emotional and intellectual lives, the satire, the comedy, the seething anger at authoritarianism, communal idiocy and intellectual myopia, the parodies and pastiches of all literature and other cultural products. Like all great post-modern works (and like Godard, Picasso, Stravinsky, Joyce is a fertile POST-modernist, not a strangulated modernist), it will be impossible to read previous literature in the same way before, while it makes almost everything that came after it seem diluted and half-hearted. Leopold Bloom has been called a bourgeois everyman, but if only he was. His kindness, his (however unmethodical) voracious curiosity, his self-awareness, his humour, are as unusual in 1904 Dublin, as they are in our racist, money-mad, mean-minded, self-obsessed, greasy-tilled society today (I mean Ireland of course). My favourite episode is 'Sirens', the ultimate fusion of everything that is 'Ulysses' - character, language, humour, style, parody, satire, anger, emotion. Life. Now for the Wake!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"What a read! Stephen Dedalus's pretentious aestheticism reminded me a lot of Thomas Mann's Death of Venice's character Gustav Aschenbach, without of course the cynical hatred of the rotten Europe, more the wide-eyed lover of the growing Dublin. Leopold Bloom on the other hand seems to be a man to my own naive (or ignorant) tastes. The poetic consumer of words versus the materialist producer of words, a unity of humanity seen through two (or maybe including Molly three) eyes. The allusions to Aristotle and Blake needed a regular flicking through literary notes and for the Proteus chapter even a German dictionary! This was no bad thing though for if anything Ulysses is an education. Like all good things it required work, but with some good notes of history and literature its a must read, as beautiful as the Lithy."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This book is so bizarre it made my eyes itch. (But then I picked up Finnegan's Wake and it was so weird that my head fell off my shoulders and rolled into the waistpaper basket). It's worth reading though, because you'll never look at regular novels again the same way."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"For the first couple of hundred pages, I found myself throwing it at the wall in frustration pretty regularly. Not merely because of the difficulty (I like long, 'difficult' books generally) but because it's a book that you've got to totally submerge yourself within. Once you get comfortable with the bizarre minutia of daily life in Dublin circa 1904, and with the way that Joyce will change register, tone, syntax and structure, often within the same sentence, it becomes a little more manageable. A little. Each section is deeply challenging, deeply strange. Just when you begin to get the tempo of one, it ends, and you sort of have to teach yourself how to read the next one all over again. It often wasn't clear to me where the mythic and mundane end and begin in this book, because they bleed into each other in different ways both structurally and thematically on almost each page. There are moments of real stylistic brilliance throughout the book (the incredible 'wandering rocks' section, the hallucinatory mythological hodge-podge of the 'cyclops' part), and there were even some parts where I was genuinely emotionally moved (the funeral scene, the final, love-affirming pages of Molly's monologue). That being said, Joyce is also an insufferable intellectual show-off. And while this might be his 'biggest' work, for my money, 'Dubliners' is still his best, because he's at his best when he makes you interested in his characters instead of being merely interested in his own intellect. It definitely helps a bit if you've read 'Portrait of the Artist' first, but you certainly don't have to. And don't bother with a reader's guide. It might help you get some of the references (and god, how this book references things), but it won't help you to actually read it. Enter at your own peril."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Stephen Dedalus, Molly Bloom, Milly, Leopold Bloom, Buck Mulligan, and Paddy Dignam, except that Paddy Dignam is dead, (as is poor Rudy), inhabit this tapestry of a book. Dead dog, body bloated, exists just beyond the sands, outside of the Martello tower, Stephen's digs. A dead father, a dead mother populate the story along with sights, smells, but most of all noise-- songs and chants. There are ditties, rhymes, advertisements, sayings remembered, refrains, art songs, Baroque and classical music filling the pages of this book.There is a great send-up on newspapers and the misinformation embodied in them. Parallels exist with Stephen mourning his mother and Bloom his father. The hectic flush indicates a finished man, a drunkard. Paddy Dignam is dead. Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam considers his last night, boozing.Molly Bloom is from Gibraltar. Eating liver, Leopold Bloom recalls when Molly laughed at another singer, Ben Dollard, who needed a suit. Poor Mrs. Purefoy has been in labor for three days.

Bloom wants to meet Martin Cunningham about the insurance of Dignam. For an advertisement there must be repetition. That is the secret according to Bloom.Gerty MacDowell is lady-like, pretty. Words used by Cissy Caffrey embarass her. Another of her companions is Edy Boardman. Gerty wishes that her father had avoided the demon drink. Bloom admires Gerty's beauty and has sympathy for her lameness.Stephen, a stand-in for the author, uses a self-description of bullock befriending bard. Stephen is seeking a career in literature, and hopes to avoid a career in the church or in journalism. Bloom was warned by his father not to go with drunken goys. Bloom warns Stephen, taking a fatherly interest in his well-being, away from Mulligan.The most densely written and exciting book of the twentieth century remains exactly that. Its artistry has never been exceeded except, perhaps, in Joyce's FINNEGAN'S WAKE."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I only just finished reading Ulysses myself for the first time and believe I may provide at least some small aid for other prospecitve readers. Obviously the book is complex. I would characterize it as the most difficult book I have ever read, whoever, I would not take this as an offence to the genius of the book. I have read (and performed) Hamlet, Homer, Dante, and a host of other &quot;classics,&quot; but even if you have not you can still appreciate this work. I would be lying if I said I understood all of the esoteric references even to the literature I have read, but lets be honest how many of us can say we havn't been stumped by a book, or movie, or story, or whatever even with references relativly close to our times and places. I know people who would have no clue if I made a reference to somthing like &quot;Fight Club&quot; even though it is both a best selling book and huge motion picture success (Lord of the Rings for that fact). Don't worry if somthing goes over your head. This is not a casual novel (no Koontz or King here). This is a thematic character study. I recently heard an interesting interview with Quentin Terrantino in which he said somthing to the effect of &quot;people don't talk about 'the plot' they talk about their everyday s**t,&quot; and actually that is a pretty fair description of what the framework for Ulysses is. It is one day in the lives of predominantly two people. We are all dynamic individuals, try to immagine a day in your own life and the stresses and desires you face. What memories creep into your concious. What little games do you play at work, with friends, your lover? I bet your not the same person in all those places are you? Don't sweat it if you don't understand a word here and there just take your time and be carefull with the text. The perspectives will shift and the stream of conciousness will kick in and you have to roll with the punches.It will probably help most people to have some reference books available during a reading of Ulysses, but I personnally felt I became too distracted with every little newance (that's probably spelled incorrectly) so I just went with it. There is a reason all the ivory tower types love this book and that is because you can literally spend years deciphering all the layers. The book, like all pieces of art, is a product of its time so be prepared for that as well. It helps to have some knowledge of turn of the twentieth century Irish/English relations, world views, even literary styles of the era. I had a duece of a time getting through the collected works of Poe because so much of it was in German, French, or Latin (you know people in America used to learn Latin in school, how lame ;) ). I have rambled for way to long so I will close with a point. Many people don't understand modern classical music because they don't understand its place in history. Many people don't understand Jazz or Punk or Hip Hop because they don't understand their places in history. Ultimatly Ulysses will be like many other works of art in this regard. Take your time with it and relax with it (you are not being graded on how many of the top 100 of whatever you have read you know). You may not really like it after having read it and thats OK, but don't be a close minded neigh-sayer just because its not your style. I don't really like Russian novels, but I see their quality, just as I see the genius of Pollack, Whorhal, and Basquiatt (probably missed at least one of those names) but would rather hang a Munch or Picasso. To each his own just don't be pretentious."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"In 2000, the Modern Library came up with a list of the one hundred greatest English language novels of the 20th century. Topping their list at number one was Ulysses, by Irish novelist James Joyce. After completion of this novel, I can conclude that they have made a wise decision.Ulysses follows the lives of two Dubliners, Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom, on a single day in Ireland. Leopold Bloom is a lonely middle-aged Jewish man who has a wife, Molly and a daughter, Milly. He also had a son that died as a child. Stephen Dedalus is a young school teacher who has seperated himself from his old drunken father. During the day, Stephen and Bloom make their seperate ways through the hectic streets and taverns of Dublin. Along the way the encounter various characters (such as the Citizen and the Anonymous Narrator) that act as symbols for Dublin society and the world in general. By the end of the novel, the theme has been understood. Like that of Homer's Odyssey (hence the name of the title), Leopold (Ulysses) has gained a son in Stephen (Telemachus), and Stephen has gained a father in him.Ulysses is undoubtedly Joyce's masterwork. He takes command of the English language, as well as nearly a dozen others, throughout the course of the novel. Various literary styles are exhibited to fit the theme of each chapter. For example, to show the busy workplace of a newspaper office, Joyce begins each section with a headline that sums it up. A complete five act drama is even included in a single chapter of this novel. Joyce's methods of characterization are also very obscure, yet brilliant. Characters are not characterized by their actions or by dialouge, but by their thoughts and fantasies. This allows the reader to see each character's hidden emotions and fears. These inner monolouges may be triggered by the smallest occurrence, then escalade into the meanings of life and death.I would only recommend Ulysses to an experienced reader with a lot of spare time. This novel is 783 pages long and takes roughly thirty to forty hours to read. Joyce's various writing styles, although genious, are very difficult to read. So, if you think that you can get past these obstacles, should you read Ulysses? There is a simple answer that you will only understand after completion of the novel: Yes."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The lovely, talented Erica Jong confessed to having skipped large parts of this momentous work, yet told people it was her favorite book. Hemingway did it a similar injustice--Ulysses deserves to be read, reread, and studied as infinitum. Joyce devoted eight years of hard work to it, and nothing like its stream-of-consciousness narrative has been seen since. Scholars take note--Faulkner never read this book!Space prevents me from gushing the way I would like to, but look for the passage in which Stephen Dedalus and Poldy Bloom are getting blasted in Dublin as a baby is being born above them, and Joyce's language begins with the Angleish of Beowulf and travels through time, touching downe with Chaucer and Sir Thomas Browne, among others. In truth, it's hard to believe that a single living human being actually sat down and created this out of nothing; to my poetic heart, it has always seemed as sacred and immutable as the sea or its stars..."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses is one of the most well-known books of the 20th century. It is highly praised by some, and it is loathed by others. In this case there can be no middle road. If you like a good, gripping story, then this is not your cup of tea. If you like literature for the sake of fine language, then you are on the right track. Joyce is not out to make the journey through this book easy, in that respect one may get the idea that the story of Ulysses is really the story of the reader's struggle through the book. But there are much riches to be found in it. Perseverance is the key. A reviewer here thinks the GertyMcDowell part to be the best, indeed it is the most readable chapter in the book because it is a parody of cheap 'women's' literature. The other chapters have their own strengths, and it is not unimaginable that each reader will have his or her own favorite chapter (for example, Molly Bloom's incredible soliloquy at the end of the book, or the eerie 'play'-chapter). Go click and buy this work of art, try it, and if you hate it, put it away and return to it in a few years. You may find you savor it then."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I not only read this book, I was taught it. It was the subject of my thesis at Berkeley. However, I would not presume to know a great deal about it. I think I will learn even more the next time I read it.Is it the greatest novel ever? Big question. I haven't read every novel, so I can't say. It's the best novel I have ever read.The novel is much deeper than most people believe. I would think to read it on the surface level only would be pretty boring, except for the lyrical style. But the real brilliance lies in his intertwining several allegorical levels with the action (if it can be called that). Too complicated to go into.Suffice it to say this book is about Everything! and Everyone! The universe contained in one ordinary man in one ordinary city on one ordinary day. We are all warriors and adventurers while at the same time stepped on by cowards and beat up by triviality. We are Leopold Bloom. Didn't you know?Apart from the mind bending, headache inducing allegory, what sets Joyce apart from other twentieth century novelists is the way he makes the English language into music. Joyce truly exhibits the shear beauty of words, creating nothing less than a symphony filled with harmony, dissonance, rythym and syncopation, noise, peace, passion, hopelessness, beauty, and terror that you can hear if you listen and if you let your mind let the words pierce that well disguised wall of cynicism.It's a romantic adventure about the best and the worst in all of us.Helps if you read it with the New Bloomsday Book. Hard to make it through it without it."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I was inspired to give ULYSSES another try after reading Bartholomew Gill'sDEATH OF A JOYCE SCHOLAR, a detective story whose plot is closely tied to Joyce's great novel. One of Gill's characters gives the advice to let the words flow like music, over you and through you, and not to get hung up in the details. Good advice, I found. If read quickly in this way, ULYSSES is more mesmerizing than it mystifies, and constantly exhilarating despite its occasional tendency to exasperate. I fully expect that a second reading will require a full summer rather than a mere week, and demand the use of a dictionary, a map, and a detailed reader's guide, but a first pass without any of these can still bring enormous pleasure.I did find it almost impossible, however, to read for plot. Although the events in ULYSSES are rather simple and are confined to a single day (Thursday, June 16, 1904), so much is told in flashback or in the imagination that it becomes hard to separate the various strands. I found it helpful to refer to the online Cliff Notes after reading each chapter just to confirm what I thought had happened. And, in real terms, nothing much does. Two men, the young intellectual Stephen Dedalus (Joyce's alter ego fromPORTRAIT OF THE ARTIST AS A YOUNG MAN) and the fortyish Jewish salesman Leopold Bloom, wake up, leave the house, wander around Dublin for most of the day, crossing paths occasionally, only to come together towards the end of the book and part again before the story ends in the small hours of the following morning. But the plot is only one of several threads that Joyce uses to organize a novel that contains as much of life as he can cram into it; among the other devices that shape the book are parallels with the ODYSSEY, the geography of Dublin, an almost Freudian penetration into the psyche of his characters, an ever-deepening humanity, and a large-scale structural organization akin to the movements and thematic connections within a piece of music.Joyce's language is musical too, and should probably be heard rather than read. His set-pieces -- such as Molly Bloom's famous erotic soliloquy in the Penelope chapter [18] that closes the book, Leopold Bloom's parallel fantasy at the end of Nausicaa [13], the Viceregal procession at the end of Wandering Rocks [10], or the numerous passages of Homeric invocation that punctuate Cyclops [12] -- show his magical ability to weave a spell with words and his exuberant delight in doing so. But there is no single Joycean style; one of the joys of ULYSSES is that each chapter introduces a distinct style of its own. The classical passages in Cyclops [12] are answered by long early-British sections in Oxen of the Sun [14] in which no latinate words are used whatsoever. The intellectual legerdemain of some of the Stephen Dedalus chapters is balanced by the down-to-earth barroom conversations of Leopold Bloom's friends. At different times, Joyce uses the language of magazine stories, the Catholic Church, political rhetoric, or scholastic debate. He includes densely-argued prose, free verse, snippets in six or seven languages (ULYSSES is not merely Irish but cosmopolitan), quotations from opera and street songs, and even two pages of musical notation! Wandering Rocks [10] is composed of brief fragments, like verbal snapshots of Dublin at a particular moment. Ithaca [17] is cast in the form of a catechism that addresses subjective emotional issues with the detailed objectivity of scientific analysis. Circe [15], the longest chapter of all, is a masochistic nightmare written in the form of a play script, or rather a movie scenario years ahead of its time.More than anything else, I found myself reading ULYSSES for the sheer delight of its many styles, and hugely enjoying even those parts that I didn't understand. There are many more treasures to be found in the book, I am sure, but this was more than enough for a start!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The reader of Ulysses is forced to continually reassert his perspective and understanding of point of view when reading the text. The narrative frequently shifts in perspective between Stephen, Bloom, the citizens of Dublin and a faceless narrator operating on levels internal and external. Language is used directly in speech and substantiation, as well as symbolically in mental thought and acquires transcendental meaning in grammatical and spelling reconfiguration.Stephen's typological character is self-defined in Telemachus as that of a servant. As he explains to Haines, \\"I am the servant of two masters... the imperial British state... and the holy Roman catholic and apostolic church.\\" Whether this servitude is literal or self-inflicted, we do not know. We know from Mulligan's remonstrations of Stephen's actions at his dying mother's bedside that Stephen has struggled with the Catholic faith. We know from Haines' knowledge of Gaelic over the milkwoman's that there is a level of intellectual and political dominance in place. We also know this from Haines' self admission, \\"We feel in England that we have treated you rather unfairly. It seems history is to blame.\\" This is exactly a point where a reading of Ulysses accompanied by a fair knowledge of the political relationship of England to Ireland and an understanding of the rise of Nationalism during the time in which the novel was placed could add a good deal of understanding to the depths of the characters relations. This will continue to be the case throughout the novel as there are countless allusions to the history of the church and Ireland. There are frequent references by Stephen of historical heroes such as Pyrrhhus, Moses and Parnell who were frustrated while trying to lead a certain people out of bondage. The purpose of these references culminates in the important discussion between Stephen and Bloom toward the end of Ithica about Moses Maimonides and the chanting of the 113th psalm which celebrates the escape of the children of Israel from Egypt. These historic and theological references are important counterpoints to Stephen who in Telemachus declares himself not to be a hero. Though the narrative of the first few chapters can be followed fairly consistently without historic knowledge of this kind, in the later chapters the narrative will cease to make much sense when references are cited and counterpoised to create specific intellectual and sociological meanings in the lives of the characters. Once a fact or idea is raised it will surely resurface at a later time in the thoughts of a character and will be mulled over ad infinitum. It is the discourse of the narrative that gives the best illumination into the classification of characters.Not only does Joyce span the forms of narrative from dialogue to subconscious hallucination, but also he twists the structure of language and words themselves to reassign meaning to language tools whose original purpose was to have a definitive meaning. Consider the final functional unit of the novel. Molly begins her soliloquy with the internal declaration, \\"Yes because he never did a thing like that before as ask to get his breakfast in bed.\\" The entire soliloquy could be labeled as the indicial knowledge which feeds into the question: will Molly bring Bloom's breakfast to their bed in the morning? However, in the course of this long final narrative the question is eclipsed by the question: will Molly continue to be unfaithful to Bloom? Directly after this is established, it is tempting to speculate about the meaning of the narrative rather than cling to the rules of understanding its structure. Before this point in the narrative we have only had a very short encounter with Molly. The most we have gathered about her character is that of an object of desire. This image is both reinforced and destroyed by her final soliloquy. The answer concerning the original question of breakfast appears to be in the positive as Molly has expressed disappointment in her lover and a remembered passion of her vow to Bloom. This speculation gives a more refined meaning to the narrative as a whole implying a cyclical nature to Dublin life. Molly will bring Bloom his breakfast and he will leave on another journey throughout Dublin leaving her to remain in the bedchamber as an image in the lascivious imagination of the world. This seems to be the consensus of overall criticism of Ulysses. But, as it seems the day of Ulysses was the first day Molly had an affair, this suggests daily life isn't as static as it might first appear and people have the propensity to break from their assigned roles. This is especially true as with Stephen, whose role was to find a father figure or a \\"home\\" in the novel, but Stephen leaves him/it when the discovery is made. Creating final and definitive answers to Ulysses meaning is impossible and we should remain aware of this in conjunction with our methods of reading."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This is the second time I've read &quot;Ulysses&quot;. It is a 'hard read' even for me, a good reader; my consistant criticism against Joyce is that he intentionally works to hide his arguments, his characters, and his thematic material behind a mind-boggling wall of style in &quot;Ulysses&quot; and &quot;Finnegan's Wake&quot;, though his earlier works are quite approachable.Too bad. The book is actually quite deeply human, and funny as hell. Bloom is a decent, bungling 'hero', a human like all of us. He's got his strengths, his weaknesses. I see him wandering flat footed in his black slacks like Charlie Chaplin through the crazy, jangling streets of Dublin. The night-town scene is a burlesque with a keenly penetrating, humanistic mind firmly at the helm. The barroom brawl a riot, especially with the dual narrators; the uneducated clod of low intelligence, and the archaic, mythic intonations of the blabber mouthed rhetoritician.He muses on the wonder of existance; how we, living, dead breaths breath. How man and woman come together, making love and making babies. How, ultimately, we are all connected, umbilically to the past through our connections with the Tribe of Man.&quot;God loves everybody,&quot; says the comic, absurd voice in the barroom scene. It is funny. We grin, chuckle at the absurd voice. But it is true. It is Joyce's central theme.Unfortunately, what he's mostly done is kept a ton of scholars busy writing 'commentaries' for a book that is revelant, all too human, and funny as hell... Perhaps even more hillarious than &quot;Catch-22&quot;... but that's debatable.I give it five stars because I happen, through the graces of a good education, to be able to understand it. It is towering and complex. If you're willing to work, go for it. It will take you some time; took me two solid weeks of work. Still, when you're through, there's a sense of mental satisfaction. You feel like you've solved a great logic puzzle. However, don't just read it for themes; try to recreate the scenes and dialog in your mind. This isn't easy, granted. Joyce's style makes it tough.. but do! The rewards are immeasurable. Once you see these characters as real, solid characters, not as abstractions, the lights begin to shine, and you understand how Joyce sees the mythic/ religious shining through our chaotic, jumble of the modern world."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This book is five or six times the length of most novels, has an army of minor characters to keep up with, and contains a vocabulary that makes prudent keeping handy a good, unabridged English dictionary. (Never mind the German, Italian, French, Gaelic, Yiddish, etc., or the allusions to classical or Irish mythology.) A damned difficult book, it's true. But it captivated me. ULYSSES is by turns crude and sensitive, lyrical and blunt, funny and sad. During Bloomsday, the people of Joyce's universe eat, ogle women, defecate, bet on horses, worry, work, make love, lift their petticoats and wiggle their behinds, attend funerals, beg, give alms, pray, blaspheme and discuss every subject worth breath from the disposition of Shakespeare's second-best bed to God being a shout in the street to sex in all its manifestations. Yes! O yes! I have never seen anything so rich with the texture and feel and vivid details of life. Add to that Joyce's use of stream of consciousness and interior monologue to draw the reader into the tale with the characters (something no novelist before Joyce, not even Henry James, could pull off) as well as blindingly beautiful stretches of sheer poetry and you are looking at magic. Read this. Truly beautiful things can be as difficult as they are rare."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Definitely buy this Jim Norton version. Do not get the Donal Donnelly version that one reviewer recommends -- I followed his advice and it was a huge mistake, now I am purchasing the Norton version. The Donal version is haltingly slow with disruptive pauses between each word, even in dialogue. It's so bothersome -- the reading is like a 3rd grader would read. This Jim Norton version runs over 27 hours, but the Donal Donnelly version runs over 40 hours -- the extra time? It's spent in awkward pauses that break the flow of the language and the dialogue -- you totally lose the beauty of Joyce. Don't make the costly mistake that I made -- buy the right one the first time. Now that I have this Norton version, I can happily sail through Ulysses and appreciate Joyce's supreme writing. If you really want to get through this novel, the audio is a tremendous help to play along with you as you read."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"&quot;Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed.&quot; &quot;Ulysses&quot; begins with an easily understood sentence, identifiable actions and objects, and little of the puns, ambiguities (well, except for what word &quot;stately&quot; modifies) and symbols (ok, maybe the cross on the bowl of lather) for which Joyce is read, and, perhaps just as often, not read.I think it's well worth reading; in fact, it's probably my favorite book (so far), one to which I return often. I think the key to enjoying--rather than just finishing--the book is that it can be read on many levels. One can choose to decode every historical, literary, and religious allusion, the staggering play of words, and sometimes barely comprehensible inner dialogue. I recommend decoding these selectively--they do add meaning and humor--but to also read this as a kind of tone poem, in which language itself is celebrated and elaborated, with passages of great humor and sympathy. A non-slavish interpretation of the book, enables one to laugh (out loud, even) at the rich humor, to identify with the struggles of every-person Leopold Bloom, and to savor, Zen-like, the sound soup without total comprehension. In addition to Joyce's mastery and subversion of the language, there are larger issues: A liberal critique of ethnocentrism, nationalism, dogmatism, and vanity. Criticized by some as degrading the human spirit (see Jeffrey Segall's &quot;Joyce in America&quot; for a very good review of critical reactions), it is really a celebration of it, finding dignity and soul in the flaws and triumphs of the &quot;common&quot; person.I can also recommend some books to negotiate the complexities of the book, especially &quot;Ulysses Annotated&quot; (by Don Gifford with Robert J. Seidman), &quot;The Ulysses Guide&quot; (Nicholson), &quot;James Joyce: A to Z&quot; (Fargnoli and Gillespie), and &quot;Ulysses, Portals of Discovery&quot; (McCarthy). (All of these available at Amazon.) While I kept the Gifford and Seidman book handy, and think it enhanced my appreciation of &quot;Ulysses,&quot;it is definitely not necessary to solve every allusion and ambiguity. In fact, appreciation of ambiguity is just one of the book's many facets. Just embrace and enjoy &quot;Ulysses&quot;; it is one of the funniest and wisest books you'll read."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Okay, this is clearly the most thought out book I have ever read. You go through it, and you pick out any part and say, why must he be so wordy about two people getting a guinness, but you realize that he is putting all the mythical overload into trivial events, and that while it is absurd, it is true. If you can read this book in a class, that would be best, but at least be sure to have a complete guide so that you can get some of the allusions. You don't need to catch EVERYthing. It is very show-offy, a bit like Joyce is trying to just pack every single piece of information he's ever picked up into this novel (or whatever you'd like to call it, I think it is a novel, though). This can be annoying, but it is amazing. And I think that was his point, to describe his world and everything in it, through the story of a common man, whose heroism so deeply embedded in him is overlooked."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I've just now downloaded this version (Ulysses [Annotated]), so I can't say how it compares to the other Kindle versions as far as missing text, or any of the other formatting complaints. I can say, it does not appear to be annotated. And indeed, if you go to the actual publisher's site (digireads.com) they do not list it as being such, nor do they mention annotation anywhere in the product description.I know Amazon probably has millions of product descriptions to sort through and try to make accurate. But I'd rather have a vague description than one with added details that prove purely erroneous.I also think their practice of automatically cross-referencing the reviews for different editions of the same book is incredibly unhelpful. Bottom line: this version does not appear to offer any immediately discernible advantages over the free version; save your $1.99."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"At the end of one of \\"Ulysses\\" most unpleasantly challenging chapters, \\"Oxen Of The Sun,\\" Joyce throws out an offhand comment which might read as a sort of gauntlet to anyone who fancies him or herself as a capable reader: \\"Just you try it on.\\"People have been \\"trying on\\" \\"Ulysses\\" ever since, and if my experience is any indication, the result is an infuriating and intoxicating read, not always both at once however. Sometimes it's great, and sometimes it's terribly self-conscious and clever, serving no purpose except allowing self-aggrandizing deconstructionists and post-modernists a chance to strut their stuff and feel like they have something over the rest of us.I want to be clear in saying I regard \\"Ulysses\\" as a supreme example of craft and literary brilliance, but I don't think it is the great English-language novel, only maybe the most important. J.D. Wombacher said it very well in one of the earlier reviews: \\"My own view is that Ulysses is an example of a writer not doing his job.\\" If a writer's job is to create a novel in such a way as to let the reader in, this is not only a valid sentiment, but a boldly honest one.You start out thinking this isn't going to be as bad as every says. We watch an awkward young man named Stephen deal with his supersmug semi-friend and an annoying British interloper high atop the city of Dublin, in Martello Tower. Stephen is aware of the fact his \\"pal\\" Buck is really a bit of a user, and patronizing as hell, and in subtle, clever, and often funny ways, Joyce lets the reader see how. Then we watch poor Stephen alternately try to instruct a bunch of Anglo-Irish brats and deal with a supercilious headmaster, who fancies himself an expert on everything from livestock to why the sun will never set on the British empire.Then Stephen goes to the beach, and what follows in the third chapter, \\"Proteus,\\" is something that would make any good editor cry out for a rewrite. Joyce noted that his writing skills by the time he got to \\"Ulysses\\" were of such an advanced degree that he could do anything he wanted to with the English language, but there's ample evidence in the finished work that such absolute power can corrupt absolutely.At least Joyce seems to realize this, too, somewhat. He shifts the focus to another social outcast, a Jewish advertising salesman named Leo Bloom who busies himself with the stream of life around the fair city of Dublin so as to avoid going home, where he knows his fat wife is about to carry on an affair with a callow bounder.The results are some of the most affecting chapters ever written, each one slightly askew from the next, but forming a kind of whole that takes into account the whole history of literature, while advancing that history into unexplored territory with stream-of-consciousness narratives and multiple perspectives. Chapters like \\"Wandering Rocks,\\" \\"Sirens,\\" and especially \\"Cyclops\\" work on so many levels they make the head spin, and Joyce the humorist (he claimed one of his principal goals in writing \\"Ulysses\\" was to make the reader laugh) rivals Twain in his humanistic humorousness. Witness this sardonic exchange in \\"Cyclops,\\" my favorite chapter.\\"Dead?\\" says Alf. \\"He is no more dead than you are!\\"\\"Maybe so,\\" says Joe. \\"They took the liberty of burying him this morning anyhow.\\"But do we really need the mindgames of \\"Oxen Of The Sun,\\" or the play-form phantasmagoria of \\"Circe,\\" which lead us into blind alleys and throw enough red herrings to kill us with mercury poisoning? People say you need to read the Greek legend this all is based on, and I didn't, but I don't think I'm alone in finding this tangent strained. When Stephen finally ditches his false friend, he does so off-stage as it were, and it is never explained what transpired. Critics have their ideas why the connection between Stephen and Bloom, once made, is so vital, but it eluded me, even with all the supplemental reading I did.The end result is a writer writing essentially for himself, and for those who will play his games. That leaves out the rest of us.I'm glad I read this book, and hope God grants me the time to read it again someday. But don't believe the hype. Read \\"Ulysses,\\" but don't sweat what you don't get. Many of those who say they do \\"get\\" it are kidding themselves. Better to be honestly perplexed, and humbled by the experience. Humility has its virtues, and Joyce might have benefited from it more in writing this, creating a real masterpiece for the masses rather than an ivory tower to which only he held the key."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"There is not a book out there that is more frustrating than James Joyce's Ulysses...unless, of course, it is Joyce's Finnegan's Wake. The problem lies in the fact that this novel is such an amazing piece of art that the reader can feel like Joyce forgot all about him. It is almost impossible to read by oneself with it's seemingly garbled maze of words and phrases and madness. However, this is what makes it such a joy to read. Imagine that an author decided to do away with any and all rules concerning fiction and to write a book that was it's own entity, showing you what it wanted to show you, telling you what it wanted to tell you and acting like its own character. This is what Joyce has accomplished with Ulysses. I was fortunate enough to read this book in a class, four months of nothing but Ulysses, and I have to warn would be readers that I don't think I would have made it through without expert guidance. I would advise anyone wishing to tackle this literary giant to gather some book loving friends, and a guidebook or two for Ulysses, and to take it very slowly. Read a chapter a week and then meet up with you group to discuss and puzzle out what you have just read. I am willing to bet that your weekly conversations will be a greater work of art than any book out there, and I think that Joyce would have liked that, would have enjoyed sparking debates and conversation, its probably the main reason why anyone creates anything; for it to be enjoyed and shared. The story line is simple, you have two main characters, Stephen Dedalus, the brilliant but alienated loner. You have Leopold Bloom, a simple man who is as alienated as Stephen, but not for his mind, for his cultural background and meek manner. The entire book takes place over the course of one day in Dublin, and after the first three chapters the entire book simply follows Bloom around during a day when he knows that his wife is having a romantic meeting with her lover. It is hard to sum up such a giant book in a few sentences like this, but basically Bloom is trying to set his life back on track, trying to reconcile himself with his wife's betrayal, and trying to reach out to Stephen who he feels could use a loving family. Of course, you could read this book and not find any of what I am saying in there, but the beauty of Ulysses is that I would love to hear what it is that you found in this novel as much as I would love sharing what I found."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"There's probably not much about Ulysses that hasn't already been said, but having just spent well over a month of my free time struggling through this book I thought I would put my two cents in.In my opinion, Judge John M. Woolsey's synopsis in his 1933 ruling on the work's obscenity charge sums up the book almost perfectly. It is indeed an astonishing achievement and a literary tour de force. It is, as he says, by turns brilliant and dull, intelligible and obscure. And of course it is unprecedented in its exceptionally honest treatment of sexuality.I really can't agree with his contention, however, that every word of the book is purposeful in its contribution to the whole. In some ways, particularly the incredible realism of its characters' interior monologues and its ability to make a particular place and time come alive for the reader, Ulysses is perhaps the most well-written novel I've ever read. In other ways, namely Joyce's frequent inability to resist showing off his erudition and mastery of language, it is one of the worst and often cries out for editing. While there's not a word of Hades, Wandering Rocks or Penelope I would change, some other chapters (e.g., Cyclops, Oxen of the Sun, and Ithaca) become downright tedious despite their conceptual ingenuity and flashes of brilliance. Additionally, the book is sometimes cloyingly self-referential, plausibility too often bows to symbolism, and many of Joyce's allusions are so esoteric or ambiguous that they can only serve to distract the reader. While it has faults (and despite the book's deification in literary circles, I can't see any other way to characterize many of its quirks and stylistic excesses), Ulysses is nonetheless well worth the exceptional effort required to read it due to its penetrating and poignant illumination of human desires, delusions and relationships. As an added plus, at many points it is nothing less than hilarious.Personally I found it very helpful to listen to a recording of the text on audio to get through the book (the version narrated by Donal Donnelly and Miriam Healy-Louie published by Classics on Cassette is extremely well done), as twice previously I had attempted to read it without such support and couldn't get beyond six or seven chapters. I would also suggest having at hand an unabridged dictionary, a book of scholarly annotations, and especially Harry Brimes' Bloomsday book for those passages where, despite your best efforts, you still can't figure out what the heck is going on (occasionally Brimes can't either).Four stars may seem niggardly for a masterpiece, but I'm comparing it with King Lear and The Brothers Karamazov. If you're an Irish Catholic literary scholar with doctorates in western religion and etymology and an upcoming sabbatical, by all means add half a star."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"On June 16th, 1904, a young James Joyce met his future wife for the first time. Ten years later, in 1914, he began what would become one of the greatest epics of modern language, Ulysses, setting the entirety of the events within that one special day shared by him and his wife, offering it to the world in an alternately joyous and tragic, comical and dense tribute to life and to living.The story cannot be summarised without reciting the book itself, an exercise that goes beyond the scope of this review. Suffice to say that the novel follows Leopold Bloom as he makes his way about Dublin, and Stephen Dedalus as he wanders from place to place. The two eventually meet, and the book finishes. Then again, that description is like saying Moby Dick is about a whale and Gravity's Rainbow is about a rocket. Technically true, but how much detail and texture do you miss with such a soul-less description?Ulysses has since grown beyond itself, garnering a reputation that scares away most readers. Considered an 'ivory tower' book, a 'professor's dream', it should be admitted that there are very difficult sections. Whole chapters - most of which are quite long - can be extremely tedious to read, becoming bogged down in medical or legal terms which serve mostly to confuse and distract the reader. But then there are chapters of amazing insight, clarity, wisdom and skill - thankfully more than there are difficult. The Cyclops chapter is sheer genius, a 120-page play that moves from bizarre to hilarious to sublime and back again. By itself, it is almost worth the price of admission, but there are many more that are just as amazing. The question and answer chapter of Ithaca is sheer genius, and Molly's monologue, right at the end, while texturally dense, flows and runs like a river.The language used ranges from flowery to technical to simplistic to overly complicated to deliberately obscure to beautiful. 'Wavewhite wedded words shimmering on the dim tide' is beautiful, whereas 'What selfinvolved enigma did Bloom risen, going, gathering multicoloured multiform multitudinous garments, voluntarily apprehending, not comprehend?' is difficult. Of course, there is always the famous 'The heaventree of stars hung with humid nightblue fruit', quite possibly one of the most gorgeous sentences written by man.Another interesting technique Joyce uses is his willingness to deny the luxury of perfect sentence structure or grammar to better convey the mood of the characters, or to greater achieve those wonderful sentences. He merges words, removes words, adds words, mirrors sentences within themselves, juxtaposes letters, words, paragraphs, all in an effort to create passages of absolute delight. Tens of pages will fly by, each one filled with wit, insight, beauty, depth. At times, it is safer to simply let go and trust that Joyce knows what he is doing, that you will be taken where you should go.However. This book can be very difficult, as I said above. Fifty pages of dense, verbose prose with little to no indication of what is happening, who it is happening to, or what sort of reference can be applied so as to make sense of it in the greater scheme of the novel, is common. These parts can be tricky to get through, but I strongly advise you to continue. Happily, the first few chapters are very easy, and very beautiful. It is only around the 210 page mark that Joyce ramps up the difficulty, which culminates in the Wandering Rocks and Siren chapters. But bear with it, and enjoy it for what it is.In the end - and I hope I have made this clear - the novel is a difficult one, requiring a lengthy time commitment, but in the end, the efforts are more than rewarded. Having just turned the last page, closed the book and put it aside, I am itching to take it up again, to follow Bloom and Dedalus once more through their beautiful, wonderful day."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I bought theUlysses (Gabler Edition)edition of this book recently as we were reading Ulysses as part of an online book club. The advantage of that edition is that it is popular edition and also has line numberings so that as part of a group you can immediately locate a piece of text.Then I discovered that you could get a free Kindle edition, so I downloaded the free Kindle for computer app from Amazon, and got this edition. Later I bought a Kindle.I am somewhat surprised at the one star reviews of a free product, the leading one of which is based on a flawed premise, lack of comparison to an actual published text.This reviewer does not compare the Kindle text with an actual book. She bases her one star review on a google line search, finding inconsistencies and saysUlysses Annotated: Notes for James Joyce's Ulysses [Revised and Expanded Edition] is different. Ulysses annotated is not Ulysses the book, it is a reference book about Ulysse, and if you imagine it, it operates like a phrase dictionary and explains the references and allusions in the book, but it is not the book. She bases her one star review on a google line search, not a direct comparison with an actual copy of the book, and comparison with an entirely different book. Really?I have compared this with the Gabler and picked 20 lines at random from the book, and then searched the Kindle edition, and read the surrounding passages. Except for one case in the Gabler edition which has musical notation and lyrics to a song the text was 100% the same.Obviously, there will be inconsistencies between versions of a book that has many editions. That does not mean that just because this edition is free and has minor inconsistencies it is worse than other editions. Nor does it mean that large amounts of text have been deleted because it's free. No, it's based on an actual text. In fact Joyce edited and added bits and pieces to the text over the years much to the chagrin and frustration of his publishers, so you can expect minor variations between editions, yet they may be 95-99% similar.In fact, there are certain advantages to having the Kindle edition. If you have ever read a book and you are trying to remember something about a character, you can type in the characters name, and you will immediately get all the references in the book. If there is a word you do not understand fully, by pressing a button you can immediately get the full meaning of the word. You can check for popular highlights, and it willl tell you how many people have highlighted which passage. For example \\"Ineluctable modality of the visible.\\"There are certain passages that no dictionary will help you with, and that is why you may need a companion book, such as Ulysses annotated, which explains the many allusions, whether to Latin, parallels with the Bible, with the Odyssey which this story loosely parallels, to Latin, British Rule, historical context, local maps, Hamlet, mythical search for the missing father, Shakespeare and the Bible.The further you get into this book the better it gets.At once this book is inpiring yet challenging, sometimes perplexing yet ultimately rewarding. Full of inventive wordplay that sometimes defies instant comprehension. I have read entire pages that turn out to be word salad at first. Every chapter has a different narrative style, such as inner monologue, narcissistic, catechism, stream of consciousness. Sometimes this book is brutal to read, sometimes a joy. I can understand why this book is so influential, and the words nibble at the edge of your consciousness forcing your mind to expand itself. This book has changed the way I think about writing, as I have never seen som many different narrative devices used in a single book before. The final chapter with Molly Bloom in bed, with its runon sentences is simply hilarious.I encourage you to get this edition. Why not? It's free. Free to buy. Free to read. Free to enjoy. The Kindle format gives you advantages over people who have read it in the past, and offers interesting, new, and quicker ways of navigating the text.And you can go get free online chapter summaries of chapters to speed your comprehension.I hope you found this review helpful."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Looking at the sample chapters of the 99c MobileReference edition, I notice an entire missing paragraph (after \\"and chanted:\\").

But if you throw aside your expectations of what makes a book great and just read the words as you would the people, places, sights and sounds that trigger your thoughts during the course of a normal day, then you will be amazed.In Ulysses, James Joyce uses his superhuman vocabulary and literary knowledge to relate a day in the life of a couple Irishmen (Stephen Dedalus and his friend, Leopold Bloom) and the people with whom they interact. Joyce's words are abnormally sophisticated, yet one never gets the feeling he is simply showing off. While his writing style is often referred to as stream-of-consciousness, it is clear that every word is appropriately placed and deeply thought out. As Ulysses meanders along through its day, the objects that enter the periphery of the protagonists triggers emotions and thoughts that lead to: poems, songs, theological and political discussions, laughing, shouting, incoherent noises, etc. The novel ranges from sublime to aggravating, but that is only because it is so true to its form. How many times in a normal day, if we were to stop and ruminate upon what we were just thinking, would we then think, &quot;What was that?&quot; But then it's quickly on to the next interaction destined to spark different emotions, thoughts, ideas, etc...It is impossible to sum this book up. It follows no plot or pattern other than that it is simply 1 day. A few people... 1 day.Reading this book reminded me at times of the Simpsons episode where Homer is seen watching an episode of David Lynch's Twin Peaks. &quot;Brilliant!&quot; Homer remarks, but then quietly to himself, &quot;I have no idea what is going on here.&quot; While I often found myself in Homer's predicament while reading Ulysses, I was always able to appreciate Joyce's writing, even if the individual words were all I understood. For that reason, I plan on reading this book again several years from now to see what life has taught me that might expand my understanding of Joyce's beautiful day."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Superbly read, clear and at a rate which allows you to read along with the recording and take in the meaning very well, even if you may have to pause a few times to make sure you get every penis allusion...The notes in the boxset are a gem as well, clearing outlining the plot and what each track on the cd will be discussing briefly. Very well produced, even to the extent of reversing the audio in Circe where 'The Voice Of All the Damned' proclaims the mighty: Htengier Tnetopinmo Dog Drol eht rof, Aiulella!Music tracks introduce each section, with songs appropriately chosen for the episode. To hear the Dublin voices aloud is superb and increases the understanding and humour gained from this great work of literature. Heartly recommended from this shout in the street."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"ULYSSES is one of the most widely discussed, debated, and disputed literary masterpieces of all time, yet surprisingly few of those who discuss it have actually read the book. Reasons range from sloth to intimidation to a flat-out lack of interest. It is important to have some basic knowledge of the premise of ULYSSES prior to reading it; two things are particularly critical to be aware of:1. ULYSSES is an allegory for Homer's ODYSSEY. The whole thing.2. All of the events of the novel span fewer than 24 hours.Trust me, knowing those two things makes ULYSSES make a whole lot more sense.Since ULYSSES is a notoriously difficult read, its readers have come up with various means by which to approach the novel. Different things work for different people, but what follows is my version of a \\"Reader's guide to ULYSSES\\":1. This one is critical: read James Joyce's A PORTRAIT OF THE ARTIST AS A YOUNG MAN before ULYSSES. Not only does the former serve as a sort of primer for the latter, but A PORTRAIT introduces Stephen Dedalus, a key character in ULYSSES. Many of the events and circumstances of A PORTRAIT are referred to in ULYSSES, and Joyce will by no means spoon-feed you the connections.Supplemental pre-ULYSSES reading includes Homer's THE ODYSSEY and Joyce's DUBLINERS.2. Remember: this is supposed to be a funny book. If events seem absurd, disgusting, or nonsensical, there's certainly a reason.3. Take... your... time. I spent six weeks reading ULYSSES, and sometimes would spend up to five minutes on one page if I was confused or spacing out. This novel is, frankly, dense enough to sink in a pool of mercury. You aren't going to understand every pun, cultural allusion, or plot point even. Accept it: spend as long as you need, infer whatever you can, try your best, don't get frustrated.4. Do NOT give up! I read this as a 17-year-old; this is NOT an unreadable book! It is a very tough read, but not impossible. If you don't ever abandon ULYSSES, you're bound to finish it. Chapters are long; if you're burning out in the middle of one, just finish the next paragraph, stick your bookmark between the pages, and put ULYSSES on your nightstand for a while.All told, this is one of the greatest and most rewarding novels ever written. Give it a chance, prepare as suits you best, and have a nice read!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This is certainly one of the most important audiobook performances available. Whether you have already read this masterpiece or you are beginning to study it, you will gain immeasurably from these narrators' idiomatic diction and narrative fluency.

No matter where you are coming from in relation to Ulysses, this reading will dramatically increase your appreciation for it."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Note: This is a PAPERBACK recreation of the 1st edition.It's a decent looking facsimile of the original (i.e. 1st) Edition of Ulysses as published by Shakespeare & Co. in 1922. It contains the original, uncorrected text, page for page, precisely as it appeared in the original run. It's regular stock paper, bound and glued into a heavy-stock, glossy paper cover.It lacks any explanatory notes. It's really only useful for someone who wants to read it exactly as it originally appeared (thought not as Joyce intended it) but doesn't want to spend too much money.If you're reading this for the first time I suggest the Oxford 1922 re-print. It has some decent notes in the back of the book to help get you through the tricky bits (namely all of it) and also includes notes showing the Gabler corrections.

It is also one of the most astonishingly beautiful books I have ever read. Certainly, reading this novel is not for the uninitiated or the faint of heart. But it's also not for those who believe they can understand everything in this book.Certainly a ton has been written on this site about the plot so I'll skip that and just give my suggestions about how to go about reading this behemoth. Find a website that gives you a chapter by chapter summary (wikipedia is not particularly good because the analysis is simply too short). Read the summary of every chapter before you read the chapter and once again after you finish reading the chapter. Also, keep a dictionary handy. James Joyce has the largest vocabulary of any writer I have ever read. I found that this method was sufficient for me to be able to understand a great portion of the book. If I had tried to use an annotated guide, I feel like I would have spent too much time looking at every reference and ultimately given up on the book out of sheer boredom. Literature is meant to be enjoyed and appreciated, so unless you are planning on teaching the book to others, read the book without an annotated guide.For those that are willing to abandon all hope of complete understanding and enter Ulysses, I think the experience is actually quite rewarding. The writing is top-notch, the humor incredibly funny, and the drama incredibly moving. James Joyce said more with this book than I believe has even been said about the human condition in any other book (his only rival being William Shakespeare). It is a work of absolute genius, the kind of book that even the best writers can merely kowtow to in reverence. Its triumph will probably never be equalled and for that reason, it is worth the challenge."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I would not recommend this audio version as a substitute to the text, but as a very valuable augmentation. To get the most out of the Ulysses experience, one must employ all senses. Joyce's masterpiece is filled with the music of his own unique language. Reading the text without hearing it is tantamount to reading an opera. Hearing Ulysses read aloud by Donal Donnelly is like hearing that same opera performed by Caruso. The Sirens episode, in particular, is incomplete until it is given a voice. The text of Ulysses is frequently challenging as it drifts, without warning, between styles, languages, and points of view, but Donnelly navigates through Joyce's maelstrom with a confident hand firmly on the tiller. I can listen to these discs over and over the way I would my favorite music, and each time I hear something I missed before or make sense out of something that I didn't understand earlier. An audio companion to the text of Ulysses is invaluable, and I very highly recommend this particular version."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I'm reading Ulysses and concurrently listening to audio CD's of a seminar on the novel by Professor James Hefferman produced by The Teaching Company.

There is no critical annotation or introduction, so you may consider buying a companion guide or annotation to accompany it (but be skeptical, many published books about Ulysses are misinformed or incomplete). All in all, if you're going to embark on reading Ulysses, you want this edition."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"\\"Ulysses\\" by James Joyce (1934) is a novel about the interaction of social responsibility and personal desires. It focuses primarily on three characters: Stephen Dedalus a self-absorbed scholar attempting to find his artistic voice, Leopold Bloom who tries to meet his social responsibilities in a culture that is not completely accepting of him, and Molly Bloom (Poldy's wife) who struggles with her feminine destiny.The novel parallels the structure of Homer's \\"Odyssey\\" that chronicles the 10 year struggle of Odysseus to return from war in Troy to his home in Ithaca. Ulysses, the Latin translation of the Greek name Odysseus, is Leopold (Poldy) Bloom who travels the streets of Dublin one Thursday on June 16, 1904. His goal is to accomplish his daily task of meeting his family's economic needs, forming social alliances with Dubliners (including Stephen), and satisfying his own drives for understanding and fulfillment. Odysseus sought to reunite with his wife and assess her fidelity in his absence, and Bloom looks forward to the end of the day when he returns to his home at 7 Eccles Street, concerned about his wife's unfaithfulness.\\"Ulysses\\" is remarkable in its descriptive detail of the physical and psychological environments of Dublin and its characters. The feelings related to immersion in the living Irish city are so strong that there may be some irrational fear of being unable to return to current life. The entrance into the reality of the lives of Stephen, Molly, and Poldy is uncanny as readers become physically and psychically connected to characters. It is a matter of proximity. You lose your own personality as you accompany these people when they converse, walk the streets, visit stores, drink and philosophize, reveal themselves in stream of consciousness monologues, argue, pursue bacchanalian extremes, and have private battles with loss and melancholy.The reader \`sees' everything that day, the external locations and the inner worlds of the characters, with the \\"ineluctable modality of the visible.\\" This is the direct and complete experience of Joyce's art without the restriction of our own frame of reference, history, obligations, and wants. It is intimidating to realize that your own life is changing, that part of your personal history now contains a new day of your own existence - you have extended your life for a day. Many people throughout the world celebrate a second birthday on June 16 (Bloomsday).After publication of \\"Ulysses,\\" I believe that James Joyce (like a few other artists) spent the rest of his life amazed at his creation. As he lay dying in hospital waiting for his wife to return to his bedside, he had to wonder where his inspiration originated, where he summoned the ability to give the gift of another day of life to us all.The reader can benefit most from \\"Ulysses\\" by preparing to read it. Read (re-read) Homers \\"Odyssey.\\" Pay close attention to the structure, the symbolic content, and the psychology of Odysseus. Odysseus was a flawed hero, externally brave but also self-serving and blind to parts of his own personality (like Bloom). Use \\"Ulysses Annotated\\" by Don Gifford to help guide you through the detail of theology, philosophy, psychology, history, rhetoric, and the physical layout of Dublin. This reference work is very good because it allows readers to have their own experiences by providing only supplementary content (facts) that help to understand the myriad allusions presented in the text. I suggest that you enjoy the many beautiful styles of prose presented in the 18 episodes pausing to quickly glance at the definitions in your opened copy of \\"Ulysses Annotated.\\" Then before reading the next episode, go back and read the complete explanatory entries in this reference book. Give yourself a couple of months to enjoy the novel and add this new day to your life."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Notwithstanding disputes on the editorial choices, the main reason to get this particular edition is the fact that the guide by Don Gifford makes reference to its line numbering. The Gifford book is an indispensable companion to Ulysses. However, the large format, relatively small print and miserable binding are deplorable. Once you get to Molly's monologue, you almost have to detach the pages one after the other. Maybe not so great for the inescapable rereading of this masterwork!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"It's great fun to observe the rancorous--at times vicious--debate this book has engendered among and between its admirers and detractors. Whatever else might be said of &quot;Ulysses,&quot; it's clear that everyone who has read it (and even those who have not) has an opinion about it. But for those who are leery of beginning a book of this size and complexity without some guarantee that it is as &quot;GREAT&quot; as its admirers proclaim it to be, I offer these words of advice: take it slowly, don't get overly bogged down by the unorthodox style, and make a diligent effort to understand what Joyce is trying to say. It's easy to treat his ramblings as the workings of a drunk or inscrutable genius, and to &quot;force&quot; one's way through the book without getting anything out of it. I read &quot;Ulysses&quot; for the first time last summer, without annotations and with only a brief on-line summary of each chapter as my guide, and I'm sure I missed an awful lot. But I loved &quot;Ulysses&quot; nonetheless. The inventive style, the devious puns, the poetic prose--all of it amounts to a reading experience that will reward the patient and persistent with a tremendous intellectual and aesthetic (if not emotional) payoff. While it is not my favorite book of all time, I agree with those who say it's the most important novel of the twentieth-century. It so completely altered the literary landscape of its day that, 80 years after its publication, its effects are still being felt (but not always acknowledged) in the works of contemporary writers.If you want to read this book only because you've been told it was &quot;great&quot; or to tell others you read it (and thus sound &quot;intelligent&quot;), pick up the Cliffs Notes and save yourself some time. If you honestly want to understand *why* this book is frequently cited as the best of the twentieth century, dig in. I plan to revisit &quot;Ulysses&quot; myself in the not-so-distant future."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Having read Joyce's Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man and also Dubliners, I decided last summer to tackle his novel Ulysses, to which several literary associations have deemed the greatest twentieth century novel. Today's sophisticated younger reader may ponder the accolades professors and scholars have showered upon a novel that rambles for well over 700 pages, but there are significant reasons that I would like to briefly elucidate.First, as many have pointed out this is a book of language, and specifically one that attempts to import all of English lexicon in order to examine where its vocabulary leads us and where we ultimately run up against road blocks. This monumental task had never been accomplished in the English language since the likes of Shakespeare and Chaucer.Second, this is a novel of experimentation. A 19th century staple, the novel was overdue for an update that would capture the complexities and anxieties of the 20th century. For too long, the novel reflected a mathematical plot line divided evenly into clear physical events, which, frankly, failed to detail the organics of human thought and development. Ulysses does the unthinkable: Our thoughts and actions cannot be explained away by chronology;there is a real-time universal presence to them, as some would later read in Faulkner's works.Third, there is an authentic examination of the individual. Reading his biography and Ireland's history, Joyce repeatedly hammers home the colossal battle between individuality and social conformity. In Ulysses, outside forces such as the Catholic church, parents, ignorance, politics, and peers attempt to squelch the voice of the individual by attempting to dictate what happiness and contentment are. It is through allusions to the mythological story of the Odyssey that our most heroic feat today is learning how our voice can Bloom in a world that too often expects us to conform.Fourth, it is an honest, realistic story about life in general. Whether we want to admit it, much of life is spent within ourselves, as Joyce unearths through the three characters' streams of consciousness. We do talk to ourselves; our thoughts are random, not linear; we scrutinize ourselves hoping to make connections among scraps of thoughts that only we and God have access to. No novelist up to this point had created what amounted to a confessional that was unafraid of society's taboos and mores. Where else could a young modern reader, for example, read about a character's sexual acts in unadorned detail?Finally, contrary to what critics have stated--i.e. several novelists of Joyce's age called the work a mess--there is a compelling story. At the time of its publication, virulent anti-semitism consumed not only colonized Ireland but the rest of the world. So enters our modern day Ulysses, Bloom, a baptized Jew who exhibits the attributes of Christ but is condemned by his society for alleged ancestral sins. And then there is poor Stephen, whose triumphant announcement to the world that he is an artist contrasts sharply with his doldrum existence, refusing to pray for his dying mother, rejecting his largely absent father, and holding a teaching position that is less than inspiring.There's Molly, a singer by trade who is blazed into sleeping with a talent agent so that she can further her career and can also help provide for Bloom when money is tight. Molly and Bloom may be jovial in name, but underneath is the tragic loss of their infant son who managed to live only eleven days. To me, this is an unflinching look at real life. And yet, epiphanies still happen, and new friendships such as what Stephen and Bloom display provide us with what really matters most: love and acceptance. Bloom is the father who unconditionally accepts Stephen, and Stephen is the son Bloom has dreamed of since Stephen clearly needs guidance.Many readers have pointed out that the traditional literary community has hailed Ulysses as the seminal novel of the twentieth century, and, therefore, today's reader must adhere to its proclamation. If Joyce were alive, I think he would be appalled simply because freedom of expression was his guiding principle. Joyce's main point is that the path toward freedom is not merely a straight line or even a winding one; rather, it is a confluence of thoughts, feelings, and relationships that eventually crystallize into an overarching personal epiphany. Ulysses certainly is a challenge, but then again so is life. Each day is worth a seven hundred page book--Joyce's merit is that he actually proved it."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Many scenes stick in one's mind forever, for example when Leopold Bloom releases his bowels or when the coffin falls on the road. I finally came to understand the stream-of-consciousness technique and realized it's not Joyce's stream we're wading in but the carefully reproduced stream of the character's consciousness. I found this particularly effective and fun reading of Stephen Dedalus's morning at school. Other scenes like Molly Bloom's grand finale are simply beautiful and literally breathless, especially if you take punctuation as a breathing signal.And I'm especially glad to read it now that I live in Dublin. I've lived in Ringsend three months, I've visited a friend in Mullingar, and I've shopped at Buckley's butcher shop, all of which are mentioned in Ulysses. I even bought my copy of the book at the Martello tower featured at the start of the novel.But overall, one feels Ulysses is somewhat contrived. Crucify this humble critic if you will, but reproducing the structure of the Odyssey is a clever but artificial way of bringing epic grandeur to what is nothing more than a very ordinary day. Why go through all that trouble? I do agree with the lesson but find it rather long winded. In painting, a still life by Chardin is as realistic as an imperial coronation scene by David, but with much less fuss.And then there are the inside jokes. References to Walt Whitman and to Edgar Allen Poe (which I got only because I remembered Tom Hanks reciting Poe's \\"To Helen\\" in The Ladykillers) and other writers abound. Shouldn't a great work stand on its own, at least where its intended audience is concerned? Ulysses fails utterly in this respect unless we restrict the audience to academics.Vincent Poirier, Dublin"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I can say without reservation that this is the most amazing book I have ever read in my life. It sparkles with emotion and visceral force, thrusting you so deeply into the lives of its main characters that the medium between the reader and the protagonists is completely penetrated and we quite simply become the characters. Asking such questions as \\"well what would have happened if Bloom had decided to do this\\" is meaningless because we know Bloom so well that it is impossible to conceive him doing anything other than as he does it. We are privy to his innermost passions and longings: in the Circe episode we too forlornly cry out to the apparition of his dead son Rudy, his destroyed hope for the honor of his name, his heritage, and his love. In the Wandering Rocks we feel Steven's pain as he is approached by his rag-clad sister begging him for food:\\"She is drowning. Agenbite. Save her. Agenbite. All against us. She will drown me with her, eyes and hair. Lank coils of seaweed hair around me, my heart, my soul. Salt green death.\\"While some see the parellels to Homer as unnecessary pretentious obscurity, by recreating the Odyssey in turn-of-the-century-Dublin Joyce shows us that all of the heroic epics and action movies in the world are as shallow and meaningless filth before the only true glorious quest, that presented to us in the living of our lives each day.The Homeric parallel also underlies another of Joyce's major aims in the work, that of preserving what has come before. Stephen, the book's other main character, is an autobiographical University student obsessed with the great works of Western literature. Both his thought-stream and his conversations with other characters are rife with allusions to great literature from the ancient Greeks through St. Augustine (the Catholic Church is also very important), Dante, Shakespeare, Milton, Flaubert, and even Oscar Wilde. These many allusions are often seen as a reason not to read the book, but I can affirm that while one does lose something by missing them, the book reads quite well without them and often one can determine the significance of the allusion from the context without knowing its source.Essentially Joyce has taken everything that has come before and combined it into a stunning novel that I feel puts him solidly beside Shakespeare as a true master of the English language. Of course when we say the English language that is up to some debate because, like Shakespeare, Joyce in no way feels bound to correct grammar and is quite willing to sacrifice it whenever he feels it hampers his expression.Yes parts of it are difficult, but not so difficult that one shouldn't attempt the book because of them. I have a dirty suspicion that a lot of the reputed difficulty of this book stems from the exaggerations of those who have read it and want to look smart. You will have to do a little background research, and I strongly advise Reading Joyce's other two books, Dubliners and A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, so that you know the setting and the people. But that said, go for it! It is more than worth the reward of a little patience at the beginning. Also Harry Blamires' New Bloomsday Book and Anthony Burgess's Re Joyce are wonderful supplements to help clear up some of the initial uncertainty.The book took me almost a year to get through, reading several of the episodes more than once, but coming away from it I absolutely confirm that it was COMPLETELY WORTH IT!!! READ THIS BOOK!!!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Right. Ulysses. The intellectual field of Joycewrit contains more essays, papers, doctoral theses, and professional articles than most libraries contain books. So much has been written about this book that I usually have to step back and laugh when contemplating the enormity. It is like fathoming the universal end when you are a child of ten.With that said, I do believe I have something to contribute to *this* forum. I can tell you what this book is. It is perhaps the best and most complete example of written reality in existence. If the world exists in a grain of sand, then it exists in a day full of sand many times.What I mean is that the book works on any level. At a closely read level one can find absurdly esoteric references to minutiae that only has relevance for June 16, 1904. The esoterica works, though. By making something obscure that is in essence very simple, Joyce makes one think about it in a new way. Look at Chapter 17 remembering that Joyce's goal is to make the simple obscure. Then ask yourself what happens over the course of the chapter. Never has less accomplished more. Ithaca (ch. 17), by the way, was Joyce's favourite chapter.At a broader level Joyce's expressive mechanism becomes clear and truly rises above any intellectualization. Perhaps you should not worry too much about that passage of Italian shouted in the street, or the odd bit of vaudevillian obscurity. Instead look at the scope and breadth of a single day and the myriad thoughts that pass through your mind. Could someone decipher your day from your thoughts with ease? And as in a real day, as in reality, a man's life is not so simple to pick apart as a speech in a novel may lead you to believe. A simple bit of dialogue spoken to a boaster may reveal a great amount:&quot;Force, hatred, history, all that. That's not life for men and women, insult and hatred. And everybody knows that it's the opposite of that that is really life.-- What? Says Alf.-- Love, says Bloom. I mean the opposite of hatred.&quot;And that, I am glad to say, is all we get."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Joyce's Ulysses has been called a lot of things, most of them not flattering. I think the reason most people don't like Ulysses is that is is unlike any other novel, and cannot be treated as 'ordinary.'This day in the life of Leopold Bloom holds everything from insights into the nature of existence, opinions ranging from useful to mundane, and observations on, well, everything. Joyce manages to write a book which leads us through the minds of several characters as they live an ordinary, utterly unspectacular day. This technique is certainly unique, and utterly defines the concept of literary realism.To appreciate this book is to take it on its own terms. To gloss over the passages in which Leopold is daydreaming about triffles (as he does, as we all do. And that is the point.) does not hurt the reader in terms of understanding the plot. You don't so much as read this novel, as much as experience it. The reader is intended to be bored when Leopold is bored, excited when he is, and vaguely aware in-between. As one reviewer pointed out, the book is best understood when read aloud. I'm not sure if this is by design or simply because of Joyce's lyrical prose, but it's a good strategy especially in the tough passages.In all respects a classic, even if difficult at times. Influenced nearly everything else after it. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Some people like to go for a stroll on the beach. Others like to climb Mount Everest. Reading Ulysses is much more like the latter than the former.I have now read this book four times. I must really be a glutton for punishment.Actually, the rereading is quite rewarding. When I first read the book in my youth, the only edition available was the one with all the printer's errors in it. Those errors made a difficult novel, much more so. So I found that my understanding and appreciation rose substantially when I could read the original version.As I grew older, I realized that I had had more experiences, read more books, and thought more thoughts. That meant that I found new layers of meaning in Ulysses.I plan to keep rereading this book on a regular basis for the rest of my life. I hope you find it this engrossing as well.What initially attracted me to the book was Joyce's ability to capture the inner dialogue that we all have. We alternate between thinking like angels and the basest animals. Joyce not only unveiled and portrayed that quality, he also imbued it with an elegance of expression that certainly exceeds my wit. It is almost as though an intellectual, well-educated literary comedian is invited along to make witnessing the internal dialogue more interesting.Of even greater significance is the reaction that many have to the novel. They simply do not want to plumb into someone else's mind, unless perhaps it is the mind of a saint. But who knows what a saint really thinks?The title, of course, is a dead giveaway (that few will need) that there are a literary analogy and symbolism involved. Those implications are enough to keep several Ph.D.'s busy for a career.Mr. Joyce was a most learned and observant man. What remarkable things must have gone on inside of his mind!If you are interested in extending your own ability to understand what is going on around you, I recommend Ulysses as a way to fill in the backdrop of what is not said when you are with others.If you are more than satisfied with surface reality, then by all means skip this book. You'll wonder what all the fuss is about.Perhaps the only exception to the latter is someone who loves a musical turn of phrasing, something Joyce excels in.Enjoy your journey!If you are like me, you'll find that it makes sense to keep your copy on the night table. You never know when you'll be ready for another trip to 1904."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"All the above reviews involve one person reading Ulysses in private, sometimes with help from notes and critics. This was a wildly new way of writing a book, so perhaps it calls for a wildly new way of reading it? I'm in an amateur group in Seattle that reads it together and does a staged reading of chapter a year of Ulysses. Our performances are free so this isn't a promotion! Many of the difficult things about the book are avoided with this method.....for example, it often seems obvious that voices are changing, and that becomes much clearer when one can hear the voices change. This includes jumps between different types of internal thoughts, or different literary styles. Also, the characters seem more real and easier to like when you can hear their voices. Plus, if something seems incomprehensible, you can't stop and perseverate about it during the actual performance.We spend several months reading together and listening to Joyce's prose and thinking about the different voices we hear in it, and researching the bits we don't understand, including esoteric references and pronunciations and mysteries. Then, on Bloomsday each year, the annual celebration of Joyce, but especially Ulysses, we read that chapter in public. The program includes that chapter's key features, a synopsis of the action, the analogy with the Odyssey, the symbols in Joyce's schema and the three or four most important of the intertwining themes within the chapter, and how that chapter relates to the rest of the book. People can bring along their copy of the book and read along.This is why Bloomsday was invented and is the best way to begin to appreciate Ulysses. Well, maybe I'm wrong. Perhaps Joyce meant us to struggle, as one other reviewer suggested, to recreate the travails of Odysseus and Bloom in our own minds as we try to understand this book with no help. BUT maybe he actually meant us to read it very slowly and thoughfully, relishing every turn of phrase, every comic and poignant moment and discussing all of the book's references, analogies and puzzles. Perhaps to overthrow the imperialism of English literature which includes telling us how a book should be read!?"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"When I landed in Dublin a couple of years ago and the immigration officer at the airport asked me the purpose of my visit, I told him, \\"James Joyce pilgrimage.\\" He was bemused. \\"James Joyce?\\" he said. \\"You mean 'Ulysses'? That fella?\\" (This moment gave me my first lesson in genuine Irish pronunciation. The Irish pronounce the title of Joyce's great novel with an emphasis on the first syllable: 'YOO-liseez') I answered his questions affirmatively; he examined my passport, studied my face and said, \\"That's a hard book. Have you read 'Ulysses'?\\" I raised my eyebrows in surprise at the question and asked, \\"Will you kick me out of the country if I say no?\\" The immigration officer, still holding my passport, replied, \\"That's a distinct possibility, sir.\\" \\"Then yes,\\" I said, \\"yes, I've read it many times, yes.\\" He returned the passport and waved me through, saying, \\"Enjoy it anyway.\\"I actually have read this book six or seven times by now. When I first read it I was Stephen's age, and now I'm the same age as Bloom. As I have changed over the years, so has my understanding of the book. I still consider 'Ulysses' the greatest novel of the twentieth century, but I can now better appreciate its weaknesses. The \\"Oxen of the Sun\\" and \\"Eumaeus\\" chapters are tedious (the former, in fact, is a failure), but the book's many high points greatly outweigh its faults. And, by the way, it's a COMIC novel, and don't let the professors tell you different."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"James Joyce is a genius. Let's all say it together, loud and proud. Maybe he is so much of a genius that he has created in a novel, Ulysses, a work that is so far above anyone's heads that since the majority of the reading public doesn't understand, well then, by God, it must be supernova brilliant. Was it just me? Did my intellectual shortcomings not allow me to truly enjoy this work that makes everyone's top 10 books of the century list? Or was Joyce just playing around? A writer with mastery of the language decided to fool around a little and release a novel that is an exercise in experimentation on what you can do with language but nothing really more. To harbor my fragile intellectual ego, that's the theory I'm going with. Greatest book of all time or not, I just didn't get it.This book is supposed to be about Leopold Bloom and Stephen Dedalus and a day in the life of Dublin in 1904. I really had to read the other reviews or cliff notes to be able to discern what happens on that day despite reading the book thoroughly. I know I sure didn't get it from the book. If cryptic meaning, having to read other books so you understand the book you're reading, and spending months slogging through a book is what your looking for in a read, by all means tackle Ulysses. Should we have to labor so hard to enjoy a book? I don't think so. The unique language and wordplay stand out above the rest of the white noise fray making this book redeemable, like a 783 page poem with no plot, if you can imagine enduring something like that.Maybe Joyce, from an Irish heaven, 70 year later is having the last laugh, as the intellectual world hails his &quot;playing around&quot; as THE modern masterpiece. Maybe it takes an English Literary Doctorate and many years to get enjoyment out of this book. I don't have either though, so the enjoyment wasn't there. Joy is the reason I read.

Somebody must've been in a big hurry."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This book is a mystery and a masterpiece. The first time I read it, it was almost a quest of sorts. I had to find something to pass the time during a particularly tedious job that required me to wait against my will every evening for at least one hour. Bit by bit, I proceeded through the text, and found myself entranced and lost in the language. I was a writer at the time, and the attention to detail fascinated me. It also showed me how much I had to learn about language and lyricism. I have reread the book again and again, some sections more than others, and still love it. Every bit. Profane? Hardly. But it has its moments, even by modern standards. Still, the idea of creating such a thing is a thing to be admired."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"When I informed a co-worker of my intention to read Ulysses, he replied that his grandmother had read it (as it used to be requisite reading) and pronounced it, \\"300,000 words about a man crossing the street\\". That is the sort of dismissal about classical literature that makes me doubly determined to dive in.Much to my dismay, Ulysses turned out to be 300,000 words about a man crossing the street. Yes, the language is beautiful. Yes, the classical allusions are thought-provoking and on-point. Yes, there is a good deal of lewd behavior and avarice to carry the reader along. Unfortunately Ulysses reminded me why no one writes classical literature any more; its unecessary and outdated verbosity went the way of the Dodo long ago.When I finally reached Molly's narrative I felt like I was a drowning man finally coming up for air, and when I completed the last line I felt I could finally breathe deep. It's not that Ulysses is unreadable; only that there is little reason to read it in its entirety. Find someone who has edited out everything but the dirty jokes and famously coined phrases in their context and read their edition instead. You'll save yourself 40+ hours."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I was intimidated at the bulk of ULYSSES, I must admit. But i found myself shocked by it's radiating brilliance. The book is a labor to read, one often has to re-read a paragraph or (god forbid) a chapter to allow the work to truly flow and make sense. Joyce uses beautiful detailed writing of the human mind, all of our peculiar little idiosyncracies and actions that define us as human beings.The greatest feat I've had in my young life is reading the last page and closing the book. You sit back and for hours are confounded as to the brilliance and success of Joyce to write the actions of two characters in a day. Each thought, each subconscious connection and little bits of thinking and reacting are somehow branded into the pages of ULYSSES. I dont think i will ever read such a significant work again. It is bold, it is at times monotonous, at times incoherent, but there are some golden pages were you are sucked into the writing, for the words on the page are your thoughts, your fantasies, your raw human nature.It took me a month to read the book, i read it in the midst of depression and suicidal thoughts. I was able to lose myself in ULYSSES, i was able to walk the streets with Dedalus and Bloom. I was able to sit on the beach and watch the dog sniff around for something he had lost in a past life time. It is a masterpiece while being imperfect, which is an awful lot like being a human being."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I don't want to elaborate on how hard this book can be to read (I think the other 75 reviews have covered that), but I will say that with Joyce you get out of it what you put into it. Those who love this book rave about its groundbreaking techniques &amp; virtuosity of language. Those who hate this book complain that it is nothing but Joyce showing off &amp; taunting his readers with a book that has no unity or point. This book DOES have a point. All the style in it is only used as means to an end. There are characters. There is conflict (there are several, but I believe the basic conflict is each character struggling with the reality their lives as opposed to what they want their lives to be). There is a climax (and what a climax it is). There is a resolution. This is, at heart, a very sad and haunting book. I think the message in this novel is that we are at the mercy of our lives (i.e. circumstances control us, not vice versa), and that the only way we can deal with the fact that we have no control over our lives is by fooling ourselves. It is a study of the contrast between what we think we are and what we really are. It is saying that the only way people deal with their biggest problems is by running away from them (note the way Leopold Bloom constantly avoids confronting or even thinking about his wife's adultery, and note the way Stephen Dedalus reacts when confronted by his mother; I could cite plenty of other examples). This may be the ultimate truth of life, that we can never face the truth about ourselves. Joyce never states this directly; it is left up to the reader to find for himself. I would be doing this book injustice if I didn't mention that it fleshes out 2 of the most three-dimensional, complete characters in all of literature.This isn't a perfect book: the climax takes place about 200 pages before it ends. I also thought the last chapter, which is probably the most-praised chapter in the book, was disappointing. Joyce apparently tried to create a complete picture of a female character in about 50 pages, when it had taken him 700 pages to create 2 complete pictures of male characters. It threw off the pace of the novel to suddenly get inside the head of a completely different person. Ithaca could have easily been the last chapter, as it summed up all the day's events as opposed to going on to something totally different (which is what the last chapter did).Still, the characters, the themes, and the sheer scope of Ulysses make it as close to perfect as any book can be."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I loved Don Quixote, still the greatest of novels. (6 stars!) I loved The Brothers Karamazov, the greatest work of the greatest novelist who ever lived. (5 stars) For sheer reading pleasure Crime and Punishment beats anything I have ever come across.(5 stars) I enjoyed War and Peace, though to me it was a bit dated and didactic and not nearly as convincing and satisfying as DQ, BK or CP. (4 stars)But for some reason after three tries I can't get past page 20 of Ulysses. I find it boring, mannered and well nigh incomprehensible. If it wasn't for the fact that so many learned people say it is a masterpiece I would say Joyce is a fraud. (I read Potrait of the Artist as a Young Man but didn't think it very enjoyable or profound.)Why is it that I can enjoy so many other classic novels yet find Ulysses so repulsive?"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This review is limited to notes on formatting.There is a linked table of contents. All entries in the TOC are in all caps (which always bothers me). But you can jump to any point in the book just fine by following a link.The only other disturbing formatting feature is that there is a blank line between each paragraph in the body text. So with a space = (normal interline spacing + blank line + interline), there's quite a big gap between paragraphs.I think this is required because all the paragraphs are in block indent style (ie, they have 0 left indent on the first line). If you didn't have blank lines between paragraphs, you probably couldn't see the paragraph boundaries easily.Anyhow, there seems to be a LOT (ie, a bit too much) whitespace on each page. I wish they used a normal paragraph indent for the first line, and removed the blank lines between paragraphs."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"As for translations of Ulysses, let me tell my Italian friends that Joyce is often hilarious; hope that comes through. (Nel questo libro, Joyce sta scherzando spesso. Spero che suo traduttore non ha tradito, non ha persolo. Alcune delle battute sono stilistica, ma alcuni sono larghi, divertente. Ero un assistente educativo in scuola di specializzazione, e ha contribuito a insegnare in una classe Jocye di Prof Chester Anderson.)I was fortunate to encounter this book after a full, excellent college English major*, so as I read it at leisure during grad school summer, I found it very amusing in the grandest sense. Funny, too. This is a book that benefits from the reader having read most anthology English lit before s/he readsUlysses. Otherwise, one must dive for the footnotes.When one has read Dubliners and Portrait of the Artist, Ellman's Joyce is also delicious. For example, Joyce received a better grade on his Italian exam than on his English, in official grades when he was qualifying to teach English in Italy (especially Rome and Trieste). He barely qualified in English, but was well qualified in Italian. This gives me pause in an era when we're told that Testing, Testing is the way to improve US Public Ed. This tidbit alone, from Joyce's life, makes one severely doubt it.*Such a major does not even exist now: for example, all of Shakespeare's plays was the standard sophomore English major course, a full year, nineteen plays per semester."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"To hold a copy of the original production of ULYSSES is a pleasure.

To my mind, it's still the best way visually to read ULYSSES. We forget that when we read our eyes are made to dance with our minds, and to engage our heart in the dance...And Dover's unabridged edition of the original, as it was presented to the world, is a ballet!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The really awful side effect of Kindle is that we are subjected to terrible editions.

Ulysses is an amazing book when it comes to style. I can not think of a book that compares; in fact, Ulysses is many books, with each chapter written in a style that is best suited for it. I first read Ulysses when I was in graduate school, and was simply blown away by the sheer breadth and depth of Joyce's writing ability. The book influenced me dramatically: it freed me from the chains of accepted modes of written expression. I love the last chapter: not a SINGLE mark of punctuation. Maybe that's nothing new but back in the beginning of the century it was Totally Radical! But with this said, the story itself is very boring, the philosophic allusions inpenetrable and the supposedly comic elements totally unfunny.But for its stylistic brilliance and Joyce's courage/genius, I give it 10 of 10."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"James Joyce most of been a prankster.

It is the landmark that reaches into the pages of every novel written since, it is polymath.But it's a darned difficult read. Each chapter is written not just in a new form, but in a completely new style. It demands a shift in mindset as one progresses through the book. In some cases that shift is required from sentence to sentence, or indeed from word to word.It's not a novel for the casual reader. To get anything out of it, one must be experienced. The annotations do help, but a broad knowledge of international literature, and indeed international language would be a boon when working one's way through the time-honoured pages.Personally, I'd buy it just for the 'Ithaca' chapter. It's pure art (or science, in fact), and in my humble opinion an incredible achievement in anti-narrative that is unsurpassed.Enough sycophancy. Ulysses is glorious, and that is truth."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The last 200+ pages of this book were fantastic, including the night scenes in town. I have not read English poetry and therefore was lost for an earier 200 pages. Joyce's references to Parnell were interesting, as was the singular reference to U.S. Grant. Leopold Bloom is an example, I suppose, of the exception to the single mindedness of these Irish people. Dublin was a lovely city, however, clearly not diverse enough for Joyce. I liked this book for the exposure given me to the English language. Joyce was a master with the pen (as was Paul). Do I read Finnegan's Wake? How can I not?"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Only on my 3rd or 4th attempt did i settle down and finally read this book. I actually saw Joseph Strick's 1967 film recently and although only a fraction of the book makes it to the screen, i found it more informative than any 'guide' you care to buy to help you.The range of linguistic styles, the mindboggling clever plotting, the dazzling knowledge,the unbelievably human sexual passages and above all the spectacular humour are for me all the elements that make Ulysses the definitive vision of how words make up a story that can depict the our condition.All I can say is that I got to Ulysses having already worked my way through the later innovators of the century - Pynchon,Beckett, Gaddis,Coover,Burroughs etc etc and it turns out that almost everything they have said can be found in Ulysses, and Joyce is always more touching, more beautiful, and more anything-you-care-to-mention."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"A couple of months ago I wrote a review (below) of a very specific edition of Ulysses (the Modern Library hardcover version) complaining that the relevant Amazon page contained descriptive material misidentifying which version of the text the book contained (an important matter in this case, as anyone familiar with the Ulysses Wars will recognize!). Now I realize that the problem with Amazon's description of books with multiple editions (like Ulysses) goes far deeper than I initially realized, as my review seems to have been attached by Amazon to all sorts of different versions of Ulysses, rather than just the page for the specific edition I had set out to review. In fact, you really cannot tell from the Amazon page for a book like Ulysses which version is being discussed. So, be warned that Amazon's modus operandi can create sheer confusion for works that are published in multiple (varying) editions!My original review of Modern Library edition:Amazon's current webpage description creates the misleading impression that this (Modern Library hardcover) is the text as \\"corrected' by Gabler in the 1980s. However, the cover of the book seems to be clear that this is in fact the 1961 verson of the text. Gabler's edition has some supporters but also some vehement critics.

And Joyce's vocabulary isn't merely extensive, its obscure and often so archaic that most dictionaries weighing fewer than 20 lbs. don't contain the words he uses. Unless you're young, if you don't read a book sentence by sentence, understanding the meaning of most every word, you aren't really reading or absorbing it, and its a waste of time, which is sad, because Ulysses has been such an influential work. But ultimately who cares? I'm coming to the unfortunate conclusion that the work of almost every member of the Lost Generation is failing to stand the test of time. Its one thing to read these icons in your early 20s; its another when you're approaching 50. As you get older, you realize Fitzgerald's and Hemingway's novels are terribly dated; Gertrude Stein's theories about writing are infinitely more interesting than her writing itself; and guys like Dos Passos are irrelevant. Now Joyce. Like Pound, he's interesting in the abstract, I guess.

The point which Monsieur Camus was trying to communicate, I think, is that we should be somewhat happy for the passing of our lives, for it is when we are engaged in the most miseable of chores that we are most aware of time's pasage.I must conclude that Camus never read Joyce, for I am certain that if he had, he would have substituted \\"reading Joyce's Ulysses\\" for \\"waiting in line for theatre tickets.\\" This incoherent, gratuitously allusive, over-long monster of a novel is what English majors have canonized to prove to Engineers that they're smart too (and I write that as a not-too-bright Poli Sci major myself). In the interests of full disclosure, I admit that I have a special hate of this book: a sadist Yallie-Ellmanite English teacher of mine forced me to read it the summer before my senior year of high school.Ulysses has two great strengths. First, it steals the plot of the Odyssey in its entirety--thus, you're not really missing anything by not understanding it. Second, unlike other books in English, it does not discriminate--it it is equally incomprehensible to English and non-English speakers alike--little wonder that the touchy-feelies who dominate ivy league English departments love it so.Lemon soap; masturbate on the beach; stately, plump Buck Whocares?Sadly, though Ulysses is awful, Joyce was not without talent. One can see the glimmer of greatness--great lyrical streches of words, wonderful cadences here and there, etc. This book, however, is the literary equivalent of a Mondrian painting, it is the smug mocking of art(and in certain circles, those who dare to point this out are treated like the boy who observes that the emperor is not wearing clothes).

A novel must be Fun!?!?Blasphemy, to be sure, but even the most heady topics must be entertaining to read, enjoyable to read, fun to read. If not, the author has failed. Failed. Failed. Yes, even Failed.If the great selling point of a novel is \\"I finally got through it,\\" the author has failed. Find me one person who has both: a) actually finished reading Ulysses, and b) enjoyed every moment, and I'll show you a liar.Ulysses is a failed novel because Joyce was a bad writer (shown by his other works). And all the illerati who insist (as did Time magazine) that it was the best novel of the 20th century are simply trying to cover up their own shortcomings of character by trying to appear as that which they are not: literate and respectable.Art is not something you have to \\"get through.\\" It is not something you have to convince yourself and others that it exists in the form you behold.

I cringe at the memory and the heated discussion I had with the professor (a Joyce fanatic). Now as a librarian I decided to give it another attmept, trying to keep an open mind. I have to give Joyce points for being clever and kudos for verbosity. After struggling through it again, I had to ask myself what was the point? Most of the book strikes me as an attempt by the author to show how very clever he was with word play and analogy and practically every other literary devise under the sun.To me as a reader, literature requires something more than an exercise in erudition or diction. I may be in a distinct minority here, but I still dislike Joyce for inflicting such a circus upon readers."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Not being an English Literature major, nor an avid reader, I nevertheless decided to read the entire top 100 novels. I would start with the top novel, Ulysses. In that fashion, of reading the best novel first, I could excite myself, that is to kickstart myself, into reading quality material. Prior to this adventure, I mostly focused on the books I could understand, like calculus or structural engineering. Ulysses is far more complex than those references.To ask: Did I finish the book? I must say yes, times one point five. And I accomplished the feat in under three years. After a severe mental breakdown from trying to choke down the book in two bites, I started over after being half finished. I was sure that I had missed something in the first half, so I wanted to return and see what I missed. I searched hard, taking time to savor every word, often looking up words that I thought I may be misinterpreting, But to no avail. But I persisted.I made it through the chapter about Stephen Dedalus for the second time, and was encouraged that more exciting events were sure to surface.Then, through the second chapter about Bloom, I began to get very worried that I would just give up my quest for fine arts. But survived, realizing that I only had several hundred more pages to wade through, to the climax, and forthcoming literary rewards.So I finally approached the end of the novel, reaching the last chapter, paragraph, or sentence, whatever it may be considered, being that it was devoid of punctuation for nearly 100 pages. Apparently it was the authors form of providing the run-on thoughts of a mixed up middle-aged woman, in the middle of non-fulfilling acts of sleeping, half sleeping, dreaming, or other non-physical event.In conclusion, Don't read the book. Burn it hard. Do not let your children read the book---it will mutilate their brain cells.

I am glad I read it and finished it. If you want to read a book that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift! This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A gift to be cherished forever."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Having gotten through \\"Portrait of the Artist\\" and \\"Dubliners,\\" I can now say James Joyce has to be the most arrogant, overrated author EVER.

Without a plot, it's just a bunch of random thoughts thrown at the wall, which is what this giant pile of excrement truly is. Don't buy the hype, I've read dozens and dozens of books deemed 'classic' and I found most to be labeled so for good reason. James Joyce is NOT a great writer, and this proves it. Awful, just awful..."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Despite its lofty status as a revered icon of English literature, one only has to fight through a dozen or so pages to reach the painfully obivious conclusion that Ulysses is, in fact, unreadable gibberish.The book has no plot, no dramatic arc, no message, a (literally) pedestrian structure, and sentences constructed by means of a random walk through the dictionary as well as through Dublin, Ireland. It has no discernable central thought. No one can tell you what the book is about, for it is about nothing. But wait, perhaps there is an underlying theme, albeit one well hidden.Remember the fable of the Emperor's new clothes? Guillible courtiers were induced to beleive that a charlatan tailor had sewn garments for the Emperor that only suitably refined folk could see. In reality, there was nothing there at all. Jame Joyce and generations of literary sycophants have convinced impressionable students that Ulysses is a worthy read.When the uninitiaed find the text incoherent, this failure is chalked up to insufficient literary maturity. It can't be the fault of the book's alcohol-addled author.\\"Press on,\\" the professors say, \\"Ulysses' gloss will be revealed if only one perseveres past the many opaque chapters, thus developing the right sensitivities.\\"However, looking longer at this nonsense only reveals the glaring absense of rational content and the transparent emptiness. The self-indulgent Emperor Joyce has no clothes.The most damming indictment of this over-wrought tome is the fact that it is impossible to find ten people who have actually finished it. Ulysses is one of those books that everyone has heard of, but no one has read. Hence the market for Ulysses crib cards for use at cocktail parties by poseurs with literary pretensions or by guys with dates with English Lit chicks whom they are trying to bed. Perhaps Ulysses has some tactical utility after all, as an example of inverse Chick Lit.One supposes that the stream-of-consciousness descriptions of nose picking, masturbation, and sex broke ground for serious literature when published in the 1920's. Joyce deserves some credit for expanding the gross horizons of writing, but today's target audiences find those subjects ordinary and routine. This taboo-breaking history is hardly sufficient reason to examine Ulysses now. To be timeless literature, a book must speak to fundamental truths about ourselves.But what, if anything, does Ulysses tell us about the human condition? I suggest its plot-free message is one Joyce didn't, or couldn't, intend. That is; to trust one's educated common sense. If, to you, a book walks like a duck, looks like a duck, and sounds like a duck, then it was most likely written by a quack.If this stream-of-consciousness genre appeals to you, for a much better read get anything by Hunter S. Thompson. Dr. Gonzo's book will be more coherent, make more sense, and will be better crafted. And, your eyes won't glaze over after ten pages, as they will with Ulysses."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Considered such a masterpiece - I HAD to read it. What a waste of time...First - the language: extremely difficult and archaic. Even for English speaking people. Can one enjoy a book if one needs a dictionary every couple of lines ?Then the allegedly 'cultural' riddles Joyce planted in the book for the sole purpose of torturing generations of English literature students and their teachers. Ask yourself - are you going to enjoy a book that neccesitates your literature teacher lie next to you and explain its 'sophistication' to you ? Every other page ?Then the foreign languages quotes in latin, german, irish, italian and who knows what else...Did Joyce expect his readers to be THAT fluent in other dialects ?Personally - I think Joyce wrote the book being completely drunk. Or worse.Last but not least - the story, the time frame and the main characters - boring, boring and then boring again.Your reading time could be used on much more pleasant, interesting books. Really."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses is the greatest thing (in all of arts and sciences)ever created by a man. I have read it all the way through once, and have re-read the individual episodes plenty of times on their own. A whole part of my life was defined by the reading of this book. It is no small undertaking to construct a universe. Ulysses is more than a machine, more than an organism; Ulysses is a universe. If you want to read deeper into things (which of course you do, if you're reading this book), then the most indispensible of the commentaries is Stuart Gilbert's, which was written under Joyce's supervision."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Clearly, Joyce's work is a tour de force, an everyman's epic day hidden in grand literary style. The langauge varies from beautiful to impenetrable, with allusions galore. The themes were shocking in 1922, and portrayed in all of life's gory detail. But is it worth it?The time involved in reading (let alone understanding) this book is enormous, easily on the order of fifty hours. What does this steep admission price buy? Simply put, not enough. Their are a multitude of insights one can draw from Bloom's day, but their are none that aren't easier to gleen from other writings. The language, while beautiful at times, does not justify the investment, in my opinion. For a passionate lover of English langauge and literature, this book may be for you. But for the everyday reader, who reads for simpler pleasures and knowledge, you will probably get little out of this book but the right to say 'Yes, I have read Ulysses, Yes!'"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I decided, after listening to an NPR reading from \\"Dubliners\\" that it was finally time I read \\"Ulysses\\"--a book that was not legally available in the U. S. 60 years ago when I was in college. (I didn't even know anybody who owned a copy or would fess up to it!) James Joyce's prose and imagery are breathtaking, and I begin to understand his influence over those writers lucky enough to read him in their youth.However, at the risk of revealing myself as a crotchety old lady, I confess I gave up about a third of the way through the book. It wasn't that it was so much racier than, say, Saturday Night Live or some of the current GOP rhetoric: I just got exasperated with the eternally adolescent whining of the main characters! Been there, heard that, thank you."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This being my first time reading Joyce, I didn't really know what to expect. After reading for a day or two, I found that it was too scattered and hard to follow. I don't think it would be right for me to say that I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, because I think it is worth a try. I might come back to it in a few years, but right now it just isn't exactly my cup of tea."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The $[...] Old Landmark edition (ASIN: B000FCK4BS) has chapter breaks and a TOC but lacks italics and proper linebreaks in the verse."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This is one of those novels that in actuality heralded the end of the novel as it was known (and still is for those of us who still enjoy a story for story's sake, and by that I mean all the ingredients).I first attempted to read this during my days in the army since I'd heard so much about it. But it wasn't until college that I was able to read this book and make sense of it (spent a whole semester doing so in a course by a superb professor).But let's get back to the novel. Told a single day, the tale of Leopold Bloom is one that was unprecedented in its time. So much flap followed this book's publication in Europe that it took a ruling from our supreme court here in the states to allow the publication of Ulysses in America. The story, by Joyce's own admission, is modeled after Homer's Odyssey. Joyce himself admitted to, and I paraphrase here, including so many \\"enigmas and puzzles\\" he would keep scholars busy for years and solidify his own immortality. So much for being a humble writer. Of course, one might argue that no writer, by the very act of writing, can exercise humility.Ulysses, since it was first serialized in a mag back in 1922, has always been more about people celebrating Joyce's supposed genius rather than about the book itself. It is, for the most part, a very poorly written book with prose, when the author is busy playing the old \\"look at how clever I am with wordcraft\\" game, is rather dull and empty.Considered the modernist book of the ages, I recommend reading it first in a structured environment like a college classroom; even if you have to audit the class (maybe you can find a Joyce class at your local college). And if you can't do that it's best to hunker down withUlysses Annotated: Notes for James Joyce's Ulysses [Revised and Expanded Edition] otherwise you might get lost like I did.With that said, if you are looking for a beautifully written, compelling story I would look elsewhere. Of course, if mediocre prose peppered with crafty tricks is your thing then by all means have at it..."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses is an experiment in style - not in content, not in entertainment, not in anything but style. As a student, you have to read it(like Shakespeare of course - but he's slightly better). And every book that you HAVE to read is already suspicious. Why is it a 'must'? Because if you would not be forced, you wouldn't read it?So true because this is a waste of space. How wonderful such space can be used, other longer books like 'The Lord of the Rings', 'Dune' or 'Catch-22' prove. They aim for entertainment, for fun, for joy in reading and all the same, they deliver perfect writing and characterisation. Now what is wrong with entertainment? Nothing! Even the bible wants to entertain - but Joyce is of course above such unnoble things like 'fun' or 'entertainment'. He's into style. And that's what he delivers:Dry, boring and self-satisfied style. He might be a good writer but he should have used 'Ulysses' as a starting point, as a construct in which he could fill a story. There are passages where his style is fantastic - short, journalistic style, the one I always use, the one I like. But these are LINES in a book of hundreds of pages... now if that is not a waste, I don't know what is."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I challenge any so-called critic to read Ulysses out loud, in an auditorum full of listeners and explain, page by page, without notes or the extensive annotations available, just what each and every sentence and word means. Those effetes who proclaim this the greatest novel of all time are kidding themselves and us. It isn't. The fact that JJ state, in writing, that he had loaded up his novel with so much foreign words, obtuse references and effermeral meanings to keep academics busy for years say it all. The fact that he had to provide a schema to his closest readers also says volumes. And HE CHANGED that schema more than once. So, obviously JJ himself didn't understand what he meant! Nice book for literature students and prof.s to OOO and AAAH about, but the fact is it is boring to the nth degree and simply not up or even close to anything by Tolstoy or Dostoyevsky or any number of other competent writers. Some time in the future it will become one of the least read novels of all time...perhaps then folks will start to take a more realistic view of what JJ really achieved."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"You can't understand this book without a study guide. That fact alone should be enough to scare you away. One reviewer asks why a reader should have to work so hard to understand a novel and it is a good question, in my opinion. I think that a work of art which is not self-explanatory but which demands an additional volume and commentators in order to comprehend it is a failure. I heard one professor suggest that we should all take three years out of our lives to go through this book and to appreciate it fully. Yeah, right. I have never been too keen about anyone who thinks they know what I &quot;should&quot; do with my life. There are far too many other great and rewarding pleasures available to me in my life which are more easily accessible for me to waste my time deciphering what looks like the work of a schizophrenic. The modernist conceit is that Joyce and other non-linear novelists have captured the actual mental processes of man's daily life. Perhaps if you need medication and are plagued by mania, yes. My mental processes are not a mad jumble and I do not see how anyone with a professional occupation could function if this were true. It simply isn't so. There is a famous sex scene in this book where the mental thoughts of the individual coming to climax fills many pages. I asked around and no one I know thinks about anything while climaxing except for a sexual fantasy. Totally unrealistic."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Woolf was right. Joyce was obsessed with being, hm, obscure. I have read every book he wrote (not that many) and studied him at length. It has not helped. I cannot admire anyone who thinks we should have to work so hard to figure out what he was talking about. Normal people can't enjoy Joyce and I think this is a travesty. For all the hard work I had to do to figure out what he was talking about, I did not get one moment's enjoyment. Down with pretentious male modernists who feel we should all spend our lives &quot;working&quot; to unveil the &quot;true meaning&quot; in their words. For all you Joyceans out there who like to mock the &quot;commoners&quot; for not &quot;getting&quot; Joyce, I am working on a PhD in English--and I &quot;get&quot; him just fine, thank you. And I nonetheless refuse to give in to the pressure to like him. Brilliant as he may have been, he was full of himself. In my mind, these two qualities alone (brilliance and arrogance) should not get anyone's novels on the must-read lists."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"FOR STUDENTS STRUGGLING WITH THIS GREATEST NOVEL IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE please skip to the twelfth episode, called Cyclops. YOu will find there all the major themes written in an engaging style, and all the threads of the plot. Just jump there and the teacher will think you read the whole not-easily-digestible work.Each episode is a microcosm and a repeating or respeaking of the same themes. Cyclops probably presents these in the most immediately comprehensible way possible. YOu quickly realize that Joyce throughout the work is MAKING FUN OF THE WAY PEOPLE TALK AND WRITE, from the first turn-of-the-century style to Molly's final stream of consciousness tour-de-force. But throughout Mr. JOyce is doing PARODY, which is exagerrating and making fun of how we speak and write, onoly to show that his underlying themes are impossible to express in modern terms. and so in Cyclops we hear every voice from ancient heroic legend to modern ringside boxing reports and wedding reports.But the basic themes remain. Mr. Bloom most explicitly states here that Love must be the basis for human interaction, and this is expanded upon. Also and most explicitly are Joyce's political undercurrents, the vile and oppressive nature of the BRitish empire's military force, which continues today stealing oil in Iraq while destroying its cultural heritage. Joyce shows how the same happened to Ireland, destroying resources (lumber) and cattle (under the false pretext of hoof and mouth) and industry as a way to impoverish and enslve the once great nation. The direct indictment of the BRitish naval power is especially explicit. This is my favorite and funniest epsode at the same time. Listen to it around disk eighteen of the forty disk Donal Donnally recording.THen ask your teacher if the reason Stephen Dedalus (get it? Dead. Alas!) did not kneel to pray for his mother, keeps Kosher, wears black with head carefully covered and wanders alone and lost, finding company only with the alleged Jew Bloom, is that while in Paris between Portrait of the Artist as A YOung Man and this work, he realized he was not a Jesuit Catholic, but on his mother's GOulding side, a Jew, and he returns to Ireland in search of his Jewish community. THis will knock your teacher's socks off.Please realize that Mr. Joyce himself reported there is not a single serious word in his work, that it is all a joke about the poor way people write. Yet, while there is not a single serious word, the underlying themes are deadly serious matters of life and death, faithlessness in marriage, national identity in the face of brutal (British) imperialist rape and oppression, and the theme of love in all its permutations. Love eternal and carnal is the basis of this book.My original analysis of this monumental work I assume got reported and dumped, without my saving a copy, so let me only briefly say that you may want the Gabler edition for the most reliable text, even though it loses the important page sized capitals S, M and P as reproduced in the Random House, as well as the important large period or asterix answering the questions \\"Where?\\" and is famously poorly bound.Do get the Donal Donnally (sp.?) recording. Jim Norton's is ABRIDGED grotesquely. Donal's is complete and extremely well done. If you want the basic gist of the novel, listen to Disk eighteen and nineteen of the forty disk recording and you will get the basic message. Love loves to love love.I am sorry to have lost my complete review written here in Ulysses style for a flavor of the original. Who's knows what lines were offensive. This book is essential reading, and re-reading, but don't get me started or I might get reported again.Be sure not only to get the Annotated Ulysses, which focusses mostly on historical explanations of places and people, but especially the Schwarz \\"Reading Joyce's Ulysses\\" and the Sicari \\"Joyce's Modernist Allegory\\", both excellent beginning commentaries that will make the text and intent much clearer to any reader. But the serious reader interested in the deeper socio-historico eleements suggested by joyce should get Dr. Cheng's excellent critique on JOyce racism and colonialism, as well as Attridge's Semicolonial Joyce. And those who get way over their heads with Joyce ought to check out Joyce and G-Men how Hoover killed Joyce's novel in the USA.The Donal Donnaly recordings really bring the novel to life.You can find several other commentaries in all price ranges, some by professors eager for tenure and looking to publish or perish, and others that are really helpful. Try Hugh Kenner of course, and the ones which investigate the brutal colonial nature of Ireland's history which Joyce alludes to, to reflect on current world events. It is worth the effort. Even Joseph Campbell has interesting things to say, on how this novel inspired him to begin to explore our world's mythologies, masks and meanings. But his commentary I found surprisingly shallow and at times off the mark. But I grow wordy . . ."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"What many consider to be Joyce's masterpiece is, to be frank, by no means his best work. &quot;Ulysses&quot; takes Joyce's use of realism and disjointed language to an extreme that causes most readers to lose interest in the story and the messages contained within. No work in which the style causes the vast majority of the readers (even of the highly educated readers) to become disallusioned and pretty much sick of can be considered a true masterpiece. If one wants to understand Joyce's feelings on Dublin and its people (and consequently his feelings on the Universe in which we exist) should read a work such as &quot;The Dubliners.&quot;"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Perhaps the worst book I have ever read. It is a blasphemy that it ever was published. Its only function is to keep blinkered academics busy trying to wring another drop of meaning from a text already exhausted from analysis.A brief glance through it is enough to confirm that it is precisely the novel you would write if you wanted to become a celebrated author but hated writing, hated readers, and wanted to punish academics. This monstrosity of hideous prose confirms that Joyce had no style and certainly no class. The novel can rightly be blamed for being the originator of the misguided notion that the squalor-and-filth quotient of a story is directly proportional to its artistic merit.The very least one might ask of a book is that it be readable. With this is mind, Ulysses, ludicrously canonised as the greatest of all novels, is a failure in the most fundamental respect. It is the only book I can think of where the reader deserves more credit for finishing it than the author. In the words of a *real* writer (H. L. Mencken): it is rumble and dumble, it is flap and doodle, it is balder and dash."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"From the first \\"Stately,\\" with the first letter taking up the first page, to the last \\"S,\\" capping off SPOILER ALERT the word \\"Yes\\" in Molly's monologue, this is a masterpiece that is worth the price of admission. Joyce's words don't fit a standard narrative, but they are worth the time to puzzle and marvel over. Its fine if you put it aside and dip back in from time-to-time. There's no rush. He took eight years to write this book, and traipsed all over Europe re-imagining the Irish soul -- forged in the smithy of his soul for the thousandth time the uncreated conscious of his race. This is it, just ignore the next book; Joyce peaked here."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"We're approaching the 100th anniversary of the action in Ulysses and I've taken my copy out and began to reread it. No other book I know of has more power to inspire or instill creative thought. His symbolism and skill is simply astounding. Anthony Burgess once said that many times he'd think of Ulysses and then think about his own work, &quot;Why bother?&quot; I know what he meant, but the power of the characters and style gives everday writers like myself something to strive for. This book is worth more than ten creative writing courses in the Ivy League. Even if I wanted to, I could never forget it."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I haven't finnished it, i pulled it off the lbrary shelf to look at page one a couple of days ago, and now a couple of hundred pages on feel compelled to write a review.

Usually after about a hundred pages I can sort of get the &quot;gist&quot; of a document, and I will admit to not having a degree in literature or Irish studies. From all the praise, I am wondering if I have a defect in my brain. But I will admit, I don't get it. If this is supposed to be some mental time capsule, a masterful expose of stream-of-consciousness, then fine. Must be an acquired taste.

Instead, it is a cruel insult to the intelligence of any thinking person who tries to read it. Even the people who don't &quot;get it,&quot; and feel compelled to give this miserable piece of trash 5-star ratings let some of its true character seep through.In the 5-star reviews alone, we see: &quot;my head aches after reading it,&quot; &quot;one will never be able to understand,&quot; &quot;a vast, complex book about nothing,&quot; &quot;when I finished Ulysses, I felt an emptyness,&quot; &quot;meaning that vanishes in the distance of one's ability to comprehend it,&quot; &quot;Ulysses is not Ulysses,&quot; &quot;sometimes the narrative line just seems to dissapear.&quot;Anyone with respect for themselves should skip this &quot;book about nothing&quot; and find a book about _something_ instead."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The only real reason to tackle the massive burden of Ulysses is to become aware of the stark reality that it expresses regarding the \\"spirit of the age\\", essentially a rampant nihilism. Then one can possibly adjust one's outlook on the current world society and proceed accordingly, perhaps avoiding being a lemming going over the cliff.Before entering the cavern of this work, one has to decide the \\"why\\" as above, then the \\"how\\". For me, after much diddling, false starts and self deceptions, this excellent CD set became the obvious answer. I had heard the comments of people far more intelligent than I on how difficult the work was to plow through. Therefore, I would have even more difficulty than they if I chose to continue reading it (a false start at reading the 735 page tome got almost nowhere). Also, I would be displaying a gracious nature in accepting the much-touted idea that \\"Joyce's prose must be HEARD to be truly appreciated\\".The production here is an excellent way to expose oneself in a leisurely manner to the book's wily trap without becoming totally enmeshed. The trap is simply that one thinks the work is \\"going to say something\\", but the fact remains that it really says nothing, albeit in a brilliant way.One can be tired but still listen to part of a CD, repeat passages at will, turn it off, reflect, then continue. It is MUCH harder to read this work than to listen to it. The CD set also contains very valuable and detailed notes about each section as well as overall enlightening critical information, and relevant musical selections are also present throughout.If one is truly serious about attacking this work, I would recommend the sort of \\"Joyce for Dummies\\" approach that I followed: purchase the DVD of the film version of Joyce's A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (although the film doesn't boast a very good screenplay and is unrestored, the performances are excellent), as well as the CD audio book of the same title (abridged, but all the important parts are there). Absorbing these will give you a central clue about Ulysses, mostly in the Stephen Dedalus character that appears in both (hint: Stephen is a boring, cold, emotionless prig). Then purchase the DVD of the 1967 film version of Ulysses (excellent photography in a pristine black and white print). Although set in 1967, it will give you a reasonably OK overview of the \\"story\\" of Ulysses which is set in 1904.Having taken in these, you are almost ready to proceed to the CD set of Ulysses, and you can already rightly claim to have listened to the prose of Joyce, definitely a feather in your cap at certain parties (where you may also want to rhyme off a few memorized lines in the appropriate accent).Avoid the millions of words contained in endless musings about the book, and read only one essay, that of Carl Jung entitled Ulysses in the book The Spirit in Man, Art, and Literature. If read carefully and more than once before listening to the Ulysses CD set, you'll find that it does indeed contain the golden key to truly understanding the nature of this massively influential book."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I've tried to read this book many times, and I never get beyond 50 pages.

At the moment I don't find it nessesary to read it any furder.But here are the conclussions I have made.Why this book is interresting:-The stream of consience idea is great, really. I love it.-I also love the idea that he descided to write about some of the things no sensibele writter would have ever written about. Like how Bloom went to the toilet or mastrubated.Why this book is a load of crap:-Way to long (I have nothing against long books and I have read quite a lot of books and I love Homer, Dante, Shakespear, Milton, Orwell, Huxley, Poe, Bulgakov, Plato, Swift, Nietzsche, Dickens, Asimov and many more so I do know a bit about litterature) this book should have ended whit the third chapter.-It lacks a plot. I am not saying that there has to be a overlingly complicated story behind it but it should have some directionlines.-The languege. Joyce seems to want to point out the whole time how good he knows English and that is very irretating.-It has no real meaning. I know that people have looked for one but all they have come up whit where some things like it is an epic of the body (well describing how someone goes to the toilet could hardly be discrived as epic. The also spoke about the complex intriging monologs and the praise of the mind (well the just say a lot of things and never seem to be able to think in a straigt line for longer than 3 min. And finally the the so cold new light that Joyce shines on myths. The mostly bring up Odysseus whit this one. Well people seek for Odysseus in this book because Joyce told them to do so.-Almost anybody could have written this book.I would also like to point out that when it was released all the people who love this book now (writters and proffesors) hatted this book. If it had never ben forbidden it would have just been forgotten like it perhaps should.I would like also to say that I didn't stopt reading tis book because it was to difficult but because it was borring. For after all I have read Paradise lost in the orriginal and I do find it difficulter to read that this one.Perhaps it is just so difficult to read because it is borring has anyone thought about that?(Excuse me for my English.)"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"How could a book like Ulysses ever have made it to print?

The book is well over 600 pages long, but the events in the story appear to take place over the course of just a single day.I have heard numerous people praise this book, but that would seem to be largely posturing because the story is lost under the weight of inadequate editing."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"ULYSSES is so boring and ridiculous in its pedantism!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This was a good book, one that took quire some time to read.

I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift! This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A gift to be cherished forever."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This is one of those books that \\"smart\\" people like to \\"read.\\" Well if being smart means liking this, count me out!

I am particularly concerned by the number of people who gave the book a poor review after admitting that that hadn't bothered reading past the first few pages. There's an adage in criticism that goes something like \\"Just because it's popular doesn't mean it's good\\" (AMEN to that)...a corallary could be \\"Just because it's difficult doesn't mean it's a 'literary hoax.\\"Yes, as hard as it may be to believe in some circles, ULYSSES is not a hoax. It is, however, difficult, and not, I repeat NOT for everyone. The stream-of-consciousness, the language(s), the style(s), and the fact that Joyce brought in all sorts of obscure references make it just plain difficult sometimes.The travels of Leopold Bloom about Dublin on that fateful day of June 16, 1904, can be, for the right individual, a difficult, fun journey. What brings fans of this work, like myself, back to it again and again, is the fact that each time we read it we discover something we missed (or misunderstood) the last time (or last 10 times) around.With a little work on the reader's part, ULYSSES can be finished. Many of us have actually made it to the end, scratched our head, and started again a few weeks later (after full recovery).Give it a shot, and if it's not for you, don't even bother moving onto FINNEGANS WAKE...you won't make it past the third line!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"\\"Ulysses\\" is a deeply flawed work of genius that richly deserves both the bouquets and the brickbats that critics have hurled at it over the years. It is by turns a desperate struggle to free writing from the literary straightjacket of convention, and an unctuous exercise in literary hubris. It is one of the most definitive products of the modernist movement then in vogue and shares the inconsistency, contradiction and schizophrenia that plagues that movement, constituting a rejection of bourgeois conformity on the one hand while on the other yielding accessibility only to a literary elite.\\"Ulysses\\" is many things: a literary experiment in variety and anti-style (different chapters are written in entirely different voices and forms); a rejection of Victorian conformity; a protest against method, structure and classicism; an attempt to transcend conscious boundaries; and not least, a gross and orgiastic display of literary exhibitionism.There were few contemporary works that dared to take the modernist movement to such extremes. Faulkner wrote similar stream-of-consciousness works but ultimately anchored his writings to a foundation of literary convention that allowed ordinary readers to understand him. Joyce, while ostensibly writing ABOUT ordinary people, never wrote FOR them. He was the ultimate literary snob who, by this time, had grown so infatuated with obfuscation that he would follow up \\"Ulysses\\" with the utterly impenetrable \\"Finnegan's Wake\\".There is something hypocritical about such an outlook: to extol the typical Irishman in writing that no typical Irishman could ever hope to understand; to reject not just established convention, but any appreciable sense of system at all; to push 'writing' entirely beyond the bounds of 'communication'.What saves \\"Ulysses\\" is that, with this work at least, Joyce does not yet go entirely over to the dark side. He goes right to the edge, but only playfully puts one foot over. Despite its calculated obscurity, its see-how-brilliant-I-am experimentation, its auteur elitism, he doesn't quite abandon content for form. This would be the last work in which he holds on to reality, and his decision to anchor his work in at least SOME recognizable conventions allows us to see where he is trying to go.This is a book that is far more important than it is either enjoyable or even readable. Its status as a \\"masterpiece\\" is problematic and misleading: since this honorific is earned if the work is judged by its incomparable technique and sheer audacity--but is undeserved if judged by its respect for the common man. This is a book written for literary highbrows--at times, one almost suspects that it was written solely for Joyce himself--and no one should feel obliged to wade through a morass of such literary contrivance. Those who do, however, can expect to glean many moments of brilliant revelation out of long stretches of teeth grinding frustration."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses is, without a doubt, the greatest novel of the twentieth century. Although many great books have been written before and after its publication, nothing has equaled it, or even come close. It is, without a doubt, a true and lasting work of art.Ulysses is an immensely detailed, perfectly-crafted, often sordid account of the wanderings of certain Dubliners around their city on 16 June 1904, principally, Leopold Bloom, outwardly a Hungarian Jewish proprietor of a small business, but inwardly, a sensuous rags and tatters Hamlet, a man who has lost both his religion and his name; his adulterous wife, Molly; and Stephen Dadelus, a clever but pretentious young teacher, Joyce's alter ego. Joyce labored for years on Ulysses, amassing and checking facts and then, with a genius that has never been matched, drawing them all into various symbolic patterns that mirror the wanderings and ordeals of Homer's Odysseus, Joyce's own hero.In one episode, narrated by an anonymous Dubliner, Bloom enters a pub and politely declines a drink offered to him by a Nationalist, accepting a cigar instead. Despite numerous attempts to change the subject, the Nationalist rages on and on, grumbling about foreigners and strangers. Bloom eventually gets fed up; he defends himself and his race, jabbing his cigar for emphasis as he speaks. Eventually, though, Bloom is accused of true treachery against the Irish race--not standing everyone a drink when he is thought to have successfully backed an outsider in the Gold Cup horse race. The Nationalist explodes and throws a biscuit tin at Bloom as he quickly retreats.In Ulysses, this scene is funny, but it is also so much more. The Nationalist is the one-eyed giant Cyclops from whom Ulysses escaped by jabbing his eye with a burning stake. The tunnel vision and terrorism that are but a small part of the Irish race are fought by Ulysses/Bloom as he jabs his cigar at his tormentor. &quot;But it's no use,&quot; Bloom says. &quot;Force, hatred, history, all that. That's not life for men and women, insult and hatred. And everybody knows that it's the very opposite of that that is really life...Love.&quot;There are ironic devices used in Ulysses other than the Homeric one, including the one used so strikingly by Joyce in A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (in which we were introduced to the character of Stephen Dadelus), matching the style of the narrative to the person occupying the foreground. As a Modernist, Joyce wanted this stylistic device to be &quot;visible&quot; rather than &quot;invisible;&quot; he wanted readers to develop an awareness of his technique, to identify, not only with the story but with the way in which he was telling it.Joyce had a message to deliver in Ulysses: he sought to tell the world of the people he had encountered; to describe their conduct and speech, to analyze their motive, to relate the effects the sordid, turbulent, disorderly &quot;world,&quot; replete with Irish whiskey and Irish ecclesiasticism, had upon him, an emotional and egocentric genius whose chief pleasure was self-analysis and whose chief preoccupation was in keeping a notebook filled with every incident he'd ever encountered and every speech heard, all recorded with a Boswellian fidelity.Although Ulysses is not impossible to understand, the book does test anyone's endurance as it is filled with fragments of songs, bits of other languages, lists, obscure references and Joyce's stream-of-consciousness style. Idiosyncrasies abound; from the early Dubliners, Joyce abjured &quot;perverted commas&quot; in favor of French-style punctuation.Reading A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man is one way to prepare for Ulysses. In that book we are introduced to Stephen Dadelus and we also have a chance to get used to Joyce's capacity to externalize his consciousness, to put down in words those things many of us would be ashamed to admit to thinking, even to ourselves.Unlike Odysseus, Joyce never returned home. He wandered around Europe, his eyesight failing, with his fiercely-loyal wife, Nora, at his side. It is Nora Joyce celebrates in the tremendous punctuationless passage that ends Ulysses.Although Stephen Dadelus, in his Parisian tranquility, would have pretended indifference to the praise heaped upon Ulysses, Joyce knew that he had created something special and lasting. &quot;O rocks,&quot; Molly says to Bloom, &quot;tell us in plain words.&quot; That is something Joyce never failed to do."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This is a brilliant novel. And it will find its salvation not because it is a triumph of form--which it is. Admittedly it packs intellectual poetry into every syllable, carefully constructed. But this means nothing today. Joyce was the only modernist who seemed to know that eventually the modernist form would fade and people would just wonder why The Wasteland is so damn hard to read. This book will find a salvation because it is more classical than any other book in the 20th century canon. And because it is a realist work before it is anything else.Anyone who doubts that Joyce is a realist writer needs to take a glance at Dubliners. It is, more than likely, the realist tint of Ulysses that made upper crust elitists like Woolf dislike it. In his failed poet Stephen, Joyce offers a critique of the aesthete lifestyle. His hero, Bloom, is an impotent Jew suffering in sexual silence for the sake of his wife. The spiritual motivation of the book is a near-illiterate woman. There's little for the oversexed anti-semites of 1930s Paris to appreciate here.Joyce wrote this book for his wife. It is his gift to her; fill in the details, ask yourself why that particular day, and you will see how Ulysses is perhaps the most profound love ode in the English language since &quot;The Divine Comedy.&quot; It abolishes identity, language, politics, ethnicity and class in favor of a simple love poem. Read and be moved, but never say it is without content."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"It's a pity for so many out there that appreciating this remarkable novel requires a broad and good education. A grounding in the classics certainly helps - Homer, Dante, and Shakespeare, as some reviewers have noted. But, in addition, if you've read widely and can catch the parodies of, say, Gibbon or the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, or of journalism around 1900, you'll enjoy it even more.Even then, 'Ulysses' is set in a time and place which have faded - Dublin in 1904 - and there are a lot of topical allusions to the politics (e.g. Parnell and his fall, Zionist publicity for immigration to Palestine), music (operas and lighter musical libretti) and much else to create a world, a whole set of intersecting lives, perspectives and meaning.Joyce was a true polyglot, so the bits of Italian, French, Latin, and rhyming underworld slang, for instance, can strike people as just showing off - but they make the book much more than a recounting of a banal day in a narrow setting.Precisely for both reasons - the allusions which have by now faded, and the breadth of the intellectual experience the book provides - even the most well-read connoisseur of literature would probably gain something by referring, at least occasionally, to the annotations of a book like Gifford's. But once this is done for a bit of the book, it gets much easier not to lean on the annotations, and 'Ulysses' can be read on its own, coming back to Gifford to see what more can be added to fill in the multiple meanings and subtleties.'Ulysses' has to be read slowly. Joyce took seven years to write it, so why not spend a year or two to absorb it? I'd suggest that the right discipline in approaching the book is to read no more than a page or two a day, and to break off and come back to it as often as needed.But then, exactly as some of the reviewers suggest, if you don't have either the background or the time, maybe you should read something else. After all, a top listing by Modern Library or the opinions of others who've thought 'Ulysses' a classic, or the fact that the book is a staple of English literature departments at universities, shouldn't force anyone to read it. And if people don't force themselves to read something they don't like, maybe they won't find a need to call the book or the author names.Yet, in spite of the difficulties of access which make 'Ulysses' somewhat esoteric, it has a lot of verbal pyrotechnics. If you enjoy the sheer mastery of language, there's little to compare unless you go back to Shakespeare. More than that, in the finest humanist style of the high renaissance (Montaigne, and, again, Shakespeare)the world of 'Ulysses' is in the measure of man. There's all of life to be experienced in reading it: tragedy (the death of Stephen's mother, from which he is still recovering, of Bloom's infant son, vividly remembered, the suicide of Bloom's father, Virag, which comes back in Bloom's reveries); comedy (mockery of \\"high society\\" in a hilarious catalogue of names, of \\"high art\\" in a sketch of a dog's barking as if it were reviewed in appreciation of its poetic qualities; sexuality in its many aspects - a quite touching portrait, through her letters to her father, of Bloom's budding young daughter who has just begun to work, but also a nightmarish and hallucinatory scene with Bloom and Stephen in a brothel.Joyce's vision is kindly and humane. He mocks established religion (the blasphemy is quite amusing if you're not easily shocked),or the 'gods' of \\"nationalism\\" ('patriotism' if you wish), and many other '-isms'. But his low-key message is of loving one another, affirming life for what it is, and doing the best one can, with no easy guides.In the end, reading 'Ulysses' is a unique experience. If this review helps even a few more readers have it, I'll be satisfied. All the others should just relax and just read what they enjoy better!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This is a fascinating book for those who have the patience and time to explore its intricate chapters and themes. Yet, it should not be forced upon anyone as required reading or for that matter anyone under the age of 21. The richess and complexity of the Circe episode alone earns a 5 star rating. Other episodes such as Cyclops, Ithica, Nausicaa and (of course) Penelope are memorable. There were times (Oxen of the Sun, Scylla and Charrybdis) that I just did not have the energy required to continue, but on the whole, a worthy venture.It particularly helps if you can identify with the eroding dreams of either Leopold Bloom or Stephen Deedalus. That is why it may appeal to those who their 20's just making their way out in life or those who middle aged such as myself, who reflect upon what has gone down and what is yet to come."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"1. When you tried it in college, it was a task, a challenge, an intellectual mountain to climb, a test of your literary mettle. Perhaps if you read it apart from any course, as I did, you felt you failed.2. In the intervening time you've read perhaps hundreds of Modernist and post-modernist novels by Joyce's acknowledged progeny, those whose numbers are legion: from William Faulkner to Beckett to Barth to Perec to Eggers to Coover to Calvino to Kundera, from \\"Wittgenstein's Mistress\\" to \\"Wittgenstein's Nephew,\\" from Jeanette Winterson to Louis Paul Boon and Gilbert Sorrentino to Peter Handke. These you have relished and enjoyed tremendously. Why, then, not tackle their progenitor, the master himself, again?3. A book is no longer in any way a notch in your belt; you read for enjoyment, enlightenment, enrichment, a sense of connectedness, all the right reasons and some that aren't.3. You can start with your old paperback, and if Ulysses again proves too difficult, you can toss it aside, no harm done.4. If the old paperback falls apart and you find you're still reading, you can buy a new copy.5. You're not in such an all-fired hurry any more. You have the sense to adapt to Joyce's demands and slow down your reading speed, recognizing that this is like a prose poem. Take five minutes on one given page, what's the rush? The writing is finely tooled enough to deserve it.5. Your maturity allows you to see beyond the Masterpiece Syndrome and the Scholar's Paradise that Ulysses became to enjoy what a romp it is. This is fun! for God's sake. Joyce is forty different kinds of comedian, veering from irony to black comedy to sly humor to sheer buffoonery.6. Each section being in a different style is itself royally entertaining, and Joyce is masterly in all of them. This is a buffet prepared by a virtuoso chef, and if you hang onto your hat, it's exhilarating as all get out.7. The unexpected effect of all this variety is that the three main characters, Stephen Dedalus, Leopold and Molly Bloom are more vivid and real than they could possibly be otherwise. Various sections familiarize us with their intimate habits, personal effects, private thoughts, and the way others see them; and by regarding them through different stylistic lenses, Joyce effects unusual familiarity and allows these fictional entities to assume the palpability of real people.8. We feel great affection for these characters, and Joyce achieves this while depicting them not as highly exceptional, heroic souls but rather average, idiosyncratic and unremarkable people. Even the highly intelligent, poetic Stephen is a typically self-dramatizing, youthful romantic. And yes, though the novel is rife with comic turns, there is poignancy, great and generous humanity.9. The novel is a sensuous feast, the words chosen always with an ear for sound in the reciprocal service of memorable, ultravivid images. You can dog-ear a dictionary (to many disappointments, considering Joyce's flamboyant taste for arcana and neologisms) or not; your workable vocabulary will suffice for much, if not most, of the glorious language. In this regard Joyce is a wizard, a magician unsurpassed by any poet in memory.10. As another reviewer here noted, you will have the urge, once you've come to the last line, to immediately begin again. Keep your new copy handy. This is such a kaleidoscope, a ride of a book, that you'll want to read it a third time, soon enough."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ah, Ulysses. What can one say that has not already been said? It seems that everyone who has read it, and indeed even those who have not, has an opinion regarding Joyce's seminal work. And now, after finally turning over the last page, I hereby add my own name to the long list of critics who have attempted to analyze this novel, and who, although perhaps unwittingly, have also added to the length of the grin on the face of its author--that eloquent literary trickster, that infuriating kicker-of-the-wheels of language, old double J himself.What immediately strikes you upon reading the first few pages of Ulysses is that, despite the cloud of mystique surrounding it, it is only a novel--a collection of words written by one man. It is not, as some would have you believe, some sort of prophetic vision of mankind, a work of art so highly conceived and perfectly executed that it transcends all space and time. No, it is only, as all books are, a story. And thereby it can be reduced to this: a man wakes up, walks around, and then goes to sleep. If you're looking for anything more than that, then keep looking--because you won't find it here. It is simply the story of one long (and I do mean long) day.But the plot is of little importance in this book. What the author wants you to focus on is style and meaning; and there is plenty of both to go around. In fact, there is too much. When Joyce attempts to reconstruct the evolution of the english language in a mock birth of modern speech and literature, he crosses the line that separates amusing people from annoying ones. In passages throughout the book--too numerous to mention in this limited review space--you often get the urge to say to its author, &quot;Okay, that's enough; we get it already.&quot; But on and on he goes, confusing you, irritating you, making you wish you had never started reading this damn book in the first place. So why keep reading, you ask? Because there are parts of the book, again too numerous to mention, that for sheer beauty and clarity of description rival anything ever written. Joyce's portrait of a grizzled old sailor in a scene towards the end of the book quickly comes to mind as a shining reminder that there are rewards for making the long and sometimes frustrating journey on which he wishes to take you.And that, I suppose, is what Ulysses is all about. You love it at times, you hate it at times, but by the time you reach the end you feel, well, something. And no more should we expect of our authors."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Symbolically, Ulysses follows Homer's the Odyssey; literally, it follows one-day in the life of a Jewish-born Irishman (an anomaly, to be sure), Leopold Bloom.First, whoever gives this book less than five stars does not respect the English language or English literature.Second, whoever picks-up this book expecting to enter the temple of profundity is in for a big shock: this book is, and was meant to be, very funny.Third, this book actually is profound, which is due to Joyce's genius and broad learning, not due to the book's intention, which was to recreate the novel and rival Shakespeare in word-play (both of which Ulysses does very well).This book treads from the extremely scatological (Joyce humorously describing masturbation as a &quot;honeymoon with the hand&quot;), to the very highest planes of human thought, for instance at the beginning of the Proteus episode: &quot;INELUCTABLE MODALITY OF THE VISIBLE: AT LEAST THAT IF NO more, thought through my eyes. Signatures of all things I am here to read, seaspawn and seawrack, the nearing tide, that rusty boot. Snotgreen, bluesilver, rust: coloured signs. Limits of the diaphane. But he adds: in bodies. Then he was aware of them bodies before of them coloured. How? By knocking his sconce against them, sure. Go easy. Bald he was and a millionaire, maestro di color che sanno. Limit of the diaphane in. Why in? Diaphane, adiaphane. If you can put your five fingers through it, it is a gate, if not a door. Shut your eyes and see.&quot; In these short lines, we have a fairly complex argument about the nature of reality; from the Aristotelian argument of knowing things through their transparency or translucence, &quot;diaphane&quot;, to Dante, maestro di color che sanno, &quot;master of those who know&quot;.But don't take it from me: go read this book; and if your befuddlement becomes too great, do what I did, and pick-up a good Annotation--even Cliffs Notes--but don't say it's crap just because you can't read it like you do John Grisham."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"If you intend to read ULYSSES here are a few suggestions.First off, read or reread Homer's The Odyssey, from which Joyce's seminal work is based. Aside from the Dedalus/Telemachus, Bloom/Odysseus, and Molly/Penelope parallels, each book in Joyce's novel reinvents equivalent parts of the Greek epic. You will gain a much greater appreciation of Joyce's achievement in transposing and reinterpreting a 10 year mythic and epic journey in ancient Greece to a 1 day journey in early 20th century Dublin.Secondly, don't come in expecting to understand everything. Many have tried and quit after reading a few parts, daunted by the strange syntax, the disjointed time frames, the shifts from waking to dream states, and the lack of traditional narrative replaced for the most part by stream of consciousness (internal monologue) to develop the plot. Joyce plays around a lot in ULYSSES, changing narrative styles, dialects, inventing words. You can't breeze through it. It requires a lot of patience to get through ULYSSES..to appreciate what Joyce has accomplished. It's always tricky categorizing a great work, but being that it's a novel about thought processes I guess you can say it's beyond realism..call it super realism. This is literature as a ground breaking art form. Joyce broke rules, but so did Picasso, and ULYSSES is kind of a literary Cubist masterpiece.Finally, after getting through ULYSSES (if you can), read the voluminous critiques on it. Read about the author. Do further exploration. Then read ULYSSES again. Multiple readings certainly enhance the experience, and bear fruit which are hidden or unripe enough to initially enjoy and appreciate."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I recently returned from Dublin where I met many Irish people and native \\"Dubs,\\" as they call themselves.

I followed along as he read and began to understand the rythm of the text. \\"Ulysses\\" became exciting instead of imposing.Jim Norton is truly gifted: Great voice and wonderful imagination."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Despite what the reviewer from MA had to say about this novel, it is readable and it should be approached by anyone who is interested in it. It is not an easy read, but then again, really innovative and engaging works never are. Joyce does something in this novel that few authors have the courage to do--trust the reader's intelligence.Yes, this is a retelling of The Odyssey, but even without that framework, the novel stands by itself. The story picks up about a year after Joyce's novel A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man leaves off with some of the same characters, notably Stephen Dedalus. But the protagonist of the work, Leopold Bloom, is the real stroke of genius. It might help to read Portrait before approaching Ulysses just to get an introduction to Stephen and his family. Anyone who really wants to get as many allusions as possible should probably use Gifford's annotations, which are available for both texts.As for our friend from MA...well, what can you say about someone who is reviewing the Cliff's Notes version of the text? Is that what Poly Sci majors read in order to try and feel intelligent as English majors?Do not be afraid; you can read this book. If you are afraid of starting a book that is so long by yourself then get some friends or family involved and read the book out loud to each other. It's marvelous."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"From the beginning of anyone's Joyce readings, he automatically assumes a powerless position. In Dubliners, we are walking through a labrynth of short stories connected only by theme and setting, paralysis and Dublin. We see the same theme and setting in A Portrait. Ulysses, though, presents Joyce's labrynth at its most complex. Unlike other more traditional novels, the chapters in Ulysses have almost no connections from one to the next. Rather, Joyce presents a series of coincidences and seemingly unrelated events within one day. The navigation of the novel in most places becomes rather belaboured, especially &quot;Oxen of the Sun.&quot; Like the epic it was modeled after (Odyssey), Ulysses includes moments of divine intervention. However, a Ulyssean intervention is made by either Joyce or the reader rather than by a Greek God serving as a deux es machina. The plot of Ulysses is the plot of the modern hero in the greatest epic of all, life. The novel is the most intricate, and probably the most realistic novel ever. I say it is the most realistic even though it has many moments of disillusionment with knowledge that we all go through many moments of disillusion throughout each day of our lives. The characters, just as the readers, are hopeless in the grand scheme of things. Fate, rather than the human hand, controls all of us. If you feel like trampling through a labrynth of deeply insightful and, at times, awfully confusing epiphanies, then Ulysses is for you. The labor involved in the reading makes its brief moments of understanding (the epiphanies) all the more worthwile. After all, you have to go through hell to come out right."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Due to the recent explosion of fame of this novel, many literature lovers have gone out to buy the book (or get it from a library,) to at least see what the hype is all about, if not to actually enjoy it. Unfortunately, many of these literature lovers enjoy not just reading, but the atmosphere of reading--curling up in bed or in a plush recliner after work and shutting off the outside world to live with the characters for a few hours. These readers generally throw Ulysses away before getting past the third chapter because they realize that no such reading atmosphere is possible with such a complex novel. To those interested in reading the novel, I offer two suggestions: first study a little Irish history, particularly about Charles Stewart Parnell, Daniel O'Connell, Arthur Griffin and Sinn Fein, the Fenian movement, etc. even if you just peruse encyclopedia articles. Second, read the Don Gifford notes for the novel along with Ulysses itself. This will constantly interrupt your reading of the novel, but it will help your understanding. If you are completely unwilling to put in this effort, buying this book will be a waste of money. But even if you don't think you would be willing to read a novel that requires so much initial research for basic comprehension, consider this: If Ulysses is really as good as its fans claim, you will want to go back and read it a second time, and then you will be able to enjoy it without constantly referring to notes, history texts or foreign language dictionaries."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This edition corrected hundreds or thousands of mistakes that were in the 1961 edition. When Ulysses was originally published, it had to be typeset in france because english printers could be prosecuted for \\"pornography\\". These typesetters didn't know english and made a lot of mistakes. Joyce's corrections (he often worked backwards to develop certain themes) were scrawled onto (at least) two sets of galleys and many of them were never included. In addition to that he was going blind and missed a lot of typos which thus came to seem intentional. Ulysses is (IMHO) the greatest book of the 20th century and demands careful and close reading. With the 1961 edition, which I read through several times before this one came out, I was left with many obscurities (such as Bloom having a watch in one chapter and needing to ask someone the time in a later chapter) to ponder which, it turns out, Joyce never intended, as well as struggling through passages than made no sense at all. This is still a very difficult book to read, but there's far less that's inexplicable in this edition. The difference is analogous to hearing cleaned-up CDs (of, say, Robert Johnson) as opposed to tapes made from shellac records with all the pops, scratches, and hisses on them."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses is Leopold Bloom - husband of Molly, father of Milly, advertising canvasser, lover of \\"the inner organs of beasts and fowls,\\" Jew, atheist, untutored but curious and sympathetic observer of the world around him. On June 16, 1904, Bloom has breakfast, defecates, attends a funeral, goes sporadically about his work, has lunch, visits the library, has a heated discussion with some Dublin barflies, masturbates discreetly while enjoying the view afforded by a conveniently reclining shop-girl, falls in with some drunken medical students, visits a brothel, and tends to an obnoxious young hipster-intellectual, whom he brings home for a cup of coffee and a chat.That's what \\"happens,\\" but over the course of Bloomsday we are invited into the life and times of the most fully and brilliantly realized character in world literature. As Bloom strolls around Dublin, and the novel records fragments from his endlessly fascinating internal monologue, his life slowly comes into focus: he is of half-Jewish descent; he is married to a voluptuous beauty named Molly who, Bloom knows, will spend the afternoon getting a thorough seeing-to by a well-hung local playboy; he has a daughter, but his only son was still-born, since which time his marriage has been largely dysfunctional; his father committed suicide; he is carrying on a clandestine correspondence with a married woman; but at the core of his uxorious being remains Molly, his mind returning time and again to their courtship and the happy early years of their marriage.We learn much, too, from his interactions with his fellow Dubliners. Throughout the day Bloom endures a steady stream of anti-Semitic bigotry, ranging from the casual to the (comically) violent. Bloom is an outsider, a humane and free-thinking man in a city of parochial bores. He is also, in Joyce's words, \\"a good man,\\" a man who takes it upon himself to collect funds for a recently widowed woman and spontaneously helps a blind man cross the road. Most endearing of all, however, is his boundless curiosity, his wonderful (if often ill-informed) observations of people and things. When he looks at his cat he ponders: \\"Wonder what I look like to her. Height of a tower. No, she can jump me.\\" \\"Good puzzle would be to cross Dublin without passing a pub,\\" he muses later. Or: \\"Wife locked up at home, skeleton in the cupboard. Allow me to introduce my. Then they trot you out some kind of a nondescript, wouldn't know what to call her. Always see a fellow's weak point in his wife.\\" Or: \\"Back of everything magnetism. Earth for instance pulling this and being pulled. That causes movement. And time? Well that's the time the movement takes. Then if one thing stopped the whole ghesabo would stop bit by bit.\\" Or: \\" Curious she an only child, I an only child. So it returns. Think you're escaping and run into yourself. Longest way round is the shortest way home.\\" And so on.Bloom, his mind and his life, - like the city he lives in - comes into focus bit by bit, like tiny pieces of a dazzling mosaic slowly coming together before your eyes. With unnerving prescience, Joyce has created a genuinely modern Everyman (he works in advertising!): deracinated, middle-class, tolerant, suburban, he's a little bit like you and me, making a go of his modest existence with a redeeming dignity.The final chapter belongs to Bloom's wife Molly, who lies in bed next to her husband and reflects - in eight astonishing unpunctuated sentences - upon the events of her day and her past, throwing new light upon what we think we know about Bloom and his marriage. Big-bosomed, generously-bottomed Molly is Woman with a capital \\"W\\". Where Bloom is intellectual, reflective and logical, Molly is impulsive, florid, instinctive, sensual. The faithless Molly is an improbable Penelope, but as she concludes with the ecstatic recollection of her courtship with Bloom atop a hill overlooking Dublin bay, and with her climactic Yes - to her husband, to life - it all makes perfect, glorious sense.Next to Joyce's latter day Ulysses - and his Penelope - the stylistic fireworks of the novel are of secondary interest, a brilliant means to an end rather than a legitimate pretext for anorak-like fixation. You'll get more out of Ulysses the more familiar you are with Homer, with the western literary and intellectual tradition, with the geography of Edwardian Dublin, and with Irish culture and history, but in truth you don't need any of those things. Here is a rich, nourishing, generous feast of a book: all you need is an open mind and a sympathetic interest in the world and the creatures that inhabit it.Finnegan's Wake is strictly for comfortably tenured scholars and tragic seekers of hermetic wisdom. Ulysses is for the rest of us. Just you try it on."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"First, please disregard the star rating. I had to choose something, but in this case, it's meaningless.I read Portrait of the Artist in college and found it absolutely wonderful. It influenced me to change my major and, to a degree, my life. I was sure then, as I am now, that Joyce is one of the greatest writers I have ever read. I therefore tried to read Ulysses several times, including just recently, and each time hit a wall after a few dozen pages. My most recent attempt was assisted by an extrinsic aid that summarized the chapters and elucidated some of the obscure references. I was determined to make a go of it; I pictured myself wallowing in a warm bath of self-satisfaction at having completed the book, and being able to mention to others (casually, of course) that I'd read it.I failed.I have read my share of stylistically difficult novels, and consider myself reasonably well educated. I could doubtless plow through the book with gritted teeth, determined not to let it get the better of me, but life's too short. I surely can't say it isn't a great work of literature (particularly since I've made barely a dent in it), but I would venture to say that you should not even try it unless you are prepared either to devote a few months of close study, with reference materials, or to miss eighty percent of what the author was trying to say and do. I can also say that I think it unlikely that you will genuinely enjoy the book unless you derive inherent satisfaction from conquering a difficult task, or are a scholar of literature of this genre.Not a beach book."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Plot? There is no plot? Hath life a plot? I think not. Life is a continual process, ebb and flow, rising and falling, like plate tectonics, like the ocean:constant movement, sometimes building to grand, pulsing, God-quaking climaxes before receding back into everyday lifes slowly humming grey. But sometimes not. Don't approach Ulysses looking for a coherent arc of plot, you're going to be disappointed(again, it hasn't one). Approach it more like Lolita, less concerned with the subject matter than with the beauty of its language; each word is a live, crawling jeweled beetle gnawing and burrowing through the dung of a day in the life of ad salesman Leopold Bloom, flittering their wings, busszing and forminng new patters, cresting and swirling into a cone, a tetracylone around an ordinary day in the life of an essentially ordinary Man. It works like a silhouette:each word, like a wort, pimple, hair or other blemish on a face defines its shape, as does ulyesses a life in the context of a single day(cf Finnegans Wake), through long sonorous sentences and chapters brimming like a cistern full of noisy pink coffee, out of which meaning blooms like a bloody Liebestod-singing rose, grabbing you. Even still, there is no meaning-ordering modern life? There is no order.&quot;Der Inhalt ist in den Augen einer Eule&quot;. Using The Odyssey to parallel Blooms avoidance of Molly is but a simple ploy, an act of acceptance and defeat, a concession of escape and resignation-much like those little pimply puke potsmoke fourteen year olds who compare their lives to popular songs. Don't hide. The pure organic beauty-tragic, erotic, hilarious, pathetic, and ulimtately affirmative runs through this novel like a vein of gold ore. Pick it up. Enjoy it at length. Enjoy it many times over-the more you read it the more you get. Don't seek God in Ulysses-Joyce's brilliance could certainly back up his notoriously mammoth arrogance but he was no seer, no mystic, but a human, flawed just like any other-instead, enjoy its beauty, and in it(eventually, but with time you will)recognize yourself, and every other human being on Earth-for am Ende we are all Leopold Bloom(nee Virag)--therein."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I won't review the book in detail, other than to say that I did enjoy it very much, and there were places where I laughed out loud (particularly when Leopold Bloom wonders whether or not Gods and Goddesses have anuses, then decides to resolve the matter by closely inspecting a statue at the National Museum).Also, to first time readers: just ignore episode 3. Many people enjoy Episodes 1-2 just fine, then get to episode 3 and stop dead in their tracks. Just skim through it or even skip it altogether. Ulysses is a book to be re-read, not just read once, so don't concern yourself with Episode 3 the first time through. It will make more sense if/when you reread the novel later. (And you should reread it, because you will be amazed at how easy it becomes once you're familiar with the basic plot).The main reason I'm posting this is to let readers, especially first time readers, know about an essay, \\"Art and Life, Nature and Culture\\" by Cheryl Herr, published in \\"James Joyce's Ulysses: A Casebook.\\" Most articles about Ulysses assume that you agree with the author that Ulysses is a great book, without taking the time to explain WHY it is a great book. Herr's essay explains a few (though definitely not all) of the themes of the novel and why its point is ultimately elusive. Some people get frustrated (I did) thinking that Ulysses is just one big puzzle that can be easily solved if you have the right \\"key,\\" making it seem mechanical, systematic, and just not fun. This essay challenges that assumption, explaining the mysteries of the novel that can never be fully explained, leaving it open to multiple, even infinite, readings.Also, although it's necessary to read \\"A Portrait...\\" before you read Ulysses, if you don't like \\"A Portrait,\\" don't worry. I didn't like that novel very much at all (maybe because I'm not Catholic and couldn't appreciate all the passages about sin and hell, but it just didn't get to me) but I loved Ulysses. So don't let a bad experience with that novel dissuade you, either."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"My discussions about ULYSSES bring out a similar comment from others--no matter how many times we return to the novel, we find something new. This richly rendered piece proves that virtual reality existed long before computers; it required a rich imagination, a good eye for detail, and a finely tuned ear for the music of voices and everyday sound. We find these things in ULYSSES. It deserves the praise it has earned for these many decades."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This is a book that can't be ignored if you want to be considered by anyone to be a &quot;serious&quot; reader, but it shouldn't be ignored. The truth is it is endless entertaining and enlightening. Though you need to spend many hours with it, you'll leave with a lot more than a great name to add to the list of authors you've read. You'll never let it go."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Preface by stating difficulty of full appreciation and fair comment on Ulysses on first reading. One proceeds ungrounded in the various contexts exposed to the author's unique and various styles wherein apparently Joyce attempts creation of reality by limiting his writing to the thoughts and communications of his characters without the crutches of traditional literature. Unknown to me why Joyce chose this particular style, though I speculate he must have wanted to illustrate the irrational nature of the thought process, and perhaps to show off the workings of his own mind. Joyce combines this method with what seems a deliberate effort of obscurity rather than clarity, complexity rather than simplicity, often degenerating into incoherence. He flits about continuously over dozens of subjects within the same page, and most often seems unwilling, or perhaps unable, to bring it all together causing frequent head scratchings for the skeptical reader. But in all this is an author so obviously brilliant that you chug on even when hopelessly lost, always expecting the bells to chime and lights to come on. There are many well done scenes, for me--the first chapter of young men bantering, the classroom in chapter 2, poignant expression of husband and wife relations with bloom and molly in the bedroom, and bloom back in bed after a night of carousing; an ending soliloquy that finally puts women in their place, and could that have been done more effectively--all rendered in writing flashing ability equivalent to the all time best. An imperfect book, but as many reviews note, it is a book on so many levels that generalization is impossible. I will appreciate Ulysses for what I believed it was, which is a lighthearted humorous thought provoking exposition in the style of the author of his own significant gifts."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"A stylistically sprawling, richly symbolic, discursive fresco, &quot;Ulyssess&quot; remains the one book that has pushed the form of the novel to explorative extremes. Not to be perused at leisure, but to be studied with diligent effort, it will be regarded as a death sentence by the average reader, but for the genuine lover of literature it's a treat. &quot;Ulyssess&quot; is an elephantine, pedantic, sometimes self-indulgent novel. At first reading, one might feel intimidated by it, which is why student guides and annotated editions are so essential. In reality, it's a very touching and candid book and not as bullying as it seems at all, but an encounter with the most familiar and daily incidents, embedded in the intimacies of lived experience. For all his dense allusiveness and linguistic acrobatics, Joyce's message is so simple that it almost seems a commonplace: the human need to love and be loved. At the same time, though it has been proclaimed as possibly the most individual and innovative novel of the century, one will discover that it's neither individual (with its polyphonic multiple registers) nor innovative (with its reliance on mining pop culture, Celtic traditions, literary precedents -- which were already extant). The really innovative novel of this type was &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot;."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I often compare Joyce to an epoch: The Ancient Greeks (collectively), Shakespeare, and Joyce. These are the masters that produce works whose breadth is overwhelming. It is a shame, on the one hand, that a mind such as Joyce's only surfaces every few hundred years. However, it is fortunate (especially for Literature majors and graduate students) that the frequency is so minimal. When I first read Ulysses, I had prepared myself with years of literary training and hours upon hours of reading. The first impression was numbing yet inspiring. In the aftermath of having read the work, I find myself reflecting back upon this work more than any other (this is saying quite a bit coming from a student of American literature). Be prepared with numerous secondary sources, including Ellmann's biography, and expect nothing short of extraordinary for this is one work a reader can never overestimate and one can never relive the first encounter with Ulysses."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Yes, OK, it's always easy to say you don't like something (therefore, you are better than that particular work of art) Having recently arrive from Dublin, the Ulyses experience is understood different: now I can see why Life can happen in just one day. I do not know if it's difficult or easy to read, but when you are more than just a reader but also jump inside the book, and write it together with the author, you are brushed away, swept into a new realm, and sigh: he's right, life is worth it. Do no try to critize the book with difficult words: just live it, and choose who you want to be: Bloom or Dedalus"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses is pretty deep water for some of us. I'm more of a &quot;The Triumph and the Glory&quot; or &quot;Stones From the River&quot; type. But the more times one reads this great novel the more one's respect will increase for it. &quot;Ulysses&quot; is so multi-dimensional that you will constantly be rewarded with discovery and delight the more you delve into its mysteries."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"To read Ulysses is truly an odyssey. It is an adventure for the mind. The reader is taken to a journey through the minds of three everyday individuals and discovers hidden thoughts, desires and guilts. It is not an easy journey though, as the reader is confronted with obstacles that challenges one's own intelligence and understanding of the story. The book is written in several different ways which will confuse the reader. I feel that when James Joyce wrote the book, he wanted to go beyond just writing a regular novel. He wanted to show us the true nature of the mind the way it really is in a variety of forms. I must say that is was very hard for me to get through the book at times and so I used the cliffs notes to help me. All the characters are excellent and some of them remind me of people I know. It is a book I will read over and over again with great pleasure. I have read many other books and this is one of my favorites. I found it funny how many people were complaining about how difficult it was and how Joyce was wrong in writing it the way he did. I don't see a problem with it. Ulysses wouldn't be great if it was written in any other form. I'm just a normal teenager who simply became interested in Joyce. If I could get through the book alive, anyone can. So for those of you who are complaining, quit crying and reread the book if you didn't understand it !. Its as simple as that."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"How does one attempt a review of this novel? As other people have expressed, adjectives like &quot;dense&quot;, &quot;complicated&quot;, or &quot;inscrutable&quot; do not begin to convey the experience of Ulysses. I read it for a Joyce course at school, with the assistance of Harry Blamires's Bloomsday (oh...*that's* what happened) book. Reading Ulysses is quite a challenge to the late twentieth century attention span, but if you can get through the maternity ward (recapitulation of the history of the english language) and circe/whorehouse (the abandonment of the rational) episodes, I think you're rewarded with the hilarious, exremely erudite yet still accessible catechism of the penultimate chapter, as well as Molly's freeflowing stream (of thought). On a bookmark I received with an order from Amazon, there is a quote by Elizabeth Drew positing that the &quot;test of literature&quot; is whether or not we live more intensely for reading it.

Other parts are as obscure to me now as they were when I first read them.That being said, when you lock onto Ulysses--when you can hold onto the thread--the words, the pages, everything vanishes. Pure thought, like music or cocaine, insinuates itself into your mind and clings to the pleasure centers.That you may never totally unravel Ulysses is unimportant.

While the product description indicates the edition is based on the 1984 Gabler edition, the Kindle edition includes a number of errors not present in that text. The company appears to have done a poor job copy editing the final Kindle text. There are a number of typographical errors. Also, in many cases numbers are rendered as letters and visa versa, particularly in the final episode. As Joyce often did not use conventional punctuation, it will be difficult for you to identify them unless you have previously read the book.If you are reading Ulysses for the first time or for school or study, you should avoid this edition. Its low price makes this edition is useful for casual re-reading."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Before I begin, I would just like to say that this is a simple review without any deep analysis of the book or its hidden meaning.Mehehehe. Right, then. What this book is about is.... ahm... eh.... hmmm... one guy's (i.e. Leo Bloom's) journey through the day of June 16th in Dublin, Ireland, accompanied by memorable characters like Stephen Deudalus and Buck Mulligan.\\"Stately plump Buck Mulligan...\\" and so it begins. I won't pretend to understand this book fully. I won't pretend that I caught all the nounces and themes. The fact is that quite a few chapters were incomprehensible to me, although that had not lessened my enjoyment of the book. I would have to say that the most difficult chapter was \\"Circe\\", which I struggled through like a sapper going through a mine field. Most enjoyable chapters, not to mention hilarious ones were \\"Hades\\" and \\"Cyclops\\". For these two chapters alone, this book is worth reading. Hey, I would read anything that would put me back in Dublin. Joyce's mastery of English language is unparalleled and I think he was an absolute genius with words ( a lot of them indecipherable, as it were, but that's okay).In conclusion, I liked the book quite a lot, and would read it again in ten years or so. However, I do feel that this book is not for everyone, especially people who enjoy a quick, easy read. I would recommend at least giving it a try, though.

Today, we can seethat his fiction worked on much higher levels: his portrayalof sex (and other things) is more inventive than Miller's,more subversive than Mappelthorpe's. Joyce's intention is noless than to create an entire mental universe; his novel isa potent artistic answer to the philosophical question, &quot;Do we really exist?&quot;Leopold Bloom, the hero of the story, is a completelyordinary man; but Joyce's combination of words and theproliferation of cross-connections between the current word andthe next illustrate that there is often little connectionbetween *what* we think and the *words* we think. So Joyceis in effect trying to write a novel without words; he wantsto get into the stream of Bloom's thought directly, withoutpreface or interference.Though most would agree that this is a &quot;difficult&quot; novel --perhaps the first book to attempt to break the limits oflanguage -- it is a must-read. Bring the book on a picnic,along with your dictionary and a lot of time. The famousfinal chapter is worth all the work."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Joyce can obviously write, from Nausicca:\\"THE SUMMER EVENING HAD BEGUN TO FOLD THE WORLD IN ITS mysterious embrace. Far away in the west the sun was setting and the last glow of all too fleeting day lingered lovingly on sea and strand, on the proud promontory of dear old Howth guarding as ever the waters of the bay, on the weedgrown rocks along Sandymount shore and, last but not least, on the quiet church whence there streamed forth at times upon the stillness the voice of prayer to her who is in her pure radiance a beacon ever to the storm-tossed heart of man, Mary, star of the sea.\\"So, we must assume that he has primarily written Ulysses for some purpose other than to entertain and to provide the kind of pleasure that would be expected from a typical novel. Ulysses is more along the lines of a textbook (in the form of fictional examples) about the philosophy of writing and language, but was decades ahead of it's time. The impact of writing and language on our perceptions of the world appears to be his true goal, with all other considerations a distant second (excepting perhaps the magnificently created character of Leopold Bloom).Ask yourself why you read. If it is for the pleasure of opening up a book and getting lost in it and enjoying the ride, then go elsewhere. If it is to expand your mind on the ideas of writing, language, and reality and perhaps to expand your own writing then this book will be very much to your liking.The best comparison I could think of was with Nabokov. Multiply Nabokov's wordplay and games by a million, but remove most of the the engaging and interesting aspects and the stunningly refined and smooth writing of every single sentence and what you have is Ulysses. But that's OK, because they seem to have had different goals for their writing, as mentioned above.Finally, to those of you who are attempting to read it for the first time and are wondering if it \\"gets better\\" (ie suddenly makes sense and settles down into a typical book once you get past a certain point), it doesn't, it wasn't meant to."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I received a copy of this for Christmas many years ago, but before that I used to have a copy of theUlysses (Gabler Edition)(which is the complete book the way that Joyce would have preferred were it not for censorious typesetters).

Believe it or not, this edition is the bowlderized one...and it still ended up being confiscated due to the Comstock Act! Strange, but true.As a historical document, the Forward is a wonderful reason to buy this version because it says so darned much about the times in which the obscenity trial took place. Just make sure you can get your hands on the Gabler edition as well to compare notes. You'll see what I mean about the difference between the two. But that's only because I'm a Lit nerd.

The latter might be true, because most books written afterwards have somehow used the stream-of-consciousness-technique and the non-linear storytelling. Mostly, the book is really about language and its relation to the modern world. Joyce wanted to use a different approach to language to make it consistent with the increasing complexity of every-day-life in a big city. I think that even modern movie experiments such as David Lynchs \\"Mulholland Drive\\" go back to Joyce' ideas to really dig deep in the complicated psyche of an individual, for which traditional storytelling is not sufficient.But is it really unreadable? The book certainly needs some preparation and some effort from your side, more than most other books. But once you are well prepared, the Ulysses is actually well readable, and at most time even a lot of fun. And often you do not wonder why it was heavily criticized at the time it came out. For example, most of modern literature which uses a lot of profanity and vulgarity looks like children books when compared to the Circe-chapter, a sado-masochistic fantasy of the protagonist. Joyce' language skill makes this chapter breathtaking, a pure adventure.At other times, the book is a pure delight, for example \\"Wandering Rocks\\" or \\"Penelope\\". If you listen to your intuition, even the latter (which is the most legendary chapter of the \\"Ulysses\\") is not difficult to read. But then, there are also parts where Joyce' experiment with language fails: For example the \\"Oxen of the Sun\\" is just bothersome and really unreadable.As I said, the book is only fun if you are well prepared for it. You should definitely read Joyce \\"Dubliners\\" first, which is an easy to read collection of short stories. It introduces some of the characters which return in the \\"Ulysses\\", and this gives you helpful background information. Even more important, read \\"Portrait of the Artist\\", which is a portrait of Steven as a young man. He has a main role in \\"Ulysses\\", and \\"Portrait\\" already introduces a lot of the central ideas of Steven and \\"Ulysses\\" in general.Other books which are comparable in style and intention but easier to read are Virginia Woolfs' \\"Miss Delloway\\" and John Dos Passos' \\"Manhattan Transfer\\", definitely two books which warm you up for the idea of \\"stream of consciousness\\".All in all, Ulysses is an experiment with language which is a lot of fun, but which does not work for all parts of the book."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Wow.

Even though I've read the novel many times, I'm not qualified to compare this new edition to its predecessors: I'm a commercial artist, not a literary scholar. I AM qualified, however, to complain about how badly produced this book is. Professor Rose refers in his intro to the important influence that editors, designers and printers have on a text. Careful analysis of those influences are the basis of the method he used to create this new edition. Well, too bad he wasn't able to influence the publisher. This edition of Ulysses is printed on very cheap paper -- the kind of dim gray brittle stuff that the cheapest of romance fiction is printed on. Fine for a book that will be read once, but terrible for a &quot;Reader's Edition&quot; of a classic that will be reread and annotated. These pages will be badly discolored in a few years. The typography is mediocre, too: the title page looks like the Bad Example in any design textbook.

Gabler's \\"corrected text\\" is an appalling defacement of a classic book; it should not be used. For an excellent account of Gabler's edition--of the legal reasons for its extensive modifications of the text, of the dubious textual methods employed, of the subsequent scholarly controversy--read Bruce Arnold's excellent little book _The Scandal of Ulysses_. Joyce's book has now twice in recent years been messed around with by dubiously-motivated editors--more recently, the \\"Reader's Edition\\" that was the subject of a wrangle in court to suppress it--which is an absurd indignity to be visited on one of the touchstones of 20th-century fiction."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Joyce was a great genius, granted, but what he did with his genius is something that doesn't appeal to me. Dangling the snotgreen stuff at the beginning of the book is not what I would call an inviting beginning. Yes, it's a marvel of writing, but I do not like what it is being marvelous about, or at. It's like a beautiful women who farts a lot but doesn't give a damn, because she knows her bosoms are so fetching. Well, fetching bosoms can take a woman only so far, just as fetching writing-- even a genius's writing-- can take a book so far. (IMHO). So yes, I like Joyce's writing's beauty and I like its fetching sensations, but I do not like his artistic manners and I do not like the liberties he takes with my attention-- which he sure knows how to catch, but so what. So can Flaubert (a greater writer, imho), and so can Proust (almost ditto).With all that out of the way I'll not-grudgingly say you probably have to read Ulysses, because, first, it sits like a dead weight in the midst of modern writing, and, second (if you are a writer), so you could steal some of Joyce's marvelous writing technique. But I would not read him more than once.AM"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Probably every avid reader feels compelled at some time in life to read \\"Ulysses\\", especially as it was voted the best work of fiction of the 20th century at the turn of this millenium.The style of writing throughout the book is usually referred to as \\"stream of consciousness\\". This method has been subsequently employed in other works such as \\"To The Lighthouse\\" and \\"The sound and the Fury\\". However, in my opinion, these latter two works used the style much more succesfully than Joyce.If you are currently reading \\"Ulysses\\" at the moment, expect a very patchy book. The second half is , in general, better than the first half, with the two penultimate chapters \\"Cabman's shelter\\" and \\"Ithaca\\" standing out from the rest. After that, the description of birth in \\"Oxen in the sun\\" is also excellent , as is the part dsecribing Paddy Dignam's funeral early in the book. As to the rest of the book, I believe there is little to recommend it.Opinion tends to be polarized about \\"Ulysses\\" . Its severest critics suggest that it is only praised by those who are scared to be criticized for not understanding the book, a sort of \\"emperor's new clothes\\" scenario. There is, however, more than a grain of truth in this opinion. It does seem incredible that a book with so much \\"padding\\" could be so highly thought of. It might have made a very good book of around 200 pages, but one does have the sensation that Joyce is taking his readers for a ride in many parts. ( Of course, his ultimate send up of his readers was \\"Finnegan's Wake\\"! ). Furthermore, the much lauded sense of humour is overblown. At best, this is a mildly amusing book with one or two laugh out loud lines. To label it as \\"very funny\\" is pretentiousness itself. Most of the humour is also of the \\"toilet\\" variety.On the positive side, there are some interesting passages as mentioned above. However, the main interest lies in seeing this new attempt at a style of writing , and to try to fathom out why this book has become the \\"darling\\" of the ( maybe \\"so-called\\" ) intellectuals. If you want to see a better example of joyce's talents, try \\"Potrait Of The Artist As A Young Man\\", or even \\"The Dubliners\\"."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Neither of us was able to get through this tome. For me, it had nothing to do with it being a difficult read; I simply was not rewarded enough to continue. Admirable, yes, but ultimately this is far from the finest novel of the English language.It is time to say it: the Emperor is not wearing any clothes. There are better books. Read Faulkner or Reinaldo Arenas."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses will get you, if you give it enough of a chance. The first time you read it, it will be difficult - maybe even impossible. The second time you read it, you will begin to suspect that Joyce is actually writing about the contours of your own mind. The third time you read it, your earlier suspicion will prove true as you successively laugh, gasp, swear, snort, breathe, moan, think, and yearn in anticipation of the occurrences of these events on the page. By the fourth time you read it, you will realize you never stopped reading it - that even the interlude of years between your first and second reading was only a momentary pause to catch the breath of your life outside the Book; and that you made a habit of the yearly 16-June read merely for the sake of ordering that interval of months between the readings - and during those intervals you will find yourself repeating passages in your head that you would never have imagined to be memorizable. Each time you emerge from this book you will find yourself unmistakably changed - your eyes opened to a further deepness of what it is to be human, what it is to be yourself. Joyce will demand everything of you, but he will give you a greater everything in return.If you have tried to read this book before, and didn't make it - well, i understand. The first time, it is admittedly extraordinarily difficult. But turn, if you will, to page 903 of the hardback Knopf Everyman edition, and read the bit of catechism &quot;What in water did Bloom, waterlover, drawer of water, watercarrier returning to the range, admire?&quot; that extends through 905. Then go to the beginning, or wherever you left off if you prefer, and start again. If not now, then someday - maybe years from now - but do it. And then do it again."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"As a devout modernist, I put off the pleasure of reading this book for years. I wanted to have the time and leisure to give it proper attention. I had taken a seminar with Anthony Burgess on ULYSSES at CCNY in the early seventies. We did a close reading of the Nighttown chapter and were supposed to read the rest of the novel on our own. I never did. But Burgess' enthusiasm was impressive and though I wasn't entirely convinced, I was certainly intrigued. In earlier years I had read DUBLINERS and PORTRAIT and even some of FINNEGANS WAKE and was especially impressed by Joyce's mastery of language and the poetic quality of his prose.An early retirement offer finally had me reading the \\"GREATEST NOVEL OF THE 20th CENTURY\\" last month in Riverside Park. Some nice cigars added to the mix.The first few chapters were stunning. The powers of description, the playfulness and musicality of language, the wit and intelligence of Stephen and Buck were a delight. I was obviously in the hands of a master. Shakespeare even came to mind.But then something happened. The humanity and poetry seemed to drain out of the thing as we were treated to yet another chapter of theoretical \\"experimentation in narrative technique\\". The idea of writing a novel, each chapter of which is written in a parodistic or borrowed style seems to me a doomed one (and more postmodernist than modernist). Apparently even Ezra Pound objected. I found myself asking, \\"Couldn't Joyce have found his own voice and style to narrate this section?\\" An entire narrative chapter in the question and answer form of a Catholic Catechism seems affected at first. After thirty pages it is deadly and even embarrassing. And then another in the style of a men's sporting magazine, and then another in the style of a women's magazine? What's the point (other than showing off)? And the Freudian/Surrealist kitsch of the endless Nighttown chapter was downright infantile. Talk about dated! This is novel writing from the outside in. First you have an \\"experimental\\" concept and then you fit in some narrative stuff. It's no wonder academics use this book as major fodder. It seems to be written with them in mind.Likewise the useless tie ins with Homer's ODYSSEY. One can't help thinking of them as a desperate attempt to add structure, incident and theme to a book fairly bereft of them. Not to mention adding a bit of literary pedigree to offset the \\"obscenity\\".Which brings me to my main point. The fancy smorgasbord of styles cannot disguise the fact that as a novel, ULYSSES is sorely lacking. Involving narrative, depth and development of characterization , thematic focus, depth of feeling etc. seem totally absent. Basically what we have here is a brief Balzacian \\"realist\\" sketch, padded out and styled-up beyond belief.Now this is really a minority opinion: not only is ULYSSES a failure, but the reason I think it is a failure is that it is a transitional work. Joyce was obviously bored with novelistic narrative but still felt obliged to accommodate. With FINNEGANS WAKE, he hit stride and finally found his m&eacute;tier - a book as a place to play with language and psyche for his own pleasure, without regard for traditional novelistics.A NOTE ON EDITIONS: The huge academic controversy about which edition of ULYSSES is \\"authentic\\" or \\"correct\\" is, as one might expect, much ado about very little. Serious textual issues are minimal. Most of the typos in the 1922 edition were corrected in 1960/1 by the editors of the Modern Library in consultation with Richard Ellmann. That text was also used for the Bodley Head and current Everyman editions. Gabler later went overboard, making some highly questionable decisions. His edition is also difficult to read due to small print, layout, line-numbering etc. Danis Rose's edition went even further and \\"corrected\\" Joyce's compound words etc. - a disgrace.I ended up reading an online version edited by Jorn Barger - a very sensible amalgam of the best work of previous editors. It took some time and expense to print out, but it was definitely worth it."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Who published this? There are no characters in the entire book who would look anything like the characters on this cover! Most of the action takes place in a newspaper office, in a bed room, in a Martello tower, and at a funeral. Most people are dressed in jackets and ties, not torn shirts, and certainly no one smiles as dumb as these jokers. The looks of this book are a disgrace to the author."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses is not that difficult a book to understand, contrary to what you may have been led to believe. Compared with Finnegans Wake, for instance, it's a cake walk. The book's most frustrating part comes early on, after Stephen leaves his Uncle Richie's house. From here on out, a dictionary (preferably a comprehensive one) becomes invaluable. In my opinion, a good deal of the confusion surrounding Ulysses has arisen out of the fact that most people, upon encountering a word that they do not understand, choose to merely carry on in confusion, as opposed to looking the word up. You would be shocked at how instantly comprehensible this book becomes once a dictionary is employed. Since this book was written as a sort of mock-heroic counterpoint to the Homeric poems, a knowledge of those literary works is also very useful for any competent appreciation of Ulysses."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"All I can say after finally finishing Ulysses is that it deserves its reputation - both of them. Yes, it is a masterpiece - and, yes, it is a difficult, at times seemingly impenetratable read. When I finished reading this book and finally closed it, I felt I had accomplished a monumental deed. This is the only book I've ever read - and I've read many (difficult ones, too) - that was an actual physical chore to read. One reviewer mentioned that reading it is comparable to climbing Mt. Everest - many people start it, but few make it to the summit - and, ridicilous as that sounds, it is true, in a way. I'm not going to go into a detailed analysis of this book (that's arguably impossible, anyway), or summarize the plot, or anything like that - there is no plot. Small review forums limited to 1,000 words such as this one is not the place for a detailed dissertation on a book as profound, monumental, and important as Ulysses - doctoral thesises and 100,000 word essays have been written for that purpose by people far more qualified than I. It is not difficult, but impossible to summarize Ulysses: it must read in full. I have done so - it wasn't easy, but I did it. I read Joyce's A Portrait of The Artist As A Young Man first (which I highly reccommend you do also), although I didn't use any annotation or Cliff's Notes, or anything like that. I have no doubt that many of the book's complexities, metaphors, allusions, and ancedotes were lost on me, but I wanted to read the book on my own first. I don't claim total comprehension of his vast and difficult masterpiece; I fully admit that there are many parts of the book that I did not understand. This is no reason to slander the book, as many have ignorantly done. I did enjoy reading the book, however - and felt great joy and a sense of accomplishment upon on reading it - and yes, it IS a masterpiece, and for this reason: this is one of the few, if not the only book(s) ever written that accurately and realistically depicts real life. There is no plot, there is no \\"story\\" - there is certainly no moral. What this book (I believe) attempts to do - and does - is to portray life in a fictional setting - real life. This book takes two normal people, and describes their day. The cross paths at times - intersect, ramble, and collide - and this book, basically, just shows a normal day in the life of two normal people. This may not sound exciting - it isn't. It may sound boring - it often is. Imagine if you wrote down in a book every single event of your day in pain-staking detail (and there are parts in thsi book where Joyce goes into such detail as to border on mundanity, despite its ultra realism.) Still, it is a brilliant and ingenious literary device - surprisignly unattemped before - and carried off marvelously well here. This book addresses the normal, everyday things that other books always cease to mention: defecation, masturbation, rambling thoughts inside a person's head. Like Portrait, this book contains no quotation marks. All dialogue is written as it is personally experienced by the character; I know no other writer besides Joyce who writes - both dialogue and narraration - from INSIDE the character: you actually feel what it's like to walk around inside a person's head, rather than just witnessing his external actions, like every other book in the world. Ulysses, though a long and difficult read (especially if one chooses to study it), is ultimately rewarding, and I reccommend tackling it to anyone who reads with an open mind. It is a masterpiece, and it is, indeed, the true last word on realism."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"A blasphemous, vulgar and sexual book about the lives of sots in Ireland written by a Shakespeare-variety wordsmith. At first glance, it sounds too good to be true. The catch...An extremely comprehensive plot summary for each chapter will only take about 25 words. That's right-it takes place over the course of a day and a night, and the action can be completely and all-inclusively summarized in only 450 words. However, there are only two ways to get this summary: 1) five or six years of study, or 2) by reading a Cliffs Notes-type book.This book has been fairly assessed as incomprehensible, numbing, nightmarish, and mind-numbing. The average reader will have a excruciatingly grim time completing this book.Still, I am convinced that anyone who reads every word of this book will love and embrace it. Be warned, the love and embrace do not happen immediately. After reading the first 90 pages, I had the worst headache in my life. I could not read for five more days. I hated the next four hundred pages of the book. Around page 500, I began to embrace this beloved work. It took the last 250 pages to achieve a unity and oneness with the book.I'm one of those people who reads the dictionary for fun. Because of this, I know a lot of words that I've never heard or have never read. Ulysses changed that. I think that he used every word that I have ever learned by reading the dictionary, but have not heard in life. Finding those words in print is worth reading the 700+ pages.As a smattering of the jewels of perspicacity of James Joyce, I have included my four favorite parts of the book. If you like this small morsel of the volume, you will love the rest. Enjoy!1. Moses, Moses, king of the jews, wiped his arse in the Daily News.2. Love loves to love love.3. Q. Did Bloom accept the invitation to dinner...? A. Very gratefully, with grateful appreciation, with sincere appreciative gratitude, in appreciatively grateful sincerity of regret, he declined.4. Q. What in water did Bloom ... admire? A. Its universality: its democratic equality and constancy to its nature in seeking its own level ... [Insert 30 more things about water] ... the noxiousness of its effluvia in lacustrine marshes, pestilential fens, faded flowerwater, stagnant pools in the waning moon."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Those who attack Joyce and this book today are like the people who attack Einstein and his theory of relativity simply because they're to addled to understand the chaos and unity behind the mathematical symbols. In my experience as a teacher of undergraduates and as a published writer of fiction as well, I would like to say in response to comments by a so-called Phd English student, that criticising a monumental work of art that deals with the need for a personalised fiction in the fragmentation of twentieth century alienation, reflects an ignorance that boggles the mind. It is better to remain silent on what one doesn't understand than convince the world of one's lack of, well, insight. My suggestion to those who want to fathom what Joyce is trying to do is to check out what writers like Burgess have to say. And as for comments about male 'post-modernist' stuff, please read Grass's 'The Flounder' on what excess feminism is all about and learn to grow."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"There are no notes in this book.

I really appreciated it! Merry Christmas."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"A masterpiece? Yes, no doubt about it, yes, it is a masterpiece, yes!Joyce's \\"Ulysses\\" is endowed with Aristotelian unity of space: it all happens in Dublin, and God knows, it helps if you know your way around that city. Unity of time as well, it all happens in a 24-hour period starting on the morning of Thursday, June 16, 1904, and God knows it helps if you know the headlines of Dublin newspapers for that day. It even has unity of action, whatever there is of that ingredient in this novel. It all revolves around the current adulterous affair of Molly Bloom with the vulgar Blazes Boylan, and the preparation of her next adultery with intensely intellectual Stephen Dedalus, whose father Simon had also been her lover at some point. There seem to be three main characters: Leopold Bloom, his wife Molly, and the young \\"bard\\" Stephen Dedalus, alias Joyce himself. It is amusing that Joyce repeatedly keeps referring to Stephen Dedalus, his alter ego, as a bard, a title reserved these days for William Shakespeare. This seems to signal Joyce's conviction that he belongs to a very exclusive club with the bard of Stratford upon Avon as its only other member.Beyond these three \\"main\\" characters, there are literally hundreds of other characters whose names and even their Dublin addresses are mentioned and oft-repeated. You might think, I wrecked your whole pleasure in reading this book, by giving away these spoilers. You need not worry, as things are not what they seem to be. The true main character of the novel is none of the above, but rather the English language, of which Joyce has a command second to none, with the possible exception of the bard of Stratford upon Avon. I wouldn't be surprised if Joyce's vocabulary had weighed in at twice or maybe even thrice that of the typical educated reader, and not for a minute does he let you forget this fact. Why?Why? Well, the book has a clear anti-British slant, and Joyce is rubbing it in to the Brits, that it takes an Irish genius like himself, to show them what can be done with their language. He also feels free to distort the King's English, and by extremely clever alliterations, homophonies, misspellings and lists he manages to poke quite cruel fun at the tool he wields with such virtuosity. He casts Irish art in the role of \\"cracked lookingglass of a servant.\\"I just mentioned lists, and God knows, there are so many in this book, some of full-page length. The whole novel reads like a veritable prose-poem. Think but of the Joycean line \\"A veil awave upon the waves.\\" In many places Joyce lapses into actual poems, most marvelously that \\"Ballad of the Joking Jesus\\" (supposedly borrowed in an abridged and altered form from his estranged friend Oliver St. John Gogarty, the model for the Buck Mulligan character in \\"Ulysses.\\") the first two lines of which I cannot resist writing down here,I'm the queerest young fellow that ever you heardMy mother's a Jew, my father's a bird.In the next two lines he refers negatively to \\"Joseph the Joiner\\" and one cannot miss the sharing of James Joyce's own initials with both those of the Divine Joking Jesus and of His holy mother's sainted husband.Along Leopold Bloom's Dublin wanderings deep issues are addressed: the dynamics of anti-Semitism, the difference between male and female sexuality, the patterns of married life, among others. In the latter context, a whole chapter is devoted to an extremely original, if far from provably correct analysis of William Shakespeare's marriage to Ann Hathaway. What is remarkable is that this analysis manages to shed light also on the problems in the Bloom marriage, with Leopold Bloom taking a different and much more forgiving attitude toward his wife's adultery than the bard.When dealing with sexuality, Joyce, in a serious novel written a mere decade after the Victorian age, does not shy away from the use of four-letter words, the detailed description of masturbation and of passionate intercourse, and quite some space is devoted to bodily functions. Indeed a crucial scene in the penultimate (\\"Ithaca\\") chapter ends with Leopold Bloom and Stephen Dedalus sealing their friendship by the quite homoerotic act of urinating together in the garden.Finally, maybe the most important influence this novel has had on modern literature is at the stylistic level. There can be little doubt that Vladimir Nabokov's exotic, if always so marvelously correct, word-choices owe a big debt to Joyce. The title character of one of Saul Bellow's famous novels shares the name of the minor character Moses Herzog in \\"Ulysses.\\" In \\"Ulysses\\" each chapter is written in a different style, here a romantic novel, there a tabloid newspaper, there a serious newspaper, now a play, then an unpunctuated stream of consciousness and so on. In \\"Herzog,\\" Bellow also mixes a basic narrative with the epistolary style of the letters despondent Herzog dispatches to all kinds of live and dead world leaders. The word \\"snot-green\\" invented by Buck Mulligan to describe the color of the Irish sea in the first chapter of \\"Ulysses\\" has made a comeback in twenty-first century novels, not to speak even of the use of four-letter words and explicit sexual scenes in serious modern fiction. To a certain extent, even the deeply moving poetic style of Tennessee Williams' marvelous plays seems indebted to a certain extent to Joyce.Above all, the stream of consciousness narration, which traces the free flow of the characters' thoughts rather than of their actions, has become a standard in modern fiction. Between the unexpected turns of these thoughts and the beauty of Joyce's use of the English language, one remains glued to \\"Ulysses\\" through its almost eight hundred pages, much as one would if he had spiced the story with all the trappings of a first rate thriller.As a practical piece of advice, use as I did a paperback edition, and tear it into some ten fascicles of seventy-eighty pages each. This way you can enjoy one of the major masterpieces of twentieth century literature without risking a hernia and/or a carpal tunnel syndrome."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The ultimate controversial book, maybe just behind the bible. Nothing can be said about it that hasn't already been discussed, and everything you may have already read about it is absolutely true: confusing read, snobbish pretentiousness, seminal masterwork, culmination of english literature, cult genius, modernist epitome, madman's soliloquy, beautiful narrative, a classic, waste of time, bag of crap. So it's just fair to rate it a well-deserved 3 stars, the just average to a work that can easily be described as sublime and profane, at the same time -- sometimes not even chapter to chapter but paragraph to paragraph.

I'm sure it has tons of allegorical layers but whats the good of that when you can't tell what the hell is even going on.It seems that for a book to be considered great it has to have layers of meanings hidden that are very hard to figure out. But I'm sure that half of these &quot;great&quot; books are written with a meaning intended by the author and then the critics and readers assume that there is some great meaning behind everything so they make up something just to make sure they don't look stupid.

Here there is way too much information when all the reader wants is to solve the plot and find out what happens.

I read it with the annotated version as a guide. It was work but it was fun work. Here are a few things people never talk about with Ulysses:1. It's a very, very funny book2. At it's heart, it's about a young man trying to recover from the death of his mother and a middle aged man trying to cope with his marital crisis and the buried sadness over his dead son and father. Nothing overly obscure or elitist or intellectual there, I don't think.3. The verbal pyrotechnics serve the story. Joyce wanted to describe one day and make it entertaining. All the literary references serve the purpose of adding richness, depth, timelessness and universality to a story about ordinary Dublin citizens wandering around on a warm early summer's day.4. Ultimately, this book is a love story--the least sentimental love story ever written but it's about Stephen's conflicted love for his mother, Molly and Poldy's conflicted love for each other, and Joyce's conflicted love for Ireland. The book is about, as Stephen says, \\"the affirmation of the human spirit\\". He's not being sarcastic when he says that.Ulysses is a novel in brilliant technicolor. I've read nearly all the major literary classics and they are all in black and white by comparison."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"When I started this book, I must admit it was slow going. I was never a big fan of Joyce. \\"Dubliners\\" was cold and a bit too precious for me. \\"Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\\" was likewise nothing to crap your pants over. So it was solely with a sense of responsibility to literary tradition that I finally opened my age-old copy of \\"Ulysses\\" to see what all the fuss was about.Immediately I hated it as I've hated few books before. Dense and uncommunicative. Sure it had stream of consciousness and all that - but this really was perfected by Faulkner, etc. - or so I thought.I kept reading - and reading and reading and reading. There came a time about 150 pages into this almost 700 page monster that I seriously considered doing my book physical harm. I thought of throwing it or ripping it or even burning it. However, good sense prevailed and I just kept at it.Then, the epiphany!Joyce's \\"Ulysses\\" doesn't just mirror Homer's epic but the reader actually reenacts it in the very process of understanding the book. Sure, the text is hard and Joyce doesn't take you by the hand - but it's meant to be that way. In the very difficult process of making meaning out of the text we become an integral part of the text and its meaning. The book is about the experience of literature more than it's about Mr. Bloom or Stephan Dedalus. In effect, you become Ulysses, yourself, and your very difficulties in understanding parallel the hero's difficulties finding his way home.What emerges after such a discovery is still a difficult and - at times - frustrating book. However, it is unquestionably a work of genius. Moreover, it goes far beyond the generation of stream of consciousness. The modes of communication are so varied here that each chapter almost reads like a new book. View points are important as well as the parallel structures they build cumulatively, however, the very mode of communication, itself, is of the story. Moreover, the honesty of the character portrayals is shocking. These are real people to a degree we rarely if ever see portrayed. We see everything Bloom does - from pontificate to use the bathroom.To anyone having difficulty with this book, I advise you keep reading. Promise yourself that you'll finish this book. Then you can hate or love it - whatever you want. Just finish.Now that Joyce actually makes sense, I wonder if I should go back to his early work or on to \\"Finnegan's Wake\\" - that monster of textuality that goes even further than \\"Ulysses.\\" I'm not sure I'm ready for that yet - but I will be. I will be."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Joyce is the most talented user of the English language since Shakespeare. His use of language is dazzling in its inventiveness and sophistication, and the sonic qualities of his writing are the equal of any poet. 'Ulysses' is rich, beautiful, moving, and evocative; the cleverness of the novel is associated with a profoundly human and humane sensibility.Often, this 'modernist' novel is contrasted with 'realist' novels, as though Joyce was doing something strange and different, but I don't think that's true - on the contrary, if a realist novel is one that communicates reality, then the stream-of-consciousness passages of 'Ulysses' are the high-water mark of the realist prose tradition, because they do something that no-one else has ever really managed - persuasively communicate his characters' experiences and thoughts from within. And there's more about the reality of Dublin life in 1904 than you would get from a dozen other novels of the period. He's not writing something other than a realist novel - he's doing it bigger and better than anyone else.BUT - it's not an easy read. The density of the prose makes it like reading poetry, and it's hard work just as reading an 800-page poem would be hard work. Furthermore, it's not all equally good; some of Joyce's experiments with language are less successful than others - the surrealist chapter springs to mind as a weak bit. When you're half-way through one of the less successful chapters, and it's both hard work *and* rather boring, it can feel a little bit like banging your head against a brick wall.So - know what you're getting yourself into. This book isn't for everyone, and you're not going to finish it in the course of a a one-week beach holiday in Marbella. But if you think you're up to it - have a go. It may just really annoy you. Or it may be the most rewarding book you'll ever read.Harry"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"While I think the Gabler edition of Ulysses is great, if you are looking to buy a new copy of it, please beware! In a class I taught, many students' books contained a considerable misprint in which 15 pages of episode 13 are reprinted in episode 14 (and 15 pages are missing from episode 14). The binding on recent printings is so poorly constructed, that within 4 weeks of class, 3/4 of my class's editions fell apart into a dozen clumps of roughly 50 pages each. We contacted the publisher, but Vintage customer service was indifferent to our problems. My own copy, from 1986, is still in one piece after years of use. If you want this edition (which I still recommend), try an older printing. Vintage's indifference to its own shoddy book production is unprofessional and inexcuasble. I'm posting this review Oct 2005, so I hope this warning will not be necessary at a future date."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I am glad that I read \\"Ulysses\\" by James Joyce as part of a graduate level course so that I had a professor who could explain all the intricacies and idiosyncracies of Joyce's masterpiece. Had I tried to read this novel on my own, I'm sure I would've given up very early on. Its stream-of-consciousness style not only defies the laws of narratrion, but Joyce expected his readers to be as intelligent as he was, which is just not the average case in today's society. It is easy to see why this novel has been the center of such controversy and praise ever since it was published; it truly stands alone in the pantheon of modern literature. As challenging and frustrating as it can be, it is a rewarding and intriguing read.So how does one sum up a nearly 800 page novel that follows the seemingly mundance events of one day (June 16, 1904) in Dublin, Ireland? \\"Ulysses\\" is the tale primarily of two men, Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom, whose paths propitiously cross late within the book. Stephen, a young intellectual, is stuck in an unrewarding job as a teacher. Bloom, a half-Jewish worker, is stuck in an unhappy marriage and who finds joy in the smallest and oddest of places. His day's journey through Dublin takes him to a funeral, a bar where he very nearly gets into a fight, a maternity ward, and a house of ill repute before he returns home for the evening. Along the way, readers are introduced to a wide cast of supporting characters who flesh out Bloom's adventures and play symbolic roles based on Homer's \\"The Odyssey\\". Readers are also given a vast insight into the history of the English language as well as questions that concern the very essence of humanity. The novel finishes with the perspective of Bloom's wife, Molly, who sheds some interesting light on Bloom's fears and presentiments.There is truly no other work like \\"Ulysses\\" in the history of the English novel and there will likely never be another quite like it. Joyce's command of the English language was phenomenal and his powers are at full display in chapter after chapter, whether in parodies of various writing styles or mocking the vapid putrescence of romantic literature. Leopold Bloom springs to life and his journey, while challenging and difficult, is definitely worth pursuing."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Five stars for Joyce and Ulysses, but boos to Amazon and Kindle, because the Kindle link provided with the ad for the Gabler edition leads to a Kindle version of the older Random House edition, which has many textual differences. Amazon, is the Gabler edition of Ulysses not available on Kindle? If it is not, please stop misleading your customers into thinking that it is. If it is available on Kindle, please replace the present Kindle link with the proper one. Thank you."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Of course it's difficult; it was meant to be so. However, Joyce's desire to keep critics writing about him by making Ulysses a dense read is not reason to disparage what he was capable of doing. Another reviewer states that the book has neither plot nor story; this is false and misleading.Ulysses is not for the faint-hearted nor for the prudish. Certainly it remains on college reading lists because of its multiple layers of meanings, which few readers, if any, can grasp at first reading. To understand everything probably requires multiple readings, secondary sources, and/or formal study. Also, reading the entirety of Homer's Odyssey is a great help, just for seeing the parallels Joyce was driving at. But many jokes and innuendoes can be understood immediately, and if you are truly reading the text, you can determine what is going on. But this is never a book that you can comprehend by merely skimming along, waiting for the narrative to clear everything up for you.The effort is worth it, but don't attempt it if your motive is simply to add another title to your \\"List of Important Books That I've Read.\\""},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses has got to be the most difficult thing I have ever read. Being as tough as it is to read, I can see why their is a lot of negative reviews about this book. Most people feel for a book to be good it has to be action packed and fastly paced with a bunch of characters that you like.Well Ulysses has really none of those things, unless you can identify with Bloom or Stephen then you'll probably like them. When you pick up Ulysses you need to get some help. I read the guide by Gilbert along with the text and it helped me a lot. Without a guide Ulysses can be even harder than than it normally is.You also should not expect any major or huge events to happen. Nobody dies or anything exciting like that.Lastly you need to get into a mindset that what your going to be reading is extremly hard, but with a little patience it can be extremly rewarding.Now, without further ado, I will review Ulysses. I gave the book five stars, but it is not an unqualified five star review. When reading Ulysses in it's entirety, some parts are classic while other parts just seem unneccesary. For example, the Hades episode is the best in the book and probably the best example of realistic writing in the english language. Most of the other episodes are also great, but a few are just a burden to read. The Oxen of the Sun episode in my opinion is pointless. Joyce seems to like the fact that he can write in middle english, so he does. I'm no expert on middle english, but it's damn hard to read and it disrupts any flow the book had. If you can sort out the slang at the end of Oxen of the Sun then I congragulate you, because it was totally lost on me. The Ithaca episode is another example. It is told with a series of questions and are answered in the most drawn out and scientific way possible. Maybe Joyce could have been best served using a diffrent style. Stephen's Shakespeare rant also seems unnecessary and the episode where Bloom is trying to sell an ad to the newspaper is hard to follow.Ever other episode is expertly written and is a delight to read. The pitfalls of a few episodes are more than made up for with the 14 or so episodes that are expertly written.What Joyce does with language in this book is amazing. He is a true master of the english language and a master of a multitude of diffrent styles. He writes magnificently but sometimes he can't seem to help but show off his skills.And to those who think this book is utterly impossible and if anyone says they finished this book is lying, well I swear to god in heaven that I read this book cover to cover. It was no easy task, it took me a long time, but I did finish it. I don't claim to come close to total comprehension but I did read it all the way through.I would recommend this book to anyone who isn't analytically challenged, has an attention span of at least one hour, and won't be offended if a writer changes styles every chapter. I highly recommend it. If you get through it you can be a literary snob for the rest of your life. Did you finish Ulysses, I did."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I suppose it is pretty hard to add anything to this monstrous string of reviews. But I will comment because (obviously like so many others) I found this book to be very important. The fact that so many reviews exist shows that this book has effected a lot of people (enough to expend their precious energies writing about it). As you can see, not many really ride the middle ground about it. People seem to love it passionately or they hate it passionately. This should be enough to recommend it to anyone. We all should be after books that are going to change us, challenge us, effect our lives and loves. This is a book that has done that for a great many people. If you have not read it, take the time. I do not think that you'll sit in your easy chair and say 'well, it was okay,' and flip on the television.Personally, I found the book to be lively and entertaining. It was also challenging and arduous. Sometimes I couldn't put it down and sometimes I couldn't pick it up. Sometimes I thought it was a stupid book and sometimes I thought it was the best work of fiction that I had read. Ulysses is overall 'real.' It discusses truth, it changes a lot, like life. All the characters can be seen as stable in their lives, yet metaphysically sort of lost and wandering. That is like Ulysses. It is also a lot like you and I. There are jarring events, changes of style, unexpected devices and layers and layers of erudition. There are also normal everyday joes going about life as usual, to which we can all relate. It was not easy, and that is like life, also. Like life, it has a lot to teach you. And you can come back to this book many times and still find it fresh. It probably will seem an entirely new beast when you return.Unlike some of the reviewers, I wouldn't recommend annotations. Trust yourself and trust Joyce in undertaking the work. Perhaps you'll miss things here or there. That is okay. You'll still 'get it,' in the end, if you make it. Part of it is seeing if you can make it, so you sort of fail in your test of yourself if you immediately resort to consulting some sort of 'dictionary of Joyce.' For anyone that sees this book as too daunting, let me just say that I'm not an English major or in a literature related field. I'm a music student, just a plain old undergraduate joe that read this book. I read the book without annotations except for one period where I was stuck and thought I didn't understand. I checked the annotations out from the library and I found that I did understand (at least as well as the annotator) and that I just needed to keep going to figure it out, just like in finding out how a Dickens plot is going to unfold. I would recommend against taking that step. Leave the annotations on the shelf. I'd recommend that you, another plain old non - literature joe or jane, try it. Trust yourself and try it."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"There is no reason in the world for me to write a review for this except to say \\"I READ IT\\". I live in the boonies of SE Oklahoma where there's not a soul who has heard of Joyce much less care whether anyone has read him or not. So, reader of Amazon's reviews, you're my (un)lucky audience. Not only did I read it, but I have not moved it to my \\"Trade\\" shelf. I want it as a reminder of how damned goofy I can be.If you are reading this because you are wondering whether to read it or not, then the answer is that you probably won't \\"get it\\" any more than I did.

He has to pass through many dangers, including the cave of the giant one-eyed cyclops and the magical woman who turns men into pigs, before he can return home to his faithful wife and free her from her unwanted suitors.Well, not exactly, as the car rental commercials say. Our hero is Leo Bloom, a Jew in Ireland married to an Irish sexpot named Mollie. The evil cyclops awaiting Leo is a big one-eyed antisemite, and the cave is a bar. The woman who turns men into pigs is a dominatrix. The faithful wife is in bed right now with a man named Blazes Boylan. And our droll hero is avoiding home because he gets a perverse pleasure out of the whole situation.Then there's the language of James Joyce. Buss her, wap in rogue's rum lingo, for, O, my dimber wapping dell. isn't whether or not to get the Cliff Notes, the question is which to read first, one chapter at a time, the book or the explanation. If you read the book first, you're giving yourself the chance to get it yourself. If you read the notes first, you'll have a much better idea what you're reading.In a book that sometimes makes you dislike humanity, as when some stupid antisemite (there are many, in fact almost everyone) gives Leo a little dig, the single most beautiful moment comes in the 14th chapter. I'm not referring to Send us, bright one, light one, Horhorn, quickening and wombfruit, or to Hoopsa, boyaboy, hoopsa! The most beautiful writing in the book is when Mrs Purefoy has her baby.Reverently look at her as she reclines there with the motherlight in her eyes, that longing hunger for baby fingers (a pretty sight it is to see), in the first bloom of her new motherhood, breathing a silent prayer of thanksgiving to One above, the Universal Husband. And as her loving eyes behold her babe she wishes only one blessing more, to have her dear Doady there with her to share her joy, to lay in his arms that mite of God's clay, the fruit of their lawful embraces. He is older now (you and I may whisper it) and a trifle stooped in the shoulders....And Doady, knock the ashes from your pipe... You too have fought the good fight and played loyally your man's part. Sir, to you my hand. Well done, thou good and faithful servant!It makes you think that life might be worth living after all, and that maybe God will one day say the same to you."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"As an undergraduate, I tried and failed to read James Joyce's Ulysses the conventional way - I think it took me six months to finish chapter 1. Having treated myself to the audiobook, I can say that it's a completely different experience - Jim Norton's and Marcella Riordan's masterful recording really brings the text to life. On a purely practical level, the lengthy stream-of-consciousness bits make a whole lot more sense when they're read with the intonations of natural speech, and the variation in vocal tone makes it much easier to stay engaged in sections that otherwise tend towards the soporific. Most impressive are the 'voices' Jim Norton does for all the different characters - Stephen Dedalus's 'thoughts' are all done in a low-pitched deadpan monotone that perfectly captures his personality, while Buck Mulligan is loud, brash and has a much stronger Irish accent (this difference in volume is large enough to be a potential problem for someone listening through headphones). Norton's skill is particularly noticeable in 'ensemble' scenes such as the library, where he has to switch voice every couple of lines. I've got the Oxford Classics edition of the book (1922 text) and it's almost identical to the recording - very occasionally there's a word or two that's different. This time round I'm actually really enjoying Ulysses - who would've thought."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I've read the reviews. I've seen the complaints. &quot;It doesn't mean a thing... I can't understand it... It's just a bunch of drivel...&quot; All are opinions that anyone who has read the book is certainly entitled to. As for all the scholars out there who say that there are hidden meanings in every sentence, well, that's your opinion too. And you're more than welcome to scour &quot;Ulysses&quot; for the rest of your natural life looking for pieces to Joyce's grand puzzle. But I'm going to offer something a little different - those who would scour the novel for such meanings are missing the point in almost the same way as those who toss it aside as incomprehensible.In &quot;Ulysses&quot;, we are given access to the inner-consciousness of Stephen Dedalus, Leopold Bloom, and Molly Bloom. They are normal people living ordinary lives in early 20th century Dublin. They go to work, go to the bathroom, walk the streets, greet people, and think about their lives. They mull over details of their own lives that are so personal to them that they could mean nothing to anyone else. And if you think about it, isn't that what we all do? If someone were to open up your head and read your thoughts, they might say the same thing - &quot;What the heck is this?&quot; But we also consider the things that affect us all; love, death, loss, and hate, among others. Those are the thoughts that would carry weight and meaning for anyone, and the characters in &quot;Ulysses&quot; ponder these things as we all might. We cannont completely become them, and thus we cannot completely understand everything they think of. But they hit upon enough major truths so that there is meaning for anyone. Their adventures through Dublin would have made an interesting story on their own - being able to see inside their minds takes the novel to a completely different level."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Why do people who don't like Ulysses always lambaste those who do? You have every right to like and dislike what you please, and so do I. Why the name calling? I wouldn't call myself an intellectual and I'm certainly no \\"literary luminary,\\" but I love the book. For me, it's not about mythic parallels or stylistic experimentation or esoteric theories of art-it's about the richness, the absolute miracle, of human experience. Whatever else you can say about Joyce's intent, he wanted to show us life. And every time, for example, Bloom wonders whether black reflects or refracts light, I see life-the sort of life (banal, uncertain, driven by the demands of the flesh, often a joy, sometimes thankfully relieved by humor) that I live. Joyce (I think) succeeded in giving us a very simple but profound truth: every moment of life is sacred. Eternity, heaven and hell, God, the whole shebang, are right here around and within us all the time. And we spend 99% of our time distracting ourselves in one way or other.Bring your sense of humor! (it's supposed to be a comedy), and a little patience. The more you read it, the more you get out of it."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I am writing this review on the 100th anniversary of the most famous day in the life of the wandering Jewish Dubliner Leopold Bloom, who was created by James Joyce and immortalized in Ulysses. \\"Bloomsday,\\" as this day is called in some circles, prompted me to once again revisit this vast, difficult, and important book.I should note that I have only read Ulysses from cover to cover once, and that was more than 15 years ago. But I refer to it and re-read parts of it periodically, even though the years appear to have dampened some of my enthusiasm for this brick of a book.The more I think about Ulysses, the more I decide that most of the value of reading and understanding the book (two very different things, by the way) comes from its ambition and the impact it has had on 20th century literature. This is the work that -- probably to the chagrin of literature students everywhere -- more or less invented the stream of consciousness style of literature, and which literary historians say marked the start of the modern era in English literature. The narrative, a nearly 800-page examination into the events in Leopold Bloom's life on June 16, 1904, is dense but also very compelling, and the language is often crisp and colorful.Unfortunately, the language is even more often a bizarre maze of metaphors, references, and descriptions so inaccessible that some scholars think they may contain some kind of secret code. At one point, the erotic and deflating soliloquy of Molly Bloom (Leopold's wife) takes up something like 25,000 words unmarred by a single punctuation mark -- a section long enough to be published separately as a novella.Without a doubt, a similar book written today by an unknown talent would never find its way the shelves of the neighborhood Books-A-Million without first shedding 300 or 400 pages under the red ink of some unfortunate editor. There's also little doubt that the modern literary cannon is better off for the fact that that didn't happen when Mr. Joyce produced this seminal work. Readers are also better off, but only the ones willing to work at it."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I started reading Ulysses with the help of the annotations, but soon left those behind. The horror stories that I had heard of the difficulty of the book were unfounded, and I enjoyed every moment of the text. Having read the Dubliners and Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, I was used to Joyce's style, or so I thought. But in Ulysses I discovered that stream of consciousness could be taken to a new and deeper level. Joyce did not mean for us to grasp every allusion, therefore annotations are not really necessary. By reading Ulysses, I also managed to gain a new insight into the Odyssey, and found new undertones withing Homer's work. People had told me that at the age of 16 and 17 it would be impossible to read Ulysses. I disagree. Length does not make a book more difficult to read -- Walden Pond is, at times, harder to understand than Ulysses. When I finished Ulysses, I felt an emptiness, for I had been living in the mind of Leopold Bloom. It was as if part of me had been taken away. In the future, I will definitely reread Ulysses, and I recommend it to anyone who loves literature. It is a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This review is for people that have not read this novel and are frightened by it.Greatest novel of all time, blah blah blah. Forget the academic wankery that has encased this novel like a black, shiny coffin. Joyce never meant this novel to be read with reverential nods and oh so serious frowns. This is a novel that is bursting with atmosphere and life.In its essence, this novel attempts two major tasks: to inflate one utterly ordinary day in the life of a human being to epic proportions, and to do so by undertaking a different writing-experiment for each chapter.The \\"epic inflation\\" aspect is absolutely fascinating. Mr Leopold Bloom spends an entire day wandering around Dublin for a bit, then comes back home. Absolutely nothing \\"epic\\", in the usual sense, actually occurs here. He encounters a spiritual son in the form of the slightly malnourished, youthful, pseudo-intellectual Stephen Dedalus...but the encounter doesn't really lead anywhere.Rather, it is the point of the novel to inflate the simple things in life to something epic. Taking the Odyssey as its skeleton (and you really should be familiar with the Odyssey before attempting this book), Joyce turns each tiny incident during the day (in pretty much \\"real time\\") into an epic event with its own incredible atmosphere and drama. Even Bloom sitting on the toilet, going to the post-office, or drinking instant chocolate become massive epic events.To some degree this is slightly self-mocking. However, the novel makes you see your own life in a slightly different way. Maybe there are no \\"dull\\" days in our lives; from a certain point of view even the most mundane stuff, like dropping off something at the post office, or drinking Ovaltine, becomes miraculous.Secondly, there is the experimentation. The fact that each chapter is a totally different experiment gives you a real sense of curiosity about the novel. What is coming next? Stream of consciousness wackiness? A play? Random newspaper headlines? The division of the book into different experiments means that, even if you don't like one chapter, you can read on in the hopes that the next chapter will be more to your taste.Think of it as being like a concept album. Even if you don't dig Within You Without You, When You're Sixty-Four is just around the corner.Overall, I liked the atmosphere of the novel. Even if sometimes you don't totally get what's happening, you get a strong sense of Dublin c. 1904, with people lunching on gorgonzola sandwiches and sherry at pubs, people wandering along Sandymount Strand and buying sweets, people going to the turkish bath and buying scented soap.There is also the unmistakeable tang of the Homeric Aegean. Dublin is near the sea, like Troy, and you don't forget it. Whether wandering the sandy beach, eating headless sardines from a tin, or watching drunken soldiers wandering along the street at night, the sea is never far away.Don't be put off this book. Wallow away in something that is truly an epic \\"show about nothing\\". Speaking of which, what is this book comparable to in the modern world?\\"Seinfeld\\", with its excruciating minutiae about life in New York City being raised to the mock-epic level, whether it's George lying about his job or Elaine wondering if a rabbi is gossiping about her.\\"Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\", with its exuberant, youthful experimentation with the very bedrock of music albeit with a playful unpretentiousnessmost oddly, \\"24\\", with real time coverage of events in such a way that every single hour has something epic happening in it."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses is great fun. It takes a bit more work to read than most books, just as it takes a bit more work to play tennis than it does to play catch. You shouldn't feel compelled to put the work in, any more than you should feel compelled to learn an unusually difficult sport. But people who do put the work in and who have a good time doing it shouldn't be made to feel guilty about it either. It's a pleasure to follow the interweaving lines of the Sirens chapter, for instance, and anyone who does it will see that the chapter is alive in a way that almost nothing else is in literature. Joyce is a terrific comic writer and a terrific creator of vivid, complicated characters. But he requires the reader to put in some extra effort to enjoy how good he is, and I can't blame anyone who gives up after a few pages and refuses to go any further. On the other hand, I've noticed that people who don't like Joyce's approach seem to want to attack people who do. This is silly. Again, it's like hating people for playing basketball just because you prefer skateboarding. Both the Joyce lovers and the Joyce haters should lighten up a bit."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"A book deserving to be thoroughly studied and a milestone in development of English language currently known, but a common reader like me can afford but a hasty and superficial eagle eye, and most references and connections would have been lost to me without the diagram by Stuart Gilbert quoted in the introduction of Penguin edition.A full and unique mastership of language results in a wonderful balance between fictional and technical , at ease with each employed style besides the contrasts between the different narrative techniques employed in the various chapters, which depicts the wide variety of microcultures composing the fragmented Irish society during British occupation.Many years ago I read a book, whose title The Cardinal, by Henry Morton, about the career of a Catholic American priest with Irish origins. The first half of the book is set in the Boston Irish community, and I have been impressed by how many \\"Irishnesses\\" in the book (which I read in an Italian translation) can be traced back to Joyce's Ulysses (I still remember the pun Rows of Cast Steel = Rose of Castille).An example of how a local tale becomes universal literature, and a mandatory step in understanding English language."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I think there is one sentence in Ulysses that sums up Joyce's intention perfectly: \\"Any object, intensely regarded, may be a gate of access to the incorruptible eon of the gods.\\"This really is a great book, full of humor and insight and what I can only describe as those little sparks of recognition you get when you see your own life in great literature. And I think it even has something akin to a real spiritual revelation we desperately need in the West (see the quote above). But there's no denying that Joyce was a sadist, linguistically speaking. Like all Irish writers I've ever read about, Joyce had mixed feelings about English. It was not his true native language and, while he loved it, he was always knew that it was a kind of shackle on his country. The issue comes up in A Portrait (when young Stephen bristles that he knows the language better than the English priest who's teaching it) and it reappears very early in Ulysses.At breakfast, Haines confounds the old milk woman with his speech in Irish (it's French, for all she knows). In his mind, Stephen associates the old woman with all of Ireland, and Haines' command of the Irish language is emblematic of his status as conqueror (he's conquered the land and assimilated the language, and now he's come to plunder the culture! Haines is in Ireland to collect folk tales). Joyce may not have embraced the Irish cause like many of his contemporaries, but he had his own more subtle form of revolt. He wanted to bind the English speaking world with one of it's own shackles. In Richard Ellman's biography, someone tells Joyce he demands too much of his readers. He flatly replies that his only demand was that his readers spend their whole lives reading him. He wanted to make us all slaves! Just read those two mind-bending sentences near the beginning of the Oxen of the Sun chapter and imagine what sadistic pleasure Joyce must have felt writing them. You can almost hear him shout, \\"take that!\\" And any time you come to a particularly difficult section of the book, just imagine Joyce there beside you saying, \\"Hey, don't look at me. It's YOUR language.\\"I'm sure what throws most people is the third chapter that begins \\"Ineluctable modality of the visible...\\" Up to then, things have been pretty clear, except for the occasional shifts from dialogue to thought, which Joyce does without giving us those helpful little \`he said's and \`he thought's. He doesn't even give us quotation marks (he didn't use them because he thought they were ugly, by the way). We've seen-and \\"seen\\" is the key word...we have not been told by a narrator...it's as if we are there watching it all-we've seen Stephen have breakfast in the tower, walk with Mulligan and Haines to the bathing area, teach his class, and talk with Deasy. But suddenly we find ourselves inside his head along with Kant, Schopenhaur, Shakespeare, Milton, the Bible, the Catholic Mass, early Christian heresies, Irish mythology, on and on. It gets confusing to say the least.Do you have to know as much about all this stuff as Stephen to understand the book? It probably wouldn't hurt, but I certainly don't. The main thing is to understand that STEPHEN understands it all, and yet he is still struggling. His mother has died and he's asking a simple question, \\"what does it all mean?\\" This is the question of the book. What does life mean? How should one live? The answer the book gives is: life begins when you understand that we are all one. Stephen and Bloom, two completely different people, are one. Religion, myth, and all the great symbols that spring up across the globe are so similar because human life is essentially the same everywhere. Joyce told a friend that he chose The Odyssey as a model for his own book because Homer created the most complete character in all of literature: Odysseus is a father, a husband, a lover, a warrior, a politician. In short, he is Bloom: a completely ordinary man. Joyce showed us that ordinary life, \\"intensely regarded\\", is the stuff of myth.It's not always easy (although much of it is, if you read carefully...and compared to Finnegans Wake it's practically Dr. Seuss). But it's well worth the effort."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses is one of those big, mad bellwethers of a book that X will tell you is the biggest, best, most important blah blah blah and Y will tell you is a load of badly written tripe. Neither X nor Y tend to notice that the book consciously encourages both responses...but, well, I'll get back to the academic riffing in a minute.I first tried to read Ulysses aged about 14 (I was an annoying little boy that way) and didn't get very far. The first three chapters are set in and around the mind of Stephen Dedalus, one of the most ridiculously clever and over-educated characters ever conceived, as he takes breakfast with some friends, teaches in a school some miles south of Dublin and walks along a beach. Along the way, his mind ruminates on subjects as diverse as 16th century underworld slang, his dead mother, and something he calls &quot;the ineluctable modality of the visible&quot; which I'm still struggling with. But he's a curiously ambiguous character, this Stephen; he fancies himself as a poet and rebel but when, on the beach, he picks his nose, he has a quick look around to see that nobody's watching before he smears the snot on a rock. (Joyce likes to poke fun at pretension this way - although he doesn't suggest that Stephen's ideas or rebel stance are completely hollow, either.)The 14-year-old me didn't get that far. I gave up. It wasn't until I was 19 or so that I got as far as chapter four and encountered a Mr. Bloom, pottering around the kitchen making breakfast, that I started to get a grip. Bloom is one of the most likeable characters in fiction. He's a quiet, rather shy, oddly intelligent advertising salesman married to a voluptuous siren of a wife, Molly. Either you're prepared to go the distance with Bloom, or else cast the book aside with a hollow oath, because he's about to spend the entire day walking around Dublin. Nothing will happen except that a man will be buried, a baby will get born, and Bloom will help Stephen when the latter gets into a drunken fracas with some British soldiers. (Ireland was still part of the Union in 1904, and Dublin was a garrison town. Many non-Irish readers concentrate on Joyce's innovation or wit or technical whatever, but Joyce is extremely historically aware, and Ulysses, like all his other books, is riddled with the traces of English domination. These add to the book, rather than diminish it.)Readers who like those clanky, tinpot contraptions known as &quot;plots&quot; may get a tad frustrated. Leaving aside Joyce's gifts for parody (a _tad_ too indulged, in my opinion), the, if you like, human interest in Ulysses is in the details of the to-ing and fro-ing between the characters. A quite banal conversation turns out to have all sorts of fascinating undercurrents; Bloom, who is Jewish and therefore even more of an outsider than Stephen, is extremely good at detecting the hints and shifts in the tones of the people he meets. He keeps running into two things that cause him particular discomfort: anti-Semitic remarks, and reminders that his wife is about to sleep with another man.Ulysses is about language, but that makes it sound like it's some godawful lumbering doorstop written by an English professor. (John Barth, come on down!) It doesn't feel abstract at all; it's full of sights (the band of old sweat inside Bloom's hat), smells (restaurants, horse urine, flowers) and especially sounds (cats, printing presses, trams). I can't think of any other book which transports you so completely to a different place and time. (It might've helped that I grew up in Dublin and knew most of the places that Joyce is writing about.) Borges described Joyce's prose style, at least in the earlier half of the book, as &quot;strong and delicate&quot; and that's a good description.As the day wears on, the book starts to rumble at the foundations and it lurches with increasing unpredictability from style to style. Joyce is making a point about language; that things are altered by the manner in which we describe them. This can get a bit wearisome after a while, but when it works well - as in the chapter where the doings of a young girl on a beach are narrated in the style of a girl's magazine story - it can be very funny and rather touching. The book closes with a mighty tour de force as Molly Bloom sits up and thinks about her life and her curious husband.Okay, that's the beginner's guide. My personal opinion? It's the best Irish book, a constant wonder, irritation and delight to read, and a stunning effort of imagination and intelligence by the most significant and most lavishly talented Irish writer. 20th and 21st century Irish culture is unthinkable without it. I'm grateful that it's there. What else is to be said?"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I picked this up for a group read of Ulysses. I figured it would be convenient to have it on the computer so I could look up all the references I didn't understand, and the price was certainly right. Unfortunately, as I came to realize, this edition of the book is missing pieces of text. I probably wouldn't have noticed this, except that when I googled one of the references that I didn't get, I came up with a preview of a book called Ulysses Annotated, which describes in detail the meaning of all the references. As I read, I noticed that in several places there were references noted that I hadn't seen in the text. Finally, I got annoyed and googled the exact line that preceded an area of missing text, and found that some lines of verse had been omitted from my edition of the book. It's a shame, since I was enjoying the clear formatting and the ease of use that the Kindle edition was giving me, but since it's not really a book that I want to spend money on, I guess I'll be giving Project Gutenberg's version a try."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Stuff you probably want to know:1. It's read by two people: one guy, who does absolutely everything (including Molly) up till the last chapter, then the last chapter, which is read entirely by a woman.2. The guy is supremely talented at reading. It's a dramatic reading, in which he imitates the voices of the others and tries to get into it. I would regard his imitation of the voices of others as supremely believable.3. He has a light British accent (London), but switches to a convincing Irish brogue when reading straight spoken dialogue for most characters. Excellent French and Latin pronunciation. His Italian and Spanish are less successful. The woman is certifiably Irish.4. There are no sound effects (footsteps, keys, etc.), but there are a few songs interlarded, usually at the beginning of each CD.5. If you're a Joyce scholar, you are doubtless using the Gabler edition of 1986, WHICH WASN'T THE EDITION USED FOR THIS. I think they're actually using the 1922 edition! Anyhow, this is a constant irritant for serious Joyce fanatics, as, since you are doubtless using Gabler, there'll be something in almost every paragraph that's just a whit different. It's a constant distraction, alas!6. He reads it a little fast for my taste (especially in Circe).7. Yes, it is totally unabridged.8. There are 22 CD's total.9. You should buy it. I had read Ulysses twice before I got it, and going through it with this CD set really opened up the book to me, in a way I couldn't have gotten with any other type of ancillary aid. It was like reading the book for the first time! Wasn't so incomprehensible after all!I should warn you that one thing you might find thoroughly infuriating is that the title tracks / id tags of the CD tracks are totally in chaos. It's so bizarre, it smacks of sabotage. (For example, the title track of the 1st track of the 2nd (!) CD is: \\"Time for lunch. 1 p.m. After Dignam's funeral . . .\\" While the actual content is the \\"ineluctable modality of the visible\\" passage. It's craaaaazy!Rest assured, this is just the names your computer sees: everything is there, and in the correct order. My point is that if you plan on porting everything over to your iPod, you're gonna have some tedious clerical work ahead of you."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"O.k. to start with...for all of you out there who are interested in reading &quot;Ulysses&quot; but are intimidated by all of the rest of you out there who say it's unreadable, take my advice. Read this book. It's absolutely ridiculous to say this book can't be read. I can't say you're going to find it interesting or enjoyable, but you can read it.There are people who would have you believe you have to wage a massive campaign of pre-&quot;Ulysses&quot; study before delving into Joyce's novel. I've heard it's necessary to read biographies of Joyce, read all of his other literature, read about the history of Dublin, read Greek mythology...even study Dublin city maps!!! Don't you believe any of this. &quot;Ulysses&quot; is perfectly approachable having read none of the above. I admit that reading &quot;Portrait of the Artist&quot; first is helpful, and at least having some passing knowledge of &quot;The Odyssey&quot; won't hurt, but being familiar with these other works will only help you appreciate some of Joyce's nuances. Being unfamiliar with them will not prevent you from digesting &quot;Ulysses.&quot;Now, for the book itself. Is &quot;Ulysses&quot; good? That's become an almost irrelevant question to ask. Do you have to like &quot;Ulysses?&quot; No. Do you have to admit that it is the greatest novel ever written? No. Anyone denying that the book was influential in altering the course of literature would just be foolish. However, I don't think &quot;Ulysses&quot; is the be-all and end-all of 20th Century literature, and the new ground that Joyce broke would have been broken anyway had he not done it first. He was certainly an innovator, but other authors (Faulkner comes to mind) use Joyce's modernist approach to fiction and do it better.For ultimately, Joyce is a lousy storyteller. Notice I did not say he is a lousy writer. One can't deny the absolute mastery of language apparent in &quot;Ulysses.&quot; But Joyce is almost completely unable to connect with his reader. Parts of this novel come close to doing just that, but in between there are vast numbers of pages of dull, dull prose that set out to be as incomprehensible as possible. What was Joyce afraid of? Was he scared that what he actually had to say wasn't either particulary interesting or profound, so he had to bury it underneath layer after layer of obscure allusions and writing styles? I didn't understand every part of &quot;Ulysses,&quot; and I don't believe all of these so-called Joyce experts do either, despite the massive amount of critical study done about it. However, understanding every single part of the novel and understanding the novel are two different things, and I believe I understood &quot;Ulysses.&quot; And what I found is that it's not the beast everyone's made it out to be, but neither is it particulary interesting or profound.In short, I would recommend that everyone read &quot;Ulysses,&quot; if for no other reason than that you can have an opinion on it. I won't be reading it again, so I guess I'll have to just live in ignorance of all the hidden delights Joyce offers his readers. I neither loved it or hated it---there are many books I've enjoyed reading less and many more books I've enjoyed reading much more. Before reading &quot;Ulysses&quot; I was reluctant to state that I didn't like Joyce's writing, feeling that any opinion about Joyce without having read his masterwork would be uneducated. Well, I've read the damn thing now, and I can state with a very educated opinion: &quot;I do not like Joyce's writing.&quot;"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I have frequently heard Ulysses proclaimed the best book ever written, but I could never understand why. I purchased this edition of the novel three years ago, and since then it sat on my shelf, a mighty 900 page undertaking that I kept putting off. I was reluctant to read it, for I have often heard how difficult it was to get through. Finally, I have read it, and though I believe it presumptuous to call any one book \\"the best book of all time\\", I certainly believe that Ulysses could claim that title. First off, it is not a difficult read. If you could get through A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, you can get through Ulysses. I heartily recommend this edition because of the brilliant introduction by Declan Kibard. Before I read Ulysses, I could not understand how this could be the best book of all time. According to my understanding, it was a novel detailing, in 900 pages, one day in the life of a Jewish Irishman, Leopold Bloom. A totally unremarkable day at that. After reading Kibard's introduction, I was fiercely eager to begin the novel. In his introduction, totally some 70 pages, Kibard answers the precise question I had: Why would this book be called the best of all time? This book is never boring, and is actually a quite enjoyable read. It is arranged in 18 chapters, and to me, the most astounding aspect of this piece of literature is the fact that every chapter is written in a different style. Joyce wanted to show that \\"originality\\" in terms of style was merely a new arrangement of previous styles, and so shows his brilliance as a writer by changing his technique and method completely in each chapter. It is indeed difficult to believe they were written by the same person. The styles are listed as: Narrative (Young), Catechism (Personal), Monologue (Male), Narrative (Mature), Narcissism, Incubism, Enthymemic, Peristaltic, Dialectic, Labyrinth, Fuga per canonem, Gigantism, Tumescence detumescence, Embryonic development, Hallucination, Narrative (Old), Catechism (Impersonal), Monologue (Female). Some chapters, such as the Cyclops, done in Gigantism, are deliciously satirical and overdone, while others, such as the Lotus-eaters, are sharp and direct. Though Joyce is often called a \\"stream of consciousness writer\\", only a few chapters are the truly chaotic stream of consciousness, such as the Oxen of the Sun, the Proteus, and the Sirens. The culmination of absurdity and abstraction occurs in the massive Circe chapter, a play styled as a hallucination in the brothels of Dublin. This novel is nearly impossible to take in with just one reading, and I will be reading it again shortly. On this note, I would say that I heartily recommend reading Ulysses straight through in its original form, rather than labouring under the weight of the hefty annotated edition. A true masterpiece, one of the best books I've ever read, and yes, quite possibly the best book ever written."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The eBook is missing text. I also have a print edition, but I wanted a copy I could read on my phone when i had the time. The part I noticed is missing is the Ballad of Joking Jesus.

When I was 16 or so, I tried to find Ulysses in the St. Cloud Technical High School Library. It was listed in the card catalog, but it was never on the shelves. Finally, I asked the prim-and-proper old biddy librarian where the book was. She fairly shuddered and asked me with a cockeyed combination of excitement and accusation &quot;why&quot; I wanted to read it. I told her I'd heard it was a great book and so please hand it over. Sure enough, it was in a back room and the old battleaxe crept forth with the book, jacketed in a beautiful red. At home I opened it and tried to make sense out of the first page. I dipped around in it and finally threw it hard as I could against the wall of my bedroom. &quot;This is gibberish junk!&quot; I said to myself. Later, I kept hearing more about the book and thought, &quot;well, maybe I'm just dumb,&quot; which really teed me off. One day I found a book called &quot;Re-Joyce&quot; by Anthony Burgess (of Clockwork Orange fame). He was a Joyce fanatic and wrote a book about how to read Ulysses. And so I read Re-Joyce as I read Ulysses and, wonder of wonders, what an experience! That was back in 1965. I still read Ulysses. It's the one book I re-read more than any other. Oh, and when I look back, way back to my high school library, I know now how Joyce would have roared with merriment at that biddy librarian. He would have been honored in his sly way to see his naughty book kept behind that bun-haired spinster's iron petticoats. Don't give up on Ulysses! Get the Burgess book as a guide, or the Gilbert guide. But don't give up. Riches, great riches, await you!"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I have listened in the past to the taped rendition of Ulysses, and I pushed my way through it for the bragging rights. This new version is just so superb and so amazing in its vitality.While at times Ulysses is still a challenge to grasp, I can guarantee that the whole book is much more comprehensible, and wonderful, to hear it read so well. It suddenly makes sense.As a by-the-way, the Naxos packaging is second only to Apple's iPod in the pleasure I got from handling it and opening it."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"You ever hear that old adage about \\"what don't kill you, makes you stronger\\"? Well, struggling through Ulysses is kinda like that. If you haven't taken a bottle of pain relievers mid-point through the book or perhaps just sprained your wrists trying to hold aloft the 768 page tome, you might just start to understand the methods behind Joyce's madness. But understanding doesn't equal enjoyment.Ulysses, one of the most celebrated and challenging books in the English language has been reduced to one of two things: to the general public, a curiosity, a book of importance that no one would really read or: to Lit majors: the equivalent of a double-dog dare among the Lit-Crit crowd; a book professors assign in order to weed out the weak, who more than likely change majors to something less demanding, like quantum physics. Inevitably, in both circles it has become a book to be endured, not enjoyed.What is the book about? Joyce, a master of the written word *does* appear to have a lot to say about everything, including, but not limited to, religion, politics, sex, and literature. But if there is a flaw in the book (and indeed, it could be argued that the flaw lies with the reader, not the author), it's that Joyce seems more preoccupied with how his story is told, losing sight of the actual subjects. Ulysses is really about WRITING, it seems, and in particular, how well Joyce can do it. The skill involved in the writing often attains that genius status, but too often it feels strangely hollow, a series of breathlessly staged feats of writing skill. In other words, he's showboating.Still, despite Joyce's blatant shouts of \\"look at me!\\", many moments of passion do leak through. Particularly impressive is the final 40 pages or so which takes on a confessional tone that at last attempts to engage the reader emotionally, instead of keeping them at a distance.Reading Ulysses is difficult, to be sure. Joyce drops more obscure references than Dennis Miller after three highballs. Joyce assumes you've read The Odyssey, Dante's The Divine Comedy, the Bible, Hamlet, and, of course the dictionary. He also assumes that you have a passing knowledge of about 6 or 7 languages. But, even if you do have prior knowledge of said works and you know Latin, it cannot help make Ulysses as a whole, an engaging, vital work. It is a towering achievement, yes, but much more of a textbook on writing, which just happens to use the characters of Stephen Daedalus and Leopold Bloom as examples of the styles that Joyce writes in.All said and done though, I would recommend this book as it is unique and it is one of those titles that, like childbirth, has to be experienced to be understood.I would also recommend Joyce's Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man as a superior work of art. It's just as inventive, it's moving and passionate, and it says what it has to say before wearing out it's welcome."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The Orchises Press edition stands out for three reasons. The first is that it reproduces--with impressive attention to detail--the first edition of Joyce's novel. The second reason is that the large, widemargined pages add the pleasure of reading to the pleasure of reading Ulysses (there is something missing, after all, in the insubstantial, tinytype levity of the paperback editions). Finally, the weight of the paper, the strength of the binding makes this edition one that will last (and you will not, as with the paperback editions, be forced to transcripe all your notes from a book that falls apart after three readings). For those who seek the &quot;authenticity&quot; of a first edition, who admire Joyce or who will be studying the novel for years to come, this is the edition to buy."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"James Joyce (1882-1941) was a tormented Roman Catholic who forsook his faith, picked up his pen and wrote the great novel \\"Ulysses\\" based on the epic poem \\"The Odyssey\\" by Homer. It is impossible to explain Ulysses or give it an adequate review in the short space alloted this reviewer. Howwver, I would offer the following thoughts for those brave souls eager to enter the labyrinthal complexities of a genius's mind:Joyce tells the story of one day in the life of the people of Dublin, Ireland on June 16, 1904 (the day he first met his wife Nora Baracle). As he does so in eighteen chapters linked with similar episodes in \\"The Odyssey.\\" During the day (about 900 pages) we follow the two chief characters on their peregrinations and adventures. Those characters are:Stephen Dedalus-Named for the Greek mytholgical figure Dedalus who builds wings to fly in the sky; his son Icarus flies too close to the sun and perishes while Dedalus lands in Sicily. Stephen was the chief character in Joyce's \\"The Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man.\\" He is tormented by his failure to pray at his dying mother's bedside; tormented by the Roman Catholic Church's burden of guilt laid upon his soul. Stephen is an aspiring author. He is ambivalent in his feelings toward his native Ireland. As the novel begins he is living in the English built castleThe Martello Tower along with his friend Buck Mulligan and an Englishman named Haines. Stephen is a teacher who is supervised by the horrible Deasy a West Englishman who in an Orange Protestant. Deasy is a false Nestor to the callow Stephen. Stephen is an intellectual with biographical correspondence to the author James Joyce.Leopold Bloom-A 38 year old advertising man who is married to the sensuous Molly. Bloom is a middlebrow who roams the streets of Dublin plying his advertising career engaging in arguments, dreaming about a sexy young thing on the beach and saving Stephen from trouble in the famous Nighttime section of the book. Leopold does not practice his Judaism. His father was a Hungarian Jewish immigrant. The novel ends with Bloom returning home to his unfaithful wife Molly just as Odysseus returned home to his faithful wife Penelope in the Homeric epic. Bloomsday is celebrated worldwide on Feb. 2 each year (the date of Joyce's birth in 1882).c. Molly Bloom-Her nearly fifty pages of stream of consciousness prose was until recently the longest sentence in the English language. She is a coarse, bawdy, serially cheating wife to Bloom.I do not claim to understand everything going on in Ulysses. Joyce said it would take the professors and critics centuries to explore its rich minefield of literary allusions, jokes, and analysis of the human condition. Ulysses has been banned and blasted by literary critics as the same time it has been praised. You may find out yourself by giving it a close reading with a good commentary handy. Joyce plums the depths of the human mind. He is a great Irish genius whose work demands study."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The best edition of what's considered by many the apotheosis of English fiction. As mentioned in the front matter, \\"this book reproduces, as closely as offset printing will allow, Roger Lathbury's copy of the first edition of Ulysses published by Sylvia Beach's Shakespeare and Company in Paris in 1922. Broken type, signature numbers, and the colophon have been left as printed.\\" Editorial slip-ups are therefore obviously included, adding a quaint historical nuance.The perfect gift for any fan of Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom, this edition is elegant, a pleasure to hold and read, and ideal for anyone new to and wishing to appreciate Ulysses. (Most mass market editions, while well edited, are otherwise cheap products.)Two outstanding aids for appreciating Ulysses areWings of Art: Joseph Campbell on James Joyce, and Stuart Gilbert'sJames Joyce's Ulysses."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"i have been waiting for kidd to release his corrections to the 'corrected' editon of ulysses for nigh on 17 years now. amazon, god bless its heart (i guess corporations have hearts now that they're real people), gives kidd's future book a listing here and therefore a way for me to keep track of it. and if kidd ever actually gets it published i can preorder.professor kidd, i beg you, please put out your edition of this classic, and bury gabler once and for all."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Reading Ulysses is a different experience for everyone. One thing is for certain - it is a difficult,long read. It is also, strangely, very hard to put down and it leaves you searching for meaning and just in a state of complete wonder. Amazingly, Joyce is able to convey each character's thoughts and dialect in a way that has never been achieved by anyone else. It feels almost as if each character was composed by a different author - they are so unique and detailed. Though I cannot express much of anything that has not already been said - let me make one recommendation to the reader of Ulysses - read something to help you through it (even cliff notes) and also read the Odyssey again - you will find this very helpful in navigating through this remarkable text."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I've read Dubliners and Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man and now Ulysses. One apparent source of the joy of reading these for me is that all of the characters are good, sympathetic people, even when they do petty things. It is a world full of light and air, humor and optimism. Stephen Dedalus, Buck Mulligan, Leopold and Molly Bloom and all the rest are more-or-less normal humans living normal lives even though somewhat oppressed by poverty, the Church, and the English, and of course themselves. Ulysses has none of the violence, darkness, ugliness, cynicism, villiany, and perversion that is found in so much of modern literature. The most dramatic and upsetting thing that happens is when Stephen gets his hand whacked in school (in Portrait). Even Stephen's alchoholic irresponsible father is painted somewhat empathetically.The events in Ulysses are so prosaic and quotidian that Joyce had to dress up his work with high-fallutin prose and verbal pyrotechnics. Otherwise the work would just be too bland. The reader can skate over most of the obscure rambling parts or go back and endlessly ponder them. I ignore most of the references, and I'm not too taken with the Homeric and Biblical symbolism. The book can be read on many different levels. I admit I loved it--but I would recommend reading Dubliners and Portrait first. I would also recommend visiting Dublin if you can swing it, and especially Howth, which figures prominently in Ulysses. Howth is a charming village and vast, dramatic, wild, high headland with sweeping views of the Irish Sea, Bailey Lighthouse way below, and Dublin city center in the distance--all within the city limits of Dublin. Last stop north on the DART (Dublin Area Rapid Transit)."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses symbolizes the height of modernist writing, and in many ways, was the first to address post-modern issues- in it's fragmentation and pastiche of form.Each chapter, which accounts for a particular time of day in chronological order (perhaps the only linear aspect of the book), appropriates a certain 'style', which addresses the 'consciousness' that Leopold Bloom, our hero, is undergoing.For example, when Bloom is worried about his job at the newspaper, the chapter breaks into journalistic form, adapting headlines and soundbites, however comical and absurd.Another example, when Bloom enters a brothel, and is pensive about being recognized, the chapter becomes a play, where all the characters are faceless and have taken on roles.There is a tremendously humane and sad scene at the pub, where all of Bloom's friends talk and banter over him, not hearing the profound things he has to say. Bloom is a poet that doesn't know it, to borrow from Dylan's rhyme. He is a modest man, navigating his way through his banal day. He goes to a burial and daydreams the corpse rolling down the hill. A bar of soap melts in his pocket. He goes to the beach and looks at a girl. In the bath-tub, he notices his penis, floating like a water-lily. And that is why this book is so kind and rare: His day becomes beautiful through his eyes. Each banality and prosaic task becomes macro-cosmic and mythical in the way that it is written. Bloom's Odessey is to return home.With each transition, Joyce continues to astonish the reader with how agile his writing is. The most genius part of the book is the penultimate chapter, in which Bloom and Stephan (the narrator in \\"Portrait of the Artist\\" and Joyce's alter-ego), enter the former's home, both drunk and lonely. Here, the chapter becomes Q & A form, a series of questions that are answered. Perhaps Bloom, eager to sustain Stephan's company, so late in the night, adopts the role as an interviewer, they way we ask meaningless questions to allude the awkward silence.In the end, Bloom crawls into bed, and his stream of consciousness blends into that of his wife's, Molly. Here, readers enter her mind, and we discover what has been bothering poor and gentle and lovely Bloom all day."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Why haven't you read this book? There are two types of people in the world: those who love _Ulysses_ and those who despise it. It always astonishes me the degree to which some people loathe this book. One of my very best friends cannot read past an early description of the sea as \\"snot-green.\\" Go figure. Joyce challeneges our notions about the ordinary. The ordinary is not always beautiful. It is not always remarkable. But seen through the life of one ordinary man, a single day is an epic, albeit an ordinary one. And what's so wrong with that?Leopold Bloom and Stephen Daedelus are perhaps the most intriguing characters in 20th Century art. They are opposites of a sort. Bloom is an everyman, Daedelus wants to be the Ubermensch, but he is far too Gallic. Bloom (the Hungarian Jew - anything but Gallic) triumphs in his epic, this day in Dublin. Stephen, well, he doesn't quite triumph. There are lessons here that one can explore for eons. Why is Bloom successful in his odyssey? Why isn't Stephen? Stephen is trapped in emerging Gallic existentialism, dark, \\"sinister\\" as Buck Mulligan describes it. Bloom is, well...Bloom. He is the good kind of existential...the Teutonic rather than Gallic.Read this book, for God's sakes. Don't take my word for it. Love it, hate it, I don't care.

He did everything so well he only had to each thing once. One short story collection: Dubliners. And one great novel: Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. On the basis of these two works alone Joyce would be legend. But he did not stop there, he went further than anyone had ever gone with literature and wrote a new kind of novel, Ulysses. And after that another new kind of novel, Finnegans Wake. Ulysses is a work which every reader must face once in his life. Or twice. No other novel so sums up the reason novels are written. Ulysses is an epoch about culture but told lyrically through two characters, the familiar Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom. Both will win you over. Dedalus for his scholars apprenticeship at life, and Bloom for his well versed walk through the very reaches of modern life. Irish this is in the very best sense. The language is real but the words are not coming from everyday talk but from the inside, the waking consciousness' dialogue with itself. That is the magic of this book. It is completely original born from nothing but inspiration. It is a great move to have Stephen, the character from his last novel, collide with Bloom, this new novels creation. Joyce has the teachers good will to introduce you to the new work via an old companion, brilliant stroke. The modern world really makes no sense is Stephens Tragedy and Blooms comedy. If you are a young man you will probably share Stephen's sentiments and if you are beyond youth you will share Bloom's. Or both which makes it all the more wonderful. No book is more insightful in leading to an understanding of the western predicament and no book has yet come close. Joyce writes in a sometimes hard to decipher prose but it is all worth it. In the end you will feel you have collided with the one who understood first what it was to be a modern life. Make it easy on yourself and read this after Dubliners and Portrait of the Artist as a Young man. For the best readers there is no other way.

Joyce was living in Europe, hitting up friends, relatives, and would be patrons for money as he masturbated away his talent right in front of the poor, half-wit woman he married. &quot;Because,&quot; he answered, &quot;I can't think of anything else to do.&quot; That about sums up why this book in truth is an eruption of verbal flatulence, a screech in the literary void by a man who was not capable of doing what lesser writers could: compose a plot. There are scenes, passages and conversations from Ulysses that are truly brilliant--but that's all one can say about it. The tragedy is that a man of such talent, who would have secured a place in literary history if he had never written another word after &quot;The Dead&quot;, felt obliged to labor his way through this doorstop of a novel, when he could have produced something so much better."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I have a BS in English from Ga Tech in the USA.

He wrote this work for people who cared more for style over substance. Don't read this book. Leave this dark epistle where it is in the store and read Joyce's other works.

In high school I purchased the volume because that is what readers did. Purchasing the book, however, is about all the good I got out of it back then. I don't think I even made it into Part II without giving up. So, naturally, a book likeJames Joyce's Ulysses: A Studyprofited my younger self infinitely more so than the novel it purported to study. That is because, without even having read the book, I could speak somewhat intelligently on the novel and also make ridiculously absurd remarks about its place in the \\"modernist project.\\" As you can imagine, I was invited to a lot of parties.Years passed, a Modern Library list of the one hundred greatest books of the twentieth century was issued, and Ulysses remained unread on my bookshelf. During my undergraduate studies, and I use the term \\"studies\\" in its most liberal application, I enrolled in a James Joyce course. I read it and I hated it. Now, in an attempt to read through the Modern Library's list, I have read it again. I am still convinced that it is not a great book.Ulysses is not a great book for many different reasons. First is its notorious and intentional difficulty. Joyce himself once commented on the book that he had \\"put so many enigmas and puzzles that it will keep the professors busy for centuries arguing over what I meant, and that's the only way of insuring one's immortality.\\" And this is the problem. Joyce has forced so much meaning into the text so as to render it meaningless. Indeed, reading Ulysses is more academic exercise than pleasurable literary experience. Literature, at its core, is an attempt at human communication and what we have here is a failure to communicate. Few average readers are willing or able to invest the time and effort necessary to read and understand a novel whose explicit goal it is to confuse professional scholars.The difficulty of the book extends beyond the themes, symbols, and structure and into the very language employed to tell the story. If only Joyce had adopted - as Biddy the Clip describes Stephen Dedalus' language in the Circe chapter - a \\"marked refinement of phraseology,\\" then perhaps the novel wouldn't be so bad. Instead the book is strewn about with an infuriating amount of useless and obscure language. This opacity has spawned a cottage industry of explanatory texts. But this is a novel, not an excursion into unknown territory. We shouldn't need maps. In the end the language of Ulysses will limit it to a very select readership, namely those interested in convincing others of their sophistication and intellectual powers (you know, people like me). It will never enjoy popular readership. I am reminded here of the quaker librarian's warning from the Scylla and Charybdis chapter where he comments that, \\"the mocker is never taken seriously when he is most serious.\\"I offer that the book fails in two more respects. First, it fails in its stylistic ambitions. The book is perhaps best known for its stream-of-consciousness innovations. This narrative technique is an effort to get inside the head of the characters and to replicate the character's thoughts. For the most part, Joyce fails miserably at this. No one thinks like the characters of Ulysses think. Their thoughts are simply too sporadic, befogged, and preposterously plentiful. These passages may very well be streams-of-unconsciousness, but no one ever had a conscious thought pattern as absurd as those found in Ulysses. The interior monologues of Stephen Dedalus are the worst. Most readers, I imagine, skip them entirely. Readers interested in a proper execution of the stream-of-consciousness technique need look no further than William Faulkner or Virginia Woolf.Secondly, the novel fails in its modernism. If the modern novel is meant to serve as a symbolic manifestation of the confusion and aggravation of modern life, then the book is a wild success. Indeed, perhaps the only thing more confusing and aggravating than reading Ulysses is readingFinnegans Wake (Classic, 20th-Century, Penguin). If, on the other hand, we understand the project of literary modernism to be an articulation of the era's spiritual disillusionment, despair and alienation then we need look no further than the prose of Ernest Hemingway.There is a way to read Ulysses. Read it slowly. This works in two respects. First, part of the charm of the novel, if there is any, is its language. By reading slow you will be able to digest it all. Secondly, if you are polymath and polyglot enough to understand what is going on, you will not miss anything important. Finally, as my undergraduate professor suggested, it helps to recite the book in your mind with a deep Dublin Irish accent. Doing so makes the book at a least a little more entertaining.So why would I offer suggestions about how to read the book if I feel that it's not worth reading? Well, my limited appreciation of the novel is based on its at times brilliant wordplay, its humor and the beauty of the final chapter.Few books provoke authentic LOLs. Ulysses is one of them. The first glimpse of this humor comes from the Hades chapter when Leopold Bloom - the alienated Jew trapped on an island of rabidly anti-Semitic Irish Catholics - ponders the curious rituals of the Roman faith as he and his peers lay to rest poor Paddy Dignam. Mr. Bloom satirizes the ritual prayers over the dead body with his own intonation of, \\"hoping you're well and not in hell.\\" In terms of the book's funny punnery, none is as enjoyable as that found in the conversation between Alf and Joe during the Cyclops chapter when Alf asks who has been making character assassinating allegations against Bloom. Joe replies, \\"I am the alligator.\\" Stephen Dedalus provides the biggest gut buster when, drunk and conversing, he professes that his understanding of brotherly love is reducible to the maxim that, \\"greater love than this no man hath that a man lay down his wife for his friend.\\" Unfortunately, finding such humorous literary gems in Ulysses is like searching for a needle in a pile of donkey poo.Despite my previous distaste for the majority of the novel's language, there are some very pretty sentences in Ulysses. For instance, the shade of a tree becomes \\"the treeshade of sunnywinking leaves.\\" On a morning trip to the butcher, Leopold Bloom, relisher of the inner organs of beasts and fowls, watches as \\"the ferreteyed porkbutcher folded the sausages he had snipped off with blotchy fingers, sausagepink.\\" Finally, instead of entering the carriage, a character pokes his \\"silkhatted head into the creaking carriage and, entering deftly, seats himself.\\"Finally, Ulysses endeared itself to me a bit more this time because the final episode, the Penelope chapter, is just so wonderful. This chapter documents the thoughts of a woman - Molly Bloom, wife of Leopold - as she falls asleep. Where elsewhere Joyce fails in composing a convincing stream-of-consciousness, here he is resoundingly successful. Molly Bloom's lazy, floating thoughts fall upon memories of her friends, her lovers (premarital and adulterous), her childhood, her dead son, her living daughter, her desire to blow Stephen Dedalus before finally and beautifully coming to rest upon (yes) her husband who has literally just kissed her ass. I realize that the prospect of reading a ponderous forty page run-on sentence may not sound like the most palatable literary endeavor. If there is anything that makes Ulysses worth reading, however, it is this chapter.Should you read Ulysses? I don't know. On one hand, it's the greatest novel ever written. Then again, it's certainly one of the worst. If anything, please do not read it on the Kindle. Get a print version. That way you can look really smart when people see you reading it on the subway."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Yes, this book is staggeringly difficult. Yes, Joyce was a pompous, self-absorbed, pretentious butthead. Yes, he was a cynic who indulged in bitter ironies. But at the same time Joyce was also a senitmentalist and an idealist, and this magnificient novel is a successful exercise in unadulterated nostalgia. It is humble. It is funny. It is sad. It is vexing. And it contains the most sublime sentences and passages written in the English language: \\"On his wise shoulders through the checkerwork of leaves the sun flung spangles, dancing coins.\\" The \\"Scylla and Charybdis\\" chapter alone is both dazzling and haunting. Shorn of the baggage (and garbage) it has accumulated over the years, Ulysses is, at its heart, a deeply moving probing of nothing less than the human heart."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I was excited to see this as a free Kindle download.

Stephen Dedalus has left Ireland only to return to his dying mother. Just because you've read and understood Portrait, don't expect Ulysses to come quite as easily. It's rough going in spots but well worth the effort of getting through. In the process you will be taken through 783 pages that encompass less than a twenty-four hour period in the life of Stephen, the Blooms and Dublin. And what a day it is. Everything you might imagine happens, and much more than you ever could imagine also occurs. From the uneasy start of Stehpen's day to his boring job as a teacher he plods through his mind as he tries to plod through his life. In the course of the day a man dies, a woman gives birth, Stephen finds himself at the library discussing his theories of Shakespeare, Hamlet, and that paternity may very well be legal fiction. Also during this same day Leopold Bloom is going about his routine business in Dublin and finally fatherless Stephen meetssonless Bloom. They venture off into the night world where the present and past hallucinate in a theatre of the mind living nightmare that culminates with Bloom taking Stephen under his wing. And while all this was going on, Mrs. Bloom, Molly has had her own sort of day. The Blooms have an odd relationship yet manage to maintain a bond through their thoughts that neither of them does well in putting into words to one another. Whatever they do, they do with full thought and awareness of the other. What makes this book so terrific is the wide ranges in style that Joyce uses. Each episode is like a novel in itself. There is no boredom or tediousness to get through, the main thing that makes it difficult are the constant allusions and references that Joyce makes that may have you wondering at times just what is going on. There are a number of good books to refer to while reading Ulysses and they can make it easier, but even without them, it's worth plunging forward and reading it all. The novel covers everypart of human existance from the banal to the sublime. You will not be in doubt as to what these people are feeling or thinking, their stream of inner consciousness takes up most of the book. And what's great about that is in finding out what these people are about you can learn something about yourself that you were not previously aware of."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I want you to decide for yourself. Ulysses, to some the masterpiece of all 20th century works, a glorious, sun-ravaged inspiring that is open to all nooks and encompasses all passion. Others call it ludicrious, pompous and dull; overlong; a frustrating exercise in pieceing together symbols. I want you to look over some of the other reviews and see for yourself the division between the pros and the cons; the academic justifications and the confused, ennerverated whining. The fans overpraise with unspeakable delight: believing themselves in the know--a fan of another person's excellence, a seer of all there is to know. You can scan the pages and glean all sorts of terminology, from the label of 'modernism' to the execution of 'stream-of-consciousness' (two indescribible approaches that cannot be so singularly defined as to explain just what, exactly, is going on). There are references to other experts' reviews, and the almost outraged frustration with which it is bespoken tells the person who couldn't get into it that somebody else out there has written about all the things you didn't like in the book and therefore it must be brilliance. The haters are less uniform in their scorn, although most of them summarize 'it didn't make any sense' in one form or another. There are rat-tat-tats of 'boring(s)' and machine gun slogans writing off this unquestionably influencial opus as something not even worthy of remembering.Me? I fall less in the middle and more to the side of scorn. It is a techically dazzlingly display--a rip-roar of English-Latin-Gallic with the cantor on fire and the rhythm in flames. Boom-boom-boom goes the glory of this lover of language who plays and who plays and who plays--trickling insight with the tickle of a feather and bringing the house down with a terse yet finely tuned phrase . . .The biggest problem is the story--a legitimate babble of voices talking over one another with a transformative center that can't keep anyone focused on what any of the characters is actually saying (the characters notice this too). The dialogue goes on for pages--twenty--fifty page stretches!--where no one seems to have the interest or attention span enough to keep things settled for a moment to even decide if any of them know what they're talking about. The topics shift abruptly--aloofly, it would seem--and the range of all of their interests is predictably limited. I can respect (and even admire) the effort to invoke this mindless clamor of Babel, and appreciate the consistancy that can redeem by none of them ever learning anything, but the end result is a story that no one can follow unless they had written it themselves.Ulysses is a book Joyce wrote for himself. No doubt it was joy--an endless experimentation from a frustrated (and rather pompous) author who finally felt justified at the publication of his previous two books. Ulysses, to me, reads as more of a show-off work. A man with great genius who wanted to prove to everyone just how great he could be. The problem is that he was boasting to himself. Here is a book about me me me! All passing to 'naturalism' or the 'realistic aspect' related in numerous grinding scences, are valid, certainly, but merely another label that cannot begin to describe the monster Joyce created here.In the end, an endlessly unpleasurable read that causes one to stop and think often, some of that time about setting the book aside and reading something better--"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"What to make of Ulysses, that towering work of modernism that has been seen as both the hallmark of the age, and an impediment to later generations of writers trying to get out from beneath Joyce's long shadow?Ultimately, the worth of the novel can't be questioned, even if you do not \`like' the book. Perhaps no novel in the 20th century exerted (and continues to exert) so great an influence over the written arts. Lots of ink has been spilled about the novel. On this, my third reading of it after twenty years, I have this to say:Part of the challenge and thrill of the novel is Joyce's chameleon like ability to thrown on literary guises, while at the same time being intractably, even stubbornly, Joyce. He had few illusions about his genius, and wrote a work from that lofty standpoint. Although loaded with humor, dirty jokes, and common place incidents, Ulysses is an intellectual's novel, meant not to be read but re-read. It is nearly Talmudic in its dimensions. Dig deeper into a passage and you find multiple layers of meaning.Part of the challenge (and frustration for some) of this novel is its incredible restlessness. The first third of the novel features Joyce's famous stream of consciousness technique. Characters are minds in bodies, thinking a stream of thought, occasionally interrupted by some external datum.Here Joyce creates a kind of hyper-naturalism. It is as if he wishes to show readers that the naturalism of the preceding generations was nothing more than a fictive mask. Here is the closest we can get to the workings of the human mind in its social and psychological settings. He bends language get this. He coins new words. He leaves words dangling off and thoughts unfinished. In other words, he tries to reproduce how our halting minds actually think their thoughts.Once Joyce has accomplished this, he appears to repudiate it. We then get a variety of chapters written from certain literary standpoints (often mockingly so). It is as if Joyce is saying: this is literature too, a series of guises that we throw on and off at will. This is the lens through which people see the world. They are more than encapsulated minds. They also structure their worlds.So, Ulysses keeps the reader off kilter, and with a sense of sheer delight on the part of Joyce. We start over and over again, chewing on the same material and spiritual conditions of one day in Dublin over a hundred years ago.In the process much that is profound happens surrounded by a spectacle of mundane happenings. In other words, just another day."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Is this the greatest novel of all time, or just a colossal waste of time? My experience is that reading Joyce's ULYSSES will indeed pay the reader great dividends for the time she put into it. However, I don't believe it's a novel that can be understood and appreciated without a great investment of repeated readings and consultation of outside texts. In fact, I don't think there's ever been a novel that requires that the reader consult at least a half dozen texts and repeated readings to not be totally bewildered by what the hell the author is trying to say.Here's why I say this. I read ULYSSES several times while in college. The first reading gave me absolutely nothing! However, because I was an English major, was deeply interested in Irish lit, and had the time, I gave the novel repeated readings and consulted dozens of secondary books and periodicals. Then I began to get somewhere. What before was a jumble of gibberish about Irish towers and bars and streets and a dog on a beach, before born baby boardman had bliss, shamefaced peaches clop clop clop introblio ad nauseam began to reveal the deeper currents underneath. And I feel it was all quite worth my time and trouble.So here's my advice for the new reader. The 1st reading should be accompanied by Cliff Notes (don't laugh) to get a basic idea of each chapter's theme. This will be a great help. Beyond that, the ANNOTATIONS book is a very good resource. Another secondary source on ULYSSES that I found very valuable and interesting was the many great pieces from THE JAMES JOYCE QUARTERLY on the novel. I hope that by now someone has digitally compiled all that scholarship so that it's not lost and forgotten in college library basements!Here's what I found out: Joyce's astounding accomplishment with ULYSSES is that he successfully layered multiple literary, religious, psychological, philosophical biological and historical structures in a single work. The 1st chapter alone is worthy of a full semester's attention in order to unravel and reveal the myriad references and their cross-associations. What we have here is modern scripture, and the largest literary puzzle ever. If intricate literary structure interests you, this is the magnum opus. I'm not risking overstatement to declare that ULYSSES could be called The Book of Life, as a key reason why so many scholars have lauded it as the greatest of novels is that it's the most voluminous and eloquent tale of living that's ever been written.But again, to share these scholars' opinion of this novel WILL require MORE work from the reader than she has given to probably anything else she's tried to read and really appreciate. Know this before you begin reading."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Substituting capitalization for italics is unacceptable. Also, multiline verses are collapsed into one unbroken line."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"The three previous reviews are right on: to my mind (and I confess that I am not unique in this) Ulysses is the greatest novel in world literature. It is unrivalled in style (who could rival it?) or in character. And who is not moved by the pathos and humor of the book, the sorrows and triumphs of L Boom? This lovely edition befits the novel itself. You may want to read and re-read and take notes in \\"corrected\\" editions. This is the one to stare at lovingly, longingly."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"FOR STUDENTS STRUGGLING WITH THIS GREATEST NOVEL IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE please skip to the twelfth episode, called Cyclops. YOu will find there all the major themes written in an engaging style, and all the threads of the plot. Just jump there and the teacher will think you read the whole not-easily-digestible work.Each episode is a microcosm and a repeating or respeaking of the same themes. Cyclops probably presents these in the most immediately comprehensible way possible. YOu quickly realize that Joyce throughout the work is MAKING FUN OF THE WAY PEOPLE TALK AND WRITE, from the first turn-of-the-century style to Molly's final stream of consciousness tour-de-force. But throughout Mr. JOyce is doing PARODY, which is exagerrating and making fun of how we speak and write, onoly to show that his underlying themes are impossible to express in modern terms. and so in Cyclops we hear every voice from ancient heroic legend to modern ringside boxing reports and wedding reports.But the basic themes remain. Mr. Bloom most explicitly states here that Love must be the basis for human interaction, and this is expanded upon. Also and most explicitly are Joyce's political undercurrents, the vile and oppressive nature of the BRitish empire's military force, which continues today stealing oil in Iraq while destroying its cultural heritage. Joyce shows how the same happened to Ireland, destroying resources (lumber) and cattle (under the false pretext of hoof and mouth) and industry as a way to impoverish and enslve the once great nation. The direct indictment of the BRitish naval power is especially explicit. This is my favorite and funniest epsode at the same time. Listen to it around disk eighteen of the forty disk Donal Donnally recording.THen ask your teacher if the reason Stephen Dedalus (get it? Dead. Alas!) did not kneel to pray for his mother, keeps Kosher, wears black with head carefully covered and wanders alone and lost, finding company only with the alleged Jew Bloom, is that while in Paris between Portrait of the Artist as A YOung Man and this work, he realized he was not a Jesuit Catholic, but on his mother's GOulding side, a Jew, and he returns to Ireland in search of his Jewish community. THis will knock your teacher's socks off.Please realize that Mr. Joyce himself reported there is not a single serious word in his work, that it is all a joke about the poor way people write. Yet, while there is not a single serious word, the underlying themes are deadly serious matters of life and death, faithlessness in marriage, national identity in the face of brutal (British) imperialist rape and oppression, and the theme of love in all its permutations. Love eternal and carnal is the basis of this book.My original analysis of this monumental work I assume got reported and dumped, without my saving a copy, so let me only briefly say that you may want the Gabler edition for the most reliable text, even though it loses the important page sized capitals S, M and P as reproduced in the Random House, as well as the important large period or asterix answering the questions \\"Where?\\" and is famously poorly bound.Do get the Donal Donnally (sp.?) recording. Jim Norton's is ABRIDGED grotesquely. Donal's is complete and extremely well done. If you want the basic gist of the novel, listen to Disk eighteen and nineteen of the forty disk recording and you will get the basic message. Love loves to love love.I am sorry to have lost my complete review written here in Ulysses style for a flavor of the original. Who's knows what lines were offensive. This book is essential reading, and re-reading, but don't get me started or I might get reported again.Be sure not only to get the Annotated Ulysses, which focusses mostly on historical explanations of places and people, but especially the Schwarz \\"Reading Joyce's Ulysses\\" and the Sicari \\"Joyce's Modernist Allegory\\", both excellent beginning commentaries that will make the text and intent much clearer to any reader. But the serious reader interested in the deeper socio-historico eleements suggested by joyce should get Dr. Cheng's excellent critique on JOyce racism and colonialism, as well as Attridge's Semicolonial Joyce. And those who get way over their heads with Joyce ought to check out Joyce and G-Men how Hoover killed Joyce's novel in the USA.The Donal Donnaly recordings really bring the novel to life.You can find several other commentaries in all price ranges, some by professors eager for tenure and looking to publish or perish, and others that are really helpful. Try Hugh Kenner of course, and the ones which investigate the brutal colonial nature of Ireland's history which Joyce alludes to, to reflect on current world events. It is worth the effort. Even Joseph Campbell has interesting things to say, on how this novel inspired him to begin to explore our world's mythologies, masks and meanings.

When Judge Woolsey decided in the 1930s to institute what Morris Ernst decreed \\"the New Deal in the law of letters,\\" making Ulysses legal to own and distribute in the U.S. (before that it was contraband, smuggled into the country as if it was bootleg scotch by, among other people, Ernest Hemingway), Random House, which had locked up the U.S. rights, decided to act fast, while the book was hot (Joyce even made the cover of Time magazine). So they rushed their now-legal version into print as quickly as possible, using in the process the ugliest, most unreadable typeface known to man.In 1961, they revised the text, getting rid of some obvious errors (if I'm not mistaken they were in such a rush originally that they used Samuel Roth's 1927 pirated edition as copytext!), but for some reason they kept the same repellent font, probably because resetting the whole book in a new font would have been too expensive.When I finally read Ulysses complete, it was in the 1960 Bodley Head edition, which is miles ahead of its American counterpart in elegance and readability. Unfortunately, the text is not nearly as good (Joyce scholar Hugh Kenner's comment on it is particularly apt -- suffice it to say that it's the title of Jacobean playwright John Ford's most famous work).So if you're planning on taking a stab at Ulysses, this is what I would suggest. Forget about the Vintage Paperback edition (as well as Hans Walter Gabler's so-called \\"Corrected Text,\\" for textual reasons too cumbersome to get into here), and go with the Everyman's Library hardcover. It may not be ideal (contrary to what I thought at first, they reprint the Bodley Head edition and not the Modern Library 1961 text), but it's published in a large and reader-friendly font. It's the edition to get if you've never tried Ulysses before (although Dover has recently put out a reproduction of Shakespeare and Co.'s 1922 First Edition that's worth looking into).And if you haven't read Ulysses before, I would suggest that before you do, you: a) read Joyce's earlier and simpler novel, A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, b) try a biography first (Richard Ellmann's is the authoritative one, especially in its 1982 revision, but I'm rather partial to Stan Gebler Davies' shorter biography from the 1970s, which sounds like it was written by a character in Ulysses). Also: c) find and read a good commentary first, such as Edmund Wilson's chapter on Joyce in Axel's Castle, or Hugh Kenner's book, entitled Ulysses or Harry Blamire's The Bloomsday Book. If you're a Joycean newbie, you will need help. Plenty of it.Even then it won't be easy. But Joyce, with the possible exception of Proust, wrote the greatest novel of the last century, and if you're any kind of a serious reader you really owe it to yourself to take a whack at it. Clifton Fadiman once compared reading Ulysses to climbing Mount Everest. Not many people make it to the summit, but the ones who get to the top are afforded a view that's hard to beat. Reading Joyce is less a matter of reading a book than of having a life experience, and a precious one (although some might wonder in which sense of the word) at that. Good luck."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Unfortunately, the first edition of *Ulysses* to be published in Dublin is not the edition of this book which anyone should read first. Danis Rose's decisions to normalize punctuation and spelling, to make intrusions into Joyce's prose on the basis of his own criteria of syntactic and semantic coherence rather than on textual evidence, and to re-insert apostrophes into Penelope (although he prints an alternate version of the chapter in an appendix) are only barely justifiable in terms of his own theory of editing -- and entirely alien to the &quot;normal&quot; practices of scholarly textual critics. This is quite a shame, because some of Rose's work on the manuscript evidence (as it is described in his introduction, quite interesting in itself) might potentially be of great importance to the textual study of *Ulysses*. Without an apparatus criticus, however, no one can tell for sure. Although (as Rose himself points out) there is and can be no absolutely &quot;definitive&quot; *Ulysses*, there are better places to start. Read Hans Walter Gabler's 1984 edition, keeping in mind its limitations (or, if you want a student's edition with good notes in the volume, use the reprint of the 1922 first edition, edited by Jeri Johnson for OUP, taking care to check out some of the more important alternate readings in Gabler's text). For those interested, a forthcoming issue of *James Joyce Quarterly* will include extensive discussion of Rose's edition and its merits."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I think Jonathan Franzen had it about right when he compared Ulysses to a great, Old World Cathedral packed full of iconography. Tourists wander in, snuffle about, pick up the odd snippet that they find aesthetically pleasing without ever coming close to comprehending the depth of the whole thing; then there are the fanatics who consult with the priestly critics who can comprehend its mysteries. On top of this the state certifies the thing as great art (Ulysses is a huge national institution in Ireland - it has spawned a great Joyce industry (even though he lived most of his life as an exile from Ireland) and the 100th anniversary of the day on which Ulysses is set was marked by native Dubliners parading round the streets in stockings and boaters).Ulysses is a hugely difficult book (though not as bad as the impossible Finnegan's Wake), made doubly so by the fact that it is so reader unfriendly. I suspect most people read Ulysses because they have heard it is the ultimate literary challenge, plough through it with some difficulty, skimming large parts, picking up the odd stylistic triumph that keeps them going, then breathe a huge sigh of relief when they have finished it.If you still insist on reading Ulysses, I recommend 'The New Bloomsday Book' by Harry Blamires which offers a page by page readers guide to the book's contents. But really, unless you devote months of scholarship and read a multitude of supplementary texts, you won't fully grasp what is really going on."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This version is NOT annotated, in spite of the claim. The book itself is of course a classic of literature in the English language...but do not expect any annotations (and this is a book which would be much helped by annotations)."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This is in the eyes of most literary critics the greatest novel of the twentieth century, and a major addition to the Western literary Tradition. So much has been said about it in so many ways that I will free to chip in my less than two cents without doing the reviewer's ordinary task of describing the work, and telling the reader what it is all about. Bloomsday is a day on the literary calendar of the world. And Daedalaus, and Leopold Bloom and Molly are with K. and Falstaff, and Sancho and Pickwick in the cast of world - literary creations whose image is part of the collective human consciousness generation to generation as most real human beings are not.Ulysses is not easy to read even if one takes a Gilbert Stuart or some other modern guide , and figures out what each section with its own separate style, technique, theme parallel in the Odyssey is all about. And there are parts and not simply small parts which bore in their incomprehensibility as only Finnegans Wake will exceed. But there are also, and this is all through the work great lyrical passages of course culminating in Molly Blooms yes I said I will yes. There is too I suppose the particular pleasure of trying to figure out all these literary mysteries and these hidden hints in the multi- layered language of the text. Already Joyce here is moving toward the creation of his own language and the portmanteau and pun principles are richly at work. In Oxen of the Sun he writes the history of the English language parodying its styles. And the whole theme of parodying rewriting alluding to the great work, and somehow superseding it are in the frame of the work ( Before Bloom and before Daedalus there was a real Ulysses) Joyce's effort to write in one day the whole of human experience and to make too of the form of catalogue encyclopedia a higher way to art is part also of the transformation of popular forms into the highest art forms. Shakespeare did it on many levels and so must Joyce, as Hamlet Daedalaus reminds it. Ulysses at publication time was revolutionary to many in its putting on the page the lusts and obscenities , the sexual thoughts and even ' experiences' of its characters. It too broke the frame of convention in a whole host of other ways including through the shifting centers of its narrative consciouosness- the way it tells and does not tell its story. The sheer lyric musical beauty of Joyce's prose is poetry at its best .And the epiphanies on oval leaves are revelations of the beauty in language itself its sheer joyful joycean playing. And how can I having read through with dismay so much of the hidden and not so hidden anti- Jewish character of so many in the Tradition not be hearted by the warm feeling which flows toward the good souled Leopold Bloom. If I were to complain about graduate school time reading through the longest longeurs in Joyce I would nonetheless always keep in mind that one wee bit of an Irishladdie allalone went out there and by himself only made a masterpiece all mankind can make its own by reading and rereading before running on to riverun from bend of bay to swerve of shore past Howth Castle and environs"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I run these Donal Donnely disks continually just for the sheer joy of the language. This story, as any IRish tale, is from an oral tradition untamed by the printed word. It must be heard and sung, just as John Jameson and sons must be sniffed and savored, rather than read. Each sentence and paragraph (especially in the Cyclops section) requires a different narrative voice, which Donal does masterfully, even the \\"suppressed rancor\\" of the dog's poem requesting a dish of water!I find the disk nineteen the most important point for understanding the message and and meaning of this great misunderstand novel. Please supplement with Schwarz's Reading Joyce's Ulysses, Sicari's Joyce's Modernist Allegory, Joseph Campbell, and even the Annotated Ulysses for a too-real explanation of people and places. But by this disk set alone you know the novel.Continual rehearing drops pearls of comprehension and connection in the most unexpected ways and places.

This a very long book (933 pages-the introduction is around 50) but I can almost gaurentee you will find something you absolutley love in the book unless you didn't understand it at all. Well if you do finishing reading this and want more of the same style of book, try to read Gravity's rainbow, but take a pen and paper so you can take notes on the more then 400 characters so you'll remember them near the end of the book, and also try to pay attention to who is narrating because of the constant and occasionally abrupt changes from character to character.

That's right. All of them.First of all, the ones that accuse Ulysses of being a load of gibberish and a sluggish read. They're right. However, Ulysses is not meant to be a pure pleasure read. It's meant to be studied. I read a lot, and before Ulysses, the longest a book had ever taken me was two weeks. Ulysses took me two months. I did it as a part of my AP English project, and tackled it AFTER I had read Dubliners, A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, and sections of Richard Ellmann's biography. Even then, I kept Ulysses and Annotated and the Cliffs Notes close by my side.There are many parts of Ulysses that don't make sense. But the parts that do are brilliant. Joyce was a true genius, and if you take the time to studdy his work, you will be blown alway by his mastery of the English language, and his understanding of human nature. I hope to become a writer someday, and reading Ulysses has totally changed my outlook in writing and life.I would be lying if I said I enjoyed Ulysses all the way through.

Amazon should remove this edition, it is a corrupt text falsely advertised as complete."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"How should one read Ulysses at the beginning of the 21st century? The Modern English Library rated James Joyce's magnum opus the greatest English-language novel of the 20th century. Was their judgment correct? Perhaps (though a Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man does not fall far behind). However, Joyce's novel, which traces the misadventures of Stephen Dedalus, Leopold Bloom, and then Molly Bloom, is of course an echo of the Odyssey. It is also an affirmation of the Hebraic and Hellenic cultures in the West. But that is not really how it should be read. Ulysses is perhaps even more difficult to comprehend now than it was when it was first published in Paris through the Shakespeare Book Co., because Joyce alludes to modernist Irish literature, art, and architecture with breathtaking speed (though it is still far more cogent than Finnegan's Wake). However, you must read Ulysses, it is a rich cathedral of European artistry, from Joyce's command over the vernacular to his groundbreaking \`stream-of-consciousness' form. The first section of the novel deals with Stephen, and it can be regarded as a kind of carry-over from a Portrait of the Artist (though a bit more accomplished in form), while the middle section deals with Bloom, one of the strongest characters in the history of Western literature, and certainly one of Joyce's greatest achievements. Bloom is the thrust of the novel. He is the middlebrow that bridges Stephen (the intellectual) with Molly (the tramp), and his observations are the most lucid and revealing about the state of civilization at that time and place. But Ulysses is always funny, and moving and beautiful at the same time. The closing of section one ought to illustrate the strange majesty of Joyce's prose: \\"He [Stephen] turned his face over a shoulder, rere regardant. Moving through the air high spars of a threemaster, her sails brailed up the crosstrees, homing, upstream, silently moving, a silent ship\\" (51). This curious novel, which unfolds over the course of a single day, will undoubtedly continue to astound and perplex readers and scholars eternally. The way to work your way through Ulysses if it is your first time, is to be mindful of the details; Don Gifford's Ulysses Annotated is an excellent resource for a listing and explications of the more arcane allusions in Ulysses. Hugh Kenner's critical book is also a first-rate work of criticism for those who want further explication of the \`meaning' and significance of the work as a whole. For those who are truly courageous, you can begin to look into the Post-Modernist interpretations of Ulysses from fellows like Derrida and DeMan, but you should be wary of them, as they are often more complex than Joyce was to begin with."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ullysses is an Alice in Wonderland of writing styles. This doesn't make it unreadable, it can however prove to be a challenge to casual reader. This point does not distract however from the books marvelous apeal.Ullysses is a book about the comon ordinary man trying to make it though the day. The main character in the book Mr. Bloom wonders around dublin encountering a vast variety of people and events. All of which anyone might encounter, from the visit to the funeral to the one eyed bigot in the bar. We all could encounter the same obsticles that mr. bloom encounter thoughout the book.After reading the above one might think \\"so what, don,t most novels do that anyway.\\" This point is true, but many books do not elaberate on events, thoughts, and conversations of various characters the way Joyce does. This aspects makers Joyce one the top tear of all writers throughout the ages.This book also showcases parellels to the adventers in the oddyssy hence the name of the book. this my be a little hard to grasp at first, but as one moves along and perhaps rereads a chapter or two. the reader should be able to see the parellaels in front of him.

But it is also worth the challenge if you want to think about marriage, identity, love, and society in serious ways. If you put the book down half-way you are undoubtedly going to walk away disliking it-the final chapters really tie everything together and the Penelope chapter is vital to understanding the ideosyncratic bits of the text that leave you asking, \\"What?\\"I would not suggest making a go of it without buying \\"Ulysses Annotated\\" by Don Gifford. A lot of what he includes is superfluous unless you read the book for school, but it really gives such a greater idea of what Joyce is trying to do with this book, explaining the Odyssey stories for each chapter, stylistic intentions, and illuminating obscure references to Judiasm, Irish nationalism, character histories, food obsessions, etc. Without it the book will probably not have that much meaning for the reader, it's too complex.At first Stephen may seem annoyingly self-involved, Bloom a weak coward, and Molly a tart, but when you consider the themes Joyce is taking on-Irish nationalism, being an outsider, understanding another person in a way that allows you to accept their flaws, etc. their character \\"flaws\\" give way to another interpretation. Especially considering the novel takes place in a single day.The book definitely gets better as you read, so don't get frustrated, the end, while not idealistically upbeat as most novels tend to be, is really fitting and satisfying."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I tried to read Ulysses when I was about 20. I couldn't get into it. The stream of consciousness put me off completely Now I'm over 60 and I greatly enjoyed the book. I could hardly put it down. The writing is beautiful. I just had to go out and get a gorgonzolia sandwitch with a glass of burgundy."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I had this book described to me by a friend as both the best and worst book she had ever read. I can truly understand and appreciate her sentiments. Parts of the book are sheer poetry, and the descriptions and language draw the reader into the mystical brilliance of James Joyce's non-narrative. Other parts are maddeningly obscure and leave the reader wondering just what the hell is going on. The surprising part of this is that these obscure moments actually add to the book, rather than detracting from it. If &quot;Ulysses&quot; were not so obscure in so many parts, then the sheer mundaneness of much of the day would make it as boring as its detractors claim it to be, but the obscurity forces the reader to read attentively throughout. This is not a challenge enjoyed by all. This is not a light read, and if you're looking for a summer book by the cottage then stick to John Grisham and no fault to it (the light reads serve their purpose and should not be denigrated). However, if you're looking for a book that will test your imagination &quot;Ulysses&quot; is the perfect book. You probably won't fully understand it (I estimate I fully understood about 2/3 of it) but you will have learned much about yourself and the world of early-20th century Dublin and also of the world we live in today. Also, another reviewer here as written that this is a book to be read aloud. I agree whole-heartedly with that appraisal. It will add to both your understanding and enjoyment."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Many people see Ulysses as perhaps a pretentious volume of over-rated nonsense which can only be appreciated by intellectuals and academics. This is not the case. By 'the consummation of all literature' I mean that it employs every style of language, every grand philosophical and theological theme. It unites styles of literature like playscript, monologue, soliloquoy, poetry, melodrama, fantasy, heroic, symbolism and makes use of all literary devices: bathos, puns, litotes, dramatic irony, hyperbole - fusing them not only into a story but into an Odyssey. It is the heroic storyteller's heroic story. It's context - modernism - is transcended and becomes what one would hesitatingly refer to now as Postmodern. By that rather glib statement I mean it uses all these disparate themes and unites them via the central character, Leopold Bloom. Leopold is the Modernist man - the manifold fragmented man who asserts a new identity by unification of his 'hundred thousand flaws'. Virginia Woolf tried to demostrate this in Mrs Dalloway by allowing no chapter breaks in her exploration of the semi-autobiographical heroine and thus totalising the sum of experiences. Where Joyce succeeds over Woolf is that he explores not only the totalisation but the totalisation of all relevant parallel events. Like a theorist of chaos, he explores the detail that affects the major life-forces and struggles. The parallel to Homer's Odyssey is emphasised by making the hero's journey so incredibly anodine on the one hand and so completely heroic on the other. Using the Homeric myth of Cyclops, Joyce explores the prevalence of anti-semitism, the Irish religious conflict, the pettiness of argument and theological truths in but one scene. Joyce's work is a classic, not in the way that Finnegan's Wake is - which explores the actuality of language, the song of words and music , but by taking a life in a day and writing about lives themselves and the world they inhabit. It sounds extremely pretentious to say it is the consummation of all literature, but no other book thus far, in my experience, comes even close nor attempts to tackle so much of what Joyce achieves. It is not only that Joyce sees a world in a grain of sand he sees, more importantly, the grains of sand in the world."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"While I have a number of quibles about what Random House/Modern Libary put on their 100 best list, I had no problem at all with what they put first. If I had to pick one book as the best book of the century, it would by Joyce's Ulysses. It's a book I first read about 25 years ago and have returned to it every couple of years since.Ulysses is a rich, complex book that works on many levels. Most people tend to focus on its experimental prose, which Joyce used to both explore his characters and to widen the scope of his novel. But, beneath all of this, Ulysses is a novel of character, a profound look at the human condition. The book experimentation works because it is grounded on the story of Leopold Bloom, who is fundamentally a decent, likeable man. It's also the story of Stephen Daedalus, who, while somewhat of a prig, is a very intersting person, whose thoughts and ideas are exciting to follow.The more I think about it, the more I think that it'll soon be time to read Ulysses yet again."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Yes, ULYSSES is a mainstay of college literature. Yes, the book is a worthy literary endeavor. But for those who are not brutally devoted to the endless pursuit of mind-numbing genius, ULYSSES is tiresome, tedious, and passe.

For those enterprising readers such as myself who feel guilty dumping a Joyce work after only a chapter, read on. It gets worse.

It is certainly not &quot;about nothing&quot;--those that say so are talking about its lack of a standard plot. It's about the relationships people build with one another. Look at the relationships depicted: Bloom's love for Molly despite her infidelity, Molly's love for Bloom despite the infidelity she percieves, Molly's purely sexual love for Boylan, Bloom's fatherly love for Stephen, Stephen's constant searching for paternal influence, etc, etc. Joyce examines in minute detail each one of these and allows the reader to come to his own conclusions about the characters and their feelings.It _is_ a difficult book. Stick through it; it's worthwhile. For me, it really started to come together around &quot;Oxen of the Sun&quot; (chapter 14). After &quot;Ithaca&quot; (ch. 17) I felt like I'd known Bloom all my life. And &quot;Penelope&quot; (ch. 18) is remarkable not for what it reveals about Molly, but for what it reveals about Bloom.If you didn't get anything out of _Ulysses_, you didn't read it carefully enough. I suspect many people pick it up without knowning anything about it, and I further suspect that many people who read it for a university course are only skimming it for essay topics (of which there are plenty). Get something like &quot;The Bloomsday Book&quot; to help you through it, read something about the book before you start to read it, read it carefully, and read it more than once.

One risks opening oneself up to the assaults of the junior college-educated parrot, who gleefully repeats what &quot;wisdom&quot; was imparted to him by his talentless and blustering English instructor. But for those of us not interested in posturing; that is to say, for those of us who actually read Mr. Joyce's work--yes, every last page! (and not at the behest of some school-drudge)--we can risk dispensing with the bombast and dogma to whisper our opinions in a voice sharpened with an edge of honesty. &quot;Ulysses,&quot; such as it is, is a bore. Few unread novels have enjoyed as much success. Such fame rests chiefly, however, on the fact that it is usually not touched . . . which, even if it were, it would reveal itself to be wholly incomprehensible--thus allowing any pseudo-intellectual halfwit to attach any meaning to it that he wishes. The truth, though? &quot;Ulysses&quot; is a satire--and a very tedious one--of Homer's wonderful Odyssey. But Homer's work is actually readable and entertaining! Sad, considering that the ancient Hellene is several thousand years removed from us and yet still has the power to spin a fascinating story. Joyce, however, has created--nothing! He borrows, he steals, he imitates . . . badly. For a true original; for a man of genius and an author who can actually write his own plots; one should look no further than Homer. Joyce?

Most people who tell you that they understand the book are lying. Joyce was a genius--not in a way that he was a &quot;really good&quot; writer, but in a way that he simply had more brain power than almost all of us. He pushed himself for years and years to write this book, and he is a genius, so why should we be able to understand this book in one or two readings? You might get the gist of it after a few readings, a good professor to guide you through, and a strong literary background. But it doesn't matter if you have your MA in English or not, Joyce's intricacies will, for most of us, remain elusive. Not understanding Ulysses doesn't mean you're stupid it means you are human. I don't know why people are suprised that they don't &quot;get it&quot; when they read it. Most of us will probably never be able to grasp the brilliance of Mozart's music or Einstein's theories either, we have to kind of trust people that know how good they are. After a while we may be able to see why they are so good too. It's curious that people would hold literature to a lower bar than those disciplines. If you're not a rocket scientist, chances are you're probably not going to pick up a book on rocket science and expect to understand it."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Certainly, Ulysses must be one of the hardest books to review. The fact that so many has been written about it makes one shy to add one's own humble opinion, while the fact that it has recently (although somewhat controversially) been chosen as the best book of the last century makes one want to give it the benefit of the doubt with respect to every critical remark.And most of all, Ulysses is simply a brilliant book. The reader finds herself immersed in a dull day, which nevertheless reflects all aspects of life in Dublin around 1900. And this realist, evocative aspect of the book is balanced by its success in mirroring large parts of the literary heritage with which every book must come to terms. Loosely based on Homer's Oddysey, and riddled with references to Dante, Shakespeare, and the Bible, it shows both a tremendous respect for man's wish to put his life into words and an ironic distance from every specific attempt to do so. There were indeed many times I found myself thinking that I was reading the perfect book, the &quot;novel to end all novels&quot;.Nonetheless, in the end I concluded - albeit hesitantly - that Ulysses is a flawed gem. There are two aspects of the book that make it so. First, there are the constant allusions to Irish folk music. Indeed, large parts of Ulysses (and not only the Sirens chapter) read as though they should be sung. While this certainly adds a layer of meaning to the book for everyone who knows these tunes, it makes for frustration with everyone who does not. Moreover, with the inclusion of this fickle and all too transitory form of art, Joyce has strongly connected his novel to the early 1900's. While this might have been his intention, it detracts from the novel's universality and its ability to transcend the boundaries of its time. Even now, 75 years after its publication, I often felt like I was gazing at a world which is both completely lost and partly incomprehensible. The second major flaw is the apparent lack of structure between the episodes. While every episode itself is highly structured, and one of the main joys in reading the book is to gradually discover these structures, I could not help but wonder why certain structures were chosen, and how they relate to each other. The prime example of this is the Ithaca episode, in which Joyce has turned some rather mundane events into an elaborate catechism of questions and answers. While hilarious at times, this structure seemed highly arbitrary to me. I am quite sure that many interpretations of this aspect of Ulysses have been given in the secondary literature, but the essence of structure - as in poems - seems to me that it should invite the reader to understand it: the reader should see glimpses of a larger whole in order to start looking for it. Unfortunately, in Ulysses I did not find myself invited, but more often the subject of some incomprehensible joke of the author.I am well aware that both flaws are only so on the basis of some (probably outmoded) theory of literature, and that they can both be turned into major beauties of the book. Nonetheless, I think that Ulysses is the prime example of a book who wishes to be perfect, but which, unfortunately, is not."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Like everyone who've read the book, i saw ulysses very complicated and hard to read. It's a huge book; about 1000 pages and the hardnesses in them makes readers have difficulties while reading. The confusing writing style, too many characters and names of places, conflict between thoughts and speeches, many words/sentences in many different languages, a great cultural background with many colors, unordinary writing skill.. All these and other causes make the book ununderstandable and complex. But, beyond this, you can feel the genius writer among the pages. Joyce, hides himself, his prodigy, all of the people, thoughts and happenings of 16th July's Dublin. The most important impact of the book is, to me, the prodigy you read in it."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"this is one of the briliant book i have ever read there is a lot of information on it on historical things and its very interesting to read those details its a hard book but it worht it its a smart and funny i suggest that the reader try to engoy the book this book is a peace of art and not fight whith it"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses, while seemingly understood (by literary professionals anyway) as a masterpiece of literature, is a very hard narrative and one that turns off alot of people. I think part of the reason that many readers have difficulty with the novel, though, is that they approach it similarly to other reads. Personally, I think this is a mistake.Ulysses is, in my opinion, the literary equivalent of improvisational jazz. Improvisational jazz is considered by many musical professionals as the purest of music. Jazz performers find it thrilling, joyful, and simply without comparison to other musical forms. Yet, many others consider it boring and difficult to understand. I think at least part of the reason for this is that it lacks the musical structure to which we are all programmed to respond to. Many people have no frame of reference to place it in.In a literary sense, I think Ulysses shares these aspects in many ways. Many passages are difficult to understand, especially if one seeks a familiar literary structure within which to place it. And yet, if one steps out of the box a little and takes the time to appreciate its poetic lyricism, to allow the words to flow without necessarily seeking to place them within that familiar structure, some otherwise difficult passages can be reached at level different from other novels. The normal reader's desire to understand the passage in its purely contextual form is lessened. The end result is that the novel becomes a less daunting read.Ultimately, though, I give it only four stars. Irrespective of a reader's approach, too many brain cells have to fire for too long to get through it (its over 1000 pages long). I don't think most people want to work that hard to read a book."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses is complex, evocative, and displays an incredible mastery of language. The landscape of Dublin 1904 is still as stunning - in a dark sort of way - as it was when Joyce was composing this great book.Certainly, it is hard to read in places. Chapters fourteen and eighteen are especially trying. There are spots where it seems that Joyce gave too much information, or not enough. But for the most part, Ulysses is very readable, with exquisite prose.This is not a book to shy away from. It is well worth the effort."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Of course the novel is brilliant. I don't really need to go into that. What everyone tends to forget is that Ulysses is damn funny. Most people don't really read this book: they spend all their time thinking about how stupid it is (i.e., how they don't understand it) or how magnificent it is (i.e., how they don't understand it). Screw the hype, read the book. You don't need any guides; you're in the hands of a master."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"It is very difficult to read but with lots of help from students and teachers of literature, I feel that this piece of work would produce many dividends in knowledge."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Each book has its balance between prose and poetry and this book is almost all poetry. It actually doesn't have much of a plot, it's more of a stream of consciousness of his ruminations briefly punctuated by daily events. With all of the literary references, and breadth between Greek, Latin, Physics, Hebrew, French, etc., this is a smart person's book. More than anything, the author seems like someone you'd want to have at a dinner party."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Very pleased with the condition and price of the book.

Many of the points made by detractors of Joyce and Ulysses are valid, in fact most of them are. Even Yeats who praised the book confessed that he never finished it. But that is indicative of some peculiar choices by Joyce, for instance, the Third Chapter is intentionally unreadable. Joyce apparently did this to make a point about the mentality of the educated Irishmen, such as himself, who had the tendency to make themselves irrelevant to their countrymen. He did this by filling the entirety of the chapter with verbiage so obtuse and obscure that even educated people would have trouble telling you what's actually happen, which isn't much, they guy just sits there on the beach and feels sorry for himself. If I had not been in a Module whereby the Lecturer explained that this is essentially unreadable I surely would have put down the book forever.There are many points of interest for me in the book, I highly suggest reading the last chapter by itself as its prose is quite enjoyable and really provides of portrait of a time and a place and a people. It's not really necessary to read the book stait through, as my good friend and classmate (though he never took this course) explained it to me: \\"Ulysses is a book which is never intended to be finished, you just pick it up and open it up anywhere and start reading and when you can't take it anymore, you put it back down.\\"In regards to this book, if it can help provide the insight I needed to help me understand Ulysses I would say it is worthwhile, but my experience is that these books never do that, they just tell you what they think it is you should know about the famous book, banking on the name-recognition of the book and the author, knowing full well that most people has never read enough of the book to refute them.It was a strange thing for Joyce to do in his effort to \\"write the greatest book in the English language\\" where the result was really much more (and then again sometimes less) then a book at all. The volumous \\"story\\" - we'll call it that for lack of a better word, really became an entity within itself because he hi-jacked the English language to make statements by the use of the text itself rather than within it, and within the hundreds of pages he hid what was considered pornographic imagery, knowing full well that those who would take exception to it would be hard pressed to actually read it for themselves. The result was so un-approachable that he actually had to tell people that it was a parallel to the Odyssey (despite the name) and provide notes on how to interpret it. If this was any other book this would signal the utter worthlessness of the book, but what Joyce did, and which has never been recreated, is the exception, if you are ready to accept it for what it is, and what it isn't: a good story.The story itself, is rather boring and uninteresting, this was part of Joyce's design though. He was making a statement about Ireland by making this incredibly uneventful and uninteresting story and then contrasting it with the heroic tales of Odysseus. There-by making the Joyce-equivalent all the worse by comparison. Like I said, it makes the story itself boring, but it's interesting if you know that going in, thank goodness Joyce provided the author of the first literary analysis of Ulysses with his notes!Even though I whole-heartily agree with many of these points on their own, I believe that Ulysses is an import book to peruse, if not read. And it should not be dismissed in its entirety. However for an enjoyable work by Joyce I highly suggest something else, such as Dubliners, where the short story form restricts Joyce from getting to ostentatious."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"I will admit it took me atleast two times the amount of time to read this as most books but,it was worth the time.

Because of extentions to the copyright in the early 1990s, he says, Kidd's edition can't be published for two decades.\\"'It's not out of the question we won't publish it then.

But, how to acomplish yhis ambition, when Romeo and Juliet and Anna Karenina is allready written? Joyce's solution is to redefine what the concept of a Great Love novel is all about. Instead of regarding the reader as someone to ammuse and seduce - someone that has the passive role of observing the story, Joyce combats the reader and makes the readers experience of reading the book as a crusial part of his story.Even the 16th of May 1904 was a long time ago and happend far away as Joyce wrote Ulysses in Trieste, Zurich and Paris from 1914 to 1921, Joyce describes virtually every detail that happened in Dublin that special day, long ago, far away. Even the fact that James Joyce wasn't much of a husband, drinking heavily when he had money, often was out of work and in conflict with his family because of his drinking, spending and unemployment, working on Ulysses - against his doctors strict orders as it would make him blind - when he was in a state of working, his wife hanged on to him all this time. In the same way the book appears difficult to read, and goes on \\"forever\\" in the sense of pages, places and number and level of hidden meanings you can dedicate alife to, Ulysses simply gets too much for many of its readers, making them give in, regarding it to complicated, difficult to understand, simply not worth the effort. In the same manner, the most obvious conclusion to draw from a marriage with James Joyce, might be that it was not worth the effort. As soon as I understood that this probably was exactly the point Joice was trying to make though, it was like I would not and could not let him prove that he was right and unlike my previous attemts to finnish the novel, I succeded. Blessing or curse - I guess this feeling of denying to give in, is excactly what can make a relatationship like this go on.As far as I know, Joyce is the first writer to introduce this projective way of writing - integrate the readers feelings and reactions to what he reads as a vital part of the story. After though, this projective writing is used by several writers - for instance when Bret Easton Ellis writes in a manner that makes the reader of American Psycho feel as bored as his main character Patrick Bateman feels - illustrating that he has more in common with you and me than we care about, or when Jerome David Sallinger in A Perfect day for Bananafish at the last line of the shortstory makes you realize that he has wrapped you arond his little finger all the time, manipulated you to think what he wants you to think, feel what he wants you to feel, leaving you with the predjustises that he wanted you to have , in order not to make you see the fatal conclution.It is obviously other ways to read Ulysses. You find a lot of them in the other customers review. It can be a good advice to put a copy of the so called Ulysses schema in the book when you try to read it, to make it easier to orient in time, space and theme. Make an internet search and you will find it.I hope you will finnish Ulysses with a sense of having read something that made it worth-while:)"},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Not a novel in my view, more an artist using all his materials in a vast experiment, with the secondary agenda of shocking the establishment and sensibilities of his time. Constantly changing style and using a truly massive vocabulary, often seemingly at random, he seems to be using his powers to toy with the reader. There is no real story, no exploration of the human condition and yet it is truly amazing.

I must admit it is not the most accessible book ever written, but it gets four stars for its intent ... and that it is better than \\"Finnegan's Wake.\\" Be warned: This book is not for the casual reader."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Joyce's later works are aimed at that type of person who likes to theorize about the forms of &quot;art&quot; endlessly, without ever being able to point to any meaningful specifics this type of thing may have. In fact, much like the splatter-painting of Jackson Pollock, or the black-on-black canvases of Ad Reinhardt, or the silent compositions of John Cage, or the cut-ups of Wm. Burroughs or the pop lyrics of Bob Dylan, Ulysses has no real meaning at all--and that is its secret to success. When an artist has something important to say, he (or she) expresses himself with as much clarity as possible, just as a person who is shouting &quot;fire&quot; or &quot;wake up&quot; would. When he has little or nothing to say, he writes or paints or plays either right-brain stream-of-consciousness gobbledygook and calls it &quot;metaphor&quot; or &quot;exploring the unconscious&quot;, or presents minimalist nothing at all and calls it &quot;conceptual&quot;. He can then sit back for decades and watch the pseudointellectuals and tenured humanities professors invent endless meanings where there are none, whereas books that contain any clarity will slip into obscurity, since their meanings are obvious and leave the masters (and doctors) of hot air nothing to debate. Ulyssess is the all-time champion of this sort of thing; while many of modern art's similar hoaxes have long since been relegated to the proverbial dustbin, Joyce's obvious genius for manipulating words keeps this thing at the top of the charts among those influenced by academic pretense. The fact that those words are all surface and communciate not one idea of any significance to anyone is a something of a shame for serious people (who might waste time seeking them here, due to its reputation), but an absolute goldmine for the people who like to write glorified term papers about this glorified crossword puzzle and its like. At least the more general reading public has never been swayed by such frauds, preferring mere entertainments like Lord of the Rings--which indeed have more going for them, on any level, than anything Joyce and his kind have ever done."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"This rating reflects the quality of the edition, not the work itself.

It's the most obscure and dense book I've ever read, made even more so by its modernist experiments, but I have to admit it's phenomenally well done. The problem is, instead of turning each page to find out what the characters would do next, I kept reading to find out what *Joyce* was going to do next. So I found it wonderful as a written work, with all the fun, strange and brilliant techniques Joyce used; but as a novel, as a story about people's lives, I really didn't have much interest. I was kept at a distance from the characters by Joyce's telling of the story, so that even when the characters were deep in frenzied monologues, I only heard Joyce's writing, and not the characters' actual voices. I suppose this is typical of modernism, but I found it made the entire experience somewhat unsatisfying."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"There is often much talk about how to best &quot;get&quot; this book. Many will suggest various commentaries, some will suggest several &quot;deep&quot; reads.The best way to come to understand this book, its place in the history of literature, and the excessive praise it has earned in its reviews is to read one simple fable: &quot;The Emperor's New Clothes&quot; by Hans Christian Andersen.If you are looking for an example of great literature, don't look here. If you are looking for a model to improve the precision of your own thought and expression, don't look here. If you want to come to understand a great joke and laugh yourself into hysterics at the sheer buffoonery of modern life, read this book.Having made it through this sick joke of a book and coming to know it thoroughly, I've been in a position to enjoy fits of uncontrolled laughter when I listen to fans of this book begin to yammer. It's a great inside joke that you can really only be in on if you've read the book and understand something of its place in literary history. Having read this silly tripe and listening to self-important types discuss it is more flat out silly than getting stoned out of your brain and watching the South Park movie.As H. C. Andersen taught us, if we simply cannot find any meaning in something it is entirely possible there is no meaning there. And just because other people claim to see meaning in this book, or fleas in a flea circus, or clothes on a naked emperor... well, you get the idea.Hence, I have to give this book at least 2 stars.

James Joyce just wrote a book for you to enjoy. If you want to make a big hairy deal out of some Irish guy writing a book, you probably have no life, or else a Master's thesis to write. James Joyce just stuffed a bunch of language into a book he thought he might like writing. He was just trying to write something worth reading, like Mark Twain, or William Faulkner would. Get over yourself. Joyce took language a little farther out on a limb. He was just another writer trying to make love to English. Why would any writer not try to love a language as lovely as English? Joyce made love to English. Shakespeare was a true polymorphous lover of English. He was embarassing.

Unfortunately, too many academics were entranced by occasional flourishes of vivid imagery to see this sham for what it was (and is): An intense act of laziness and hubris by a writer who had trouble telling stories. I think of _Ulysses_ as the precursor to all the self-indulgent pseudo-intellectual garbage that turned so many people off from reading &quot;great literature&quot; over the last 60 some odd years. However, the greatest tragedy comes from the fact that Joyce had talent in spades and showed it on occasion, such as with many of his short stories.

Sure James Joyce was a writer of some talent as shown by his early short stories and his Portrait of an Artist as a Young Man. But this book?When he wrote it Joyce was in the hands of the European artistic progressives. They had rejected the notion of contest in favor of form. That is hypnotized by that arch braggart Wagner they accepted the delusion that art must continually progress and change form. When he wrote art generally was subject to continual change in style. Picassos went through his various periods, French Art struggled through Impressionism, Cubism and so on.James Joyce moving in those circles felt that he had to reject the form and grammar of his predecessors. That is he had to reject the way of writing which made Dickens, Eliot, Austin and Conrad the giants of literature that they were. What in fact is wrong with the use of grammar and the English Language. It has given us masterpieces such as Shakespeare, Milton and Wordsworth.With Ulysses you can see a novel peeking out from behind the obscure language. Joyce's talent was such that even he could not write something absolutely bad but what a tragedy that such a dud ideology could destroy the work of so potentially gifted a writer.You know its true."},{"Title":"Ulysses","review":"Ulysses is the sorriest excuse for a novel I have ever come across; don't waste your time.

It is a work of its time rather than anything of lasting interest.We all know the background, at the turn of the century the art world was a kaleidoscope of new ideas and trends. In art there was C&eacute;zanne, Seurat, and Picasso. In music Scriabin was experimenting with the melding of music and light.Artists were experimenting with form rather than looking at content. Sometimes these experiments worked other times they led to a dead end and were forgotten.Ulysses is an experimental novel, one that uses the form of stream of consciousness. The form is at the expense of its readability and clarity. What happened with Joyce's experiment, it limped through Finegan's Wake which is so impenetrable it barely rates as a puzzle and died. Ulysses as an experimental art form is a dead end, and with good reason.The sorts of things that made and make literature great are the sorts of things that Joyce rejects with his experiments in form. Literature is related to the content rather than the empty vessel of form.This of course is not to say that Joyce was without talent.

I found this publication easy to read and comprehend. Utilized the information and step by step illustrations to create animation as described. I found it to be an excellent learning tool for beginners and intermediate users. I have advanced personnel on staff who found the applications described most accurate and complete with additional and background materials that serve them on a daily basis. The addition of interview materials was also most informative and resourceful. It added depth and value to the publication.

My biggest complaint about this book is that most of the chapters were boring. Chapter 2 shows an ostrich walk cycle, chapter 6 shows fighting skunks and chapter 8 shows a talking grave.

My two cents."},{"Title":"Flash Character Animation Applied Studio Techniques (Applying Studio Techniques)","review":"The only worthwhile part of this book, is when Purcell intrerviews people who Flash for as a job, and questions them on techniques, tips, and tricks. These pages are very helpful (especially sound). You can tell Purcell himself is no an artist. If you check out the tutorials he wrote, they're just so stupid, and not useful (fighting skunks, a walking ostrich, etc.). However, the CD is great, and hearing pros talk about Flash is something new, it's a worth a buy, but don't bother with the tutorials, they're a waste of time."},{"Title":"Little Town, USA","review":"This collection is chock full of good to great poetry written by the everyday man, woman and child.

It made me feel good about being a part of the human race."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation Speaks Letters and Reflections","review":"I am a product of the 60's. Mr. Brokaw's Book did not try to render an opinion or to state in any way certain people were right or were wrong. He reported what he say and did as a child of the 60's himself. I got a lot from some people who did influence my thinking back then and still have a lot to say as their words are timeless. To say it brought back memories would be an understatement, it brought back ALL the memories, many I wish I could forget, but still they are important. My summary from thosememories is I need them not to do them again, but as a way of life that had a chance before chemicals were introduced."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation Speaks Letters and Reflections","review":"I was touched reading this true account into the lives os soldiers and families suffering their personal anguish throughout the war. The letters and real emotions came to life and I was in awe. I am a Generation X twenty-something and it's a shame my generation doesn't realize what sacrifices this generation, truly the Greatest Generation has made on behalf of our freedom.The stories they shared and the worry the wives felt were awesome. You cannot appreciate what these men and women have been through, the war, the depression and all the after effects of coming home. To live in this troubled time was truly an accomplishment. This is well worth the money.

This collection of stories will give the reader a better understanding of an era most baby boomers have never experienced. The stories come from the hearts of loved ones and speak of loss, pain, sorrow and fear, leaving the reader with a variety of mixed and intense emotions. For most of us, the realities of World War II are events we have only read about in history books or seen on television, but what was it actually like to live in that time? What were the mood actually like? How did people cope with the intense uncertainty? What were the complex emotions that existed in that day-to-day world really like? Through the pages of this book, the reader will develop a compassionate understanding of the love and loss, trials and tribulations, sorrows and joys experienced by individuals who actually lived in this unparalleled time. I highly recommend this excellent book. High praises to Tom Brokaw for bringing these personal chronicles to light, and a million exhaultations to those individuals whose stories are contained within the book; hopefully, they have finally found eternal peace."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation Speaks Letters and Reflections","review":"I am Korean by nationality, but my heart is red, white and blue. When I read this book, I had to wipe my eyes and make sure my wife wasn't looking! Great job, Mr. Brokaw - you're my favorite host! It just filled me with so much pride to be an American! I have so much heart-felt thanks to men and women - most I'll never meet - who secured for me and my family a beautiful future. Every American must read this book - and take extra time to thank a vet, or someone who is a part of this generation. Buy a flag and raise it high with humility and pride. What this book solidified in my heart was that freedom is not the right to do what you want, but the empowerment to do what is right. So many - so young and visionary - risked so much because they felt it was the right thing to do. And I, my family, and our nation, are it's blessed benefactors. Thank you, God, for the Greatest Generation!12-27-01In wake of 911, this book has become even more important to me. Suddenly it's not sappy to be patriotic: to fly flags, brag about our country and actually SING the National Anthem - loudly - at public events, with hand over our heart. You seek out vets to say &quot;thanks&quot; to - and encourage those friends and family currently in the military.The baton has been passed on to me and MY generation. I pray I may be as courageous and vigilant as the Greatest Generation in the ways I need to today.What we build today is what they fought for yesterday. May the generation that follows us stand and say, &quot;They lived worthy of the legacy passed on to them.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation Speaks Letters and Reflections","review":"i read the first book by mister brokaw and was extremely impressed. his second book is not quite as significant in it's effect. there are some great follow-up stories in this book and a few examples of how people &quot;found&quot; each other after 50 years. this is still a book that should be purchased if you love stories about W.W. II."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation Speaks Letters and Reflections","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It adds even more personal insight to the already personal stories of Brokaw's first book. I myself, enjoyed the tales of struggle on the home from and on bonds formed to be slightly more interesting then tales of battle, but I guess that is open to interpretation. The best way to read this book is while listening to music of the time and putting yourself in the shoes of those involved."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation Speaks Letters and Reflections","review":"This book has some great stories, letters, and memos. I would recommend it to school students. I'm sorry it took Tom Brokaw so long in life to finally denounce the 60's generation. I believe he should &quot;be brave&quot; and use his forum to admit the 60's revolution was and is a big failure. By exposing and thanking the WWII veterans, he exposes his hypocrisy, in being part of the liberal biased mainstream press."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation Speaks Letters and Reflections","review":"Anyone enjoying THE BEST THINGS IN LIFE ARE FREE (Health Communications) will appreciate the wonderful stories in words and images presented in this book."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation Speaks Letters and Reflections","review":"This is the perfect follow-up to last year's great book. The book's chapters are organized by subject -- and this is a very effective way of explaining the tremendous letters in this book. A great buy."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation Speaks Letters and Reflections","review":"The book is boring. Perhaps Brokaw is trying to pat himself and others of his age on the back. As young men they fought in WWII- they did not lead it. Their track record as leaders is debatable. As President's go, it seems unlikely that Kennedy, JOhnson, Nixon, Carter, Ford or Bush (HW) will ever be highly rated. Reagan was outstanding so give them a point.Internationally the did not solve the issues of the Mid-East or Northern Ireland. Science marched on but the pace did not change.Even if you except his conclusion, the book is not compelling. TV journalists do well in 60 second, heavily edited snippets. This book did not engage for much more than that.I am glad I borrowed it."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation Speaks Letters and Reflections","review":"This book contains the text of actual letters received by Tom Brokaw, in response to his original successful book &quot;The Greatest Generation.&quot; Letters written by and to soldiers, wives, families and friends give a first hand account of WW II and great insight into the WW II generation, as they lived through the depression, went and returned from battle, and came home often finding that their lives would be changed forever. Many of the letters were written at the battlefront, others at the kitchen table, and paint a true picture of the scene for the reader. Families of many of the forgotten heros were anxious to pass these gems kept in old boxes and dresser drawers, on for others to examine. Readers will experience a variety of emotions as they peruse these irreplaceable jewels from love to loss, loneliness to joy. It doesn't matter if the reader agrees with how and what took place or doesn't, but every human being can learn and benefit from the experiences of these people and their families. A great reading experience, and one that you won't soon forget. Read it, and encourage others to do so."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation Speaks Letters and Reflections","review":"A very moving look at the people who sacrificed so much for this country and did so quite selflessly.

I was moved beyond words by so many of these first-hand accounts. As a 47 year-old daughter of a WWII veteran who has never spoken of his wartime experiences, Brokaw's books have provided me with a deeper respect for and understanding of my dad. This past November I viewed Veterans Day in a way I had never done before. Thank you, Tom Brokaw, for contributing so significantly to our appreciation of this generation."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation Speaks Letters and Reflections","review":"In 1987, my mother, brother, and I walked through the American Military Cemetary in Luxumburg - where thousands of men are buried from the Battle of the Bulge. It is a peaceful, dignified place. We met a women who had finally found the grave of her brother who had died in the battle more than 40 years before. I cried for these men who gave the supreme sacrifice nine years before I was born. Thank you for your sacrifice.

I only wish I had know Tom Brokaw was writing this book. I have an incredible letter written by my father, who flew a bomber in WWII. The letter was written after the troops were not allowed any contact with home, it describes their flights, and happenings in awesome detail."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation Speaks Letters and Reflections","review":"I Sent Mt. Brokaw a short essay in response to his first WWII Book Greatest Generation. Several months later his office contacted me for permission to use my essay in his new book. I agreed and a version of my essay appears on pages 191-92.It was never my intention to write to him for publication. I was telling him a story in return for his telling a large number in his book.I note that he says that he received many manuscripts fomr vets like me. I visited a the National Archives (College Park Maryland)and ther Library of Congress. Neither one had a place to receive and protest manuscripts like the ones Mr. Brokaw received.If we are, as he contends, the Greatest Generation, then that which documents our &quot;greatness&quot; deserves to be preserved.After all the Library of Congress has all of Adolph Hitler's papers How about us?Great Book Mr. Brokaw and in the right spirit of things. Mr. Brokaw, in lucid English and great sense of editing and selection serves well those old WWII GI's to whom he attributes greatness."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation Speaks Letters and Reflections","review":"There is absolutely nothing that is less than superlative about this book. Mr. Brokaw has at once paid tribute to those who do not receive our thanks often enough, and has ensured these men and women and what they gave to us is never forgotten. I am one of the thirty-something's that were a group who were felt may not be interested or moved by these stories. It is not possible to experience every emotion from joy to despair, and finally horror as this book is read. To those who say we take what we have for granted, they are, for the most part correct. Over 274,000 men and women died in WWII alone to preserve what they had then, and then passed to us a Country that was so loved, that immigrants would arrive here, turn around and risk and lose their lives for their new home, many times fighting their original birthplaces! I don't know a stronger way for someone to endorse this Country. And in the last Presidential Election only 43% of those with the gift of freedom to choose their leaders bothered to do so. I was astounded by the men of the \\"Sweet 16\\" who's story I never knew. These men, these black men, fought for their Country, the same Country that allowed Prisoners Of War, to use facilities that were denied to them due to the color of their skin! What is the word for that? Patriotism, not even close. Read the words of Walter Morris of the \\"Sweet 16\\", and then try not to place him on a hero's pedestal. \\"Hispanics\\" produced 12 Congressional Medal of Honor Recipients. Women served at the front lines, and were as exposed to combat danger as the men. And many of them never came home. Why does it take a war to create moments, hours, and days, that we do not experience every day? A Rabbi giving council and comfort to non-Jews, Protestant Ministers doing the same for a Jewish or a Catholic soldier, a Priest doing likewise. There is no word in my opinion that can describe the Rabbi that placed his hand into the \\"Fertilizer\\" that were once Families. Maybe there would be words if the Holocaust were an entirely unique event, instead of a recurring event to this day. Hitler referred to the Armenian Genocide perpetrated by the Turks, and the fact that \\"who remembers?\\" when a general expressed concern as to how they could possibly carry out such evil as they had planned for the Jews. Horror, evil, read \\"The Rape of Nanking\\", very tough to read through. Stalin's slaughter of tens of millions, The Khmer Rouge slaughter of Cambodians, Hutu And Tutsi of Africa just a few short years ago, and the \\"Former Yugoslavia\\" with the hideous phrase \\"Ethnic Cleansing\\" is still not really over. There need be no worry that this \\"Greatest\\" generation, those that came before and after, and who fought for their Country will be ever be forgotten. Mr. Brokaw has set in motion a wave of remembrance, the fact that every day we need realize what we have, and what we could have lost. A sad revelation is that we who owe what we have, have allowed the erosion of respect to the point that Veterans must seek a Constitutional Amendment so the Flag Of The United States, the flag they fought under and for, should not be allowed to be burned by those who's ability to express themselves is so impaired that burning a flag is the best they can do. A mindless, offensive act will always draw attention. The idea that burning the flag is a freedom is difficult to deny. But what is worse are the generations who are so bereft of respect, they burn a symbol that represents the freedom for their hostile behavior. If we all could understand our History and not just know it as facts of the past, Flag-Burning would be a non-issue. Democracy is the most demanding form of citizenship; it is not one that suffers passive or oppressive behavior. (The words that follow are a mix of quotes, and for that I apologize.) \\"Democracy is advanced citizenship, it will demand that you stand in rage and silence, while a fellow citizen advocates something that you would spend your lifetime resisting\\" Sir Winston Spencer Churchill (half American) \\"No one pretends that democracy is perfect or all-wise. Indeed, it has been said that democracy is the worst form of government except all those other forms that have been tried from time to time\\" 11/11/47"},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation Speaks Letters and Reflections","review":"Have you ever told someone from The Greatest Generation thank you for all they endured during those years from 1941-1945?

Their experiences speak for themselves. The over-patriotic and sappy text that introduces each of their letters just gets in the way.I have no doubt about Mr. Brokaw's good intentions. And I don't want in any way want to show disrespect toward the courageous men and women who are the subjects of these two books.But bad writing is bad writing, and this applies to the 20 percent of the book that Mr. Brokaw and his assistants produced. The subjects deserve simple respect, not a gusher of uninhibited, flag-waving adulation.If you are interested in reading more compelling, honest and well-written first hand accounts of this era, I suggest &quot;The Good War&quot; by Studs Terkel."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation Speaks Letters and Reflections","review":"This is just a great book containing letters from some of this nation's finest people.

We will order again from this vendor."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation Speaks Letters and Reflections","review":"This book discusses the letters sent home by soldiers during WWII. The soldiers had fought at D-Day, the Battle of the Bulge, Iwo Jima, etc. One American POW was an eyewitness to the atomic bombing of Nagasaki. He saw an unearthly flash of light, followed by a strong wind that first blow outwardly from the city, and then inwardly. There was an American Rabbi who visited a German concentration camp and saw (and felt) the ashes of the cremated victims. (This was an \\"ordinary\\" concentration camp, not a death camp.)The book also focuses on decades-later reunions. Many were by soldiers who had been buddies during the war. Others, however, were between former enemies. For instance, the Japanese and American veterans of Iwo Jima had a reunion there. A Buddhist Japanese caption and American Christian captain embraced each other.Not all of the testimonies are by Americans. For instance, there was a German who kept hosing down a wooden historic building so that it would not catch fire from Allied incendiary bombing. There is also the testimony of a Pole whose relatives could barely eke out an existence during the German occupation of Poland, and whose innocent relative had fallen into the hands of the Gestapo.Although war is never a pleasant topic to write about, the human spirit shines through in the writing, and the reader can feel delighted instead of downcast. This book is a must for those who like human-interest stories."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation Speaks Letters and Reflections","review":"I sent this to my dad for Father's Day.

Nothing is hokey or excessive, but the honest human sentiment is tough to resist.By contrast, Tom Brokaw sounds like he's phoning in his part of the script. But he has comparatively little to do here. The heavy lifting is done by the professional narrator and actors. A stunner.

We have our faults. I am proud of the everyday men and women who have silently, in their living and working, made the country what it is -- despite its shortfalls. There is a cost associated with having a great melting pot society. Accept The Greatest Generation Speaks for what it is. A rewarding, uplifting read. For those interested in another personal narrative may I suggest non-fiction LIFE WITH NOAH. The content, written from the perspective of a life long Lake Placid native (a camp caretaker and woodsman) warmly greets readers. It offers a wealth of information about nature, beauty, friendship and values. Tom Brokaw and ordinary Americans Richard Smith and charismatic, colorful Noah John Rondeau, the Adirondack mountains last hermit, address a time and culture which desperately needs links with its past and grounding in that which is real."},{"Title":"The Greatest Generation Speaks Letters and Reflections","review":"RE: AUDIO VERSION READ BY BROKAW. I listened to this tape set prior to reading Brokaw's forerunner &quot;Greatest Generation&quot;, and found it profoundly inspiring, and as the son of a Pearl Harbor vet dad and Wash DC clerical mom married since 1947, it rings absolutely true. Very important stuff historically, socially and emotionally. Interestingly, I find that these stories submitted directly by the readers in response to the first book are far more riveting than the interviews Brokaw solicited for the first work. If you have time or interest to read only one make it this one rather than &quot;The Greatest Generation&quot;. The author's reading is surprisingly mush-mouthed for a celebrated news anchor - I'm afraid he's past his broadcasting prime. 5 stars for the material but take one away for this recorded version."},{"Title":"Sisters : Catholic Nuns and the Making of America","review":"Boy, if this isn't an eye-opener! Not a particularly scholarly treatise (thank God), the book nonetheless chronicles well the incredible story of the impact on our American history and way of life \\"the Sisters\\" have had. Living in the \\"heyday\\" of the 50's - early 60's, and having had the blessings of a parochial education, I was not only mesmerized by Fialka's exploration of the scope and breadth and depth of the impact nuns in America have had, but deeply saddened to get a fuller sense of the decline of this influence in our society. I'm no feminist, but if any women in our history deserve greater recognition and honor for what they contributed to our lives it's these women. Fialka's narrative bounces around a little, but he keeps you focused on the mostly selfless dedication many of these Sisters lived by. The stereotypical nun whacking your knuckles with a ruler obscures the realities Fialka chronicles in case after case of the love and devotion so many of these Sisters lavished on their students (or patients). His discussion of the causes of the decline of the Sisters as a force in our society cites numerous influences, not least of which were the upheavals in all corners of our social fabric in the mid-late-sixties, nor the disruption (my word) of the \\"Catholic eco-system\\" resulting from so much misguided interpretations of Vatican II doctrine. Good book. Read it, revel in your memories, and weep for its demise -- America's great loss."},{"Title":"Sisters : Catholic Nuns and the Making of America","review":"Sisters: Catholic Nuns and the Making of America is anoverview of the influence and contributions of nuns in thevast American land. There are a few statistics, someinterviews, and a great deal of history. History can bea very slow read. It can be to dense to wade through.But Fialka does a great job of presenting history in away that is not only interesting, but also enjoyable toread. The only sad part, of course, comes in the latterpart of the book when he writes of the decline of somany of the sisterhoods. Some of the decline was fast andintense, some has been slower - but all of it seems tobe painful. There are a few glimmers of hope, though.Some of the work done by the Dominican Sisters of Nashvilleand the Oblate Sisters of Providence is wonderful."},{"Title":"Sisters : Catholic Nuns and the Making of America","review":"By the time I entered a Catholic elementary school in 1980, only one elderly sister was rumored to be residing in the church's convent. Two years later, the building was used for storage and our music room. Today, daily obituaries show how accomplished many of these women were - receiving an education that would have been unheard of for most women in the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s. It was not until I read this book that I really understood just how important these brave women -- and in many cases, young girls -- were in the development of this country, the nursing of its sick, and the education of its youth. This book skillfully explained the complex reasons for the sudden demise and division in the sisterhood today. Even the non-Catholic will be moved to feel concern for aging nuns and gratitude for their efforts. This book also offered a glimmer of hope as it investigated the growth of the Dominican Sisters of St. Cecilia. I thoroughly enjoyed the experience of reading this book as much as I enjoyed learning what it had to tell me."},{"Title":"Sisters : Catholic Nuns and the Making of America","review":"\\"Sisters\\" is a comprehensive look at how Catholic sistes contributed to the development and growth of the United States of America. From hospitals, to schools to homes of refuge for prostitutes, one can see that Catholic sisters are a fearless cadre of determined women who work long hours, sacrifice much and give without counting the cost. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and learning about the Sisters of Mercy in particular, and what it means to be a religious in general. Even the famous Mayo Clinic had its beginning with a Catholic nun, Sr. Roberta, who encouraged Dr. Mayo to create a world-class clinic in the middle of nowhere. He was skeptical, but she was sure she had a mandate from God. Thank you Sr. Roberta for encouraging the Mayo family in this regard.I felt thankful to all of the sisters who had worked diligently in the Catholic schools I attended as a child and I am glad that Mr. Fialka wrote this book to give nuns recognition which they neither desire or expect, but certainly deserve.It should be a part of our American history curriculum."},{"Title":"Sisters : Catholic Nuns and the Making of America","review":"The old saying \\"Don't judge a book by its cover\\" is certainly appropriate with this one. I assumed that it would chronicle the history of all the major orders of nuns but it doesn't. This is a great book sharing with the readers the history of the Religious Sisters of Mercy from its founding to the present. To be honest, the author does include a few anecdotes concerning sisters from other religious orders that make this book even a better read. Being a Traditionalist in the Catholic Church, I didn't spend too much time on the chapters concerning the Vatican II and post Vatican II periods except the parts dealing with the Orders self-demolition. The RSMs liberation from the yoke of the Roman Church cost them dearly and it was the very elderly nuns who paid the price! It probably won't be too many more years until they die out. That is too bad for the wonderful group of nuns that I remember from St. Peters School in Omaha, NE."},{"Title":"Sisters : Catholic Nuns and the Making of America","review":"This book is at once fascinating and heartbreaking. As a non-Catholic, I was amazed at the accomplishments of Sisters in the US. I used to see them when I was a child, knew they existed but they were mysterious and hidden to me. Reading this book, I feel we have lost something so precious and powerful. As Christianity declines, it is not so much the religion itself I miss, but some - like these - of it's powerful institutions to help others."},{"Title":"Sisters : Catholic Nuns and the Making of America","review":"This has to be one of the most inspiring books I have ever read. It clearly demonstrates the dedication of self-sacrificing women of various religious orders who helped form the consciences of Americans, not to mention the educational and hospitals they built (literally in some cases) when the quality of America's educational system was sporadic, and hospitals' existed in a less-than-desirable hygienic environment. They raised both institutions to a whole new level. These women were educators and nurses par excellence without regard to one's race or creed. Their nursing of and tending to both the Union & Confederate soldiers, and bold presence on the battlefield during the Civil War astonished the soldiers of both sides. By their example, they were able to obtain the affection of even some of the most hardcore bigots of the Catholic Church which especially permeated American society in the 18th & 19th centuries."},{"Title":"Sisters : Catholic Nuns and the Making of America","review":"I love nun books, and this one was no exception. Instead of covering a number of different orders, as most nun books tend to do, this one chose to focus primarily on the Sisters of Mercy. I was excited to learn that this order, the first one to come to America, initially settled in my native city of Pittsburgh! There were so many fascinating stories and women covered in these pages, from the order's amazing founder Catherine McAuley and her successor Fanny Warde to more modern nuns, such as Sister Sharon Burns, the schoolteacher turned musical performer, and the author's own former teacher, Sister Mary Roberta. Since the order's inception in early 19th century Ireland, the Sisters of Mercy have set up shop in numerous states and cities, founded or assisted at numerous schools and hospitals, and gone through the same changes many other orders went through in the wake of Vatican II, but the one constant has been their guiding principles of helping the less fortunate, regardless of their station in life, and doing it without the expectation of receiving fame and fortune in return. The Sisters of Mercy literally helped to build America, as Mr. Fialka describes, as they served in the Wild West, served as nurses during the Civil War, nonviolently stood up to anti-Catholic Know-Nothing prejudice in the mid-19th century, turned swamps and wildernesses into thriving cities and towns, taught countless children during the decades when parochial schools were at their height, and today continue to serve in such capacities as teaching in inner-city schools and nursing AIDS patients in hospitals. Modern nuns might be habitless (or at best wear a modified habit) for the most part, but that doesn't take away their continuing impact on American society. And during it all, they, like many other orders of nuns, had to deal with prejudice from their higher-ups, such as bishops and cardinals who often treated them like stupid children or people they thought they could get away with bossing around because they were \\"only\\" nuns, not male clergy.As much as I loved the book, though, I thought it could have used a closer proofreading job. A number of times I noticed the misuse of commas and apostrophes, along with some embarrassing errors, such as a line that says a ship set \\"sale\\" or another that describes how a nun \\"wrapped\\" on the door."},{"Title":"Sisters : Catholic Nuns and the Making of America","review":"This is a great expose of the many contributions by Catholic religious to the founding of America. A little heavy on the Sisters of Mercy, but the stories of the contributions could be of most congregations. Nursing homes, orphanages, hospitals, schools and universities: all tributes to the hard work and dedication of the religious communities who quietly contributed to the history of the United States. Having learned more about Catherine McCauley, I now understand why the Mercy Order is in such a shambles and the final chapters show that the liberal orders still don't get it. The more traditional orders are the ones that will continue to grow and continue the work of the SISTERS because they continue the work and run the schools, hospitals and nursing homes. The other communities will continue to die out until they are all gone. The author doesn't take sides either, he just lets the story tell itself."},{"Title":"Berlin","review":"Well as I stated above this book is two different books fused into one and not very brilliantly I might add. The first half of the book describes the last month or so of the Third Reich and the fall of Berlin.

There is also an interesting byline of the last days in the Fuhrers bunker how everyone keeps on obeying him although they all know he's talking out of his arse.The second half of the book goes on about how Berlin fared up until 1953 under the soviet occupation. It is actually very dry and is primarily concerned with statecraft. If you are interested how the soviets acted this is interesting in a historical way but if you are in there for descriptions about the second world war stick to the first half.All in all not bad.

Although this is not intended to be a how-to manual, it will give you a VERY clear idea of what a soul retrieval/soul recovery is like -- both from the point of view of the shaman, AND from the point of view of the person needing healing.Of particular interest are nine case studies that are given in full, including: the life problems the person was having that caused him or her to seek help from a shaman; what the shaman \\"saw\\" and did in the spirit realm on the person's behalf; the shaman's interpretation of the symbolic dimensions and significance of what transpired in the spirit realm; what kind of \\"homework\\" the client had to do to integrate the changes into real life; whether the healing \\"took\\" or whether further work was necessary; and follow-up on changes the client experienced over time in life and behavior, reflecting the work that was done.These case histories give you a clear picture of what the client goes through in the process of healing and for that reason I would recommend this book to anyone who is considering having someone else do shamanic work on their behalf.Especially useful is a short section titled \\"Finding The Right Shaman\\" -- which also briefly discusses the related topic of avoiding the WRONG shaman. This was of particular interest to me because of a previous bad experience of mine.Some years before, I'd had a soul retrieval done by a friend-of-a-friend who had credentials as a \\"certified shamanic counsellor\\" (trained in the Harner/Ingerman school) but who gave off bad vibes. Well I should have listened to the vibes, because after I let that woman do a soul retrieval for me, I felt violently agitated, invaded, and violated by her.Then I read this book and when I got to the part where the author (briefly) describes what can happen to you if you get mixed up with a shaman who's into power trips, boy, did that ring a bell with me. Following the pointers in this book and using my own common sense, I was able to avoid repeating the mistakes I made the first time, and find a shaman who was right for ME. And I'm happy to say we were able to clear out the damage that had been done to me by the previous shaman, and get me back on the path towards healing.Of course, on the whole it would be better to avoid situations like that in the first place! I wish I'd known about this book sooner, I think it would have saved me some grief. I would HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone who is considering having a soul recovery/soul retrieval done. It will help you to understand and to actively participate in the healing process, and to steer clear of possible pitfalls.This books is quite short, but it's to the point and packs a lot of bang for the buck. You won't find anything here about the anthropology of shamanism -- the author does not have a Ph.D. in psychology or anthropology, but draws on knowledge that was passed down in her own family for generations (she is part Eastern Cherokee) and on her own experience. She shows great insight into her subject."},{"Title":"Soul Recovery and Extraction","review":"Enjoyed this quick read about journeying to recover lost aspects of ourselves.

It presents an interesting point of view on psychological health.The reader/s should move past 'Western' (i.e., modern) medical concepts; some understanding of shamanism and shamanic practices would be helpful. Before the introduction of 'Western' medicine, I think shamans had equally sophisticated ways of dealing with behavioral disorders: Soul Recovery and Extraction is one method of treating a number of negative habits that are symptoms of greater issues.This is the first book by Ai Gvhdi Waya that I've read, and no, I haven't tried to have a soul recovery performed for myself."},{"Title":"The Pig, the Prince & the Unicorn","review":"I just got pick up this book from an used bood store and glad I did. It's a cute fun little book and since I've never read any of Tolkien stuff I had no problem enjoying the story, though how anybody can compare a loooooooong novel with a short book is beyond me.The pig was cute and funny and the hyper-clean eel was amusing. It kind of makes me want to have an eel for a watch-animal and companion too. The anti-guest witch was also funny to read even though she had a short role.Overall it's a nice book for an afternoon read where all the characters come out swimmingly in the end, even the bad guys, who weren't all that bad."},{"Title":"The Pig, the Prince & the Unicorn","review":"This book is like a scab. It's an awful book; one of the worst books I've read. But for some bizzarre reason, I'm compelled to keep reading it. Maybe I'm just in a massochistic mood.The writer has enough word skill to actually tell a story, but it's not written well. She makes the #1 mistake of fantasy writers, thinking that &quot;Fantasy&quot; does not require realism or sense. There are a lot of logical gaps, contradictions, and unclarities in the details of the world, culture, and characters, and these don't read like the author is being clever or mysterious. She copies too many bad fantasy cliches, while failing to present her own inventions in a convincing manner (example: the people in the undersea kingdom use paper documents, steel armor, and torches! Under water! And the pig is dirty and has to take a bath! Yes, while he's already underwater! The author doesn't seem to notice that this makes NO sense; she just slaps it with the label &quot;Majic&quot; which in this case clearly means &quot;I can't be bothered to think up something new and appropriate&quot;).Yet the tale it is lighthearted (it would be 0 stars if it took itself seriously) and somehow manages to be amusing (mostly because I want to see how bad the next chapter is; yes, really). The young talking pig does behave admirably unlike a cliche fantasy hero (even unlike the usual Poor Unassuming Reluctant Chosen One), which is the book's strongest point. He's just a child-pig, and he does behave like both a child and a pig, befriending everyone he meets if possible (even the &quot;villains&quot;), and frequently showing a kind of bravery that does feel in-line with his youth, inexperience, small size, and desperation.I cannot honestly reccomend that anyone BUY this book instead of something actually GOOD, but if you feel like an amusing frivolity, if you aren't too picky, and if this book is lying around, try it out."},{"Title":"The Pig, the Prince & the Unicorn","review":"I first read this book when I was in high schoolI've read it compulsively, once or twice a year since.I am now 31, graduated from university, and writingbooks of my own.

My mom picked this book because she thought that we kids (there were 5 of us) would like the fact that there was a character we could identify with and that was \\"adult\\" enough so she would also stay interested.

Maybe I'm being picky, but I found far too many parallels with this book to that of the Lord Of The Ring series by JRR Tolkien. In Tolkien, Bilbo and Frodo were the Ring-bearers; in this novel, the pig was the Key-bearer. And in Tolkien, Gandalf rode a fast horse known as Shadowfax; in this novel there was an almost identical character with a very similar name also. There were several other times while reading it that I found parallels too close to Tolkien to be merely coincidental. But enough about that. As a whole, the novel was very shallow and predictable. I didn't find it challenging in the least (as I did when I read the Tolkien fantasy novels...or others like Neverwhere). I gave it two stars for the simple fact that it was easy to follow and I was able to read it quickly. But it left me feeling empty."},{"Title":"Amphoras and the ancient wine trade (Excavations of the Athenian Agora)","review":"The late Miss Grace was the foremost authority on ancient wine jars, amphorae, and worked for many years at the Agora in Athens.

Men cannot be good without making that choice themselves. They can be made to act in good ways, but they cannot be good.\\"The alliance is a very thrilling, modern, science-fiction novel by Gerald Lund, which has left an amazing positive impression on me. One thing that keeps it so interesting and unique is the dealing with this moral statement above. How far should we go to get our society free of crime and violence? I think the idea of the conflict and the storyline itself are very thoughtful and also made me feel different about similar situations in our time.Another thing I really liked about the book is the writing style. Gerald Lund has amazing skills: once I had started I wanted to read the whole book and couldn't stop anymore! There are many changes of the narrator perspective, giving the reader the exact amount of information to make it a thrilling experience. Sometimes boring time periods are just skipped and the next chapter already starts with the next big event. Other times you only get to know the plans of the \\"bad\\" side, and how they create a clever trap on Eric. Then you are totally amazed, that Eric and his friends are even more brilliant and play a double game. There are just many unpredictable and surprising parts in this book that make it unique and absolutely worth to read.The language is easy to read and understand, which I really appreciate since English is not my mother tongue.Another reason why I like this book is that the main characters are very likeable and sympathetic. They aren't like perfect superheroes, but human and learn from the mistakes they make. Eric and his friends are very intelligent as well. They find out how they can trick a system that seems to be unbeatable. Accordingly the dialogs are meaningful and the answers quick-witted and thought-out.A few smaller things I personally think could be still improved are that some parts are not 100% realistic. The main characters seem to have a lot of luck, but I think this is normal for a science fiction novel. Also, in my opinion the middle part concentrates a little too much on the relationship between Nicole and Eric. I would have preferred a bit more variety there, because the main topic starts to repeat.However, I think overall the Alliance is a great thrilling science-fiction novel. I suppose there are many parts that are typical of fictional entertainment reading, and if you don't like science-fiction at all, it won't make you change your opinion. But I had a lot of fun reading it, and it's a book that I probably will remember."},{"Title":"The Alliance","review":"This is a great book for young teans and older.

But the book resonates with incontrovertible truths, fully three-dimensional characters, and an extraordinarily fast-paced storyline. It is reminiscent of other dystopian books like Brave New World or 1984, but at the same time it's strikingly original, rather more accessible, and not nearly as disconcerting. It is an assertion that the freedom to chose evil is better than forced rectitude; a testament to the triumph of human goodness over the vices of evil.I would absolutely recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Alliance","review":"I really enjoyed this book overall. The story is great, and is a lot of fun to read.The biggest problem I had about this book is that at the end it spells out what the lessons are in the most boring way.

I recognize that Lund wanted to emphasize his point, but it ended up taking away from it.At the end the story remains very good, but the implementation is only decent.The book is very good, but was kind of a guilty pleasure (like the Harry Potter series and others).

Having first read \\"The Work and the Glory\\" and \\"The Kingdom and the Crown\\" series by the same author, I was a bit surprised when I found that the book took place in the future, but it was absolutely wonderful. The moral issues explored were very interesting, and the plot was fast paced and exciting. You should definately give this book a try! (P.S. I love Eric Lloyd[the main character]! He's awesome!)"},{"Title":"The Alliance","review":"When I realized that it'd been written by the same person who wrote many religious books I did not expect much. I was assigned to read it for Science Fiction class that I am taking. Usually it seems that teachers get the worst books possible, but this book was excellent. The only problem I had with it was that I was so far ahead in the reading that I often couldn't remember answers to the quiz. I had the book finished almost a week before the rest of the class!"},{"Title":"The Alliance","review":"Synopsis from the book itself: \\"It's eighteen years after the end of civilization as we know it. And in the aftermath of a nuclear holocaust, survivors are being relocated to a new society known as the Alliance. For Eric Lloyd and the members of his village, the Alliance seems like a dream come true. There is work and safety and food enough to spare. But the utopia is not what it seems. Though crime, anger, and prejudice appear to have been eliminated, under the mask of perfection is a society chafing with discontent. Eric vows to destroy the Alliance. But is there any hope of withstanding the Alliance's power structure and its computerized control of its citizens? And what of Eric's growing attachment to Nicole, a Guardian of the Alliance? Author Gerald N. Lund (The Work and the Glory) invites you into a futuristic setting where he explores the principle of moral agency through a gripping tale of good and evil, danger and escapes, and the power of one person to change the world.\\"Gerald Lund wrote this book decades prior to the boom and popularity of dystopian fiction initiated by Collins' \\"The Hunger Games.\\" I recommend it for anyone wanting a good, triumphant read that isn't drawn out in a long trilogy format."},{"Title":"The Alliance","review":"Gerald Lund has always been a favorite author.

Now I realize I am what Germer calls a \\"trailblazer.\\" I've never been one to go along to get along, and I don't kiss up to move up. That's hurt me in the past, but Mustang Sallies is filled with strategies to make me succeed without selling out. I love this book. (...) It's phenomenal."},{"Title":"Mustang Sallies : Success Secrets of Women Who Refuse to Run With the Herd","review":"I got an early copy of this book when Fawn Germer was the keynote speaker at a conference I attended. This book is a powerhouse. On one level, it is great to have such insightful input from Germer's interviews with people like Hillary Clinton, Susan Sarandon, Janet Reno and all kinds of athletes, CEOs and mustangs. But, Germer's words are powerful and her insights are absolutley unforgettable. She has been through some of the same hellacious corporate political encounters that I have experienced, and lived to help the rest of us in our battles.The book shows how our feelings that we are \\"outsiders\\" or \\"misfits\\" be explained by the fact that we aren't marching to the sam drummer as everyone else. We are mustangs who may make some waves because we dare to be excellent and strive for better. The best parts of the book show how to interact with detractors and people trying to put you down.I'll never forget her speech, when she talked about how this boss tried to derail her career and how she bounded back. She's traveled a courageous path that I admire and want to explore for myself.

To read this book and hear what ultra-successful women have gone through in order to just be themselves has given me hope and renewed energy. I am presenting \\"Mustang Sallies\\" to my reading group next month and I feel confident thirteen other women are going to find strength in Fawn's writings.I highly recommend this book to any and all career women who have felt undervalued and conflicted about their careers."},{"Title":"Mustang Sallies : Success Secrets of Women Who Refuse to Run With the Herd","review":"This has saved me about two years in psychotherapy.

It's like my own private sledgehammer for those moments when I feel my power and self-esteem just slipping away."},{"Title":"Mustang Sallies : Success Secrets of Women Who Refuse to Run With the Herd","review":"Do you feel isolated and judged at work, simply for being who you are? Then you may well be a Mustang Sally, insists journalist Fawn Germer (\\"Hard Won Wisdom\\"). Mustang Sallys (from the song) don't go along to get along, says Germer, which means great rewards, but also great trouble - especially in business, where women have little leeway as outspoken leaders.Peppered with interviews from some 75 different women like Hillary Rodham Clinton, Erin Brockovich and Eve Ensler (\\"The Vagina Monologues\\"), Germer offers advice on being true to yourself, fighting for what matters, getting what you want and daring to make mistakes. While Germer suggests little in the way of self-examination, she will definitely reassure courageous yet criticized women who refuse to kiss up in order to move up."},{"Title":"Mustang Sallies : Success Secrets of Women Who Refuse to Run With the Herd","review":"Every morning,I put on my business suit and pumps, go into the office and hope like heck I don't get beat up again.I have had my share of bad bosses and experienced many situations of sabotage.

Now I know that it's because I belong with these mustang women like Nadia Comaneci, Eve Ensler, Carly Fiorina, Janet Reno and the others in this special, life-changing book. One thing I learned is that I have to be more proactive in my personal interactions. I have to know what others want and expect.

Yes, I know, this is a thrid edition and is supposed to be an updated rehash, but there is also a lot of content here from some of Bly's other books, such as The Copywriter's Handbook. The thing is, there is also enough new and valuable content here to make this another \\"must read\\" for copywriters.This book also very closely mirrors Peter Bowerman's Well-Fed Writer with much of the same content. That's not necessarily a bad thing and just adds confirmation to the advice being given.I wont begin to talk about what you might take away from this book.

I first discovered Bly when this book was \\"how to make $75,000 a year\\". At the time, I was a university student, hoping to someday make it as a writer. I bought this book one summer and, within a month, I'd summoned up the courage to get published in a major newspaper - for pay. And I was hooked. I toted the book everywhere with me, even as I moved from college apartment to apartment. When I finished university, I launched my business, using the ideas in this book.

HOWEVER....When I wrote to the author, Robert Bly, several years later to thank him for his good advice, his reply was a pitch for AWAI, billed a \\"writer's resource\\" that hawks \\"classes\\" and \\"reports\\" for new and experienced writers -- through those loooooooong sales letters with all kinds of testimonials from \\"satisfied customers.\\"Further, I got into an email discussion with Bly over a grammatical point which I know was correct. I very politely pointed it out to him; is response was curt and defensive. So I again tactfully restated my reasoning. His second reply was, \\"whatever.\\"Third, I ordered one of his products a few months ago online. I was emailed a code to use to access and download the product. I didn't get to it right away -- maybe a week after it had been sent to me -- and when I attempted to download, was denied access because the code had expired. I wrote to Bly's organzaition once; no reply. I wrote a second time; no reply. Wrote a third time, threatening to notify the publisher of the online newsletter in which his ad had appeared. The reply was notification that my credit card had been credited the amount of my purchase. No apology for the delay in asnwering nor for not telling me the code would expire, no attempt to re-issue the code so I could get the product (besides the incredibly poor customer service, just plain bad business practice) which is all I really wanted when I wrote the first and second times.So, although I can't deny that Bly knows the freelance writing formula for success, and his books are indeed valuable resources for those of you considering a career in freelance writing, I will never purchase another of his books or online products that would directly profit Bly. I find one of his books in used-book store, though....that's a different story (pun intended)!"},{"Title":"Sea Star Orphan of Chincoteague","review":"Bought 3 for grandkids for Christmas, to get them ready for a Family camping trip to Assateague Island in May."},{"Title":"Sea Star Orphan of Chincoteague","review":"I'm surprised and delighted that Marguerite Henry's books have recently been put back into print, as despite the surplus of \\"horsey books\\" that flood the market, theMisty of Chincoteaguebooks have always been rather special, due to the vivid sense of time and place, the warm family environment, and the focus on the responsibility that the children must assume in order to care for the horses that cross their paths.The books are set on the islands of Chincoteague and Assateague off the coast of Virginia, and Henry captures the beauty of these islands: the grassy plans, piney forests, sandy shores and clear blue skies - it's enough to make you want to jump on the nearest plane and visit yourself. The wild horses that roam Assateague are the descendants of the horses that survived the wreck of the Spanish galleon off the coast and flourished on the island; these days the horses are famed for the Pony Penning Week in which the inhabitants of Chincoteague drive the horses across the water in order to sell various mares and foals.In previous books in this series, the children Paul and Maureen Beebe become besotted with the wild mare Phantom, only to turn their attention to her foal Misty when Phantom proves too wild. Since then Misty has reached near-celebrity status, and \\"Sea Star\\" opens with a pair of film producers arriving at the Pony Ranch to make an offer on Misty, hoping to include her in the film they're making about the Chincoteague ponies. Needing the money in order to help get their cousin through university, the siblings reluctantly agree. Struggling with their loss, the children's grandparents try to distract them with various tasks about the farm, and it is during an expedition to fetch oysters that the two come across an extraordinary sight.In Tom's Cove on Assateague Island, Paul and Maureen find a lonely foal with a crooked star on his forehead lingering by the dead body of its mother. Rounding it up themselves, the children dub him \\"Sea Star\\" and manage to get him home, where they're confronted with the new challenge of nursing him through his infancy.The story is neatly divided into two halves: the loss of Misty and the coming of Sea Star. The first half of the story deals with the children trying to cope with the departure of their beloved pony, and despite being the title character, Sea Star doesn't actually turn up until approximately the middle of the book. However, once he does appear, the challenge of taking care of him begins.One of the best aspects of the story is the warm, loving environment that Mr and Mrs Beebe provide for their grandchildren. I'm not entirely clear where the children's real parents are (it's been a while since I've read the previous books in this series) but the Beebes are a powerful force of good in the world, raising their children to be practical, kind-hearted and well-mannered. As wise as their years, the grandparents often have to make some decisions that seem somewhat cruel at first; such as Grandpa Beebe's steadfast refusal to let the children feed Sea Star with a bottle, recalling a past foal that was ruined by such a method, and eventually coming up with an ingenious way in which to provide the foal with the much-needed milk.Also worth noting is Henry's grasp of the linguistics of the area, such as: \\"Now it's gettin' on fer dinnertime and I got to take yer Grandma to the dinin' hall. The ladies is a-waiting,\\" and \\"Childern, now I know fer sure there's somethin' of the best of me in the both of ye,\\" and \\"I recomember now!\\" All of the little quirks in the speech patterns are an essential part of the charm of both the islands and the books. Likewise are Wesley Dennis's lovely illustrations that thankfully have been reproduced for these new editions.In many respects the stories may be a bit dated, particularly in how Paul is given prominence in the story's main events (Maureen is sent to wash dishes whilst he gets to work with the horses) and there is a rather unpleasant portrayal of a rodeo (I suppose your mileage may vary, but I've never seen much appeal in the sport of bareback riding) but on the whole, the Misty books have retained their warmth, humour and love of horses that made them so popular in the first place."},{"Title":"Sea Star Orphan of Chincoteague","review":"i liked this book a lot. it was very interesting and i liked it a lot. i think marguerite henry is a very good author. i love all her books. this book is definetely something people should read."},{"Title":"Sea Star Orphan of Chincoteague","review":"Sea StarOrphan of ChincoteagueBy Marguerite HenryIllustrated by Wesley DennisReviewed by MadelineSea Star is the magnificent sequel to Misty, which was thought of as Miss Henry's only Chincoteague story.

With its mamma dead, the foal can't feed and will die, unless Paul and Maureen have something to say about it. The two children take in the little foal in and give him milk from a mare at a nurse-farm and from a bottle, naming the foal Sea Star, for the star-shaped blaze on his forehead.

I thought that it would be very boring bacuse of the front cover and I shouldn't have judged the book by it's cover so I read it, then I thought that sane was very true. Once I got to the conflict I couldn't get my eyes off the book. It starts out like an ordinary book with little, small details and then they have surprise news that wakes you up. You are halfway dead when all of a sudden you are more than alive. This book is great becaus eit is very detailed so I understand so well that I can grow and share this with my kids, and you can't take your eyes the book.Paragraph #2The way they described the story was very different from how other books, that I have read, had explained the story. They make a sentence like: Let's go eat! Into like a describtive sentence like this: Let's go enjoy a meal by filling our hungry stomachs with a big and nice samdwhich! I love how they describe every single, little thing they talk about. It's like, if they don't write so that we can't understand, they aregoing to quit writing the book, they do their writing so well! I know what is going on and I am interested in what is going to happen next.Paragraph #3The way they explain the story is that they take a hard story to explain into a easy kingdergarten book. I can memorize the book word by word. (exaderation) I had a time where I had got mad at the book because it was getting all interesting until they made it so confusing I didn't get it. I was so frustrated that I got mad at the book. This book is always more than understandable. Everyday I read this book, I forget things very easily, I can remember this story from where I started to where I ended everyday. To tell the treuth this book had got me hyptnotised into it.Paragraph #4Whenever I read books I always get into trouble for not reading it a lot, but this book I get into trouble for reading it too long. This story is a very continuous story that if you take your eyes off for one moment you miss a whole apple tree in a garden. I enjoy howq there is something going on everytime and everyday. Many people don't know the feeling of horses. While reading this book you enjoy and learn at the same time. I would tell everyone that doesn't like to read and give them this book. Last of all the ending, the ending has a whole different side to everything I said. The ending is the most saddest part ever, even though it is a happy ending. The book ended! I hate it when books end, it seems like your adventure had ended and you have to start all over again. You never know whaty kind of books are as interesting as this. Your book fun time is over.

The way they described the story was very different from how other books, that I have read, had explained the story. They make a sentence like: Let's go eat! Into like a describtive sentence like this: Let's go enjoy a meal by filling our hungry stomachs with a big and nice samdwhich! I love how they describe every single, little thing they talk about. It's like, if they don't write so that we can't understand, they aregoing to quit writing the book, they do their writing so well! I know what is going on and I am interested in what is going to happen next. The way the explain the story is that they take a hard story to explain into a easy kingdergarten book. I can memorize the book word by word. (exaderation) I had a time where I had got mad at the book because it was getting all interesting until they made it so confusing I didn't get it. I was so frustrated that I got mad at the book. This book is always more than understandable. Everyday I read this book, I forget things very easily, I can remember this story from where I started to where I ended everyday. To tell the treuth this book had got me hyptnotised into it. Whenever I read books I always get into trouble for not reading it a lot, but this book I get into trouble for reading it too long. This story is a very continuous story that if you take your eyes off for one moment you miss a whole apple tree in a garden. I enjoy howq there is something going on everytime and everyday. Many people don't know the feeling of horses. While reading this book you enjoy and learn at the same time. I would tell everyone that doesn't like to read and give them this book. Last of all the ending, the ending has a whole different side to everything I said. The ending is the most saddest part ever, even though it is a happy ending. The book ended! I hate it when books end, it seems like your adventure had ended and you have to start all over again. You never know whaty kind of books are as interesting as this. Your book fun time is over. I enjoyed this book and I had learned a lot from it."},{"Title":"Sea Star Orphan of Chincoteague","review":"I remember how eager I was to read this book when I received it as a kid, because I loved \\"Misty.\\" But I didn't find \\"Sea Star\\" as compelling. It's one of the few Marguerite Henry books that I didn't read over and over."},{"Title":"Sea Star Orphan of Chincoteague","review":"After reading Misty of Chincoteague, anyone could become enamoured with the ponies of Assateague island. That being said, this book is kind of a let down after that. While it was still well written for children and does envelop the horse culture that is Chincoteague, the story almost seems incomplete and not very fleshed out.Its the next Pony Penning day at Chinconteague and before all the wild ponies of Assateague can be driven over to the island, Paul and Maureen are approached by some movie makers wanting to buy Misty, their pony they had gotten the year before. Misty is beloved to them and they have a hard time letting her go, but need the money to send their uncle to college and also think other children should be able to experience the wonderfulness that is Misty. With the emptiness that fills their hearts after letting her go, they need to find something to ease the pain. Luckily, they find an orphaned foal whom they call Sea Star and claim him for their very own. He doesn't want to eat however, and is not thriving very well. Maureen and Paul have to find a way to save him.The characters in this book are not as fleshed out. Although they are the same as from the previous books, they just don't have as much warmth to them and even Grandpa Beebe seems a little less cheerful. Grandma Beebe gets a few more lines in this book which was nice to see, but still remains a minor character. The book mostly focuses on Paul and Maureen but they are often doing things rather than experiencing them and showing emotion (the exception being when they make the decision to sell Misty).This book is still very well written for kids. Most of it is easy to read and understand and has a simplicity that even the younger ages can handle. There isn't anything offensive in this book and it is appropriate for all ages. I do find some flaws in the writing though, although a lot happens in this book there is scant description and the ending seemed incomplete. Another fifty pages or so would definitely help the book and bring the story along more.It was an ok book, just not as good as some of Henry's others. I do look forward to reading some of her other books and always love a good horse story that appeals to adults and children alike.Sea StarCopyright 1949174 pages including pictures"},{"Title":"Sea Star Orphan of Chincoteague","review":"Marguerite Henry is one of the best animal story authors I have ever read. She has a smooth, flowing style of writing. Her books are generally true to history and often based on real stories. They are easy to read but still suitable for both adults and children. In this book she really appeals to all animal lovers, male, female, young and old. It's refreshing to read a horse book that is not just another 'girlie' horse novel. This story is SO much more then that! Henry's stories will be classics for a long time. In this story (it's the sequel to her book 'Misty') brother and sister Paul and Maureen sell their favorite pony Misty and though they are sad, they know it's for a good cause. Soon after, they happen to find an orphaned colt on the beach with a crooked star on his forehead and they eventually find him a foster mother-pony who lost her own baby. This is a heart warming story and I love the ending. It has some sad parts and some adventure but nothing too intense or scary. A good choice to read to younder kids and sensitive readers. I would reccommend this to boys, girls and anyone who loves horses."},{"Title":"Sea Star Orphan of Chincoteague","review":"This book kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. I felt like i was right there with Paul and Maureen. They are the two main charecters that found Sea Star on the beach. This book explains the little ponys struggle for life and how Paul and Maureen helped save the ponys life. The author explains everything so well that you dont want to put the book down, ever. If you like animals then you should read this book. The author did a great job explaining and keeping you on the edge of your seat the whole time."},{"Title":"Sea Star Orphan of Chincoteague","review":"Although author Marguerite Henry had not envisioned a sequel to MISTY, she found herself touched by the real plight of a tiny orphan colt whose mother had died at Tom's Cove. Those plucky youngsters, Paul and Maureen Beebe, make the ultimate sacrifice: they decide to sell their beloved Misty in order to finance their uncle's education at Seminary. But when the Lord cloes one door, he often opens a window somewhere else. In this case the starving little type whickers his way into the children's grieving hearts, giving them something positive to work for: finding him proper nourishment.If you enjoyed MISTY OF CHINCOTEAGUE, you will love this tale as well. There is more of Grandpa's blustery horse sense--for children, as well as for the animals on Pony Ranch. It is also a treat to experienceGrandma's warm support for empty stomachs and aching hearts. Readers will relive the excitement of the roundup on Pony Penning Day, as the firemen of Chincoteague hold their annual fund raiser (capturing and selling the wild ponies of Assateague Island to Mainlanders). This year a movie crew is on hand to film the tumultuous events. The conflict of human versus equine will is played out on a salty stage of splashing waves off the Virginia coast. Sea Star will quickly capture your interest, along with world-famous Misty. A light, heart-warming read for kids of all ages."},{"Title":"Sea Star Orphan of Chincoteague","review":"This book was addicting! At school I couldn't wait to come home to read it!

Although classified as a Contemporary Romance, it touches on relationships between mothers and daughters, sisters, friends, and spouses.From the back cover:&quot;Carefree photographer Jenny Romano is nearly as famous as her subjects. Her globetrotting life leaves little time for a serious relationship, and that's just the way she likes it. Besides, her perfect older sister Grace already occupies the role of ditiful wife and mother -- or so it seems. Suddenly, Grace needs her sister more than ever, and Jenny finds herself in the sort of small town, suburban life she swore to avoid.&quot;&quot;For psychologist Elliot Drake, healing pain is an around-the-clock job that keeps his own relationships short and bittersweet. Elliot has never met anyone like Jenny. Brash, outrageous, unpredictable, she's a force of nature -- nothing at all like her cool, collected older sister. She's also made it clear that she's not sticking around for long. And suddenly, Elliot's not so sure that short-term is the way he wants things...&quot;&quot;Taken by surprise and unsure of the next step, Elliot and Jenny discover that real life happens whether you want it to or not. And truth gives wings to the heart's most important journey.&quot;This story tells of fear, hope, love, yearnings and triumphs. I really loved it. This book would be an excellent book for a readers' study group. In fact, after reading The Butterfly Garden, I visited Mary Campisi's homepage and found there a list of recommended questions to use for a study group.This is a book which delves honestly into the things which hold us back and set us free."},{"Title":"Oops...We're Married?","review":"If you like your sweet romance with a strip-poker scene, then this is the book to read!

Thank you Amazon."},{"Title":"Inside the Prisoner: Radical Television and Film in the 1960s","review":"The disparity between the contents of this book and its title may be judged by comparing a comment on the back cover with a section of the main text:Back cover:&quot;Rakoff - who was intended by McGoohan to play a key role in the scripting of future episodes - now reveals how the series could have developed, then and now.&quot;Main text (p.176, col. 1)&quot;McGoohan's promise that I'd have four episodes in the next tranche of the series was perhaps not seriously meant. It was probably only a well-meaning apology for having abandoned me in order to be free to go to Hollywood.&quot;In order to get this book in perspective you need to take full note of the subtitle - &quot;radical television and film in the 1960s&quot;.An even more accurate subtitle would have been &quot;Ian Rakoff, an autobiographical account of how I came to England and worked on a few films, and served as assistant editor on a couple of episodes of 'The Prisoner', during the 1960s&quot;.As Rakoff himself admits, he came &quot;in at the tail end of things&quot; (p23) as far as the making and editing of The Prisoner was concerned, and apart from a few brief and highly uncommunicative meetings with McGoohan, whatever he (Rakoff) knew about the series was gossip and hearsay.His version of the nature of the original 'Rover', for example, is clearly not from personal experience, and conflicts with evidence that there really was a blue VW 'beetle' with flashing light.He also suggests, for no good reason, that production manager Bernard Williams came up with the idea of using weather balloons; which doesn't tally with the more widespread report that McGoohan fortuitously spotted a weather balloon in flight and gave Williams the task turning this into a practical replacement for the VW bug.Not surprisingly, then, even that section of the main text that deals with the TV series (pages 23-100) consists almost entirely of vague anecdotes that are more likely to be of interest to film and TV technicians than to fans of the TV series. Nor is this section of the book entirely given over to items related to the making of The Prisoner, but regularly wanders off into pure autobiography, as in Chapters 5 and 7, for example.Having said all that, it might seem that Rakoff is still a key witness as regards the concepts and philosophy behind the TV series. After all, he did work as a writer on the series, didn't he?Well yes, sort of. It turns out that Rakoff wrote the basic story for the episode 'Living in Harmony' - but had very little to do with the final script. Indeed, on viewing the initial screening he comments:&quot;For a moment I couldn't believe I'd written any of what I was seeing. It seemed familiar but from somewhere far away and long ago. Dialogues struck chords.&quot; (p.98)The fact is that Rakoff based his own story on material in Gene Autrey (cowboy) comics of the 1950s. It's relevance to the central themes of The Prisoner was, (given his very limited time on the project), almost entirely co-incidental. And the episode as it was filmed and screened, owed nearly everything to series producer David Tomblin - who is credited as producer, scriptwriter and director on this particular episode.In short, if you're keen to lay your hands on 'anything' that relates to The Prisoner then you'll pobaby want to own this book as well.If, however, you're looking for material that provides genuine insights into this most enigmatic of all TV series then there are far better ways of spending your money."},{"Title":"Inside the Prisoner: Radical Television and Film in the 1960s","review":"Rakoff, an assistant editor on the show, does his best to describe what it was like to work with McGoohan, Markstein, Tomblin, et al., but he only worked on a few episodes, and really saw only a sliver of the total picture. Too much of the book focuses on the rest of Rakoff's career as a writer and filmmaker, which is marginally interesting, but not Prisoner-related."},{"Title":"Inside the Prisoner: Radical Television and Film in the 1960s","review":"A very deceptive title. Ian Rakoff worked on only a few episodes and his accounts are limited to a few encounters with McGoohan and trivial gossip around the show. The book should've been titled &quot;Ian Rakoff: A bunch of stuff I did that had nothing to do with the Prisoner.&quot; Maybe 25% of the book is about working on the show, the rest is about his career before and after which makes for poor reading. I didn't even finish it because after the sections about the Prisoner it completely lost my interest. Anything worthwhile about the Prisoner has been written about in other books. Avoid dissapointment."},{"Title":"Inside the Prisoner: Radical Television and Film in the 1960s","review":"Readers expecting a straightforward look at the classic 1968 television show should look elsewhere (probably towards PRISONER: A TELEVISIONARY MASTERPIECE)-- while Ian Rakoff has many interesting things to tell us about the making of the show, and fascinating insights into Patrick McGoohan, this is much more autobiography than television analysis. But if this visionary show taught us anything, it is to not accept the easy binaries and divisions of form too often foisted on us. Imagine, then, the publishing industry as &quot;The Village,&quot; and Ian Rakoff as its No. 6, using the show as a pivot point to explore TV and Film in Britain in the sixties, race and class as issues within the counterculture, and Mr. Rakoff's own split existence as white South African artist and revolutionary AND commercial editor and screenwriter. It doesn't all work-- in particular, Mr. Rakoff's firm moral viewpoints, while deeply admirable, sometimes cause a bit of tunnel vision, not allowing him to see that, especially on a show like THE PRISONER, &quot;politics&quot; can take many forms, and have many sides (hectoring Lindsay Anderson, then, should not be the end all and be all of conscientous film, not in the age of the Beatles and the New Wave). Still, this is an insightful and unique take on a crucial bit of mass culture, and, per its subject, a fittingly quirky and personal one. One more complaint-- Overlook Press does magical things when it comes to film criticism and history, but they desperately, DESPERATELY need a copy editor or two-- there are punctuation errors everywhere, and even a page gets transposed. Shoddy, and shame, given the generally outstanding qualities of the actual text and graphic layouts."},{"Title":"Inside the Prisoner: Radical Television and Film in the 1960s","review":"It's misleading to call this book &quot;Inside the Prisoner&quot; since probably about half of it concerns the author's other TV and film experiences, culminating in his work on &quot;If.......&quot; But when Rakoff does tell us about McGoohan and The Prisoner, he's transfixing. Most of the other books I've seen on The Prisoner amount to episode guides; few give you a sense of what it was like to work on the series. Rakoff was there and tells us. I don't recall any other book that explains in detail, for example, the strained relations between McGoohan and George Markstein, or what it was like to work around David Tomblin. By giving us these details, Rakoff adds depth not only to his story but to other accounts we've read about the series. This is one of the few books I've seen about The Prisoner that was genuinely original."},{"Title":"Inside the Prisoner: Radical Television and Film in the 1960s","review":"What the others have said. The Prisoner content is minimal, but what there is slightly furthered my understanding of the series and its origins.If you're interested what it was like to be a peripheral character in the film industry in London in the Swinging Sixties, this is worth a look."},{"Title":"Inside the Prisoner: Radical Television and Film in the 1960s","review":"First and foremost, this is not a book with new insights into the series. Nor does it shed new light on the series and its meaning. Rather, this book is more of a snapshot of the era in which the series was made, from the perspective of a writer and filmmaker whose greatest involvement in the series was being the writer for an early draft of the episode, \\"Living In Harmony.\\"Instead, the author, Ian Rakoff, writes extensively of his own filmmaking experience, from his anti-aparthied experiences in South Africa (of which he refers to frequently), his brushes with notable radical filmmakers, to his involvement in 'leftist' films and other projects, such as The Prisoner.For fans of The Prisoner, his few interactions with Patrick McGoohan are the most interesting. In these few passages, the reader is treated to Rakoff's perception of the actor/producer, both from production rumors to actual interactions, and how McGoohan appeared to be affected by the troubled production of the series. But before more can be digested of the possible impact on the development of the show, Rakoff wanders off on his own personal and professional development as a filmmaker in 60's Europe.While the author often returns to the development of his episode script, he is more interested in revealing the radical filmmaking culture that The Prisoner eventually became a flagship for. And this is where the book finds its value; not for his association with the show.It is fascinating to read about the variety of people that were involved in the show, the different kind media culture that bred the type of filmmaking at that time, and what impact, if any, these same people may have had in the show's development, or demise.For students of the development of radical filmmaking, this is a fine companion book. For fans of The Prisoner who must have it all, look for it used and refer instead to the more interesting Appendices and the Episode Summaries. All other fans might want to look elsewhere.NB: The episode summaries are adverstised as being produced \\"in collaboration with Six of One, the official Prisoner Fan Club.\\""},{"Title":"When Dragons' Hearts Were Good","review":"This account of what life may have been like in the Garden of Eden is based on the book of Genesis.

With &quot;Spirits of the Ordinary&quot; Kathleen Alcala has supplied us with an excellent example of the mystical genre which is, insofar as I can assess, by far the most difficult and interesting format to work with and master.Set in the late 19th century, the book essentially is the story of one man-born a Jew, married into a large Catholic family, so estranged from both he lives essentially alone prospecting for gold in the mountains of old Mexico-who eventually becomes the equivalent of a shaman to and for the indiginious Indian communities in Northern Mexico/Southern New Mexico.Alcala hits the righ tone by introducing her mysticim indirectly and in a low key--the requisite angels, spirits and revelations are present, but are a complement to rather than the focus of the basic story.The book exhibits flaws common to the debut novel--sometimes disjointed, major characters a bit too out of focus, minor characters given too much play, etc., but the genuiness of the story, the aura of mysticims established, the overll quality of the writing and the extraordinary bredth of the core characters more than compensate for these weaknesses.Overall, this was one of the best novels I'e read this year and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Spirits of the Ordinary: A Tale of Casas Grandes","review":"In her first novel Alcala writes the story of Zacharias, a Mexican Jew who, in the late 19th century, leaves Mexico to pursue his dreams of finding gold in North America. He leaves behind his wife and children and his Jewish parents. His wife, tired of him spending her father's money on his prospecting expeditions, does the unthinkable and has herself declared financially independent of her husband. His father, a scholar who cannot understand his son's wanderlust, studies Kabbalah with the hope of understanding where his son went, both figuratively and literally.On its dust jacket, the novel is described in terms of other authors of epic and mystic Hispanic fiction (Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Jose Luis Borges), which is why I chose to read it.Alcala does a beautiful job of giving the novel a sense of place in both Old Mexico and New Mexico. Her characters are engaging and complex. Her writing style is, indeed, reminiscent of more established (indeed legendary) Hispanic authors. Perhaps this is why I was so disappointed in the novel itself. For the first two-thirds or so, the novel progresses wonderfully and draws you into the lives of these remarkable characters. It's in the last third that, for me, it all falls apart. The end of the novel wraps up too quickly compared to the pace established at the beginning with many of the characters' stories being finished unsatisfactorily, or not at all (some characters simply are not mentioned again.I have just read that this is the first novel of a trilogy, so perhaps the next two will pick up the threads of some of the missing characters' lives. Unfortunately, when I initially read the book I don't remember any indication that it was one of three so I was expecting it to stand on its own and it didn't quite do that. So, while I thought it was a good book, I was disappointed because I was expecting a great book. I'm still undecided as to whether or not to read the second book in the trilogy when/if it is available."},{"Title":"Spirits of the Ordinary: A Tale of Casas Grandes","review":"I loved this book. It is rich in biblical themes and Mexican history, with touches of magical realism and Cabala before it was trendy (this book was published in 1996 originally). I felt transported to the red earth desert. There was a spare poetry to the words that seduced me. I didn't want to the pages to end. I'm sorry to hear that the sequel is disappointing."},{"Title":"Spirits of the Ordinary: A Tale of Casas Grandes","review":"Clearly the best of the three books in the series, Spirits of the Ordinary courageously introduces the reader of Mexican-American literature to the hidden Jewish component to the southwestern culture. Many practicing Catholics of the area continue to have clearly Jewish customs. They go back to the Conversos of the time of the Inquisition, and whose ancestors came to North America with the early settlers. The combination of the general magical realism genre--mixed with the Jewish element of mysticism along with a wonderful tale--makes for excellent reading. Alcala is a master storyteller, and her characters are placed in a variety of landscapes from a small back yard garden to the vast wilderness of the Mexican hills. There is a lot of Garcia-Marquez and Rudolfo Anaya wannabes, but Alcala rises above the copycats to blend the local literary scene with creative gusto. A wonderful book, which I have enjoyed more than once."},{"Title":"Spirits of the Ordinary: A Tale of Casas Grandes","review":"Nicely told story set in New Mexico around the turn of the century.

Filled with black and white illustrations from the period in question, the fashion plates, drawings, caricatures, and portraits help create a strong sense of the 19th century. This book follows the gradual changes and shows the overall shape of each chunk of time in the form of silhouettes (The author prefaces each section with a gray on white figure outlining the nature of that time's costume). While this book may be out of print, it is well worth the search if your passion is costume history through primary resources, particularly that of the 19th century. The approach is purely pictorial, but if what you want to know is the look, this book is excellent."},{"Title":"The fashionable lady in the 19th century","review":"Charles H. Gibbs-Smith, a curator at the famous Victoria and Albert Museum in London, assembled this book in 1960 to provide a pictorial overview of 19th-century ladies' high fashion.

There isn't much text but every picture has a brief caption, and one could certainly say that many of the outfits shown here speak for themselves. The reader can clearly see how fashion evolved and changed from the filmy, figure-exposing muslin dresses of 1800 to the S-curve corsets and pouter-pigeon bosoms of 1900.

I've seen FAQ-pages of websites that had more content than this booklet (or should I say &quot;brochure&quot;?).

Okay. Let's roll!\\" (Pg. 215)Larry Ellison, CEO of Oracle (where Todd worked), eulogized Todd's heroism in an E-mail sent to all Oracle employees, and Lisa mused, \\"Clearly Larry was convinced that Todd had been involved. How did Larry know that? The FBI hadn't made any announcement to that effect... Yet Larry, like many of us, couldn't imagine Todd Beamer sitting idly by while terrorists threatened to hurt others.\\" (Pg. 184-185)After President Bush paid tribute to Beamer and the other heroes of Flight 93 in a speech to Congress and the Congress stood and applauded, she records, \\"it was the most humbling experience of my life to know that they were applauding me, in an indirect effort to express their appreciation to Todd and the other heroes aboard Flight 93.

However, the text offers the best, most accessible summary of the key principles involved in REIT investing for the little guy. I would pay very close attention to the general principles outlined in chapters 3, 4 and 16. Several chapters in the book look at a distinct property type (multi-family residential, commercial, triple net lease, among others) and deserve attention as well. Ignore all of the stock data and company profiles, as all of that information is useless now, given all the changes that have happened in this space over the last decade.Don't let the admitted dated nature of the text keep you from gleaning its important 'secrets'. Too many gullible investors look at REITs for their fat, juicy yields, and inevitably get burned in the process. Like I said, pay very close attention to chapters 3, 4 and 16, and in a pinch, before investing, consult chapters 4 and 16 before you commit your funds.I wish the guy would write an updated version of this little gem of a book. Read this book before you read a book like Block's Investing In REITs (latest publication is the 3rd Edition, circa 2006 or 2007) in order to put this particular investment into proper perspective."},{"Title":"Getting Past Almost: Expanded Edition","review":"The narrator (who shares the author's name) tells a friend about his gay sexual adventures.

Franck was one of 20th Century America's most prolific gentlemen travel writers. This account of his survey of Alaska in the 1930s should be considered a must-have for anyone wanting a good glimpse of what the land and people of Alaska were like in that era, and what it was like to visit there, delivered in an easy-going, folksy story telling style, complete with about 100 of the author's black and white photographs.Franck, although not to be confused with a hardcore outdoors adventure traveler, traveled the length and breadth of Alaska by boat, auto, foot, airplane and railroad, meeting the natives and newer settlers, relating some of the history along with the current status of a land that, even more so than now, was considered an exotic place, a land of eccentrics and eccentricities."},{"Title":"On the Body: A Contemporary Theology of the Human Person (Crossroad Book)","review":"Cardinal Carlo Maria Martini has a very powerful way with words. I believe this book can provide insight whether Christian or of another faith.On the section 'Who am I?' he writes, &quot;In general, a body is any object that the eye and the touch can perceive. Obviously, when we talk about the human body this definition is insufficient, unless we are talking about a lifeless body.&quot; He goes on and I suddenly had a strong impression of the delineation between my body and my soul. I could not help but believe that a living body must have a soul, and that it is the soul that is most important regardless of what our secular world convinces us of. Other faiths would use a different term for soul.It's a slow read because speed reading it would completely miss the points made in such few words. One paragraph, one sentence, is sometimes enough to make one stop and review one's thoughts.This is not a large book but, for an absolutely amazing price of one or two meals (please forgive the assumptions), the spiritual rewards are great. Cardinal Carlo Maria Martini, a man who has certainly pondered humanity and life, brings to mind perspectives that we are often too busy or too blinded to consider.This is a book that should be on the same shelf with the Bible; a wonderful uplifting book for peaceful reading just before restful sleep or to invigorate for fullness of life."},{"Title":"On the Body: A Contemporary Theology of the Human Person (Crossroad Book)","review":"The body should be seen in perspective, not underestimated, not overestimated. We should seek to develop a healthy view of our body. Martini is sheer joy and sheer delight for me to read. For his sake I hope to learn Italian and read every word of his writings in his native tongue. I grew up as a Muslim with an inferior view of the body as the source of evil and most of it is termed in Islam as \\"\`awra\\" i.e. a cause of shame. We should never be ashamed of our bodies, and that is the true message of Christianity. The body is for the Lord and the Lord is for the body. God is not an enemy to our bodies but, if anything, he is FOR our bodies, taking our side.First the author discusses what it means to have a healthy body at all costs. We should not worship our bodies to the point of obsession, or this would be the \\"religion of the body\\". We have to be careful not to lose our soul for our body (p. 14). All around us we have shrines and sacred rituals intended for the recovery of health, beauty, strength, and youth. In our age, more than any other time ever before, we believe we have the means to be healthy all the time and we are not content for less. We have a made a god out of technology and have refused to accept limitations. In fact we treat technology as omnipotent. The doctor can't come up with the ideal cure and we get upset and rebellious. Illness becomes an accuser to us: What did I do wrong? Why did it have to happen to me? In sickness, are are brought to reflect more on ourselves, our bodiliness, the frailty of the human condition, of my being a creature, I question everything, that is. I would even wonder whether life is worth living as is when, after all, we eventually die. In essence, I simply ask: What is my body? Aha, I see, I am not my own master, not the master of my body or my destiny. I am not even the master of my end. This body has an end: the body is meant for the Lord. The Lord here should be the main goal of my life (1 Cor. 6: 13). Even Jesus experienced fear of death, and like Him we also should turn it all into prayer: My Father, if this is possible, let this cup pass from me; yet not what I want, but what you want\\" (Matt. 26: 39). We should be careful not to make an idol out of technology, because it is just a means, not an end. Martini announces that sickness for us should be a call for help, for love, and for meaning. Physical pain can become an opportunity for interaction instead of a loss of meaning, an opportunity for sharing instead of isolation, an opportunity for accepting our own differences and those of others (p. 24). Suffering can be an opportunity for us to experience conversion, to be more transformed like Jesus. But we still have to want that and seek meaning to our existence in the midst of sickness. Life is not a journey towards nothingness as Sartre claims, but a journey towards the Lord God Almighty who is coming to meet us. Do we pray because we are seeking results or because we enjoy conversing with God? When we are sick, we can choose to allow sickness to inspire us so that we suffer together with Jesus, in the awareness of completing what is lacking in Christ's affliction for the sake of his body, that is, the church\\" (Col. 1: 24).Just as the body of Jesus is a revelation of glory, the Invisible made visible, the narration of God among humankind, so our body, a totality comprised o flesh and spirit, is meant to be a mirror in which divine beauty is reflected (p. 39).The book is written with a high degree of precision, words are carefully chosen in a highly concise yet poetic manner. I would read paragraph over and over and feel I am getting something new and apply it to my own setting for the present moment. Each paragraph of his can be expanded into books and you would wish he would speak more but you just have to keep reading and that is Martini for you, a man of a golden heart and mouth. My prayer is to be able to read all his books, even those in Italian, and it is for his sake primarily that I am working on my learning of Italian so I can savor every word he says. He is definitely a high mentor of mine in all his teachings."},{"Title":"On the Body: A Contemporary Theology of the Human Person (Crossroad Book)","review":"My God bless Cardinal Martini - he passed away on Friday, August 31, 2012 at Aloisianum, a Jesuit institute in Gallarte, Varese province,Italy.

There are only 120 pages (actually the book starts at about page 10), and the print is quite large. Many people could finish it in a day. The topics covered include health of the body, sexuality, the sacraments, and the resurrection of the body.Martini keeps his comments necessarily short on each subject. Almost like it was a diary: he jotted down a few notes on a certain topic before he went to bed. \\"On the Body\\" is nice if you've read all of the Theology of the Body books and are looking for more; it isn't in-depth at all, but gives a fresh perspective.One note of caution to orthodox Catholics buying this book because it's by a cardinal: Martini is the darling of the liberal media and has put forth progressive proposals, so read this book with a skeptical eye. I couldn't find much in here that is unorthodox, but the book doesn't go into much detail, like I said."},{"Title":"Venetian houses and details,","review":"Author Samuel G. Weiner, Sr. (1896-1977) was a Shreveport architect known internationally for his work in the International style. The few buildings of his that are still standing are considered \\"priceless examples of modern-age architecture.\\" However, as a young architect, he was probably trained in classical, Beaux-Arts architecture. He definitely went to Venice, at least, to observe and sketch.\\"Venetian Houses and Details,\\" published when the author was 33, is a compilation of the author's skilled renderings of Venetian facades, courtyards, and decorative details, plus many photographs taken by his architect brother William of facades and architectural details such as windows, doors, and staircases. There are a few pen-and-ink elevations of architectural details. Buildings included are not only those found in urban Venice, but the surrounding countryside - both the country houses of the wealthy and working farm buildings. Sketches and photos are often identified by century or architectural style. The book has a foreword, but no text other than figure and photo captions; however, architectural histories of Venice are easy enough to find. Set designers and event planners looking for romantic inspiration should have a field day with this book."},{"Title":"Peliculas de Mi Vida, Las: Una Novela (Spanish Edition)","review":"Vengo leyendo a Fuguet desde la epoca en que escribia como Enrique Alekan, y aunque se podria decir que el autor a veces peca de autoreferente (si, Matias Vicuna tambien aparece aqui), en este libro se aprecia una forma de escribir y de estructurar la novela mucho mas depurada. El paralelo entre la sismografia y los &quot;terremotos personales&quot; de cada uno, la encontre excelente. Creo que es lo mejor que ha escrito, aunque con esto no quiero menos preciar sus otros libros: Tinta Roja y Mala Onda son relatos con merito propio.Desde mi punto de vista, creo que Fuguet logra lo que Matias Vicuna (de nuevo) describia despues de leer The Catcher in The Rye. Una identficacion tal con el personaje que a uno le gustaria sentarse a conversar con el, y saber que fue de su vida, que que paso despues del punto final...Lo recomiendo sobre todos a aquellos que han criticado a Fuguet por la crudeza de algunos relatos, y lo decadente de alguno de sus personajes.Excelente lectura."},{"Title":"Peliculas de Mi Vida, Las: Una Novela (Spanish Edition)","review":"This is another of Alberto Fuguet's intense and incisive works of fiction. He breaks with the myth of the \\"good Chilean exile\\" by having his protagonist closely relate to Pinochet supporters. His criticism is subtle and therefore more effective. His outsider's perspective on both Chile and the U.S. offers very unexpected insights on both countries and cultures.As much as I can rave about the book I must complain about what amounts to the worst edition I have ever seen coming from an American publishing house - and this is Harper Collins! I was exited about the Rayo concept - books written by Hispanic authors appearing both in English and Spanish versions. Naturally, I was looking forward to reading my first of these. However, the Spanish edition is so bad it has probably a typo per page. It is a shame that Rayo was unable to hire Spanish speaking editors of quality. As if they did not exist. Makes me wonder if Latino editors get the same income as their English language counterparts."},{"Title":"Peliculas de Mi Vida, Las: Una Novela (Spanish Edition)","review":"As well as being the first book I read by Fuguet, the back flap of the cover was the first reference to McOndo that I have ever heard. Judging by the brief definition of the genre, I was expecting a work that blatantly attacks Gabriel Garc&iacute;a Marquez, Alejo Carpentier, Isabel Allende and other writers of magic realism while celebrating McDonalds and Coca-Cola. After all, McOndo declares the death of magic realism in Latin America. What I found was a work that agrees wholeheartedly with the uniqueness of Latin American and Chilean culture but is speaking from a different generation.After guessing wrong at the tone of the book, I repeated the mistake after taking a look at the format. Flipping through the pages, the format looks like a list of movies that the protagonist has seen. I got excited thinking that maybe I would read an intellectual perspective on several classics. As it turns out, this is not the case at all. Rather, the narrator uses the films, many of them forgettable B flicks, to locate the times in his life where formative events occurred. The list has nothing to do with building a relationship with the reader and is completely introspective and therefore autobiographical. There are no obvious ovations made to the reader, the ending is neither epical nor moral.This is an exorbing portrait of a Chilean adult looking back at his life and past passions. I get the sense that many of the events described come straight from Fuguet's own experiences, but at this point I don't know enough about the author to be sure. In a way, it is not represenative of all or even most young Chileans. The narrator spends most of his childhood in California and holds a PhD in seismology. But it has a very subtle and captivating style that keeps the reader turning the pages and enjoying what she finds."},{"Title":"An indiscreet itinerary;: Or, How the unconventional traveler should see Holland, by one who was actually born there and whose name is Hendrik Willem van Loon","review":"Book arrived quickly, in slightly worse for wear condition than expected; could be postageGreat bookRecommended to anyone interested in Holland and any Bill Bryson fans"},{"Title":"Habits of the Heart: Individualism and Commitment in American Life","review":"This book is an interesting read but is so sloppy in its scientific approach that it makes the serious student of social science want to cry.

It is true that we are social animals and that recently people have grown cold to each other...but the solution is not to enslave people with some &quot;inherent responsibility&quot; to others.

As compared to Rohaytn, who endorses a \\"partnership\\" of elites who work to adjust and balance the multiplicitous machine of political, economic and social interests, Harrington would spread out the decision making to at least nominally include the people.

The authors' direct opinions are circumscribed to the few pages of the Conclusion and the Appendix.

This situation? \\"Individualism\\" has now degraded into narcissism with the real threat of this causing the collapse of our country if not our planet (i.e. the constant reassurance from government agencies that we will not have to make \\"sacrifices\\" for climate change which is basically planetary death; in this case, offending the individual supplants possible planetary death taking the obsession not to offend the \\"individual\\" to nearly psychopathic levels).A few weeks ago I mentioned to some co-workers that I believe we should be motivated by the idea of the common good and they looked like me like I was crazy. They had no idea what I was referring to. They are also young people. 'Raising up\\" young people who have no concept of the public good quite frankly should terrify us all.Anyway, the friend I was talking to pulled Habits of the Heart off her crammed bookshelf and handed it to me. \\"I don't think you are the first one to make note of this.

Those who take the time and make the effort to read it carefully will learn a lot not only about American history and society, but also about their own private thoughts and fantasies and the background assumptions of their everyday lives. The dismal state of American education is the main thing you can learn about in most of these reviews. This book has limitations. The most obvious: it's about white/Anglo middleclass Americans. But the only sensible response to the book is still gratitude. If you haven't read it, read it."},{"Title":"Habits of the Heart: Individualism and Commitment in American Life","review":"This book may not be very rigorous as a piece of social science--other Amazon reviewers have complained about this lack--but the material, interviews with Americans in different groups provides much insight into what Americans think about and how their lives are intertwined with institutions of politics, education, religion, and community. As such the book is highly readable and accessible to the average, college-educated reader and thought provoking as well."},{"Title":"Habits of the Heart: Individualism and Commitment in American Life","review":"\\"Habits of the Heart\\" is the authors' attempt to conduct a sociological study of \\"middle-class\\" American ideals and values. The book was somewhat revolutionary when first published (the early 1980s), primarily for exposing the pervasive individualism (and resulting alienation and isolation) in modern American life. The authors show how the classic myth of the rugged American individualist has been compounded by the modern pscyhotherapeutic culture, and simultaneously stripped of the more communitarian aspects of civic republicanism and biblical religion that provided an historical counter-balance. The result is the now-common (but poorly understood) view that one is totally autonomous, entering and conducting all social relations on the basis of pure self-interest - a view that is doing a great deal of damage to families and to the American social fabric as a whole.The book, however, has a number of flaws. For a study based upon interviews with hundreds of individuals, the authors fail to support their assertions with either statistical data or detailed case studies (except for the first chapter, which is the most interesting part of the book). Instead, the text is a steady stream of broad generalizations, occasionally sprinkled with carefully-selected examples, and the authors' historical analysis. And, unfortunately, their analysis clearly reflects their positions in establishment-liberal academia. They reject (especially in the new Introduction) the logical suggestion that the rejection of traditional religion and morality is largely to blame for rampant individualism and social break-down. Instead, embracing an economic determinism worthy of Marx himself, they suggest that free-market capitalism and the decline of labor unions are to blame. Similarly, they call for greater communitarianism, and note that modern \\"therapeutic\\" worldviews provide no sound basis for such communitarianism. However, the authors are unwilling to embrace a sound basis for it, either, repeatedly pointing to the civic-minded and caring values of \\"biblical religion\\" (a.k.a. Christianity), but then declaring that a return to traditional religion is no longer a viable option. In short, the authors of this important work betray the same relativism and postmodernism that is behind the very individualism they decry."},{"Title":"Habits of the Heart: Individualism and Commitment in American Life","review":"I think Steve Seim's review is excellent. The book is a famous statement of an editorial point of view, namely the communitarian claim that individualism has led to the incoherence of Americans' religious and moral claims. But like so many books, the authors dissemble to pretend they're scientifically reporting objective news rather than a kind of editorial. In this sense, the book is not substantially different from the kind of pseudo-science we've come to expect from sociologists, who, after conducting some interviews and handing out some loaded surveys, tell us \\"what's really going on\\" with the \\"modern American woman\\" or \\"Generation X\\" or, in this case, the \\"modern [misguided] liberal American.\\" I, for one, view such work as social criticism vital to our society, and it makes thoughtful reading, but it is not scientific, and I wish we could get beyond this need to justify such claims with \\"scientific\\" surveys.Considering this book represents more a kind of punditry than research, despite its claims, please consider reading the most famous response to the book, the chapters from Jeffrey Stout's \\"Ethics After Babel\\" devoted to the book. Stout, in one instance, close-reads one of the interviews, in which a guy is asked what's important to him, and whenever he talks about \\"being good\\" and \\"being honest,\\" the interviewers grill him \\"but why? but why?\\" until after many replies relating to maturing and learning from his experience, he finally says something like \\"it benefits me to live a life of honesty\\" so the authors end the interview and conclude he's a rabid individualist whose only basis for his ethics is egocentric utilitarianism. They did not, for example, explore whether he has a rather rich concept of personal honor, or even a sense of Stoic maturity, either of which seems a more accurate way of describing his answers up to the point they choose to end on. Either alternative reflects a vocabulary of long standing moral traditions, which would contradict the authors' claims - ala Alisdair MacIntyre-- that modern liberal Americans have no such vocabulary. In fact, I find it rather hilarious that they use this subject as the quintessential amoral individualist, since communitarian founding father Aristotle says repeatedly throughout the Ethics that living a life of virtue must benefit the individual, for to say the opposite would be akin to saying that giving a plant sunshine doesn't benefit the plant. Of course this connection of virtue and human benefit is problematized in other ethical systems, but, still, it's funny to me that Arisotle could be characterized as lacking a moral framework because he connects living virtuously with personal benefit.In any case, reading both this book and Stout, you're in a good position to come to your own conclusions."},{"Title":"Habits of the Heart: Individualism and Commitment in American Life","review":"It is not easy, nor obvious, to understand what makes &quot;the American mind&quot; tick!

Though it certainly addresses itself to the French-American artist Louise Bourgeois's mysterious and beautiful &quot;Spider&quot; series of sculptures, it is just as much about the &quot;experiencing&quot; of artworks in real space and time. But Mieke Bal goes beyond the phenomenological and explores the way in which viewers bring their own sense of history, memory and culture to bear upon the object being viewed/experienced. For Bal, in this particular instance, it is Bernini that haunts the sculptures under scrutiny. And her case in convincing. The book is short, and exquisitely produced in full color."},{"Title":"Louise Bourgeois' Spider : The Architecture of Art-Writing","review":"This review by Wayne Andersen was published in Common Knowledge.Louise Bourgeois's monumental sculpture, Spider, currently installed in London's Tate Modern, stands so far outside the standard notion of sculpture that to call it sculpture is to say there's no such thing as sculpture. Mieke Bal translates Spider into a theoretical object, coalescing, in an expostulating narrative, theoretical thought with visual articulation of that thought in the various materials and objects that structure and consist of Spider-its mixed media egg case between huge bronze legs: a femme-maison, or Frauenzimmer, the spider is female of course, her egg case a house, a woman-house.In Bal's terms, this theoretical object deploys its visual status to articulate thought about art as internal to the work of art, like within a womb, house, or dream, the spider's egg case's shell a chain-link fence, within it a mother's lap in the form of a chair, perfume bottles hanging on a chain, segments of marrow bone wired to the fence, brooches and medals, a grandfather's watch, a tiny locket, eggs in a wire basket, other stuff-all there to puzzle over, the chair not to be sat in, dangling objects not to be touched, only approached as behind one's eyes or within the spaces of one's mind. \\"Come into my parlor,\\" the spider says through an open door one dare's not enter.Bal admits that her construal of Spider as theoretical object is as much about her approach to the work as about the work itself-how to see it, to write about it-which might prompt one to question whether her essay competes with the object as if to erase it. If, on behalf of the object, an explanation of it does supplant it, thus becoming it, one confronts a tautology, such as Paul Gauguin's saying, \\"An explanation of the man is the work of the man,\\" interpolated in Bal's case as, \\"an explanation of the work of art is the work of art,\\" a double bind familiar to critics when passing from material description to an interpretive phase, aware that what can be described is the property of the work under scrutiny while interpretation resides solely within the observer (as in saying, I came, I saw, I conquered, the enemy erased, the victor left to mourn the loss). So, after reading Bal's essay one might find her interpretation having foreclosed on Spider, leaving it bereft of its theoretical objecthood. In spite of that possibility befalling a seduced reader, Bal's narrative, which is neither historical nor biographical but omnipresent and transcendental, is itself a theoretical object that holds to itself so tightly as to be independent of the work-a covering narrative that can be pulled off the work, leaving its irreducible mystery intact and open for anyone capable of plumbing its depth. In short, Bourgeois' Spider is approachable but not to be subjugated, and unlike its referent, too big to be squashed.Bal is exceptionally skilled at close reading, and the subjects she chooses to take on are commensurate in complexity to that skill. Louise Bourgeois, now in her nineties, came through French Surrealism of the 1930s into New York art of the 1940s and 50s. To say the least about her, she is ineffable; to say the least about her work, it is beyond comprehension by any mode of art-writing that quails within boundaries, like fenced-in theories unwilling to bleed. To relieve the pressure of Bal's text, as relentlessly demanding as it is generous, the distressed reader might fall into giddiness and recall a clip from a Marx Brothers film with Groucho waist-hugging a woman twice his corporeality who says, \\"Oh! Hold me closer,\\" to which Groucho responds, \\"If I held you any closer, I'd be behind you.\\" No critic that I've read (Rosalind Krauss notwithstanding) has embraced Bourgeois' Spider closer than Bal, who gets behind the work, all around it, and through it, exhausting all permutations. Her essay is intellectual adventuring into a dense thicket of what's possible when knowable unknowns are forced into being known and secrets induced to tattle on themselves. Tag along with her, try to keep up, forewarned that from where she is headed there may be no way back."},{"Title":"Louise Bourgeois' Spider : The Architecture of Art-Writing","review":"The author of this &quot;essay&quot;--her word--on Louise Bourgeois' &quot;Spider&quot; admits to suffering from a &quot;major dissatisfaction with much...art-writing,&quot; and proposes, from her special vantage &quot;as a literary specialist trained in close reading&quot; to offer something more &quot;exciting&quot; for the reader's consideration.

With the coming of agriculture, however, the forests became the adversary: Quid est agricola, silvae adversarius. Agriculture required clearing the forests for fields. As population increased, villages were built using wood. From these grew towns and then cities. And as these grew the forest was cut for fields, for timber and for firewood. Civilization and deforestation grew together.Thirgood shows how civilization and deforestation were symbiotically linked. The forests supplied wood for cooking, for heat and for building. Wood became the prime strategic resource for the cities and kingdoms that grew from them. Timber was necessary for the building of ships, which made possible long-distance trade. But wood was also the prime fuel, necessary for the making of pottery and metalsmithing. Thus the forests provided not only the vehicles to carry the trade, but the trade goods themselves.

But he shows that kings and governors recognized early on that such a strategic resource should be protected. Thus reforestation, as well as deforestation,occurred in the ancient world. Trees were cut, but under powerful rulers, the forests were not despoiled.Thirgood believes that three factors combined to destroy the Mediterranean forests: 1) War ( in which trees were cut for strategic purposes, but in which forests also were burned to deprive enemies of those very resources); 2) Weak governments ( who were unable to keep wholesale clearing or excessive exploitation from occuring); and 3) The triumph of pastoralization over agriculture ( which he dates from the conquest of the area by Islam [632-732AD]).Of the three key factors of deforestation, the most damaging has been pastoralization, particularly the herding of goats.

He assured me that all of the ragas composed by traditional Indian musicians were designed to enhance or induce spiritual states. Thus, for the Hindu musical tradition of the ragas, the concept that instrumental music affects the human mind and spirit is a basic presupposition. Indeed, the primary purpose of the music is not entertainment but Hindu spiritual development.Nevertheless, it seems that in the modern West, most Christians and secularists alike reject with asperity this elementary insight that the most influential message of music is found in its rhythm, melody and harmony rather than in its lyrics. Therefore, we owe a debt of gratitude to Carson Holloway for this groundbreaking recovery of the role of music in the moral education of human beings. He contrasts the deep concern with music as a moral force of the ancients represented by Plato and Aristotle and of certain moderns such as Rousseau and Nietzsche with the lack of such interest of other moderns such as Hobbes and Locke.Holloway acknowledges Allan Bloom's recognition of the anti-philosohical influence of rock music but finds Bloom's analysis wanting. I think that Holloway succeeds in advancing a rational understanding of the subject. Unfortunately, an objective appraisal of his work is difficult for many because music lies on the fault line of the culture war between those who see the Judeo-Christian ethic as corresponding to the natural order of creation and those whose ethic denies the existence of such an order in favor of human autonomy.Defenders of the Judeo-Christian ethic are typically disarmed on the musical front by their failure to understand what any random student of Ravi Shankar knows: Music directly affects the soul without regard for the rational content of lyrics, which are quite optional. Thus, the sounds of the music, i.e., its musical form, may enhance or detract from any lyrics. Indeed, the form of the music may well be more powerful than the words and overwhelm their message.Holloway makes a useful contribution to our understanding of how music affects us beginning with this recognition that music does affect our souls in powerful ways that matter in both ethics and politics."},{"Title":"All Shook Up: Music, Passion, & Politics Library Edition","review":"\\"All Shook Up\\" is an excellent introduction to the important roll music plays in forming societies. The author carefully progresses from Socrates to Nietzsche to show the significance of both the differences and similarities in their philosophies on music. He makes a strong case that the effects of music on society are more significant than even the \\"conservative moralizers\\" imagine."},{"Title":"All Shook Up: Music, Passion, & Politics Library Edition","review":"Holloway effectively illustrates the assertions of notable philosphers concerning the importance of music in society, with particular reference to the rhythm and tone of the music. Philosophers ranging Aristotle to Rousseau understood the importance of music in arousing or pacifying emotions. Holloway offers a very convincing illustration of the effects of music upon the characters of individuals. Music is filled with explicit language, verbal images of gratuituous sexual conduct, and the pleasurable experiences of narcotic abuses. In being over-exposed to this kind of music, the current generation has become accustomed to expecting extreme methods of gratifying oneself. This over-gratification has lead to an experimentation with new methods of gratification, more extreme and effective than the preceding methods. Holloway doesn't really discuss what should be done to remedy this trend nor does he suggest censorship. Also, the book was lacking a global philosophical approach as asian philosophical teachings concerning music were omitted from the book."},{"Title":"All Shook Up: Music, Passion, & Politics Library Edition","review":"Holloway's book is a wonderful introduction to what the history of western political philosophy says about the role of music in shaping people's character. The belief that music has a role in forming the character has always been a controversal stance, starting with Plato, and remains one still today. One only has to be reminded of Allan Bloom's chapter on Rock music and the reaction that section provoked shows how powerful this theme remains today. Liberals (ancient and modern, capitalist or not) don't like the idea that music plays a role in character formation.. and what Holloway's book does shows the reader what the big stars of western philosophy has to say on this subject. Holloways argues by ignoring the power of music in the formation of character of the young especially, contemporary society and the music it has bread.. has lead to extremes both in music and people's character.. and both for the worse."},{"Title":"All Shook Up: Music, Passion, & Politics Library Edition","review":"This book does a decent job at describing the theories of music and its effect on character in Plato, Aristotle, Rousseau and Nietzsche. But it does so in a rather long-winded way. I found myself constantly saying 'ok, I get it!' as the author repeated themselves and spelled out their point yet again. I also found the author's habit of referring to Plato and Aristotle as 'the ancients' rather annoying. He repeats 'the ancients' so many times, he ends up sounding like a toothless old nun endlessly repeating the Ave Maria. I love Plato and Aristotle as much as the next man (probably more), but just repeating their name like a mantra is not a substitute for rational argument.I was hoping the author would speak more about modern music, pop and rock and roll, and its place in modern politics - after all, the book is called 'All Shook Up'. This only comes right at the end of the book, and it's clear the author has no familiarity at all with pop music. He never analyses a particular song or a particular artist, while he's happy to make sweeping comments about the music's crassness and barbarism, based on articles he has read in the news. That is ignorance masquerading as informed contempt.The author is right that modern political theory foolishly ignores the impact of music on our souls. But piously intoning 'the ancients' while showing an ignorance of the popular music you're criticising just makes you sound like a fuddy-duddy and is unlikely to win you many readers (least of all many young readers).And his solutions to the 'virus' of pop music are non-existent. Or rather, he says, the solution is to 'turn to the ancients'. What do you mean? Put Socrates to music? Finally, he ends the book with the worst sentence ever: 'Whether we follow the ancients' advice, or even try, remains to be seen'. In journalism if you end an article with 'remains to be seen' it's a sign of laziness, never mind ending a whole book that way.I think my main point is, if you're going to tell other people what the good life is, what the best and noblest culture is, I need to be persuaded that you yourself are a cultured, wise and mature person. But the impression I get from this book is of a rather cramped, narrow and unimaginative soul, complacent in their own moral advancement because they have read 'the ancients'."},{"Title":"All Shook Up: Music, Passion, & Politics Library Edition","review":"As a former classical music critic writer for The Washington Post, I feel that that poorly paid gig should at least give me some cred, as they say, or used to say in the pop music world, when talking about the world of music. Speaking of cred, one of the greatest seekers of it, as I am sure most people will recall from high school, is the nerdy guy who wants to be cool in some way. So he hatches a secret plan to use his smarts to get in good in the field of the cool types, like the ones who listen, and presumably hump, to the hottest music. Maybe the author here Carson Holloway, was a cool jock in high school, or one of the few nerds to befriend the QB and his buds. But I bet not. So I am betting that this book is a sort of remembrance of things past, or past traumas, namely in the world of hazy high school memories. For that is about the only explanation I can come up with for the thing. How else would you explain someone who seriously is discussing Eminen and Kanye West with Plato and Aristotle? I know he gives an uber-nerd rationale for the thing, but at some point one just wants to laugh. What's next, Britney Spears and Hans Vaihinger?? The whole premise of the thing is delusional and forced. The phenomenon of music for the ancients, which is definitely a very fascinating topic in itself, bears almost no real resemblance to what music is today. One doesn't need disquisition on plectra compared to electric guitars to see this. Only the vast qualities of mass consumer culture and instant communication in society are needed to assess it. And if one is not satisfied with that, then think alone of the Volume! (It now goes to \\"eleven\\" as they said in the genius movie Spinal Tap) Frankly, it is so different that one would more rationally and profitably compare ancient philosophy's view on war and aggression to modern music than to the very rarified matter of what they meant by music at that time.Further, Holloway's tendency to give an simple textbook analysis of the matter is particularly troubling because he has chosen such a broad bailiwick. He bears down on the famous notion of Plato's that music is a form of mimesis, or as he says, is \\"imitative\\". But then, even though he is citing the Republic, he forgets to historically contextualize this in terms of Plato's exact metaphysical implications. Since for Plato any notion of mimesis generally is linked with his metaphysical conception, which was later in the medieval era to be called a Realist perspective, \\"imitation\\" in fact has some unavoidably negative implications seen in the Ancient context. It is the tendency to give a Polyanna-ish reading of ancient \\"idealism\\" that allows such analyzes as Holloway's to be both technically correct, in a high school culture course sort of way, and ultimately silly in an serious conceptual sense. Plato's view of the Republic was, as many serious scholars on the right and the left have argued, not a perfect society per se, (perhaps fantasized by conservatives today for their special communities in Florida, with names like Trinity). No Plato's notion was, if brilliant, also grim and, by our standards, decidedly non-funtastic. But one shouldn't need such close criticisms to critique this book. Just the idea of Eminem and Plato in the same sentence should do for any reasonable real music lover. As someone who was proudly non-cool in high school because I loved Mozart above all others, I think Mr. Holloway, just is hopelessly trying to avoid being thrown against the lockers.A more reasonable and informed view of music in our time could developed on the idea of reviving quality per se. This is an involved topic. So involved that I won't go into here. But at the very least it involves accepting the idea that most ages do NOT produce anything of interest when it comes to arts generally, and music in particular. This is what unjaundiced arts history teaches. So we are definitely not dealing with important expressions of anything whatsoever, negatively or positively. Pop music is about as important an expression of anything as a McD's Quarter Pounder is of food aesthetics. To analyze it absurd. To palliate it rationally is, perhaps, reasonable. But the nerdy desire to analyze it , on mammoth display in Holloway's book, and to use a love-hate critique of pop music and popularity generally to smuggle in his right-wing views about culture generally is just pointless. And fie on people like this for being so pointless. Case closed."},{"Title":"All Shook Up: Music, Passion, & Politics Library Edition","review":"Despite the many references to more prestigous thinkers such as Plato, Aristotle, etc., Halloway's assertions concerning popular music are shockingly simplistic. Though he clearly approaches his subject from a political and cultural standpoint, the uneasy connection he attempts to forge between the physics of music and human response, and the resultant cultural fallout, demands a more rigorous grounding in physics, psychology, biology, and/or math for his argument to even begin to seem plausible. Once Halloway's focus moved beyond lyrics to actual harmonic structures, establishing a causal connection between music (even the sort he laughably terms \\"pornographic pop\\") and \\"destructive behavior\\" required more than simply paraphrasing Plato, or quoting some Nietzsche to succeed. Not only does he avoid a comparative analysis between disciplines, but Halloway limits his studies to the classics of western civilization. There is an entire world of music out there, each unique form entwined with an equally unique culture. Certainly there must be some insight to be gleaned from it somewhere. Perhaps he did, in fact, research other discplines, and/or other genres of music, but found them inconvenient to his arguments. Indeed, in some of his more athletic leaps of reasoning, Halloway's conservative slip begins to show. Frankly, this book proved to be the sort of conservative pseudo-intellectualism I'd expect from the likes of Rush Limbaugh, but with a better bibliography. In the book's favor, I can say that it is quite readable, with a clear, if somewhat plain narrative voice. If only the logic employed were equally as clear."},{"Title":"All Shook Up: Music, Passion, & Politics Library Edition","review":"Holloway's academic scholarship serves as the thinest possible veil for an unmistakable and troubling piece of conservative moralizing. Marshalling the evidence of Plato, Aristotle, and a curious admixture of modern social science research, Holloway argues that the influence of contemporary popular music (or as he rather tellingly refers to it in several place, \\"pornographic pop\\") on the character of young listeners has dangerous political implications. His insistence that it is not just lyrics but, as Plato and Aristotle acknowledge, the very rhythms, meters, and harmonic structures of music that can lay hold of and inflame youthful passions leaves him with no alternative but to condemn pop music in its totality. Indeed, one gets the impression that the only thing preventing Holloway from supporting outright consorship of pop music is his grudging acknowledgment that the First Amendment would likely render any such attempt unconstitutional. Of course, Holloway nowhere explains what it is about the rhythms and harmonic structures of pop music that make them puerile and vulgar, and the fact that he also neglects to explain precisely what he means by \\"pop music\\" serves to extend the potential range of vilified music to a rather disturbing degree. In addition to his questionable conclusions, Holloway bases his argument on frequently one-dimensional interpretations of Plato, Aristotle, Rousseau, and Nietzsche (his interpretation of Plato, for example, is based almost exclusively on Books 3, 4, and 9 of the Republic and a brief passage from the Laws), and it often seems as if he has allowed his ideological commitments to determine the direction and findings of his research. Readers looking for yet another neo-Struassian volley in America's culture wars might want to pick this volume up. However, those readers interested in work that seriously engages the complexities, problems, and promises of the relationship between music and politics might wish to look elsewhere."},{"Title":"A+ Exam Cram 2 Lab Manual","review":"1.

Moore needs to look up the definition of conspiracy: an agreement among two or more to commit a crime or acheive a lawful end by unlawful means. His problems, however, go deeper than simple ignorance. For example, he wrote, \\"I can say without reservation that I've spent more time in Dealey Plaza, the site of the assassination, than any other critic or researcher who has ever written about this case.\\" How can he say this? I can see two ways. One, he has camped out in Dealey Plaza ever since the assassination. This clearly isn't true: Moore was four years old and living in Arkansas when the assassination happened and was living in Waco when he wrote the book. Second, he carefully tallied the time he spent in Dealey Plaza and has had others keep watch on the other critics or researchers and count how much time they have spent there. This is just as unlikely. Moore's concept of facts leaves much to be desired.An earlier reviewer challenged Moore's claim that the M-C rifle is more powerful than any carbine the Army ever used. Even if this were true, it wouldn't mean much, because a carbine is a short-barreled rifle and has less power than a rifle with a long barrel. The M-C is a good deal less powerful than an M-14."},{"Title":"Conspiracy Of One The Definitive Book On The Kennedy Assassination","review":"Compared to lone-assassin books by former Commission staffers David Belin and Gerald Ford, this book is a delight to read. Jim Moore entered the case as a young conspiracy believer himself, and now alerts others to the fact that the conspiracy community has done much to deny the American public evidence of Oswald's sole guilt. Where Moore falters is in his shooting scenario; his &quot;Final Solution&quot; doesn't work as well as that in Case Closed, which utilizes some analysis made known after Moore's book appeared. I like Conspiracy of One because it's an enjoyable read that doesn't resort to sensationalism, innuendo and conspiracy hysteria to recollect the tragedy of JFK's death."},{"Title":"Conspiracy Of One The Definitive Book On The Kennedy Assassination","review":"We've heard all the weird, wacky \\"researchers\\" out there, and their \\"books\\" made mainly for the almighty $, and to lasso millions of gullible, ignorant US citizen/ comsumers.

You would think that this fact alone would spark independent thinkers to at least take a more serious interest in not only Jim Moore's book, but also Gerald Posner's Case Closed and most recently Vincent Bugliosi's Reclaiming History - three books that stand alone against a phalanx of conspiracy exotica.I find it interesting that the same people who would demand the most rigorous evidence to convict someone in a court of law will believe the most far-fetched fantasies and coincidences to essentially convict our own government of the crime of the century. This splatter-the-issue-with-any-random-thought-and-see-what-sticks approach is not only faddish but non-rational - needless to say, irresponsible. And it's reached the point where to say you believe Oswald did it, you are inviting the most vigorous and in some cases hysterical denunciation. Part of the reason is that the \\"government did it\\" theory has sadly become mainstream, [ie] more people believe this than the Warren Report - and it's metastasized into a dogma of almost religious proportions.Consider the rigid, stalwart smugness many have to even considering that Oswald was the lone assassin. These conspiracy theorists don't believe it is even plausible let alone possible! This is a tip off to a true believer's irrationality. A clear thinker has to at least admit to this plausibility - as well as the plausibility of the premise that a government could kill it's own president. If we come to this understanding then what we are left with is the boring, unsexy, clinical evidence. But the problem is not that we don't have evidence, the problem to finally coming to terms with this very emotional issue is much bigger - a wholesale national abandonment of logical thinking. According to Steven Hawking there might not be a unified theory of the universe, but in my opinion the conspiracy folk don't seem to see that a unified theory of the JFK assassination is necessary to have a modicum of credibility. In short, with their shotgun approach they create more inconsistency and contradiction than they solve. Maybe that's the point. There certainly seems to be money to be made in penning yet another lurid account that mines the overactive imagination.I think though that Jim Moore in his postscript says something that needs to be said, in that many critics of the official assassination story generally detest this country and want to believe the worst. And you must agree that the communist movement and it's fellow travelers had an important motivation to try to spin the blame away from a pro-Soviet nut. This might explain the plethora of propaganda, but why do people buy it? Have we become so influenced by Oliver Stone's Hollywood that we think the real world operates this way? I think Vincent Bugliosi's explanation comes close to the truth when he says that people cannot wrap their heads around the fact that an insignificant, weasel with a mail order rifle could slay the most powerful man on earth. He says people want to believe someone as potent and larger than life as a young energetic American president representing an up-and-coming generation can only be vanquished by an equally powerful force.Someone needs to do an in depth study of the psychology of the \\"conspiracy theorist\\". That and teach our kids that critical thinking, logic and rational thought are not just canons of the western intellectual tradition, but grounding for our sanity."},{"Title":"Conspiracy Of One The Definitive Book On The Kennedy Assassination","review":"Jim Moore is perhaps alone in his view - not that JFK and Connally were indeed hit by the same bullet, but that they were hit at a later point in the famous Zapruder film than is commonly accepted. In fact Moore claims that JFK was hit first in the back at Z236 AFTER his arms and hands move up to his neck, but he believes that the bullet went onto strike Connally, Oswald already having fired an earlier shot at Z186.The very large problem with this scenario is that it is extremely difficult to see how a bullet could exit JFK's neck at that point and go onto strike Connally as Kennedy's hands - both hands and wrists are clearly in front of his adams apple. And as there were no wounds to the Presidents hands and wrists it seems almost impossible for the bullet to go on and strike Connally at such a moment. The SBT stands, but that bullet struck JFK at an earlier point than Z236 - more likely around Z224.This rather odd theory aside, I rather like this book for its clear concise presentation of evidence. There is some conjecture, but it is one of the better No Conspiracy books on the subject. Having just re read the book after perhaps ten years, I'd have to say its not the best by a long shot (forgive the pun) and its not as detailed as Bugliosi, but if you want a relatively short read form the Lone Nutter perspective, this would be a good start."},{"Title":"Conspiracy Of One The Definitive Book On The Kennedy Assassination","review":"I found the book full of facts rather than this conspiracy rubbish Americans seem to thrive on.I got a little sick of the constant slagging off of other so called writers who to me were not even worth a mention.

I was surprised, as Mr Moore states, just how easy the shot was from the sixth floor. Im sure if you read this book then go and visit Dallas you will leave thinking 'what conspiracy'?

Moore skips all of Oswald's childhood and activities prior to the assassination. He constantly bashes the critics, to a point where enough is enough. His act is tiring.

Moore writes with much- deserved self acclaim, but who can blame him? He has researched the Kennedy assassination and avoided the lures and trappings of the conspiracy press. He addresses concrete issues like shot timing, assassin placement, and alibis. Granted, his conclusions about the Zapruder film are probably not accepted by serious historical scholars, and his claims of locating the exact placement on book boxes in the sixth floor window of the TSBD are a bit far fetched. But all-in- all he does an above-average job of presenting a serious argument for the lone-assassin conclusion.

I have read many books on the subject since the mid-1980s, and would not consider any one book &quot;the definitive book&quot; on the subject (by the way, the assassination should be properly referred to as &quot;the JFK Assassination&quot; to distinguish it from the assassination of his brother, RFK, which is also a subject of much). controversy). Whoever would agree to the use of the word &quot;definitive&quot; as part of the title has a very high opinion of himself.

Footnotes are sparse; lacking in detail, and there is no attempt to cite source material.

Jim Moore has turned in a solid piece of work that patiently, rationally explains his stance on the events that took place in Dallas on that November day in 1963 and beyond. Moore has the advantage of having been a pro-conspiracy theorist at one time, so he is very familiar with the conspiracy theories (as well as the lack of evidence behind many of them) and has had firsthand encounters with the key proponents of the pro-conspiracy cottage industries (Groden, Lifton, etc.).

Moore's book helped deliver me from the semi-quandry of lies, half-truths and lunatic ravings that comprise most conspiracy books. In fact, I too, traveled to Dallas for the first assasination convention -- mainly to hear Moore defend his book. He did quite well, considering that he was treated with a rather large dose of disrespect and ridicule by the researchers there. (A bigger collection of kooks, the mentally ill, and paranoids you'll NEVER find ... I highly recommend checking out any JFK assasination gathering just for a laugh.) But back to the book ... hoot at it if you will, but it is one of the most rational, well-reasoned accounts on the murder that you'll find. No one with a reasonable view of the world can read it and blindly defend Oswald as a patsy. The facts are just too strong against him, as Moore points out ... also, the preservation of any conspiracy would have involved half of Dallas, probably even including my aunt and uncle who were working in Big D that day. And I have no reason to believe they were anywhere near the grassy knoll."},{"Title":"Conspiracy Of One The Definitive Book On The Kennedy Assassination","review":"I really hate to bash a Lone-Assassin believer, but sometimes it becomes necessary, IMO. And in the case of LNer Jim Moore (who wrote this 217-page book on the JFK assassination, \\"Conspiracy Of One\\", published in 1990), unfortunately I feel the need to do so.Mr. Moore, to his definite credit, has the bottom-line conclusion correct when he claims that Lee Harvey Oswald (alone) shot and killed President John F. Kennedy and Dallas policeman J.D. Tippit on November 22, 1963. But there are two points, in particular, in his book that I simply cannot reconcile in my own \\"LN\\" mind whatsoever.One of these points is Moore's belief that the \\"Single-Bullet Theory\\" gunshot from Oswald's Mannlicher-Carcano rifle occurred at about frame number 235 of the famous Zapruder Film of the assassination.Mr. Moore claims that President Kennedy was reacting to being lightly struck in the face by fragments of metal or concrete after Oswald's first shot missed the limousine and hit the pavement to the rear of the car. Moore's theory is exactly the same as another author (Jim Bishop; in \\"The Day Kennedy Was Shot\\"), who also postulated that Kennedy was reacting to being sprayed by flying concrete when we see JFK raising his arms in obvious distress just after frame 225 of the Z-Film. Moore believes that the bullet which pierced JFK's back and throat was actually fired by Oswald approximately ten Z-Film frames later.That theory re. the SBT timeline is one that I just cannot believe at all, even if I were being forced at knifepoint to accept it. In order to believe Mr. Moore's odd SBT timeline as fact, we would have to believe that President Kennedy just happened (coincidentally) to place his hands near the exact same location on his body (his neck/throat) where a bullet would be making its exit less than one second later.Which brings up a second problem with Moore's hypothesis -- HOW did that bullet get past JFK's hands if they were directly in front of the place where the missile would be exiting at Z235? Via the Z-Film, Kennedy's hands certainly appear to be IN THE WAY of any bullet that would be exiting his throat at Z235. And yet JFK's hands were obviously not struck by the passing bullet. Mr. Moore, on page 160, attempts to reconcile this problem with this passage:\\"It's important to remember that at no time in frames 235 to 238 do either of Kennedy's hands cover his neck or throat.\\"I disagree. In Z235-Z238, it sure looks to me like John Kennedy's hands are most certainly covering the exact area of his throat where a bullet exited.** = Which, of course, makes perfect sense too (via a Z224 SBT bullet strike, which I believe is the correct Z-Film time-stamping of the event), since Kennedy would naturally be moving his hands toward the \\"pain point\\" on his neck where a bullet has just ripped through his windpipe. But, for some reason, Mr. Moore thinks the President's hands are completely clear of the bullet-exiting throat area.To be completely fair to Jim Moore, it is somewhat difficult to tell on the Z-Film exactly where JFK's hands are located in relation to the neck wound during this time in question, so Mr. Moore could possibly be correct when he says Kennedy's hands aren't in direct line with the bullet's flight path. But it looks to me like JFK's left hand is dangling right where the bullet exited.Moore's \\"Z235\\" SBT theory has a bunch of other problems too, with respect to the second wounded victim who was riding in the Presidential limousine on 11/22/63, Texas Governor John B. Connally.Governor Connally, in my opinion, is positively reacting (involuntarily) to a bullet striking him during the Zapruder frames prior to when Mr. Moore claims he has been hit. And I've never understood WHY so many researchers fail to see and properly assess the obvious \\"Connally reactions\\" that can be viewed with ease on decent-quality copies of the Zapruder movie.The Zapruder Film is telling us that Connally is being hit by gunfire at precisely frame #224. The Governor's right shoulder drops and moves forward noticeably at exactly Z224....the right side of Connally's suit jacket very clearly \\"bulges\\" outward (toward the center of his chest) at precisely Z224....JBC's mouth suddenly opens at Z225 and a startled/pained/distressed look comes across his face....both of his shoulders then rise and fall quickly (as if he's \\"flinching\\") starting at Z226....and a huge sign of a \\"hit\\" is the extremely-rapid \\"up then down\\" movement of Connally's right arm, which also begins at Z226, just two frames after the initial \\"moment of impact\\" frame at Z224.Jim Moore thinks that all of these things going on with Connally (except the movement of JBC's jacket, which is ignored altogether by the book's author) were merely due to the Governor reacting to the SOUND of a shot that missed the whole car! (See Page 119 of \\"Conspiracy Of One\\".)This is an astoundingly-inaccurate evaluation by Mr. Moore of the pre-Z235 JBC reactions, IMO. And it's particularly silly when additional attention is focused on that strange \\"arm raising\\" that Connally engaged in, starting at Z226 (the very same arm, by the way, which was attached to JBC's fractured wrist). The \\"rising arm\\" is a very odd \\"unexplainable\\" if the Governor was NOT reacting to a bullet having just hit that very same arm (wrist).Plus, author Moore also has the exact same \\"delayed reaction\\" type of problem via his \\"Z235\\" SBT timeline that he evidently thinks only exists via the Warren Commission's and House Select Committee's SBT chronologies. Because Moore has JFK and JBC undergoing the very same kind of two-second-long \\"delayed reaction\\" when it comes to each of them reacting to the first missed shot (with respect to BOTH victims' sudden arm movements that occur only AFTER Zapruder frame 225).The WC and HSCA assumed that John Connally had suffered a delayed reaction to being shot during pre-Z225 frames of the Z-Film. But Moore doesn't buy the \\"2-second delay\\" on Connally's part if the SBT shot had actually occurred as early as Z190, per the HSCA analysis. (And I don't buy it either.)But Mr. Moore has to believe in virtually the same kind of \\"delayed\\" reaction too (for both victims)....because, per Moore, he sees some kind of \\"reactions\\" on the Z-Film prior to Z235, but Moore thinks these are caused by a shot that missed the car (at Z-Frame #186), which is a shot that occurred some 2.68 seconds earlier than Moore's \\"SBT\\" frame at Z235!Therefore, Mr. Moore seems to be advocating a \\"Two-Victim, In-Unison, Perfectly-Synchronized, Two-Second Delayed Reaction\\" on the part of both Kennedy and Connally (due only to reacting to a shot that missed them both, except for concrete fragments assumed to be striking JFK; but even there, Kennedy WAITS until Z226 to start jerking his arms upward toward his face, even though, per Moore, the President had been stung by fragments of concrete more than two full seconds earlier).Sorry, Jim, but I cannot purchase that scenario. And I also don't think it's very likely (at all) that a missed shot could have hit Elm Street and then zoom across Dealey Plaza (at grass level after hitting the Elm pavement near the limo) and then strike the Main Street curb, resulting in bystander James Tague's minor cheek injury. This book claims that all of that stuff actually occurred via Oswald's first \\"missed\\" shot on 11/22/63. (Sounds to me as if Mr. Moore's first-shot missile might be a truly \\"Magic\\" bullet.)Another question I have via Moore's (and Bishop's) theory is -- Why would concrete pieces hit Kennedy in the FACE if the missed shot struck the street to the REAR of the automobile (as Moore suggests did occur on page 198 of his book)? It doesn't add up.A much better overall explanation to tighten these \\"reactions\\" up in a realistic manner is to endorse a \\"Z224\\" SBT timeline. At that Z-Film frame, everything fits perfectly. Just watch the film again and see if you don't agree.------------------------The second thing in this book that I cannot accept at all is Mr. Moore's explanation of why almost all of the witnesses at Parkland Hospital said they saw a large wound in the back of President Kennedy's head on November 22nd. To quote from page 180 of this book:\\"...The explanation for this [head wound] discrepancy is so simple few will subscribe to it. The Parkland doctors all saw President Kennedy in only one position--face up. An exit wound across his forehead might have been labeled 'at the front of the skull', but a wound on the right side? Doctors would have seen the missing area 'at the rear of the skull', of course.\\" -- Jim MooreThe above explanation is pure nonsense (even though I am an \\"LNer\\" myself). And, admittedly, this disagreement I have with Mr. Moore on this point doesn't do my own lone-assassin position any favors; but IMO it's just common sense.Moore is telling his readers, in essence, that ALL of the many Parkland doctors and nurses actually did see the President's head wound on the \\"right side\\" of his head, but EACH ONE OF THEM was apparently stupid enough to somehow label the wound's location as being at the BACK part of the head. (And each of these Parkland witnesses would later demonstrate with their own hands where they thought the wound was located; with each person placing their hand on a REAR portion of their own head.)It's just silly to think that ALL of these Parkland witnesses would somehow be disoriented enough to NOT know the \\"side\\" of the head from the \\"rear\\" of the head. And all just because JFK was lying flat on his back the whole time.It seems to me that such a strange explanation would be akin to becoming confused about the location of a person's ear, just due to the fact the person is lying down. For example, why would anyone suddenly think an ear was located at the BACK of a person's head, rather than the \\"side\\" of the head?Now, having gushed the above tirade regarding the head-wound variables and controversy, I'll now say this in favor of the \\"Single Assassin\\" point-of-view.....I'll admit, I have no idea how to fully reconcile the many different witnesses who claimed to have seen a large exit wound in the rear of John F. Kennedy's head. But I do know that there is just as much HARD evidence (actually even more) that tends to refute those \\"Back Of The Head\\" witnesses. Evidence such as:1.) The Zapruder Film, which shows no \\"BOH\\" wound at all; and shows, instead, an exit wound on the RIGHT SIDE of Kennedy's head.2.) The autopsy photographs and X-rays, which verify that the exit wound was chiefly \\"parietal\\" and \\"temporal\\" (i.e., \\"side\\" and \\"top\\" of the head), and not \\"occipital\\" (i.e., at the \\"rear\\" of the head).3.) The official autopsy report (signed by all three autopsy physicians), which verifies that President Kennedy was shot only twice, with both shots coming from \\"above and behind\\" the victim.4.) The unwavering testimony of all three of JFK's autopsy doctors (James Humes, J. Thornton Boswell, and Pierre Finck), testimony which confirms the \\"RIGHT SIDE-TOP\\" location of Kennedy's head (exit) wound.The autopsy photographs and X-rays also verify the fact that there was only ONE single bullet hole of entry on the President's head. This is critically important, of course, because it (in essence) is telling any reasonable researcher that it really doesn't matter exactly WHERE on the head the larger (exit) wound was located....because the ONE lone wound of entry is verifying that ONLY ONE BULLET struck Mr. Kennedy's skull....and that bullet definitely came from behind JFK.As I said, I cannot fully explain the strange \\"BOH\\" tale that has been told by so many Parkland (and Bethesda) people since 1963. But I'm certainly not willing to insult the basic intelligence of multiple professional medical technicians, doctors, and nurses by speculating that NONE of these people could tell the SIDE of a patient's head from the BACK of his cranium. That's just crazy, IMO.If I were to hazard a guess as to why (and how) so many different observers could all see the same (wrong) thing re. JFK's head wound, I'd say it's possibly due to the fact that the massive amount of blood coming from the President's large wound on the right side of his head was pooling toward the BACK of his head while he was resting flat on his back on the hospital stretcher, creating the incorrect impression to the observers that the wound was located where the greatest amount of blood was seen.I think it's also possible (and, I admit, this is just a guess as well) that when Mrs. Jacqueline Kennedy was \\"trying to hold his head on\\" (as Mrs. Kennedy later said) during the high-speed ride to the hospital, it's quite possible that the loose piece of \\"hinged\\" scalp (which is a \\"flap\\" of skull/scalp that can be seen in the autopsy photos taken at Bethesda after the body was returned to Washington) was at least partially hiding the large hole at the right side of JFK's head when he was in the emergency room at Parkland.This \\"flap\\" of loose scalp could then have dislodged itself from INSIDE the cratered wound on the right side of the head before the autopsy photos were taken on the night of November 22. The \\"flap\\", as seen in the photos, is not covering any portion of the right-side head wound, but instead is hinged \\"outward\\" from the wound.Whether that \\"flap\\" was configured in that exact \\"outward\\" position at Parkland we can never know. But I think it's certainly a possibility that the \\"flap\\" could have been covering the large exit wound, especially in light of the fact that Jackie Kennedy, we know, was physically handling the President's head during the drive to Parkland, and also was \\"trying to hold his head on\\".------------------------Another \\"Conspiracy Of One\\" drawback is the pitiful lack of photographs and/or illustrations. There is a small (and proverbial) section of \\"slick pages\\" in the center of the book, containing a few black-and-white photos (16 total pages); but these pictures are little more than perfunctory and peripheral in nature and were probably thrown into the center of the book as more-or-less an after-thought (possibly because the author felt he needed at least a few photos in a book about the JFK assassination, which, after all, was the most-photographed murder in history).And since it was the most-photographed killing in the history of the world, any book that purports to be \\"definitive\\" re. the JFK case should, in my opinion, rely on many of those photos and motion-picture film frames to help tell the story. But Mr. Moore's volume is woefully lacking in such visual resources. There's not a single picture or graph or illustration within this publication (except for the 16-page photo spread in the middle of the book). And that's a shame.I think it's also rather interesting to note that the author (Mr. Moore) rakes the \\"critics\\" (aka: the Conspiracy-loving Kooks) over hot coals because of their \\"blatant sensationalism\\" in choosing to publish some of the autopsy photos of President Kennedy in their pro-conspiracy books over the years, with Moore calling these authors a \\"tasteless mob\\".But then Mr. Moore decides to publish three grisly frames from the Zapruder Film in the mini photo section within this book (including the \\"impact\\" Z-Film frame, Z313). And in addition to those three pictures, Moore also includes a photo of JFK's blood-stained shirt as well.Those aren't specifically \\"autopsy\\" photographs shown in this book, true. But the inclusion of those four blood-filled pictures within this volume certainly are contrary to this statement made by Mr. Moore on page #178:\\"I will not feed on the bloody frenzy they [the \\"tasteless mob\\"] have so successfully generated.\\"------------------------A Final Word:Despite my numerous negative remarks about the contents of this book, it's my opinion, as mentioned earlier, that Mr. Moore most certainly arrived at the correct final conclusion (i.e., Lee Harvey Oswald did it and did it alone), and that is the most important thing in a true-crime publication of this nature.But for someone who evidently, per this book's text, spent 23 years researching the JFK murder case, Jim Moore's fairly-thin 200-plus-page hardcover edition of \\"Conspiracy Of One\\", which doesn't even contain an Index, falls quite a bit short of living up to the book's boastful subtitle -- \\"The Definitive Book On The Kennedy Assassination\\".David Von PeinDecember 2006"},{"Title":"Conspiracy Of One The Definitive Book On The Kennedy Assassination","review":"I' ll start with the simplest of facts. Jim Moore states that the U.S Army does not have a carbine to match the muzzle velocity of that of the Carcano. This is simply not true. The Caliber .30 M1903A4 Rifle is in fact a more powerful weapon.A little history: The Mannlicher Carcano rifle, a 6.5mm Model 1938 (91/38) rifle, serial number C2766, made in 1940 at the Italian arsenal at Terni. This rifle was part of the Italian Army surplus sold in this country and was fitted with a four-power Japanese commerical scope by an American dealer. This rifle has a muzzle velocity of 2320 f.p.s.The Caliber .30 M1903A4. This is the sniber version of the M1903A3; a full pistol grip stock is fitted. The bolt handle is cut away to clear the M73B1 (Weaver 330C) 2.5 power scope. No iron sights are fitted. Muzzle velocity of 2805 f.p.s..Shame on you Mr. Moore.Second fact: Mr. Moore states that Oswald never live fired the rifle prior to the day of the assination. Mr. Moore states \\"Oswald apparently availed himself of many opportunities to work the bolt and to sight imaginary targets while familiarizing himself with the Carcano in his screened-in back porch\\". Yet he was able to get off 3 rounds, including a head shot in seven seconds. This, I remind you is with a rifle and scope that has never been fired or had the scope zeroed in at any range.This is laughable at best. No way in hell can anyone hit a moving target three times in seven seconds with a rifle and scope that has NEVER been zeroed in. Oswald would have had no idea where his first round hit so he would have had no idea were to place his second round and again this is a moving target.Again Mr. Moore shame on you.Take this book with a grain of salt because that is all that it is worth."},{"Title":"Conspiracy Of One The Definitive Book On The Kennedy Assassination","review":"If you are interested in the Kennedy assassination and happen to stumble across this book - Read it! If for no other reason, it is one of only a handful of books that have ever been written on this topic that does *not* bash the basic conclusion reached by the Warren Commission, that Lee Harvey Oswald assassinated (by himself) the president. One of the most interesting aspects of this book is Jim Moore's metamorphosis from a conspiracy junkie into a more rationale view of the assassination. He doesn't just bash the conspiracy buffs for their selfish exaggerations, but he lets the reader IN on what truly motivates these individuals. He was once one himself! But now he has seen the light and encourages others to do the same. Sadly (for some), the story surrounding the assassination of John Kennedy is nothing more than a disturbed, 24-yr-old ex-Marine taking his mail order rifle to work one day, pointing it out the window and pulling the trigger three times - snuffing out the life of the most powerful man in the world."},{"Title":"Affluenza : The All-Consuming Epidemic","review":"This book reads like a publication of environmental extremists...yet is admittedly thought provoking.

But this book may cause non-radicals to scoff from the exaggerated statistics, poorly supported claims of impending disaster, and contrived connections between our consumption oriented society and a sinister, contagious, all but lethal virus.I did appreciate the social/economic value statement that this book succeeds in stressing. It is all right to live humbly and simply and with thought for our neighbors, whether they live next door or on the other side of the world. They state that the media and business have managed to create a standard of living that strays from the things in life that truly give satisfaction. It is a standard of living measured by the ability to consume more and more products.This book at times idolizes certain individuals that have given up the \\"rat race\\" of professional careers for a simpler life of social activism and composting.

I love the book's cartoons, and its generally upbeat approach. The authors acknowledge the severity of Affluenza, yet they also offer proven remedies, with an emphasis on improving the real quality of our lives.

Affluena does a beautiful job of naming the causes of the discomfort being felt in so many people's lifes in the U.S. The good news is it doesn't just say, You have a fatal illness and there's nothing that can be done for you. Instead, it offers simple guidelines for reprioritizing to redirect us to deeper meaning and fulfillment. This book gives a sense of hope and connection to those who may have felt alone in their emptiness. It seems like a great opportunity to form discussion groups, which also just happen to create more of a sense of community, while revisting long-held values that have been forfeited in our materialistic frenzy."},{"Title":"Affluenza : The All-Consuming Epidemic","review":"This is a very good book. You should read it. The wealth of information and depth of analysis makes this a well-worth-the-trouble-to-read-it kind of book. The authors are well read, and it shows in each chapter. The analysis, statistics and information is hauntingly and depressingly good. But once you've read it, give it away to someone. And then give away other things you don't need. And if you don't, then read the book again. And again. Until you get it.Affluenza, the disease represented mainly by overconsumption afflicting the Western world. (Or at least, the wealthy part of the Western world and which is starting now to infect Asia.) The book is broken into three sections: Symptoms, Causes and Treatment. I've read quite a few books on this topic, and try to live a simple life, but it's not easy and the authors know that. But I'm not a 2 cars parked on the street because the garage is full kind of guy (I don't have a garage, let alone a car.) The format of the book means that I can photocopy single chapters and lend them to people who I think couldn't be bothered to read the whole thing, to give them an idea of what it's all about. And each chapter then has references at the end for further reading. It serves as a textbook of society's woes.The book was published in 2002, at the beginning of George W's presidency. It seemed at the time a good book with a good prescription for the ills of society. Reading it at the beginning of 2009, the patient is a lot sicker and I think more drastic measures might have to be taken. Doctor, give me a shot."},{"Title":"Affluenza : The All-Consuming Epidemic","review":"It does not take much skill to catalog the various ills of our modern society, particularly the unhealthy influences of Madison Ave. and Hollywood. This book does a fine job summarizing today's cultural pressures to spend and consume, to make more money and spend more time making it, all at the expnse of our families and personal sanity. Indeed, many books do the same thing; pointing out what is wrong with our spend-spend-spend culture these days is like shooting fish in a barrel. The authors provide several good examples of folks who got caught up in the world of consumption, credit card debt and keeping up with the Jones's. If you are looking for practical solutions for simplifying your life on an everyday, prectical level, however, this is not the book to read. As I feared they would, the authors rely almost exclusively on radical, unrealistic eco-solutions based upon environmental activism to recommend ways of living more simply. That might be OK for states, nations and communities to use, but for the individual looking for ways to cut back, relax, spend more time at home with loved ones, Affluenza is decidedly lacking. For folks trying to find realistic ways of not working so many hours and spending too much on possessions, the authors' recommendations of not eating red meat and eliminating your annual vacation to the beach border on absurd. Even more absurd is the conclusion: this book recommends heavy-handed, intrusive governtment solutions (including legistlation to cut back the work week) as &quot;the answer&quot; along with radical environmentalism. Nowhere do the authors recommend religous or spiritual ideas to help people reduce their work hours and conspicuous consumption, a serious flaw to this study.

Blame yourself. =D"},{"Title":"Affluenza : The All-Consuming Epidemic","review":"Overall I thought this book was good. As admitted in the introduction, this book does not contain original research but rather is a complilation of already published research. I was written primarily for Joe 6-pack who has minimal knowledge in this area.Throughout the book they danced around, but never directly addressed, the power of transnational corporations and how they are ultimately behind the disease of affluenza. It began with the 1886 Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad Supreme Court decision which gave corporations the same rights as individuals. Everything has gone downhill since. Thus, in the last section of the book designed to propose solutions to the disease of affluenza I was further let down that they all consisted of things we can do ourselves to alleviate the pain. Why not attack the source rather than try to adjust our coping mechanisms? Even if we, the individuals who read this book, adopt a lifestyle of simplicity as advocated, the root cause and status quo will remain. Our society will continue to be bombarded with consumption messages. Attacking the source means we have to look at the role of the transnational corporation. Corporations are not monolithic; they can (and should be) held accountable for their actions. We cannot do this individually but rather a collective effort needs to be made. Individuals needs to unite across class lines in an effort to make corporations accountable for their negligent business practices. Too bad this very important issue was neglected."},{"Title":"Affluenza : The All-Consuming Epidemic","review":"We have seen and heard these scenarios before, whether couched in historical, sociological, ethical, or religious terms. This particular version of the story is well-researched and there is no particular problem with the thesis. That being said, using the term &quot;epidemic&quot; implies -- just as it does with the so-called &quot;obesity epidemic&quot; -- that the problem will circulate through the system and then go away. Framing it that way is too optimistic, for the roots run much deeper than the epidemic metaphor suggests. Worth the facts, but create your own schema if you want it to serve as the basis for action."},{"Title":"Affluenza : The All-Consuming Epidemic","review":"Questions raised and addressed in this book get to the heart of why we buy. An obvious answer might be to meet physical and psychological needs such as food, shelter, transportation, safety, security, self-esteem, belongingness. But are we meeting these needs well? For example, does the typical American diet provide optimal health, or too often, various illnesses like colon cancer, heart disease, obesity, acid reflux, depression, and anxiety?The good news in this book is that there are better, lower cost ways to meet our physical and psychological needs. If our economy gradually begins to slow down, we'll be more \\"culturally content,\\" running our economy with a higher ratio of health to wealth (some have called it the \\"joy/stuff ratio\\") We'll place more emphasis on intrinsic forms of wealth like meaningful work, healthy food systems, close friends, and great communities.And what about housing? There's no argument that the American home has gotten bigger, but has it gotten qualitatively better, or is it really the most effective unit of consumption the world has ever known? Every day we consume over a hundred pounds of stuff, when the waste products of our consumer goods (like mining slash piles, sawdust, our share of concrete for roads, etc.) are factored in. If our own economy continues to grow along with other economies like China, India, Brazil and Mexico, where will we get additional planets? (Not on Ebay!)Will a more highly evolved version of the American Dream re-define what it means to be successful, and happy? The authors of Affluenza are convinced that it will, and that that new approach will improve our health, our families, our communities, and the environment.

This is not light reading, and much of it deserves reflection and analysis.I had been for a while questioning some of the very issues in the book (do i really need these many clothes? And why can't i park the car in the garage?), albeit in a very abstract form. The book looks at Affluenza as an epidemic, and as such divides the book into three parts: symptoms, causes, and treatment. To me, the most interesting part was the middle chapter, the understanding of how we transitioned from a society that valued time off above money to one where we have the lowest amount of vacation days per year, even below Japan. My boss, for example, stops accruing vacation because he never takes any. Then our Human Resources Department forces him to take a day off, and he sneaks back into the office to work incognito. He also gets upset when you try to take two weeks of vacation at a time...I agree with much of what Affluenza says, and admit being part of the problem, but the book got preachy at times. For example, it discusses how many resources go into the making (and disposing) of a computer. I started feeling guilty, because i bought a new one a few months ago. After a while, however, i thought about the absurdity of my guilt. I had used my old computer for nine years. This replacement was not frivolous. What is one supposed to do when your computer becomes obsolete, after almost a decade of use? We cannot move back the clock and expect to encounter the simplicity that existed, say, in the 50s. To think we can is disingenuous. I wish the book had given more of a middle ground.I read with amusement the unending praise that organic food gets throughout the book. I do not buy anything organic as a matter of general principle. I am tired of hearing shrill pseudo-scientists scaring consumers. For a more balanced view on this issue, i have always enjoyed what Bruce Ames at UCBerkeley had to say. And he has a lot of cred (a quick Google search will tell you why).But those are my only complaints. I believe this is an important book, for those who like me were already aware of the perils of affluenza, but especially to those who are still oblivious, and believe me, there are many shades of oblivion. I have friends who go crazy about organic food, yet they are mega-shoppers, while others may be very frugal in their shopping expeditions, but still have not figured out what their recycling bin is for. It is scary to think what may happen one day!As for me, i am resolving to watch less TV and spend less time at the mall in 2006."},{"Title":"Affluenza : The All-Consuming Epidemic","review":"This book is an easy to read and realistic view of where Americans have been and where we are headed.

You experience a temporary high as you shop and buy, only to suffer the future consequences in the form of financial distress and increased clutter in your life shortly thereafter.Combine a lack of financial education in schools and at home with relentless credit card company marketing, more and more advertising targeted at children, the public's desire to have the latest of everything (driven by relentless marketing on all fronts), and an epidemic results.In Affluenza, the authors detail America's over consumption of everything, so much in fact, that if every country on earth (probably even just half of them) consumed as much per person as the US, the planet would simply be destroyed. This consumption leads to debt and financial stress, environmental destruction, and a lifestyle that is simply not sustainable. The financial, social, and environmental impacts are tremendous.There is nothing revolutionary about anything in this book. If you are like most people, you or someone you know suffers at least some of the symptoms, an addiction to shopping, difficulty paying bills (particularly credit card), and a deep down realization that all the stuff you have really doesn't mean much. The book provides a new way to look at mass consumption and realize how it affects ones life.The book describes the empty world of plenty many Americans live in, as well as the global consequences of unchecked consumption. It also discusses various steps people have taken to simplify their lives (some rather extreme) and how the need to consume is in some ways simply built into the American society - like that 400+ a month most of us have to spend on a car to get back and forth to work so we have the cash to pay for the car.Pick up a copy of the book and find a nice spot in the beautiful outdoors to go relax and enjoy it.

It's message is powerful, but hopeful."},{"Title":"Affluenza : The All-Consuming Epidemic","review":"Every 15 seconds, someone somewhere in America is going bankrupt.(source: America's Finite Future by Arianna Huffington).That small paragraph should send alarm bells ringing all across the nation. This book will not only make you mad, it will also be a serious wake-up call as to what exactly is going on in this country-and why. There is no question that there has been a very large decline in American society since the early 1960s (this decline is a matter of record). This simply cannot be explained in terms of poverty, homelessness or crime, for these societal elements have always been with us. We live in a period of great material prosperity compared with almost all of recorded history. I've read all these other reviews and can only nod my head in agreement. It doesn't take a scientist or Einstein to figure out that there is something deeply, seriously, and terribly wrong with our society today. It's almost as if our entire self-worth is determined by the kind of car we drive, the size of our bank account, the type of home we live in, the clothes we wear, even the very stores that we frequent, racking up thousands of dollars of credit card debt in the process!A recent article by a national news magazine in Canada stated that America is on the verge of bankruptcy, and how if this mighty empire should ever fall (and it will at the rate we're going), it will take Canada down with it. Many of my Canadian friends have also expressed concerns that not only are jobs vanishing to Mexico and overseas, but the economy is becoming increasingly unstable while government and consumer spending is out of control. Almost every single person in this country owes money-and a lot of it. We can't continue on this path of self-destruction, as the authors mention, without ruining this planet for our future generations.As I write this review, I'm looking at the pictures of my three grandchildren on my desk here, and I'm truly scared to death. I'm scared that when they reach my age (52), the America that I once knew and loved will only be a distant memory. I'm worried that it will be THEM that has to clean up the mess made by US. It will be THEM that won't be able to find work, raise a family, or even put food of their table without having to stand in line at the welfare office. While I'm not normally a pessimistic person, I can't help but feel that the authors have really given us a wake-up call in this book. Even David Walker, Comptroller General of the United States, has stated that he's seen a glimpse of our future, and it's scaring the hell out of him too. Record deficits, colossal debt and no clear plan for digging ourselves out of this mess! It would seem as though Washington is more concerned with overseas affairs than what's going on right here at home in our own backyards!Let me close by saying this. As we all know, the market crashed in '29. There were various factors that led to this, and what we are seeing now, both here at home and abroad, is only a prelude of things to come. This \\"bullish\\" market we've become so comfortable with can't sustain itself for too much longer. Something has gotta give. Crude Oil is predicted to rise to as much as $100 dollar a barrel by this summer. If that does occur, the economy will start to free-fall. Jobs are going to vanish. Bankruptcies (business and personal) are going to soar. The term \\"small-town\\" America will no longer be relevant as these towns will cease to exist. Food prices will skyrocket, and people will literally be at the end of their rope. Just remember this folks. History always repeats itself. ALWAYS. RIP good ole U.S.A. We only brought this entire mess on ourselves, and now we must clean it up. God help us all."},{"Title":"Affluenza : The All-Consuming Epidemic","review":"I finished this book just prior to 9/11. I thought the subject was about as on target regarding where we are in America (and where we should be heading) as one could get. Then after the terriorist attacks, I thought how timely the book is when we in America are now examining our values and what is really important in light of the tragedy. The difference is before I was pessimistic we could even begin to move away from affluenza, but afterward I felt perhaps this country could, indeed, see that a simpler, less materialistic lifestyle fits very well with patriotism and standing together against our enemies. The book presents us with a practical approach to curing affluenza and backs it up with more than enough statistics and recommendations. I am far from a &quot;tree hugger,&quot; but I think the authors are onto something at exactly the right time."},{"Title":"Affluenza : The All-Consuming Epidemic","review":"This is a book that improves in quality as you read further. The latter half of the book seemed to earn more underlining and margin notes from me than the first; the first half appeared to hammer points too often and too heavily about consumerism, the need to restore nature lifestyles, etc.As the book continues, hard data is presented to reinforce the premise that our addiction to material consumption corresponds to increased clinical depression, environmental ruin, financial stress, and damage to intimate relationships. Conversely, research is presented to suggest that avoiding such traps correlates with increased happiness, improved family lives, and financial security.Okay, why buy this book if those points seem obvious? Well, the book does a GREAT job at showing how affluenza--the drive to buy more STUFF--is a behavior *deliberately* developed and encouraged by social and political interests that find benefits from such habits. It also penetrates the strategies used to discount those of us who question that tactic, such as creating fake &quot;public science&quot; foundations (organized by cloaked corporations) to feed propaganda about climate change, ecology, etc. to the public, disguised as independent research. That unveiling of information alone is worth the book!David Horsey's occasional cartoon illustrations hit the mark directly, as well. A good companion to this book might be Jerry Mander's &quot;In The Absence of the Sacred.&quot;"},{"Title":"Affluenza : The All-Consuming Epidemic","review":"I teach English as a Second Language to college-bound adults, and I'm always looking for reading materials that are both engaging and educational. This book fits the bill perfectly. The subject matter - rising affluence - is one that everyone can relate to, no matter what their age or nationality. The book's premise - that rising affluence is a disease that must be cured - is thought-provoking to say the least, especially since it flies in the face of the current wisdom that economic growth is the benchmark of a healthy society. The authors support their claims with numerous facts and statistics, but this never reads like a textbook; the consistent use of humor will hold the interest of nearly any reader.The fact that this book is based on a PBS documentary (available on VHS) is a definite bonus. Teachers might be interested to know that there is a whole set of free, supplementary lesson plans for Affluenza the video on the PBS website.Whether you read this book for pleasure or as an educator with an eye towards classroom use, Affluenza is a highly readable analysis of a phenomenon that is affecting not only Americans, but people the world over."},{"Title":"Affluenza : The All-Consuming Epidemic","review":"I love this book because it helped me realize the vanity and greed of materialism. Just reading this book for my English 1A Class in college, I could relate to people who spent money on useless things that they didn't need either squandering all their money or heightening their credit card debt.Indeed, American society is heavily declining due to Affluenza. Because of Affluenza, morality and family values have declined heavily. When was the last time have you seen a father and son having a good family get together at the park? The father is cooped up watching the Superbowl on satellite TV and ths son is busy playing is Sony Playstation 2 or chatting on AOL Instant Messenger.Shocking but true because I have seen Affluenza hit my family and especially the people that I know big time."},{"Title":"Affluenza : The All-Consuming Epidemic","review":"Sure, Affluenza is a polemic, but it's a powerful one. Sure, some of the book's more startling factual assertions are, on closer examination, somewhat distorted. But this is a call to arms, not a scholarly dissection. By depicting our consumer culture as a deadly epidemic, the authors provide a metaphor that simply and intuitively captures the fears and concerns of millions of people worldwide. While some conservative readers might scoff at a book that breathlessly states that life was better before the industrial revolution, we from getAbstract recommend this book as a valuable peek into the intellectual world of the anti-globalization left."},{"Title":"Affluenza : The All-Consuming Epidemic","review":"As the authors of this book make ever so clear, Americans work more, produce more waste, buy more, feel depressed more (and therefore take more anti-depressants), commit more suicide, produce more GDP, have more economic inequality, visit the mall more, have more credit card debt, file more bankruptcy, build more houses, drive more (and bigger) cars, crash those cars more often, sleep less, take more partners (more often), subdue more children with more ads and more violence (and therefore have more violent, brand-loyal children), eat more (and are thus fatter), vote less, join fewer organizations, volunteer less, have more prisons (and more prisoners), produce more cancer-causing agents, air pollution and water pollution, burn more oil, waste more water, and have more brain, liver, breast, kidney, prostate, esophagus, skin, bone and lymph cancer THAN ANY OTHER COUNTRY IN THE WORLD.We suffer from increasing rates of all kinds of diseases. And this is not so surprising, considering the average American hosts up to 500 different chemicals in his or her body. Of course, our chemical body burden is rising as more trace amounts of pain relievers, more antibiotics, more birth control pills, more perfumes, more codeine, more antacids, more cholesterol-lowering agents, more antidepressants, more estrogen replacement drugs, more chemotherapy agents, more sunscreen lotion, more hormones from feed lots, more pesticides, more herbicides and more fungicides make their way into our drinking water, air and food. In a word, we are literally poisoning ourselves to death with affluence.Perhaps worst of all, spiritual sickness is sweeping across the country. More people feel \\"empty\\" than ever before. Fewer people are contentment with their work. Fourteen million Americans use illegal drugs, twelve million are heavy drinkers, and sixty million are hooked on tobacco. Five million Americans cannot stop gambling away their income and savings - while, at the shopping malls, compulsive buyers often report a feeling of heightened sensations, or a heightened sense of awareness. \\"Colors and textures are more intense, and extreme levels of focus and concentration are often achieve - literally, altered states of consciousness. Some extreme shoppers compare their highs to drug experiences, while others have compared the moment of purchase to an orgasm.\\"Largely because of the American lifestyle (and those who mimic it), the world is on the brink of collapse. Few of us realize this, and those who see the writing on the wall often find it easier to live in denial than attempt to change. But these are the facts: A quarter of the world's plants are threatened with extinction by the year 2010. More than 38 percent of U.S. amphibians are endangered. Three-quarters of all bird species are declining in numbers. One-third of the North American freshwater fish are rare or endangered. About 100 invertebrate species are lost each day due to deforestation (many from urban sprawl). 25 percent of all mammal species are threatened with extinction. In other words, because of the emerging global economy and personal consumption habits, we are losing species from at a rate 1000 times faster than the natural rate of planetary evolution.Affluenza is does not just outline the disturbing facts we all should know, it also outlines a clear plan for change, from \\"downshifting\\" and the simplifying your life to overt political strategies. It offers sustainable lifestyle suggestions as well as political action pointers. The authors genuinely want people to be happy, healthy, and free - not mere slaves to a corporate machine that is killing the planet. They note that people are genuinely satisfied when their work is fulfilling. People also seem to be satisfied when they are out in nature. Today we are both working less fulfilling jobs and seeing less of nature. But as the authors show, it doesn't have to be this way. You can learn to simplify your life and pursue those things which genuinely matter in life.In short, Affluenza provides a broad outline of our illness as a species and the only cure in sight. I highly recommend giving it a read. Would have posted 100 stars if possible.JWK"},{"Title":"Affluenza : The All-Consuming Epidemic","review":"Did you know that American's use more than their fair share of the world's resources? That the eat an unhealthy diet? That they drive big gas-guzzling cars? Oh you did? Well, then you might be able to skip this 270-page tome on the evils of the modern world.The cover was striking, the book jacket promised more about the ills of the modern wold than I could dream of finding. But the book seemed to ramble on without providing much in the way of help for us to break the shackles of the dreaded affluenza and move up to the next level of enlightenment.I found the name affluenza and the idea of it being a \`disease' was cute. At First. That wore out pretty quick for me though. But not for the authors who carry the pun until the dreaded device is as fun as nails on a blackboard.The book had topics that spoke about people who quit or were laid off from high-paying jobs and suddenly found happiness when they made 1/3 or their old salary. It spoke of the joys that people who never spend more that 8,000 year had in comparison to corporate CEO's. The book stops well short of explaining how we can do this in our own lives other than recommending websites and additional books to buy.I just didn't come away from this book with any great compelling \`must have' knowledge that I think will change the world. I know that an SUV takes more gas than a Honda Civic. I know that there is a wide disparity between the rich and the poor and that it is only getting wider. I think that most people who would be tempted to read this book know that too.I suppose that this was what I disliked about the book. There was a mish-mashed collection of facts without any hope or plan to alleviate the problem. There was too much clowning around for the book to be a warning of things to come and way too little advice for it to be useful in my daily life."},{"Title":"Affluenza : The All-Consuming Epidemic","review":"This is a well researched, high quality book; written with humor, wisdom, and a great understanding of the subject: Americans out of touch with reality.If you want to come to grips with the real problems Americans face, and what the rest of the world faces as a result of our consumerism; or perhaps you are just curious about what kind of creature \\"makes it\\" in America, then this is your book.What I admired most after finishing reading, is the folksy worldview the authors have. I mean, they quote Malvina Reynolds, of all people, who complained in her songs about the cookie-cutter people which began to sprout up in the 50's, who lived in little boxes \\"made of ticky-tacky\\".Basicly, our lifestyle, -- maybe not yours, maybe not mine, but the average joe on the street, -- is a high-powered, high-stress, work-to-buy, overconsumering, lonely, almost meaningless existence. A state which is hardly even necessary to maintain our cherished international profile. Given the high technology, we REALLY only would have to work 10 hour work weeks. But of course we don't. This book is set up with a diagnosis, a description of the disease (Affluenza), and the cure. It does not fail to deliver, although it is a hard pill to swallow.Highly recommended! If you are interested in this subject, also try \\"Your Money or Your Life\\" and \\"The Idiot's Guide to Simple Living\\"."},{"Title":"Affluenza : The All-Consuming Epidemic","review":"For years I have felt like a fish swimming upstream against the constant pressures of rampant commercialism in our society. I have tried to teach my children by example, that less is more, even going so far as to write them a novel, A PARTING GIFT (Warner Books), as a way to impress my thoughts them. All this time I thought I was standing virtually alone in our spend, spend, spend culture, but now that I have read AFFLUENZA, I realize that there are thousands of others out there who feel the same way I do.I plan to give this book to both my children in the hopes that the hard cold facts and statistics presented here will have as much impact on them as the philosophical truths I tried to express in my novel."},{"Title":"Affluenza : The All-Consuming Epidemic","review":"Is having things or having a large, nice home or owning a new car more important that spending time with your family? I don't think so. Having lots of stuff or working 41-60+ hours will not make me any happier in the long run. I liked the survey the book had and how the book was laid out. It was interesting to read how the author related affluenza to a disease. I liked the small cartoon stips and reading the facts throughout the book."},{"Title":"Affluenza : The All-Consuming Epidemic","review":"This book builds a case for identifying a new disease, \\"affluenza\\", that is apparently sickening American society. The authors cite symptom after symptom of the disease, supported by innumerable facts, which are well-footnoted and indexed. The book is divided into 3 sections: symptoms, causes, and treatment. However, most of the text is actually devoted to describing the problem, and even the treatment section is filled with more facts and very few concrete suggestions for solutions to the problem. As a springboard for discussions, this book with all its facts could be quite interesting. But the endless list of statistics can make the prose rather tiresome if read straight through."},{"Title":"Affluenza : The All-Consuming Epidemic","review":"People who like this book may well want to spend an afternoon at the library reviewing the latest in poetry--which has far more to offer than religious consumerism--namely fashions, lessons and passions that never go out of style. Start with Stanley Kunitz, Seamus Heaney, Gwendolyn Brooks, Lucie Brock Broido and Philip Levine, for a cross-section of the last 50 years. If you like one or more of those, try others. Reading poetry will enrich your life in ways that forever buying things (other than books) cannot. Alyssa A. Lappen"},{"Title":"Affluenza : The All-Consuming Epidemic","review":"Affluenza is a book of great wisdom, vision, and hope. Most of all, its a book about revolution, a revolution in the way we think and the way we live, a revolution of freedom and meaning and happiness so powerful it could transform the planet. It is, in short, one of the most important books you will ever read.With a storehouse of humor and astounding evidence, John de Graaf, David Wann, and Thomas H. Naylor have pulled off the most extraordinary feat since the Industrial Revolution began over two hundred years ago. In tracing the sociological history of commercialism, they have managed to give us back the freedom and happiness lost in the onslaught.We live and die for our paychecks, despartate to accumulate More, dying to keep up with The Joneses. Like mice in the lab, we run the treadmill as if it were our fate. As if we had no choice. As if we were trapped. But we're not. Each and everyone one of us is as free as we want to be... if we will only sit still long enough to claim it. We live the way we do not because we are bad or wrong or foolish... but because we are great and strong and noble, because every single one of us needs joy and meaning and purpose in our life. Now there's a better way to find it. Affluenza is, in sum, a guidebook, leading in the revolution to happiness.As Gandhi once wrote, &quot;We must BE the change we wish to see in the world.&quot; It's up to each of us. Read this book!"},{"Title":"Affluenza : The All-Consuming Epidemic","review":"This book is less of a sociological study but more of a rant. While some points are valid, I could not help but think the authors just have grudges against certain things. In the latter half of this book, statistics, surveys and valid studies dominate, making it informative, but the beginning is littered with gripes and anecdotal evidence which I feel hurts the credibility of the whole book.The books deals with how American society is on a consuming rampage that is controlling our lives. Somehow, though, they concentrate of the extremes, insert wild exaggerations, and seem oblivious to the fact that the two major factors that take away the most money are taxes and housing. What little meaning they attach to a house is meaningless rants again McMansions, and somehow support the hypocrisy of cheaper housing and more open space.Yes, they bring up some valid points. The environmental information they provide is excellent and an eye-opener. The advertising section was also informative and made think a little harder.All in all, it's good, but in the end it made me that the only way to satisfy the authors of this book would be for everyone to go back in time and become Yeoman farmers, in a magical world where land is cheap and plentiful and government is an efficient system that can solve all of societies woes. It ain't going to happen."},{"Title":"Affluenza : The All-Consuming Epidemic","review":"I don't know how many other women (or men for that matter) can relate to the feeling of living life in a blender, the pace of their lives spinning out of control, whirling between conflicting demands of work, family, etc. This book proposes both possible causes and cures for this time famine. It often seems that the more outwardly &quot;successful&quot; we appear, the more stressed out and exhausted we feel. We have all the &quot;stuff&quot; that's supposed to make us happy, but we have no time to keep in touch with family and friends, to rest or reflect, or engage in activities that are truly &quot;re-creating&quot; for us. We have no time to consider how our actions effect other people and the planet. The &quot;bug&quot; that keeps us moving at this feverish pace, vaporizing our relationships and our happiness, also heats up the planet and destroys the very systems that support life and provide joy in the first place. I think it's high time for a cure and personally, I am starting &quot;treatment&quot; immediately."},{"Title":"Affluenza : The All-Consuming Epidemic","review":"The book Affluenza tells the other side of the story, that media and politicians gloss over: there's an addictive virus running rampant in our society, evidenced by the debt we carry, the epidemic of depression and anxiety we're experiencing, the overworking we do just to make payments on huge houses, wardrobes, and vehicles.Our economy is like an all-you-can-eat cafeteria where the rules have been changed; we're now told we must keep eating, even though we're \\"stuffed\\" and feeling queasy. The economy is co-dependent on \\"consumer confidence\\" and gives its blessing to planned obsolescence, shoddy products, waste, species depletion, global warming, asthma, allergies and other environment-related \\"bads\\" that are a direct result of over-consumption. Each of these side effects pumps up the GDP, allowing us to believe that everything is great. The question is, what kind of world are we creating?Unlike the European economy, which emphasizes belonging, not just belongings -- and health, not just wealth -- the American economy is mesmerized and dominated by the constant, devastating flow of junk.Read this humorous, well-researched book for a mind-opening discussion of the symptoms as well as the cures! I look forward to hearing more from these talented authors, who courageously speak out against the flashfood of excess, neglect, and obliviousness that pervades our hyper culture."},{"Title":"Affluenza : The All-Consuming Epidemic","review":"What more can I say about this book that others haven't already said? It sure made me put things into perspective, and it helped me understand why America is the way it is today. One only needs to take a good look around to know that something is VERY wrong with us.Much of this problem has been caused by people always wanting to live beyond their means, no matter what their means are. We are (in the U.S.) very irresponsible with money. We have a low savings rate, despite our relatively high disposable income. Our credit cards are maxed out, we buy a new vehicle every 3 years, we live in mansions full of stuff we hardly ever use! I've got to have this. I need to have that. Isn't there more to life than just chasing that almighty dollar and trying to prove that we are \\"successful\\", whatever \\"successful\\" is supposed to mean in today's society? Isn't life really about more than what we can collect and how much we can get away with? In America, we are so self-centered and materialistic that we have become miserable! It seems that everyone wants a piece of the pie but no one has peace of mind. We're living in a world that is becoming increasingly hostile and where everyone is self-serving. Let's face it, tomorrow scares people. In other words, people have taken on a \\"live for today, to hell with tomorrow\\" attitude. As others have mentioned, we are SO materialistic, in so many ways. Our system creates a lot of wealth, but boy do we know how to squander it! Only in America would kids be killing kids over pairs of $100.00 sneakers that are actually produced in some foreign country by some kid working for pennies an hour. I've seen road rage with my own eyes. I've seen how frustrated and anxious people have become. The irony of this whole thing is so thick you can cut it with a ladle.Man's greatest tool is fear. We fear the unknown, the unseen, and therefore we look for ways to make ourselves feel good and pretend that nothing is wrong and all is well with the world. It's precisely that attitude that has put us in this mess in the first place. One of the ways we have dealt with these feelings is through materialism. We have fooled ourselves into believing that we have to keep up with the Joneses. The ultimate truth is that we MUST stop living like there is no tomorrow. We are using up Earth's natural resources faster than nature can replace them. Indeed, scientists are already sounding the alarm bells that our planet is starting to show signs of self-destructing! The authors have done us a great service by writing this book and making us stop and take a good look at ourselves. If we don't heed these warnings--and soon, then I'm afraid we are ALL going to pay a very high price for our greed and selfishness. The answer to all these problems lies with US. My biggest fear is that we may have waited to long to seriously address these issues. Perhaps we've already sealed our fate? Whatever the future brings, let us all hope for the best."},{"Title":"Affluenza : The All-Consuming Epidemic","review":"Since brevity is a virtue, I will keep it short. This book is a dead on accurate assesment of the costs of materialism. It is slightly Leftist in tone, but many Conservatives such as myself practice the pursuit of Voluntary Simplicity, so don't let any of that discourage you. Excessive materialism can drive you into debt, break up your family, ruin your life, and make you as unhappy and empty as any drug addiction. Read this book."},{"Title":"Affluenza : The All-Consuming Epidemic","review":"I just finished the book last night. I now have a better understanding of society, and indeed of the world around me. (and how everything now makes sense) Almost from the moment of birth, we are conditioned to believe a certain way. We are fed spoon after spoon that we MUST keep up with Jones' and keep chasing that almighty dollar and in turn, our pursuit of happiness and the \\"American Dream\\"...The authors go on to say how we are made to feel guilty if we ever stop in our pursuit of money and material things. We have become a society of WANT WANT WANT, at any financial and emotional cost. While we struggle with soaring consumer debt, outrageous interest rates, rising utility costs, astronomical education costs, we are constantly reminded that without these things, we are nothing. Basically, the message here is watch out for number 1! Make sure you have that mansion on the hill with a three-car garage and a mortgage up to your neck! Make sure you have at least three vehicles! Be certain to get a membership at the local golf and country club! BUY!BUY!BUY! Max out those $50,000 credit cards (at 28% interest), and don't forget to take the family to Disney World twice a year! It's no wonder that the youth of today has become so spoiled rotten. We have CONDITIONED them to believe from an early age that more is better. If little Johnny has a Nintendo, then you'd also better buy a Gamecube an X-Box and a PlayStation! If my neighboor just bought a boat, then I'd better buy a bigger one. If my co-worker takes a trip to Europe, then I'd better book a round-the-world cruise! Do you see what I'm getting at here?A recent survey stated that the average typical household now owes anywhere from $10 to $20,000 ALONE just in credit card debts. It's almost a paradox how our \\"money\\" isn't even real anymore, it's just a sea of numbers and credits on paper . The amount of personal debt that we owe exceeds what the Federal Reserve has in print! (Canadians too!). Personal bankruptcies are at an all time high, and university students often find themselves up in arms when they graduate, only to be stuck with thousands of dollars in tuition debt because they can't find that \\"dream job\\" that everyone promised them... It's funny how we want to be paid $50 an hour to stand around and do nothing, all the while expecting the education system to raise our kids and get them ready for the real world! And then we sit and wonder why the divorce rate is over 50%, why families are self-destructing, why it takes two people to work today, why we have so many health problems, and why we never appear to be happy, despite the fact that we seem to \\"have it all\\". The authors also examine how the capitalist mindset is behind this current epidemic, and how our mental and spiritual health has gone down the sewer because of it. The book also mentions the tragic impact this \\"throw-away\\" society is having on our environment-and our wallets. (yes it's true--most things are only made to last so long and basically self-destruct--it's called planned obsolescence - to keep us buying).Perhaps on some levels, part of this sickness has been caused by some insecurity on our part, or maybe it's simply because we, as humans, are inherently selfish in our desire to seek more and more. It's just like that old saying goes, the more we have, the more we want. With the holidays now behind us, I remember the conversation I had with my fellow workers about why Christmas has become such a commercialized circus. Well, the answer to that question is because we have MADE IT THAT WAY. Almost from the moment that Halloween is over, we are bombarded with Christmas commercials about the newest toys and latest gadgets, and how we MUST have these things as our lives might somehow be incomplete without them! I have a friend who moved here from India in 1987. He went on to tell that me that he has NEVER seen people so materialistic as the West. Our kids are rude and disrespectful, we are surrounded by angry, frustrated people who fly off the handle over the most trivial things, we have road-rage, store rage, people who cuss and swear with every word, etc. This is something I have noticed more and more within the last decade or so, and I would say that at least from my perspective, it IS getting worse with each passing year. (Just watch Judge Judy or Joe Brown if you don't believe me. Most of the lawsuits are brought on by stupid, self-righteous, greedy people).Inspite of our high standard of living, the many freedoms and luxuries we enjoy, we STILL have the nerve to complain and pursue more material possessions in our quest to feel good and be part of the \\"in crowd\\". It's almost disturbing that Christmas has become such a secular holiday controlled entirely by greedy merchants and the credit card companies, but it's also a sad testament to how far we, as humans, have fallen. Is there any hope for future generations, or are we all heading towards financial ruin and a global economic meltdown that only we brought on ourselves? I remember what my late grandfather always used to say: \\"If you can't afford to pay cash for something, then you're not meant to have it\\". Words of wisdom for this \\"me\\" generation...The recent falling dollar, combined with many other national and global crisis really makes you stop and wonder just where we are heading. You be the judge. Read the book and come to your own conclusions. Perhaps we all need to re-evaluate ourselves and our lives AND the very things we believe in. I think that in the end, we all need to stop and ask ourselves if this is all worth it, before it's too late. Our waters and skies are poisoned. Humanity is at war with itself, and we are spending ourselves into oblivion. All this just to keep up with the Jones'... Folks, life is too short and too precious. Live for today. Plan for tomorrow. Hope for the best, but be prepared for the worst."},{"Title":"Affluenza : The All-Consuming Epidemic","review":"Two things really get my goat when it comes to discussing social policy. The first is engaging in romanticized discussion about the golden days of yesteryear, and how much better everything was before now. Careful thought and study almost always proves this to be an illusion. The second is engaging in alarmist rhetoric about how we're going to hell in hand basket, and unless we make some dramatic changes immediately, the world will end any minute now. This book is guilty of both of these sins.The first (and longest) part of the book, \\"Symptoms,\\" is a 110 page laundry list of everything -- and I mean everything -- that is wrong with America. At first I was enjoying it and felt like I was learning something, but after about 50 pages, it really started to wear on me, to the point that I almost stopped reading. It would have helped if it was all relevant to the subject at hand, but a good portion of it wasn't. For instance, complaints about people going hungry in this land of plenty are compelling, and need to be made and listened to. But this problem has nothing to do with over-consumption. We could all cut our food consumption in half right now and it wouldn't do a thing to feed people who are going hungry. The problem isn't a shortage of food. It's our policies for how we deal with poor people. But the authors couldn't resist throwing that (and every other complaint that they have) into this book.But more problematic than that is the complete lack of balance on the authors' part. They refuse to acknowledge the very simple truism that every action has a cost AND a benefit. They only consider the costs of the actions that they don't like and the benefits of those that they do. The authors boldly stand for not cutting down forests, decreasing the amount of driving that we do, and recycling. For the record, I'm for all of that stuff too, and I think that there are a number of important policy changes we could make to encourage all of it. But don't talk about it as if it wouldn't involve sacrifice. I ride public transportation to work every day, and frankly, there's a lot about it that is a pain in the rear. I'm proud to do my part to decrease traffic congestion and pollution, but I think it's a huge mistake to talk about these things as though they're painless changes that everyone would make if they only thought about it a little bit. It's more complicated than that. The authors suggest that we should live close to work so that we don't have to drive, and that we should have a garden so that we can get in touch with the earth. Well in my neck of the woods, living close to work usually means renting a small apartment. To have a garden, I would have to move out to the suburbs, but then I'd have to drive to work. These are the types of decisions those of us in the real world are forced to make. Maybe this book is more indicative of the real problem with America: not untamed consumerism, but thinking we can have it all without sacrifice. Both environmentalists and pro-growthers are guilty of that.The reason this book gets 3 stars and not less is because it did provide a good jumping off point for further study. The authors' suggestions about rethinking how we calculate the GDP were thought provoking, and have sent me looking for further information. And like I said, the first 50 pages were fun. But maybe most importantly, it has encouraged me to take individual action (despite the fact that the authors say that this won't be enough, which I hope they're wrong about). Since finishing the book, I have investigated my local recycling program and am now a proud participant. It remains to be seen whether I can cut my consumption."},{"Title":"Affluenza : The All-Consuming Epidemic","review":"This was a great book that I found most informative and fun to read. The holidays are almost over, and I'm sure the wailing and gnashing of teeth isn't too far away as the post-Christmas bills start rolling in. I know of people within my own family who racked up nearly $1000 on their credit cards this year. I wasn't one of them, but I'm still guilty in that I also charged some of my purchases, but nowhere near that obscene amount. I read one of the previous reviews, posted back about a year ago, which stated that we have more debt than there is money in print. I totally believe that statement. Almost every purchase I seen this holiday season was made with a debit or credit card!I also found some of the information frightening. Like the serious pollution affecting our lakes and waterways, and the amount of garbage that normal American households toss out EVERY SINGLE DAY. I saw this myself with the amount of garbage bags sitting out at the curbside this morning! Basically, we all need to settle down a little bit and do some serious thinking here. We are killing ourselves with this virus-a virus that is plaguing the majority of Americans today, be it rich, poor or middle-class. Find out what we can do and how we can make a difference, right now, before it's too late. I know I have to make changes myself. I need to examine what's important to me and change my daily habits, for I am also guilty of some of the things contained herein. A most fun and informative read, yet also a stark warning and sharp reminder of what's going to happen to us and our world if we don't start taking care of it. Kudos to the author(s)."},{"Title":"Affluenza : The All-Consuming Epidemic","review":"To consume: to exhaust, to pillage, to lay waste, to destroy. This is how Samuel Johnson defined the word so many years ago in his dictionary. And here we are - a nation of the most \\"consuming\\" people in the world. The government, the corporations, the advertisers and the media seldom even bother to call us \\"citizens\\" anymore. We are now just \\"consumers\\".And all of our purchases have made us the happiest people on earth, right?This book addresses the symptoms, the causes and the treatment for AFFLUENZA - a \\"disease\\" resulting from overconsumption. It takes a good, hard look at what our addiction to \\"things\\" is doing to our lives and the lives of our families; to our culture and our communities, and to our planet. The authors provide some good suggestions at the end of the book for overcoming AFFLUENZA - or if not overcoming - at least for beginning the process of healing. Some ideas such as simplifying our lifestyles and starting community groups to share ideas and assist one another are within our reach. Other ideas though, such as flexible work reduction and work sharing, while honorable goals will take more time. When people are working two or three jobs just to survive, and under the current political leadership, the dream of more leisure time is still a long way off.There is a lot to this book. It could change your life. I should also add that I enjoyed the illustrations by David Horsey."},{"Title":"Affluenza : The All-Consuming Epidemic","review":"This book was very eye opening! The author really explains how advertisers pull in their consumers, and why we always feel the need to buy stuff. This book also asks us: is the stuff we buy really what makes us happy? Is it helping our environment as well? This book really made me think about how wasteful I am, and I recommend this book to anybody and everybody!!"},{"Title":"Affluenza : The All-Consuming Epidemic","review":"WOW! After reading all these other reviews, and finally purchasing the book for myself, I couldn't help but agree with what most of the other readers said. It truly was a fun and interesting book, but it was also a soul-searching account and sad testament on how our pursuit of money and the \\"American Dream\\" has destroyed us as a society and as individuals.There is one theme that kept repeating itself throughout the book, and it's the fact that we have become so materialistic and greedy that we are destroying ourselves, and our planet, in the process. I've never witnessed a generation so selfish, greedy, egocentric, self-centered, and concerned only about material things such as this one. I remember growing up on a farm in rural Oklahoma and learning to appreciate the simple things in life and the beauty of nature. We were happy and content with what was ours, and we didn't want what someone else had. Families were strong and united, neighbors helped one another out, kids respected their parents and authority figures, and the times were simpler back then. Skip ahead 30 years to the present... What a different world we live in today. Boy how times have changed! Everything is a mad rush. We're living in an age where technology is surpassing human knowledge. Over 2 BILLION people now own cell phones. People feel angry, frustrated, unfulfilled and burnt-out from the mundane routine of daily living and the endless pursuit of more and more \\"stuff\\". Our wallets and purses are full of credit and charge cards, but our savings rate is at its lowest point in history. Kids nowadays are out of control little brats. The \\"F\\" word is now one of the most popular words in our vocabulary. The average size of a family home has gone from 1500 square feet to well over 3500 and even 10000 square feet! We just don't want a simple house anymore, we want a four-story McMansion with a three-car garage! Gone are the simple station wagons and family cars we all remember, replaced with gas-guzzling SUV's and luxury sedans outfitted with DVD players, customized seats, GPS systems, and whatever else your little heart desires. The kids today have more stuff than most of us ever dreamed of at their age. Most parents now work full time and are usually out the door before little Johnny and Suzie even wake-up. Nutritious, wholesome meals have now been replaced with instant junkfood, McDonald's, etc, etc, etc. And we keep asking ourselves what is wrong with our country today, when the answer has been staring us in straight in the face for the past 3 decades or so. I have never seen such a decadent and morally bankrupt society such as this.The authors have done a great job putting all these things into perspective, and reminding us of just how far down the sewer this country has gone. Just take a simple stroll around the block and notice these changes for yourself. Neighbors hardly communicate anymore. Families are strangers in their own homes. Old friends seldomly call (except when they want something), common courtesy and couth has all but vanished from our society, and we absolutely MUST keep up with the Joneses at any cost. People today are so wrapped up in their own lives and affairs that we simply don't have time to enjoy each other's company anymore. It's all about $$$. Our national and personal debt loads are skyrocketing to levels unseen since the great crash of 1929. We face a coming financial crisis, perhaps even economic disaster. Our current account deficit is more than $600 billion annually. Our foreign debt is more than $3 trillion. Foreigners now own over $1.4 trillion of our Treasury and mortgage debt. Credit card debt is in the billions. We must borrow $3 billion from foreigners every business day just to maintain our extravagant spending. Our national debt now is increasing $600 billion per year, and guess what? The federal reserve must print over $600 billion per year just to keep this charade going! And of course we're all familiar with the current oil/gas situation. But there is a limit to all this, and I'm fearful that we're fast approaching it. Everyone wants a piece of the \\"American Dream\\", but I'm afraid the dream isn't there anymore. You always fall more than you climb. The gap between the \\"haves\\" and the \\"have nots\\" is becoming increasingly wider with each passing year. There's no common ground or sitting on the fence anymore, you're either on one side of that line or the other. Is it any wonder why the middle-class is collapsing under mounting debt and the soaring cost of living? This book explains why.So, where do we begin? That's a good question, and the authors do offer some tips and advice on how we can become a little more prudent and careful in our daily lives. As for myself, I sold my house in the city and moved to the country, and back to my youth where I remember how much saner and easier life was back then. I planted my own garden and produce much of my own food. I drive a 1991 Ford Aerostar, which is still in good condition and serving me well. I live in a modest home, complete with everything I need, no crystal chandeliers or 65\\" tv sets. I enjoy the sounds of nature and serenity, no honking horns, screaming, profane people, sirens, and all that other madness that comes with daily city life, and you know what folks? I've never been happier. I quit my job earning nearly a six-figure income after realizing that it wasn't worth the toll on my physical and mental health, nor was it fair to my wife and 3 children. My kids are taught respect and manners and to love nature and mother earth. Personally, I feel that America is at a crossroads. We obviously can't continue down this path of self-destruction. However, at the same time, we are also painfully aware that the ways of the past no longer apply to our greedy, capitalist, materialistic system. A system that unfairly caters to the wealthy few over the working many. Conditions keep deteriorating year after year. More and more people are having to file for bankruptcy as a way out of this tragic mess, a mess that only we ourselves helped to create! It is time for an alternative to the rat race. The starting point for this alternative must be that we, as a nation and society, create our own solutions to the problems facing America, both in the present and in the future. After all, we really only need food on the table, a decent house, a secure job, universal health care for all, and the right to get a decent education. It is based on the idea that all people need to have a decent job available to them, so they can produce sufficient goods and services to earn a decent living. It is based on challenging the control and ownership of the top 500 corporations who dominate the economy, and putting power and control back into the hands of the common man and the ordinary, hard working \\"little people\\". It truly is a mad world out there, and I'm so glad that I escaped the city while I still had a shred of sanity left. EVERYONE should read this book, or at least some of it, and see just how much of its contents ring true for them. This book should have made the New York Times bestseller list, and I commend the authors for a job well done. Keep up the good work. Can we expect a sequel? Thanks again!Dennis In Utah"},{"Title":"Affluenza : The All-Consuming Epidemic","review":"He who dies with the most toys doesn't necessarily win... Money can't buy happiness... Americans are carefully manipulated by the stuff-producing powers-that-be to patriotically assume our unflattering role as gluttonous junk pigs...These core messages resonate clearly throughout this wonderful book, leading readers down a road well-signed with relevant quotes, pertinent examples, and directions to countless invaluable references. This book encourages you to be appalled with our obsessive drive for more, while simultaneously forcing introspection.In this manner, Affluenza has helped to facilitate more critical scrutiny of my own personal wants and needs. It has me looking at the crap in my house in a bright, new light. While I have always considered myself an environmentalist (recycling everything, trying to minimize driving, etc.), this book has encouraged me to be more aware of my own frivolous consumption patterns, and to rebel against the external forces out there that are working overtime to ensure that I consume as much plastic, gas, hardwood, and fast-food as possible.Two thumbs up."},{"Title":"Affluenza : The All-Consuming Epidemic","review":"Everyone should read this book. It is a perfect blend of social observations and commentary, supported by carefully researched and often alarming facts about the extraordinary level of unnecessary consumption and waste our society generates, as well as the widespread global consequences of our taken-for-granted daily activities. Although the message is serious, it is made palateable by the authors' keen sense of humor and irony. The book is ultimately a success becuase of the underlying message that it is not too late for us to recover. This book first opens your eyes, and then, as you discover that it resonates deeply with your own experiences, it motivates you to take a good hard look at the way things are and start making changes. The perspective on life offered by this book is profound, and the lessons on ecological protection and social sanity are something we should all embrace. I hope that you read this book, let it impact your life, and then share it with everyone you know!"},{"Title":"Affluenza : The All-Consuming Epidemic","review":"I enjoyed reading this book quite a bit, but I was saddened to see just how materialistic American society has become. The average American household carries over $7000 in credit card debt. My question is \\"What the HECK are they buying and WHY do they need itso badly that they would go into debt for it?\\" I was brought up to only buy things you need and can afford - what was everyone else teaching their children? Money doesn't buy happiness, but the average person doesn't seem to know that. Or, if they do, they don't know quite how to stop the rampant consumerism from ruling their lives. I didn't realize exactly how much of a burden our consumer society is on the planet until I read this book. The authors did a fabulous job of exposing the facts about our economic conditions while making the book entertaining at the same time. There's even a quiz to help you see how badly you are infected with the Affluenza bug. A great read, especially if you borrow it from the library!"},{"Title":"Affluenza : The All-Consuming Epidemic","review":"We live in an age that is hyper-commercialized, the age of Affluenza. Everything seems to be for sale these days and we are encouraged to consume more and more. The corporate message is that if we stop consuming, the economy will come to a standstill, and our lives as we know them will be ruined. Therefore, you have to &quot;shop till you drop.&quot; The end-result is that people are working longer and longer hours in order to maintain a bloated lifestyle that is essentially devoid of any meaning. Our involvement in civic affairs and community acitivities is almost non-exisitent because of this consumer culture. But things don't have to be this way, and many people are indeed escaping this mode of life. In this book you will learn how to determine if you suffer from affluenza and it will show you how you can treat this &quot;illness.&quot; The book is divided into three parts: a) symptoms of affluenza, b) causes, and c) treatment. The book is clear and well written. The text is interspersed with very cunning cartoons by David Horsey. I definitely recommend this book if you suspect you are suffering from affluenza or even if you are not."},{"Title":"Affluenza : The All-Consuming Epidemic","review":"Affluenza is a necessary book and a valuable introduction to some of the perils of our consumer driven capitalist society. They treat consumption as a disease and the books chapter looks at symptoms like &quot;shopping fever&quot;, &quot;rash of bankrupticies&quot; and the &quot;addictive virus&quot;. The book is very accessible and is designed, like the documentary its based on, for a very wide audience. Consumption is dangerous, deadening, and ultimately destructive for our society and the first half of the book details its dangerous effects. Their is a strong focus on environmental consequences, but they also detail how consumption is taught to our children and how it has become a spiritual drain on most Americans.The second portion of the book is a very brief discussion on causes of affluenza and how it grew in the roaring 20s, the prosperous 50s and became an epidemic under Reagan and then supported by formerly green democrats like Gore. This was helpful for me, but they could have gone into greater depth on the psychology of affluenza and for me income inequality deserved greater emphasis. A major blindspot was ignoring how the art of black Americans, a major barometer of the underclass, has gone from the church and socially critical messages of What's Going On to the consumption driven music of Jay Z, Puffy and much of current rap music.The last portion of the book quickly goes through cures for affluenza and while I found some of the suggestions beneficial on a personal level, the proposed cures seemed utopian and heavily biased towards Seattle quasi Utopian communities. I was left very unclear how an urban community in Washington, DC would apply some of the philosophies of this book on a local level.The tone of the authors is a mixed blessing. On the one hand, they right in readable prose and they intersperse the text with political cartoons for emphasis of points. I showed these to my grandmother and she found these hilarious. On the other hand, they often use a sledgehammer to drive home a point where a soft point will do. They will assume some of their conclusions at timew without fully backing them up.Here's an example [p153] &quot;Remember how the communists were going to destroy the businesses in our town. They didn't, but dot communists might (led by DotComGuy, dot communism's answer to Che Gurevara). Consider your local bookstore. Can it fend off an Amazon? Where is Joe McCarthy now that we really need him? Where is the John Birch Society now that we need it?&quot;Okay, I get your point we need more local business. But is this the best target and is this the best tone to promote dialogue? Ultimately if you want to get things done, you have to have a message that will build consensus between those that do not share your view. I can deal with attacking big business, but many of the dot coms blasted in this attack here are the same multimillionaires they praise later in the book for being more enlighted philanthropists than many of the past elites.I find the book's message helpful, but I will look for even more texts that allow me to convince the unconvinced and dig more deeply into this problem.3.5 starsgood idea could have been better executed"},{"Title":"Affluenza : The All-Consuming Epidemic","review":"Affluenza starts out great, with a powerful message to all of us about becoming more aware of our personal consumption. From new cars to new appliances to new clothing, it is the goal of Marketing to make us feel less than zero if we do not obtain these all-important items. It's funny how the phrase \\"Keeping Up With The Jones's\\" appeared right around the time of Television, when the Marketing industry realized they could reach right into our very living rooms and tickle our \\"Gotta-Have-It\\" bone.Never have corporations been richer or greedier, and never has the emotional health of our nation been poorer. We work harder and longer for less and less pay while striving to find happiness in an empty purchase. And the busier we become, the less time we take to stop and realize we are working ourselves to death for things We Don't Need.Affluenza points out the many scars this condition has left on America, from overflowing landfills and polluted waterways to the breakdown of our moral values and even obesity. And yes, the authors do tie this all in together very well.What I didn't like about Affluenza was that it lost steam about halfway through. After setting off the sirens in my head about this condition, it offered little or no real solution. Not once in the book do the authors even tell us \\"Turn off your TV\\", much less \\"Throw it out\\". It was rather like being spanked and then told to go take a bath and forget about it.The solutions were \\"large\\", like reducing work hours in America, which we all know needs to be done, but the authors leave it there. They don't talk about how \\"average Joe\\" is to go about fixing this problem, like writing to their legislatures or specific organizations to get in touch with.All in all, Affluenza is a good Wake-Up book, but needed to spend more effort on what we can do to inoculate ourselves from this \\"consumptive\\" disease. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Affluenza : The All-Consuming Epidemic","review":"Written in connection with a two part PBS series with the same name, Affluenza documents the falling into, and recovering from, consumerism. On the way it documents the effect of this state relating to the environment, the human psyche and relationships with family and others.It walks us through, step by step, how we are trained to be consumers. All the targeting of children with cold-hearted and violent advertisements, all the lures and come-ons pouring from the media, all the 'scientific discoveries' between psychology and marketing, and all the 'free money' ploys around credit cards. After 10-20 years of this it's so hard not to go with the game, especially when so many others around us do the same. If I was born and raised in the USA, I would be long lost to all that.But this book also shows a wide set of tools to help us swim against the flow. I have gotten all the information I need on how to withdraw my support from the all-overtaking megacorps, how to stand my ground nonmanipulated, and most importantly how to spend my time living my live instead of owned by my things. And this leads to free time, to personal power to figure out and follow my mission and to political power to make this a better place through making my voice heard.All that left is walking the talk. And Affluenza, thoroughly researched (and on the border of being occasionally repetitive, can provide part of the hammering-in it takes to change a habit, the habit of buying (and 'saving') instead of not spending and simplifying.

It will get you to think differently about a lot of things.Consumerism is out of control and if we don't get a handle on things, who knows what will happen? Of course, that's funny saying that while on an online seller's site, huh? But, if you're going to buy something, buy books like \\"Affluenza\\" or \\"Why?\\" by Phil Nery.

It exposes the marketing frenzy that drives the consumer socitey as nothing more than an than a vicious cycle of continuing to make good people feel inadequate in an effort to compel you to buy more, more, more.Consumerism is just like any other addiction that requires self-realization as a prerrequisite to being cured. Our society will be better served by people thinking on their own instead of listening to the media, politician, or any other possibly biased source that may not have a vested stake in your best interest.

Affluena does a beautiful job of naming the causes of the discomfort being felt in so many people's lifes in the U.S. The good news is it doesn't just say, You have a fatal illness and there's nothing that can be done for you. Instead, it offers simple guidelines for reprioritizing to redirect us to deeper meaning and fulfillment. This book gives a sense of hope and connection to those who may have felt alone in their emptiness. It seems like a great opportunity to form discussion groups, which also just happen to create more of a sense of community, while revisting long-held values that have been forfeited in our materialistic frenzy."},{"Title":"Affluenza : The All-Consuming Epidemic","review":"Basically an interesting, revealing if not alarming book, with loads of data, some striking graphs, and several silly cartoons. The authors have a \\"bullet point\\" approach to the topic, with short chapters (30 chapters in 247 pages) and multiple headings within each chapter. The data themselves are quite compelling, even if the writing style is not.And there are three non-trivial significant problems in the analysis.In their fifty-item affluenza self-diagnosis test, they perhaps inadvertently mix in wealth creation and savings priorities and activities with consumption, when they cite concern over one's financial investments (#17) and goals (#43) as signs of consumption. That's just wrong. The book would benefit from more attention to the creation of wealth and its effective use instead of a heavy-handed, almost singular chastisement of consumption. At least the authors acknowledge that time, comfort and happiness are forms of wealth, that wealth is not just all of a person's accumulated, tangible stuff. And they don't write much, as I recall, about spiritual wealth. But saving for financial goals by monitoring one's investments are counter-consumption.The use a misleading graph (Chapter 20, p. 167), where they use 280 parts per million (ppm) of carbon dioxide as the baseline or horizontal axis, greatly overstates the climb of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from 280 to 380 ppm in the past 200 years. Worse, they use the year 1000 as the vertical axis, cutting off a not insignificant portion of the baseline. This is the same deceptive, biased practice the authors accuse the advertising industry of using. There was no need to exaggerate and there are significant points lost for doing so.The \\"answers\\" devolve into traditional liberal solutions: more maternity leave, more sick days, more vacation, more day care, higher taxes on wealth creation, and universal health care. A carbon tax is not a bad idea, but why stop there? Why not tax all forms of foolish consumption? And why tax people for making money? In fact, American spends almost as much of its GDP on public health as do the countries with \\"free\\" public health. In fact, America's obsession with and expenditure on health care is a sign of attention to the things the authors laud: person well being and comfort. And, as introduced above, we need to improve our wealth creation and, contrary to what the authors recommend, the use of \\"uncommercials\\" is not much of a solution. Let's not leave the solution to the same medium that accelerated us down this path."},{"Title":"Affluenza : The All-Consuming Epidemic","review":"Affluenza is a smart and witty book that allows every reader to authenticate why they feel guilty and make other people around them feel bad with fun facts such as, &quot;More people are filing for bankruptcy each year than graduate from college.&quot; YAY!

What could be a useful guide to a less-stressful, more nature-loving lifestyle becomes the same shrill USA-destroyed-the-planet chant. The economics quoted are bogus, they lack realistic historical perspective, and they make crazy generalizations about US society in the context of the planet.First of all, we are not [ending life by] over-consumption. The number one killer in the world is starvation. The number one US societal problem is poverty, not my neighbor's SUV. Second, the US is not responsible for all the ills of the third world. Third world people would not live in idyllic Edens had we not persuaded them to farm our raw materials and glue our sneakers. They may have had pollution-free hammocks by the ocean, but they would still have had a miserable, diseased life expectancy of only 30 years.You see, what this book fails to point out is that while yes, we have polluted and eroded and junked up much of the planet, those were costs incurred so that we get to live to age 72 instead of 30. Because we have fast cars and designer medicines and [sterile] food we survive. People without those things still [end life] in childbirth or from the excrement in their lettuce. So yes, the way we [end life] today may be due more to pollutants, and that's a really good way to scare up support for technophobia, but we live twice as long before succumbing. So be afraid of cancer agents in the environment, but don't discard the benefits of our modern lifestyle as a result.Here's the contradiction: wealth is relative. I benefit from simple living because my neighbor doesn't. Because, if he lives simpler than me, I'm still the greater resource-hog. So while this book and others are extremely useful at getting you to lay off the credit card, their primary flaw is in evangelizing the rest of the US to do so too.And, if they don't comply with voluntary simplicity on their own, why lets...LEGISLATE IT!! YES!!...You won't stop buying SUV's? Well, we'll tax ... you! Want a greener lawn? Let's tax that bad boy too! Yes, your government, ..., will fix this! The book states that government regulation is a totally pain-free means to achieve green objectives! Tip to the authors... hire an economist! Someone with more energy than me could go to the chapters on the \\"cures\\" and tabulate how many times the words \\"should\\" and \\"tax\\" come up.Do you get it?

The bottom line here is the author does not emphasize is lack of financial responsibility, overspending, and impulsiveness. He makes no suggestions about learning skills, hobbies or spirituality. The book pushes Environazism and villianizes America. Big Government is not always the answer! Overall, it is a good book but has some severe shortcomings. For one, the cliche'd eco-environmentalism here is sickening. I totally disagree with the author forcing non-nature lovers to believe nature is the cure for ALL society's ills. He rants about SUV's, ATV's, Motor Boats, and anything related to internal combustion engines...(smells like a dirty hippie commune leader to me!) I am a consumer/citizen who does not live by the credit card, show off in a luxury SUV, supersize everything, or hang out in megamalls but nonetheless, I have other things that interest me more than tree-hugging-IE: Family, Friends, Golf, Skiing, Playing Music, Model Railroading, Camping, Traveling, Spirituallity, Volunteer Work, and Computers. I am almost never in the stores except here at Amazon. The latter chapters of this book is nothing short of leftist rant and rhetoric about internal combustion engines, American dieting, the big evil corporations, the selfish Republicans, the environment and pollution. These chapters are moot, redundant and boring. Keep that in mind when you buy this book. I had read 2/3rds of it."},{"Title":"Affluenza : The All-Consuming Epidemic","review":"The short story:IF you're looking for a good overview to the modern leftist set of ideals, this is it. It's a great introduction to the entire way of thinking.IF you are NOT new to the Simple Living / Natural Living / Slow Food... don't bother reading this book.The long story:I was looking forward to reading this, because it was recommended to me by just about every hardcore liberal / leftist \\"educated\\" type I know. Unfortunately, I can't say it really delivers.Even in the first chapter / section, the authors say that there will be no new information presented -- just linkages to the information that is already there. So I tried to keep that in mind as I read it.Ultimately, this book really does come off as just a bunch of preachy propaganda. This might be a good book for people who are new to the idea of natural living, or are still relatively unfamiliar with the lifestyle choices that one needs to make to Live Simply... but for someone who already lives as earth-friendly a life as they can, who is already socially aware and connected to their community and their family -- this book is useless.Further, there is some blatant twisting of information, simply to suit the authors' agenda. An example of this is when the authors say that the video game industry is making ads about killing cats that are aimed at children; but they're NOT. The authors mention that one woman was letting her 8 year old son read a video gaming magazine *intended for teens and adults* and after the son saw an ad about killing cats, he felt disturbed. They tried to use it as an example of the media targeting children... but they should have left the entire story out, because it's irrelevant. The magazine they named isn't aimed at 8 year olds. There are numerous other places in the book where the authors twist information simply to suit their own biases.I'm disappointed."},{"Title":"Affluenza : The All-Consuming Epidemic","review":"unfortuanately if you are this interested in this book, you are the choir. and its sermon is long and reads like a broken record. we get that you stole a clever title &quot;affluenza&quot; and made it into a book. every other word is some sort of reference back to that idea. it is like ADD in book format. clever titles aside, this book is full of unsupported facts that wreak of seemingly skewed information and is full of ideas you already belive in (malls suck, american personal debt is out of control thanks to credit cards, and SUVs are inefficient). this book reads like an extended college paper - a long long list of vague facts that all center around the idea that we're focused too much on money and products, but never present a clear message.i swear this book is written on a 6th grade reading level - with simple soundbyte facts, a repetitve overall analogy to the point where i feel dumbed down every time i see the thromometer at each neew chapter, and a general lack of depth further than any cursory internet search would yield.they say the book is always better than the movie. well this book proves that a book based on a TV show is exponentially worse."},{"Title":"Affluenza : The All-Consuming Epidemic","review":"I dont know how many times I have read this same book: It rehashes the same old stale arguments heard over and over. The material world is bad, spending is bad, consumption is bad... yap yap yappity yap.Nobody denies that there is something wrong with our economy and culture, and we need to fix that, but the boring and unoriginal rant that Simon offers does nothing for our understanding of the dynamics or nature of consumerism.In the end, this book is nothing but a empty status symbol for the kind of consumerist yuppies that Simon seems to abhor. If you want to show people that you are a concerned pseudo-intellectual, who is all concerned about the future of our planet and society, you buy this book and have it lying around your house.What a load of pretentious crap."},{"Title":"Affluenza : The All-Consuming Epidemic","review":"Please, let me know if I should continue to wait for the book, or just order it else where. Thank you."},{"Title":"Affluenza : The All-Consuming Epidemic","review":"Maybe I'm just too far right on the political spectrum to continue reading this book, but the alarm bells started ringing when the author said this book appealed to all political persuasions.I brushed it off and continued reading. My interpretation of the author's premise that we are going to consume so much that we are going to strip the earth bare if we don't stop was this book was an indictment of our capitalist system and our insatiable desire to consume everything in sight.There is zero consideration given to the concept of economic productivity: doing more with the same or less and/or it costing less to do. To wit: cars on average have become more fuel efficient; loggers have developed computer programs and special blades to get more wood from the same tree; computer spreadsheets have allowed people to perform thousands of calculations in a second...this core idea of economic progress in my mind renders ineffective the authors essentially Luddite view of the world we live in.Is rampant consumerism a problem in this country? You bet. Do Americans buy crap they don't need? Yes. Are Americans wasteful? Yes. Are Americans financially worse off in terms of bankruptcy? Generally, yes.Does that mean we need to cut the workweek? Stop eating red meat? Sounds like a socialist/environmentalist agenda to me."},{"Title":"Affluenza : The All-Consuming Epidemic","review":"This book has truly changed my life. I was aware of the &quot;virus&quot; but never really stopped to think about it. Like many other Americans, I just let myself become infected. But after reading this book, I feel much better. The &quot;fever&quot; for consuming is quickly going away. This year, I'll think before I buy. (And maybe I'll decide not to buy!)"},{"Title":"Affluenza : The All-Consuming Epidemic","review":"In this engaging, fast-paced and witty book, the authors examen the complex problem of over-consumption and spending in American culture. \\"Affluenza\\" proposes a clear and convincing alternate lifestyle; one that makes better sense and is, ultimately, more responsible."},{"Title":"Affluenza : The All-Consuming Epidemic","review":"Affluenza is really an inspiring book. It makes you look at the emptiness of American over-consumption and find alternative solutions to finding a more fulfilling life. Thinking about the effects of overconsumption not only on the psyches of the American people, but also upon the environment, social policies and our future, this book advocates lifestyle changes that would be beneficial and set an excellent example for future generations. Buying your children every piece of plastic known to man won't make them happy. Neither will a closet full of Jimmy Choos make you happy. Spending time with your family, enjoying nature and helping people are much more rewarding and fulfilling. The authors of this book are right on the nose."},{"Title":"Affluenza : The All-Consuming Epidemic","review":"Keeping up with the Jones' is a dangerous game!I read this book about a year ago and went back to it after reading &quot;The Two Income Trap&quot; by Warren &amp; Tyagi.Affluenza is a book to be taken seriously... Why do we have to have a 100inch television when the old 27inch-er works just fine? Why do we need a 3,500 square foot McMansion in middle-class suburbia when a 1,500 square foot house will provide adequate shelter for our family? It is a sickness, and easy credit helps fuel desire to catch it.Would we really buy all this &quot;STUFF&quot; if stores only accepted cold hard cash?The authors also bring up another great point. What is all this consuming doing to the environment? More &quot;stuff&quot; requires more resources. And since &quot;stuff&quot; doesn't last forever, it has to be thrown away somewhere. Where is all of it going?So in conclusion, I think the book gives us more to think about than why are we all trying to buy big screen TVs and gas guzzling SUVs... What is it doing to our water, land, air and trees?"},{"Title":"Affluenza : The All-Consuming Epidemic","review":"The purpose of this book is to heighten awareness about consumerism and ultimately bring about dramatic change in our society. The audience is primarily Americans, though the book has been well received in several foreign countries. De Graaf and his associates present powerful evidence from a wide collection of sources. Their argument is persuasive and well documented. They address environmental, social, financial, spiritual, physical and mental indicators of health in our society. Affluenza has made me more aware of how I spend my money, time and intellectual effort by highlighting some of our societies weaknesses. I enjoyed reading the book because it made me question some of my practices. The authors throw down the gauntlet by challenging many \\"American principles.\\" Overall, the argument is sound and effective, if a bit dramatic at times. A copy of should come free with every new BMW, satellite TV dish and MBA degree. America needs it."},{"Title":"Affluenza : The All-Consuming Epidemic","review":"As a high school teacher, I am daily amazed (and disgusted) at the materialism that our young people see as their inherent right - the nicest of everything regardless of the cost. Obviously, many adults are just as blind as our young people, which is why we need to get them while they're young. I can see myself using this book in my classes and hopefully making a few people think about the causes and effects of our world. I'm sure many teens (most of whom avoid books like kryptonite) would actually be enthralled to learn what goes on behind the political rhetoric and slick ads they are bombarded with. It mystifies me why this book is currently NOT available here. If there's a timelier book that people should be able to access, it's this one!"},{"Title":"Affluenza : The All-Consuming Epidemic","review":"I won't bother to repeat the rave reviews, but suffice it to say that this book led me to read others including &quot;Your Money or Your Life&quot; and &quot;Natural Capitalism&quot;. Additionally, I have decided to leave my cushy job in the auto industry to go back to school to study more sustainable and sane means of transportation. I ask many people close to me to take a look at this book; if nothing else, I hope it opens their eyes and makes them more aware of their everyday actions."},{"Title":"Affluenza : The All-Consuming Epidemic","review":"Affluenza is defined on the back cover of this book as \\"n. a painful, contagious, socially transmitted condition of overload, debt, anxiety, and waste resulting from the dogged pursuit of more.When I first read this definition, I cheered such a brilliant diagnosis of our culture. However, the overall tone of this book moves beyond the inspirational to scare tactics which is a shame. An extremist perspective of America taints the overall theme of the book and hinders the author's rationale. Had this not been prevalent, the book would get an easy A+ from me. Frightening statistics are spewed in the readers face and, though hilarious in places, a very dark portrait of the average American is mercilessly painted. As an American, I, for one, am tired of this approach.What rants such as these tend to leave out are the incredible improvements that we have made as a culture in the last 100 years. A prime example is the respect for the environment. First Lady Bird Johnson introduced a radical new idea fifty years ago - trash cans. Books like Affluenza forget to tell you that NO ONE put trash in a can fifty years ago - they threw it into the median on the road from their moving vehicles. There was no grass - no wildflowers, just piles of broken bottles, old tires, paper bags, magazines, you name it, piled high between every stretch of highway from the east to west coast. Our children now know what flowers and grass look like. Landscaping is the new hobby in America and Americans are caring for their yards and creating gardens like never before.And as for charity and community involvement, just last year a study on CNN showed that more young people are involved in community service than they have been in decades. On top of that, they are one of the most spiritually aware generations of our century. They have grown up with more respect for all peoples than any other group of people in our world's history and have proven it by living what we dreamers have idealized for years.Affluenza is definitely an issue in our country - but it is not purely American. Anyone who has studied history for ten minutes can tell you that it is a human pattern in any society that prospers. For those that think America is the most materialist and wasteful culture that ever lived, read about Rome, Nazi Germany, Victorian England, Ancient Persia and Egypt, and many more whose atrocities have surpassed us by light years. Affluenza is not limited to Americans. And for those who consider people who throw away a soda can as being worse than those modern countries who throw away their children for not being anatomically correct, I have to say that their philosophies concerning the good life are skewered.Materialism is dangerous - as is anything that humans maniacally clutch in order to fill a spiritual void. But we shouldn't let a good point be turned into another effort to portray this miraculous country as a dark, predatory monster. Authors and sociological commentators should beware of sounding like a parent who is unhappy with their child no matter how far they progress or improve. America is certainly not perfect - I mean, people live here. Wherever people live flaws and disputes will exist. But we should not forget in our attempts to better ourselves and our planet how far we have already come.Read Affluenza. There is wisdom here to be absorbed. But be cautious of extreme views that leave one twice as depressed as credit card debt. Remember, Affluenza is a HUMAN symptom not just an AMERICAN one - and its' as old as the sun. And, in the spirit of the book - save a tree. Go find it at your local library or borrow a copy from a friend."},{"Title":"Affluenza : The All-Consuming Epidemic","review":"Let's be honest. Most of us would prefer to blame almost anyone else for the planet's problems. Of course we're aware of all the issues and we do our part - recycling or whatever but we don't really do all we could. Reading this book is dangerous to our complacency. We can't really read it without seeing ourselves and wincing. There are so many examples and statistics that everyone will be caught in some way. Most of us have a bit of the Afluenza bug, even if we don't have the full blown disease. What I particually liked is that authors' sly use of humor and cartoons to poke at us. My one suggestion is that they consider the whole issue of how many of us spend so much of our disposable income on services and experiences instead of goods. Perhaps another book?"},{"Title":"Affluenza : The All-Consuming Epidemic","review":"Affluenza is an enlightening and accurate description of America's tired, wasteful, and negligent ways. While I was reading the book, I discovered that although I am not in the worst of conditions, I do suffer from Affluenza. It is so easy to get caught up in the cycle of debt and consumerism when we live in a society that promotes materialism and an unhealthy work ethic, while ignoring spirituality and values. On the brighter side, the book offers suggestions for a more ecologically-friendly society, one that values the benefits of leisure time and respects nature. If you feel as if your possessions are beginning to possess you, read this book at once! Treat the symptoms of Affluenza before you are permanently diseased!"},{"Title":"Affluenza : The All-Consuming Epidemic","review":"It's hard sometimes to live a simple life surrounded by &quot;affluenza&quot; and its effects. So for me, the book &quot;Affluenza&quot; has been really helpful in reminding me what's important in my life - it's not the &quot;stuff.&quot; It's my life that I value. It's not all that's advertised to make me hungry for what I don't want. It's remembering what I do want in my life, and prioritizing that above those tantalizing baubles that are offered over and over again to deplete my bank account - to put me in debt - to put me in slavery to my possessions.So, thank the authors for writing this important book that reminds me again and again who I am and why I have chosen to step back from all the glitter and acquisition. It reminds me why I work a 30 hour week, instead of a 40 hour week, and why I even hope to pare that down to a 25 hour week - so that the rest of my time can be spent on my life!I like it that &quot;Affluenza&quot; isn't preachy or grim. It's light and humorous. It's fast-paced, like a television program - only without commercials. It's stock full of information about how we got to this place where money and things outweigh time with our families and time volunteering to make our communities stronger. And it gives examples and ideas about how to move forward into a place where each of us can get out of debt, and shift our priorities to what we truly value in this life that we only get to live one time.David Horsey's cartoons are right on the money. They're witty and apt. The writing is visual and well-paced. Can you tell - I like this book! And it couldn't have come at a better time. A lot of us need to see its message. As for me, it's one of those books that I'll keep around to refer to when I feel particularly plagued by the lure of keeping up with any Joneses."},{"Title":"Affluenza : The All-Consuming Epidemic","review":"Although it's been some months since I finished &quot;Affluenza,&quot; the book has stayed with me (and hasn't at the same time: I've loaned it to many appreciative friends). One of its most significant effects was helping me achieve what no financial planning book before it had: for the first time in the decade since leaving college, I've completely paid off my credit card debt. How did &quot;Affluenza&quot; help me do that? Well, if you read &quot;Fast Food Nation&quot; and thought you'd never want another to eat another Quarter Pounder again, you'll be able to relate; what Schlosser does for McDonald's, De Graff and Co. do for the mall. In a clear, straightforward fashion, &quot;Affluenza&quot; looks at the paralyzing effects the fever to consume brings upon us and offers simple strategies to start curbing the disease at its core -- even if that's just by forcing you to ask yourself, &quot;Do I really need this?&quot; before your next purchase.Contrary to some of the reviews, I didn't find the book to be preachy or pedantic; actually, it was the book's common sense approach to the suffocating realities of our consumer society that made it so easy, in the months that followed finishing the book, to start spending sensibly, when at all. Armed with a new skepticism as to whether happiness was just one more swipe of the credit card away, I was able to put items back, turn deals down, and walk away with my money still in my pocket -- never once regretting the decision NOT to buy, in marked contrast to the many times I felt a hollow dread after dragging home another piece of crap to take its place atop the heap of crap bought before it (just like the book's cover).If you're a person for whom happiness is carrying a plethora of brightly-colored shopping bags to your car on a Saturday afternoon, this may not be the book for you. If, however, you've noticed that you're drowning in stuff but no closer to the shore of contentment, this book can inject a little sanity into our otherwise credit-crazy world. I'm not promising it will get you out of credit card debt -- but it just might attack your drive to spend at its roots and give you a little more breathing room -- which, for less than $13, is a bargain you just can't pass up, don't you think?"},{"Title":"Affluenza : The All-Consuming Epidemic","review":"Sure, I've heard about the disappearing rainforests and the many species of animals and plants becoming endangered or extinct, but that doesn't really have anything to do with me, I live in America, the most affluent country in the history of the world. Yes, there are some problems with industrial pollution and other environmental issues but not in my community and besides that's the concern of all those 'environmentalists.' I can go to the mall to buy anything I want as long as I have a credit card, and life is good.Not so fast! It's time to stop and think about what is really happening to us. How many Americans are working in jobs that don't energize them? How many spend hours every week shopping and commuting, but only minutes with their kids or their friends? How many feel 'used up' by a glitzy, gaudy American Dream? The book Affluenza is common ground for many victims who toss and turn, trying to wake up from a value system in which people are too often treated like machines, and machines are too often treated like people. If a million Americans read this book, we may have a shot at moving beyond the short-term illusion many call 'success.' The book offers welcome news that the Joneses have surrendered! Standing on their front porch, they plead, 'Please don't try to keep up with us anymore!' What a concept - that we might be able to cooperate with and support the Joneses, rather than compete with them...Do we have a good thing going, or a good thing going bad? The fact is, beating affluenza is not about 'giving up' the good life, but getting it back. The strength of this book is that it successfully presents critical information on the anthropology and psychology of America without stripping the reader of hope. Yes, affluenza undermines our personal health, our family life, our communities, and our environment, but the authors offer us a way out. Affluenza has a three-step strategy: to present the symptoms of a disease that often feels deceptively pleasant, like an addiction; to trace the epidemic back to its historical sources; and then to offer dozens of concrete ways to Beat the Bug. The strategy works! The humor, the great satirical cartoons, and the well-researched presentation helped open my mind up and evaluate what's important for me individually, and also what needs to be done throughout our society. This is a great book for book clubs, church discussion groups, high school and college classrooms. Get it, read it, and tell your friends about it!"},{"Title":"Affluenza : The All-Consuming Epidemic","review":"What I like best about Affluenza is its' groundedness in the familiar icons and rites of American culture. It critiques and lampoons many of our foibles,frustrations, flaws, and white-hot flashes of brilliance. With great, often humorous bedside manner and expert grasp of its' subject over consumption -- it takes the temperature and pulse of our daily lives to make a troubling diagnosis: individually and collectively, our culture is plugged into life support systems that are out of control! Yikes!With structure and content that flow accessibly, the authors move us beyond a stupefied state of denial, forcing us to admit that changes are necessary. The reader is reassured that affluenza is curable -- that millions have already kicked the addictive virus.I learned 81% of the worlds population would qualify for Americas food stamp program, and that America spends more just on garbage bags than 110 countries spend for everything! Isnt there something a little perverse about our economic dominance and our environmental obliviousness? A sentence from the books cures section really made sense to me: Think about all the money we spend to fight various diseases, many of which (like allergies, cancer, diabetes, and stroke) are caused or aggravated by affluent lifestyles. Then remember that affluenza is one disease we can cure by spending less money, not more.Affluenza's story-told reminders about other kinds of wealth besides money make it an important book for our distracted, obsessed society. I hope this book is widely read in America and overseas, where international media routinely peddle the glitz of American culture without sufficient mention of the real costs. I watched the PBS program Affluenza several years ago, and found it to be one of the most effective programs on this topic I'd seen. I wasn't disappointed to discover that the book version is even more comprehensive, accessible, and compelling.***** Claire Lanier, Taos, New Mexico"},{"Title":"Affluenza : The All-Consuming Epidemic","review":"I do not want to repeat what the other reviewers have said here. I do want to emphasize that the underlying issues in this text are very relevent to any one who chooses to read this book, rich or poor, glutton or minimalist. It is high time that the wasteful attitudes and overconsumption that are typical of Western life (especially here in North America) are addressed more widely.Having said that, I do have some complaints about the book's presentation. This edition comes on the heels of two (self-proclaimed successful) documentaries that aired on public television. This book was intended to expand on the ideas first presented there. Unfortunately, after reading the book, and never having seen the television presentations, I still got the feeling that the text was repetitive at times. Points were overkilled. The book is organized into three sections: symptons, causes and cures (for affluenza) and I found similar material repeated in all three sections. The overall feel is of an author preaching to his readership.I say save your time and find copies of the television version. The ideas, whether or not one agrees with them, are worthy of attention, but not to this degree. At 275 pages, it still feels as if the author(s) are stretching."},{"Title":"Affluenza : The All-Consuming Epidemic","review":"This was a great book that opened my eyes to a lot ot things going on here at home and indeed around the world. A truly eye-opening account on the downfall of society and what went wrong with the \\"American Dream\\". From the days when a credit card was only offered to a select few, to a nation teetering on the verge of bankruptcy, it really made me stop and re-examine my priorities in life and what matters most to me.I agree with review below in that we have become so materialistic within the last few decades that we have lost our way as a nation and as a society. We have become a nation of people who only want the \\"best of the best\\", at any cost. We are raising a whole generation of kids and teenagers who simply don't understand the value of money because they feel it's their God-given right to have anything they want--or else. Many of us are so deep in debt that we never stop to realize the consequences that it's going to have on future generations. We rely on cheap, imported goods that has turned us into a throw-away society. The Middle-class is collapsing, poverty is increasing, credit use is out of control. We are outsourcing jobs to China and Mexico where cheap labor is abundant and plentiful. We have more credit cards than money, closets full of junk that we never use, 62 inch TV sets and $1000 home theatre systems. Back when I was growing up, a 20\\" TV set was the standard. Today, the MINIMUM that qualifies for a decent set is 32 inches! VCR's have been replaced by DVD recorders, TIVO's, and a host of other digital gadgetry. We have an \\"all or nothing\\" attitude when it comes to determining what we want out of life. GIMME GIMME GIMME! Me, Myself, and I. All part of this selfish, \\"me generation\\" that has devoured our culture and ruined our financial future. The authors do offer some hope that this current trend CAN be reversed, but not before it's almost too late. I think we all need to sit back and take a good look around us and start asking ourselves a LOT of questions about who we really are, where we are heading, and how we are going to get there.I highly recommend that EVERYONE have this book in their home library. It should also be required reading in every college and university across the country, particularly for those studying sociology and economics. Am I worried about my future? YOU BET! BUT the book also offers us hope and consolation that we can stop this nonsense right now and reverse the trend before it's too late. The choice is ultimately up to all of us. I wish you all the best."},{"Title":"Affluenza : The All-Consuming Epidemic","review":"To quote words from the book, &quot;The urge to splurge continues to surge.&quot; All one has to do is take a look around us and evidence of that statement is clear. We live in a &quot;plastic society;&quot; credit cards and debit cards are abundant, bankruptcies are on the rise, and our greed for &quot;the wants of life,&quot; opposed to the necessities, is proliferus. All the toys for big boys (and girls) and living with what we think we need, often means living beyond our means. To support this, the book points out that consumers spend in excess of $21,000 a year on consumer goods, more people are filing for bankruptcy each year than are graduating from college, credit card indebtedness increased tripled in the 1990's, and we spend more for trash bags than 90 of the world's 210 countries! At the same time, the average person wonders why they have no money left on payday! In my client files these days, financial problems rank number one in the list of maladies. Second is unemployment, followed closely by relationship breakdown, which is often a result of the first two issues.This is a fantastic, well-written book which paints a realistic picture of &quot;Affluenza&quot; and its effects - overload, debt, anxiety and the continuous pursuit for more. I highly recommend this excellent book. It contains some alarming statistics and information that may really cause the reader to stop and contemplate their own lifestyle...and where the hard-earned dollars are actually going."},{"Title":"Affluenza : The All-Consuming Epidemic","review":"This book, which builds on the 1996 PBS documentary AFFLUENZA! and its 1998 sequel ESCAPE FROM AFFLUENZA, provides an easy-to-read, yet hard-hitting look at the plague of over-consumption sweeping America and the rest of the world. The authors provide examples of the vicious cycle of emptiness, greed, and destruction of community and social bonds created by the American obsession with unrestrained economic growth. Non-partisan in outlook, the book makes you think about the drawbacks of unrestrained capitalism and provides possible solutions for people to simplify and improve their lives."},{"Title":"Affluenza : The All-Consuming Epidemic","review":"I'm a financial analyst with an MBA and I am what I guess would be considered a member of the upper class (you know, those top 10% of society who make more money than the rest combined, who benefit more than everyone else from tax cuts and so on). Needless to say, I had to put my tolerance cap on to get through this book. Nonetheless, I enjoyed this book. It genuinely made me think and made me appreciate the more simple things in life again (like life itself) versus constantly focusing on financial advancement. I'm even thinking about quitting my job to work part time and volunteer the rest of the day. But the book does have its bad points. It's written like a script for a television news show. Every paragraph is an island, a topic all its own, with statistics and anecdotes lobbed out for your consumption with little contextual information as if you have a three second attention span (although everything is thoroughly referenced with footnotes, if you've got the time to look things like that up). Example: At the height of his wealth Bill Gates had as many assets (his were in Microsoft stock) as the bottom half of the US population (page 79). What's that supposed to mean? Evidently the authors want you to think that it's unfair (or even evil?) that Bill Gates has been allowed to keep his wealth after building it from nothing. Imagine that! Also, the style is strikingly similar to that best selling but vaporous management books that I was forced to read in business school, which is surprising and definitely not a good thing. Still, I like the book and found that it was best read 10 minutes at a time - that's about all of the trivia-packed reading I could take in one sitting."},{"Title":"Affluenza : The All-Consuming Epidemic","review":"It doesn't surprise me at all that this once mighty country of freedom and liberty has turned into a cesspool of crime, corruption, greed, debt and materialism. One should truly be ashamed of themselves, but like blind sheep being led to the slaughter, we continue to bury our heads in the sand and turn a blind-eye, hoping that all these problems will somehow take care of themselves. Problems that only WE brought on ourselves! We are so self-centered and egocentric that we don't even think about the full implication of our actions anymore. Don't worry. Let someone else \\"take care of it\\".Take a look at the youth of today as an example. We have an entire generation of kids who can't read or write, can't spell, are totally unathletic, and who view Nintendo and MTV as quality entertainment. They stuff themselves with McDonald's and Taco Bell and blow their money on CD's, clothes and the latest fad. With both parents working now, our schools have become nothing more than drop-off centers where kids learn to become like those around them. No more time for family anymore, no more eating together, talking together and caring for each other. We are a nation in trouble folks. And then we scratch our heads and wonder why things only seem to get worse with each passing generation? Call it the dumbing down of society.Just take a walk through any high school. You'll see kids in designer clothes, sporting $100 shoes, wearing expensive jewelry and talking on their cell-phones. (which is totally unecessary IMO). I honestly don't know why 12-14 yr olds need a cell phone for. Just another bill for mommy and daddy, since they know all too well that they'll get what they want.

It seems more like an Erma Bombeck book than an instruction manual. There are ideas for things to do like outings and stuff, but I wanted more ideas for ways to enjoy your own backyard, almost like a summer camp. This book was more concerned with making life livable for the stay-at-home parent stuck with the kids for the summer. At this stage in my life, I wanted the \\"Funfilled Activities for All\\" to include me.

So, stop right there if you're looking to get the printed documentation of RUP, because it's logistically impossible to bundle it all into a paperback book. These titles give a bird's eye view of what RUP is and how it can be leveraged for optimal productivity in the vein of software development.This book gives you great high-level insight on how your organization can benefit by adopting and implementing RUP in your developmental projects.\\"The Rational Unified Process: An Introduction\\" is an overview into the theory behind RUP. Great chart and graphics describe the processes RUP is rooted in, and the title is written in such a way as to indirectly hammer home the concepts into your subconscious, without being too blatantly redundant. Essentially, you'll get the jist of RUP - iterations, that the waterfall process isn't efficient, the importance of establishing diversity in team-based development, and the importance of architecture.Basically, the book also enforces the concept that self-organization and communication within an organization (within the team, throughout the company, and with clients) is key. It reads more like a business journal than a technical guide, so hands-on examples are left out.Also, the poster summarizing the key RUP activities that's included with the book is really great. I would have liked a case study at the end of the book to tie together the concepts with a practical example, but the book is great otherwise. I also found the fact that samples of RUP templates to be a bit disappointing. A helpful appendix listing some (not all) of the key artifacts used in RUP planning is also appreciated."},{"Title":"The Rational Unified Process An Introduction","review":"The good stuff is elsewhere ($ -&gt; Rational) is the basic premise of this book.

Overall its sales literature. I should be able to download it from Rational's web site. I don't recommend it unless you have full intentions of buying Rational's developer products."},{"Title":"The Rational Unified Process An Introduction","review":"The Rational Unified Process (RUP) was originally developed by Rational Software, which was recently purchased by IBM. Therefore, you now see the RUP sometimes referred to as IBM's Web-enabled software engineering process. As this name implies, it is a set of guidelines, some soft and others fairly rigid to the point of being a rule, for the creation of software. Like all useful principles of computer science, the RUP is a dynamic entity, being constantly modified to reflect the changes taking place in software creation. Therefore, if you are already familiar with the RUP and are wondering if you should read this book, the answer is an emphatic yes. If you are unfamiliar with the RUP, the answer is an even more emphatic yes.The purpose of this book is to provide an introduction to RUP 2003, the latest iteration of the process. Like the previous books on RUP, it is written at a level suitable for managers. There is some necessary technical jargon, but nothing beyond what a software project development manager would be expected to be able to comprehend.The book opens with a history of the RUP, what it is used for and the overall structure of the RUP. This is followed by a very brief introduction to fundamental concepts such as iterative development, architecture-centric processes and use cases. Necessary for beginners, most of this material can be skipped by those having experience in those areas.Part II covers the various areas, referred to as disciplines. They are:* The project management discipline.* The business-modeling discipline.* The requirements discipline.* The analysis and design discipline.* The implementation discipline.* The test discipline.* The configuration and change management discipline.* The environment discipline.* The deployment discipline.While the steps used in the analysis differs from discipline to discipline, the following are common to all:* Purpose.* Roles and artifacts.* Workflow.* Tool support.* Summary.The tool support section is particularly helpful if you are evaluating the RUP for possible use in your organization. IBM/Rational has many tools that can aid you in your efficient use of the RUP. In fact, without software tools to aid you, much of the material in this book would be of theoretical interest only.Large software projects require an overall organizing process to be imposed on them if there is to be a chance for successful completion. The RUP is currently one of the best such processes and this book will show the fundamentals of the process and how it can work for you."},{"Title":"The Rational Unified Process An Introduction","review":"I give 4 stars to this book, because it can be red in a very little time (a week-end, if you are motivated), otherwise I probably gave it only 3 stars. It is really an introduction, with swallow description of activities, but with an enought sufficient visibility on overall picture. The unpleasant part is the continuous recall of Rational Softwares, Showing all rational Software as pieces that perfectly fits together, which is not true. I think that a far from free book like that should be written without these continuous references."},{"Title":"The Rational Unified Process An Introduction","review":"Okay. I haven't read this book cover to cover. I never intended to - I got my job to purchased it as a reference for me. Lightweight processes are more appropriate in my professional circumstances (we don't use RUP), and I have been particularly interested in Rosenberg (and Scott)'s Iconix process. (See my reviews)However, I find Krutchen's book a good fat-free reference on how the heavy-weights do it. Sometimes one needs a bit of extra depth. The book is well illustrated, and it helps me to put processes such as Iconix (and maybe even XP) in context.The book covers the overall dimensions of the Rational Unified Process well. Issues such as best practice, iteration, team make-up, etc are also discussed. There is a big section on process workflow (more than 50%).It also adds the architectural viewpoint of the process, a section that I found quite useful. Philippe Kruchten is behind the 4+1 view model of architecture, so it is good to get it from the source.Should you buy this book? Like anything else, first decide how much you need it."},{"Title":"The Rational Unified Process An Introduction","review":"While this book has received great reviews I must offer disagreement. As an experienced OO professional (I've been working in OO practically since the beginning) the RUP leaves a lot to be desired.For one thing there is not nearly enough emphasis on requirements gathering and process engineering. For the most part the analysis aspect of RUP focuses on Use Case Scenarios. I feel that this is a major weakness. Use Case Scenarios focus on how user's use the system, but doesn't answer the question: What system? To dive into Use Case Scenarios without first applying process engineering at a detailed level leaves you with a system that no one really asked for.Furthermore I feel there is not enough emphasis on using Use Case Scenarios as a vehicle for test designs. One of the greatest advantages of Use Case Scenarios, when there done at a very detailed level, is to use them as a System Test design. This would include &quot;expected results&quot; for each step.Also, I don't feel there is sufficient evidence for support of logical object modeling as apposed to physical object modeling. It's common knowledge with database design that logical modeling comes first, then the physical. This same tactic should be employed with OO modeling. This includes both class models and use case scenarios. This is especially valuable in the Java and EJB environment where Session beans differ from Entity beans and both differ from regular Java classes, singletons etc.Another reviewer mentioned that this book might be a vehicle for selling Rational products. I agree. That's exactly what this is.If you're an experienced analyst there are still some takeaways from the book, but you will have to augment it with your own knowledge and experience. The danger lies with inexperienced analysts thinking that they can define and design complex systems using RUP, and that it's sufficient. It's not."},{"Title":"The Rational Unified Process An Introduction","review":"I agree completely with the last reviewer. The book is just a teaser for the product (another 700 USD). Very disappointing after waiting for it for so long."},{"Title":"The Rational Unified Process An Introduction","review":"I am very impressed by the Rational Unified Process. This book does a great job of teaching you how to take the complex process of developing software and making it manageable. While I have been a part of complex projects before and have worked in an ISO 9001 environment for more than a year, I joined my first software development project that is making use of RUP recently. I am very impressed that this is &quot;best practices.&quot; The book is well organized, easy to read, and very educational. Only a very few times is anything not extremely clear and accessible to even a newcomer to development such as myself. I would recommend this book be read by all members of a development team to assist in getting everyone speaking the same language and making full use of resources."},{"Title":"The Rational Unified Process An Introduction","review":"This is a very dense introduction for RUP.

I read because i want to complete my knolwedge on the process and software engineer process iteself. The book emphasizes in the goods of the process as a process model and a framework not as a product. Buy it, if you are interested in one of the most popular software engineer process outer or want to get some good advices to your own processes.

In case you are not aware, the authors of UML work for Rational and they are the company that makes Rational Rose, the market leader in OO design tools.The book outlines the process, which has many good features. One example is that the process uses the spiral methodology instead of waterfall. The book covers all phases of processes you might want to put in place in an OO project.Unlike many OO process books for the past, this book keeps it feet on the ground and stays readable. Others in the past have usually drafted into obscure technical details.The book has two problems. The first is that the prose is pretty stilted. Way too many sentences start with &quot;The Rational Unified Process is&quot;. The other problem is that the book is geared around using the tools from Rational. However, it is possible to use most of the process without using the tools from Rational.In summary, this book documents a pretty good OO design process in a very easy to understand way. If you are looking for an OO process to follow or are looking for ways to improve your existing one, this book is an excellent starting book."},{"Title":"The Rational Unified Process An Introduction","review":"There are those who might criticize this book as being a mere commercial for the development tools offered by Rational Software. My reaction to that position is, \`so what.\\" If I am a manager considering the adoption of the Rational Unified Process, then my best hope for making the correct adoption decision is to learn what it is designed to do in as short a time as possible. Any material that I can read at a managerial level that explains the capability and what I can get out of it is something of great value, and this book satisfies that requirement.The main purpose of the book is to explain the unified process at the level of the tops of the trees. This broad overview is an explanation of how a process is constructed by splitting it up into nine overlapping, but still somewhat distinct workflows. They are the project management workflow, the business modeling workflow, the requirements workflow, the analysis and design workflow, the implementation workflow, the test workflow, the configuration and change workflow, the environment workflow and the deployment workflow. The separation of the process into the different sections allows each of them to be described from their somewhat unique perspectives, which makes it easier to see how the synergy of them all makes for a complete, effective process.It took some time for it to appear, but it is now essential to examine an item of software from the architectural perspective. Such an encompassing examination of software could not exist until the projects grew to such size and complexity that no other paradigm could adequately describe it. Like the plans for a large, complicated building, it is the overlap of several different models that merge together to build something that is more than the collection of pieces. An entire chapter is devoted to the importance of the architecture in the development and unending refinement of a software project. These are wise words to heed, as anyone who tries to build the complex without a sound plan is almost certainly doomed to failure.The most significant test that any book describing a product can face is whether it is still worth reading if you have no interest in the product. This book easily passes that test and is one of the best manuals for managers of large software projects that is available today."},{"Title":"The Rational Unified Process An Introduction","review":"This book is an introduction to the Rational Unified Process (RUP). It is suitable for readers who have never heard of RUP before and for readers who have little experience with thoughtful analysis of software lifecycles. (I think it's also very useful as a quick, easy-to-read overview of RUP for more advanced readers, but you can read about that use of the book in other reviews.)I teach Computer Science at Florida Tech, including undergraduate and graduate courses in software testing. Krutchen provides a thoughtful but very readable, persuasive discussion of risks associated with different software lifecycles. In my experience as a teacher, my students' ability to appreciate differences among lifecycles and analyze them critically is significantly boosted by study and discussion of Krutchen. Accordingly, I require my students to read the relevant section of his book, they have detailed small-group discussions of it, and it often appears on their exam.This book is an introduction. It doesn't address all of the problems with RUP. It doesn't cover all of the areas of RUP equally well. It won't make any reader an expert in the process or its favored practices. It won't persuade someone who doesn't like RUP that they should like. What it does do is expose the reader to the thinking and practices that make up this particular approach to software engineering.This book is much deeper than marketing fluff, but not so deep as to lose a junior reader. As a teacher, I am delighted to have materials like this available.(Disclosure: a little bit of my work has been included in RUP, and I have developed a course for Rational on software testing within the Rational process. However, I identify more with the agile development / XP community than with the RUP community. In any case, the question that I'm interested in answering in this review is not whether RUP is any good -- it has its good points and its weaknesses -- but rather whether Krutchen's introduction to RUP is a fair and useful introduction to that subject matter. My conclusion is that it is.)"},{"Title":"The Rational Unified Process An Introduction","review":"An excellent book well organized and generally well written. Recommended either to learn about Rational Corporation's Rational Unified Process (RUP) or even just to get a general acquaintance with current ideas about software development methodology.Mr. Kruchten advocates describing a software product with various summary, abstract views. In this book, he practices what he preaches by giving just the &quot;architectural&quot; view of RUP, whose in-depth treatment would not fit in just 300 pages. There are seventeen chapters divided into two sections. A reader interested only in RUP's distinctive features may skip chapters 1 and 14-17.Section I comprising chapters 1-6 provides the motivation (software development best practices) and the dominant themes (architecture and use cases) of RUP, describing it also along two main dimensions: the dynamic dimension of phase and iteration and the static dimension of workflow.Section II dedicates a chapter to each of RUP's nine workflows. There are two final chapters, one with sample plans for iterations in different project phases and one discussing how to implement RUP in a development organization. There are two useful appendices, a dictionary of acronyms, a glossary, and a quite helpful annotated bibliography.In RUP a workflow is an interrelated set of activities producing a cohesive subset of the artifacts of a software development project. The chapters describing workflows vary somewhat in length and quality, but they all follow the same pattern: (1) start with guiding principles; (2) describe the activities, workers, and artifacts of the workflow; (3) conclude with some comments on tool support (a little marketing for Rational Corporation's tool suite). The best workflow chapters: Project Management, Business Modeling, Test, Configuration and Change Management.The high recommendation comes not without some reservations.Architectures are important in RUP, but Chapter 5, \\"An Architecture-centric Process,\\" garbles this message by describing architectures as mere derivatives of &quot;complete&quot; system descriptions (called &quot;models&quot;): \\"Architecture is what remains when you cannot take away any more things and still understand the system and explain how it works (p. 82).\\" Again, &quot; . . . models are complete representations of the system, whereas an architectural view focuses only on what is architecturally significant (p. 89).\\" Finally, \\"Architectural views are like slices cut through the various models, illuminating only the important, significant elements . . . (p. 90).\\"These explanations fail to recognize that architectures come first. Architectures are constraints that determine subsequent design and construction of the system. They are primary, not derivative, not mere views of models. Fortunately, RUP recognizes the primacy of architecture even if these explanations do not.These explanations also fail to recognize that an architecture is a complete and distinct model in its own right. They are out of harmony with the book's own (wordy) definition of architecture, which includes &quot;The selection of structural elements and their interfaces by which the system is composed . . . (p. 84).&quot; So when the elements and interfaces have been defined, the architecture is complete, right? It escapes this reader how architectures can be inherently less complete than models (whatever they are), when there is not even any one model that completely describes a system (see p. 81).The relationship that Chapter 5 describes between architectures and models is very similar to that described in Chapter 10 between the analysis model and the design model. Mr. Kruchten limits the value of retaining the analysis model as a distinct artifact: &quot;Generally, there is one design model . . .. The upper layers of this model describe the application-specific, or more analysis-oriented, aspects . . . In some companies-those in which systems live for decades or there are many variants of the system-a separate analysis model has proved useful (p. 175).&quot;Generally, companies that plan to stay in business DO expect their systems to live for decades-as do companies that spend millions of dollars using RUP to build them. As for &quot;the extra work required to ensure that the analysis and design models remain consistent (p. 175),&quot; the right tool can make all the difference. Anyone familiar with tools for database design (Erwin, for example) knows that they provide extensive facilities for maintaining separate, consistent analysis (logical) and design (physical) models. The tools offered by Rational Corporation, however, do NOT provide such a facility. Could Mr. Kruchten be tailoring the methodology to fit the limitations of the tool that his sponsor sells?Compare his attitude toward the analysis model with that of another author in the Addison-Wesley Object Technology Series. Martin Fowler in his UML Distilled says, &quot; . . . it is very important to separate the specification perspective and the implementation perspective (p. 52).&quot; Mr. Fowler uses different terminology, but he is saying essentially that the analysis model (&quot;specification perspective&quot;) is valuable as an artifact distinct from the design model (&quot;implementation perspective&quot;).Despite these issues-which might profitably have been discussed at greater length-this fine book admirably fulfills its purpose."},{"Title":"The Rational Unified Process An Introduction","review":"This book is a much better read than the generic process described by the book named The Unified Software Development Process (UP).

Many big technology firms are using RUP to include major companies from Telecommunications, Transportation, Aerospace, Defense, Manufacturing, Financial Institutions, and System Integratrors.

If you are looking for a \`helicopter' view on the RUP and nothing more, read this book. END"},{"Title":"The Rational Unified Process An Introduction","review":"First of all, please let me clarify something. In another review of mine (for the book &quot;The Rational Unified Process Made Easy&quot; of Kroll &amp; Kruchten) I mentioned that there are 3 books on the RUP. Well, this might have been true in August of 2003, but it is not anymore: There are 3 more books on the RUP out there, namely:- &quot;Adopting the Rational Unified Process&quot;- &quot;Software Development for Small Teams&quot;- &quot;Practical Software Engineering&quot; (.NET-oriented)To be frank, I found the &quot;Made Easy&quot; book to a be a bit more fun than this one. Probably, because this book is more descriptive, whereas the &quot;Made Easy&quot; one is more normative. Having said that, I feel this book is the definitive book to have if youare working with the RUP, and a heck of a useful book to read even if you're not. Especially now that everything Rational has gained more leverage (because of the acquisition of Rational Software by IBM that gives RUP an arguably more powerful marketing mechanism and exposure, let alone its plausible gradual integration into the methodologies used by the 150,000-people-strong IBM Global Services organization), this book becomes even more relevant.There is a foreword by Grady Booch (one of the 3 amigos) that goes though a can-never-remember-how-many thousand mile view of the whole landscape, followed by a chapter by the author, who briefly goes through all the nice concepts (iterative development, architecture, etc.) that permeate the RUP. There is also a brief history of the RUP in this chapter that I found quite illuminating. I always like to know the historal context; it usually helps explain the rationale behind ideas and constructs.The next chapter, entitled &quot;Static Structure&quot;, discusses the constituent concepts of the RUP, namely role, activity, artifact, workflow, discipline, deliberately ignoring for the moment the temporal dimension (for the most part). It is chapter 4, &quot;Dynamic Structure&quot;, where the core concept of iterative development is expounded, and the expected contrast with the traditional waterfall is made (hence explaining the rationale for coming up with the perhaps-not-intuitive-at-first-glance idea of iterative development). Phases and milestones are explained.If there are three pillars of the RUP, these are (i) iterative development, (ii) executable architecture, and (iii) use-case driven development. Hence, it comes to no surprise that the next two chapters deal with architecture and use cases. In chapter 5 a mention is made, among other things, to the author's important work on the 4+1 Views of Architecture that underlies the RUP. Chapter 6 is a condensed discussion of the role and merit of use cases in a software development process in general, and RUP in particular.This concludes Part I of the book. Part II consists of 9 chapters, one for each RUP so-called discipline (Project Management, Business Modeling, Requirements, Analysis and Design, Implementation, Test, Configuration, Environment, Deployment). The &quot;Made Easy&quot; book follows a similar pattern, with the difference, congruent with I've already mentioned above, that this book tends to treat the Disciplines in a descriptive rather than normative manner.There is a pretty good &quot;Summary of Roles&quot; appendix at the end, and I liked the Glossary too, as the definitions contained therein are very precise but at the same time very comprehensible too. Finally, there is a rich annotated bibliography section, which, if you're at all like me, you'll find rather useful (There's also a poster of the RUP at the back if you're into that sort of thing).All in all, I haven't at all regretted the 38.50 and the time I've spent reading the book; and imagine that I was familiar with this stuff already. If this happens to be the first book you read on RUP (as it should normally be) then the benefit for you will be even greater."},{"Title":"The Rational Unified Process An Introduction","review":"Target AudienceIT professionals who need to learn about the Rational Unified Process (RUP)ContentsThis book is a relatively high-level overview of the entire RUP process.The book is divided into the following chapters: Software Development Best Practices; The Rational Unified Process; Static Structure: Process Description; Dynamic Structure: Iterative Development; An Architecture-Centric Process; A Use-Case-Driven Process; The Project Management Discipline; The Business Modeling Discipline; The Requirements Discipline; The Analysis and Design Discipline; The Implementation Discipline; The Test Discipline; The Configuration and Change Management Discipline; The Environment Discipline; The Deployment Discipline; Typical Iteration Plans; Implementing the Rational Unified Process; Summary of Roles; Summary of Artifacts; Acronyms; Glossary; Bibliography; IndexReviewThe Rational Unified Process, or RUP, is a software engineering methodology that attempts to map out and document all parts of a software development project. It's extremely comprehensive, but it's also adaptable to whatever level of effort is appropriate for your situation. This book, The Rational Unified Process - An Introduction, is a good start to begin your understanding of RUP.First off, let me say this is not an easy read. It's a good book with all the information you need to know to start using RUP, but the information is dense and highly detail oriented. Like most developers, I'm more oriented towards coding and testing. But realistically, you need to know what the system should do before you get to the coding piece. RUP helps to put all that into a formal framework so that the necessary things will get done in the proper order.While the entire RUP framework might feel overwhelming, the author makes sure to let you know that you can adapt the RUP to meet your situation. If you are adding a function to an existing system, you will be more focused on use cases, development, and deployment processes. The author does a good job in segmenting the information so that you can more easily focus on your needs.You should also not consider this the end-all volume on RUP that you will ever need. Kruchten doesn't try to detail specific techniques like use cases or UML. You will learn where they fit in to RUP, but you will need additional information on how to implement use cases or UML diagrams. Consider this the volume that allows you to place everything in a mental framework so that you can figure out what you will need to know going forward.ConclusionIf you are considering or in the process of implementing RUP, this is a book you should be studying. It's not an easy read, but it will give you the overview you need to understand the process and concepts."},{"Title":"The Rational Unified Process An Introduction","review":"This book introduces the logic behind Rational Unified Process (RUP). RUP is a novel idea. It puts several good practices in a consolidated package. What makes RUP useful is the fact that Rational provides all the necessary software tools to support this. This book does an average job in explaining the RUP. It over stresses obvious and well accepted concepts like &quot;iterative development&quot;; which makes the first half (6 chapters) of this book a bit boring. For a professional with software development and management experience, I found the first sixe chapters are best read at a cursory glance. The second half of the book introduces the workflows - and it is this half that I found more interesting. I finished this book as bed time readoing over the weekend - so this book is an easy reading. However this book is not about teaching how to use Rational Products. This book only gives an overview of the basis of origination of RUP. You would need another book to become an expert in using RUP."},{"Title":"The Rational Unified Process An Introduction","review":"This is a thin book. I am not sure it is worth $30. If you need a crash course Intro in RUP this book is great. However it does not go into great detail about any of the artifacts. You will need to buy the Ratioinal software, find a website with RUP templates, or buy another book that is more comprehensive if you are trying to implement RUP.It gives an overview of the different job functions and the artifacts those workers have to produce.

The trouble is, it's such a high level introduction that there's almost no useful information whatsoever. The entire time I was reading, I was waiting for the author to get to the meat, only to discover at the end that there was none. It was like ordering a double cheeseburger, and getting two buns with ketchup and a pickle, and no beef patties.I can only assume that Rational paid the author for his time in the hopes that people, after reading this book, would purchase their entire software suite just to find out what the RUP actually involves.Despite my severe disappointment (and relief that I didn't have to pay for it myself), I can't rate it any lower than two stars. It's well written, and it could quite possibly be useful to managers and other business types who have no idea how software development works.

The great virtue of Kruchten 's summary view is that it allows engineers and technical managers to see that much of what is offered as a guide for technology and business management is, in reality, little more than a sophistical reworking of the AI theory of the mid-1970's. Such a summary has long been needed, and this book, for this reason, is a welcome sight.Kruchten has been an employee of Rational Software, so the implications of the summary view he offers are in some ways unexpected. The explanation may be that it is evident from the first that author maintains reservations about the methodology he describes. While skepticism reveals a level of realism (or perhaps cynicism) that is interesting, the general impression may be a bit discouraging. If one of the primary evangelists of a management method reveals skepticism toward the method, then what is to become of all those managers who have advocated paying all that money to educate their employees in the use of the method?The answer is, of course, to be expected. Pay equal or greater amounts of money to seek education in alternative methods (possibly marketed by the same vendor). If this is, indeed, the action proposed, then any hint of skepticism ends up being a brave (if not offensive) gesture, to say the least, and it is understandable that it is not explicitly asserted.This book may represent what may be a significant crack in insular mysticism maintained by one of the major vendors of methodology in today's technical sector. The fact revealed is simply this: no technical method of management can replace the culture that a business creates by having bright people, successful products and good services. Certainly, a failing company seeking an image of success may benefit by purchasing classes on &quot;rational business and technology management methods,&quot; but a genuinely successful company has its own culture, its own business vision, and ultimately its own managerial and production practices. These are the simple imperatives of the free market, which thrives, not on ideological conformity or fixed, enforced methodologies, but on innovation, creativity, and a common sense of professional purpose.Kruchten 's book may bring light to a dark area of the world at a moment when many companies must seek innovation in order to survive the economic downturn that is sweeping the technology industries. Probably the only qualification is that such a book ultimately brings about the conditions of its own demise. If we see the myth for what it is, then why do we continue to invest in it? Obviously, we don't, and the over-priced books summarizing outmoded AI theories go out of print."},{"Title":"The Rational Unified Process An Introduction","review":"Good and profoun"},{"Title":"Off on a Journey","review":"I have read the book and found the stories, and poems to be very real, honest and heartfelt.

With a little help from his friends Rosie-Rose, Gorse and his beloved Grand-Ma-Ma-Flora, Herb demonstrates that vegetarian food can be just as delicious as meat-based dishes.Cooking With Herb is both a cookbook and a storybook combined. Along with recipes such as Chili Con &quot;No&quot; Carne, Party Pasta For A Herd Of Dragons, Herb's amazing potatoes, Chocolate Banana Walnut Bread and sixteen others, it's designed for kids and their parents to have fun together. And remember, the recipes are not just for kids - they're ones I cook for myself and my friends. So, I hope that everyone will join in. Some kids will be able to prepare them by themselves while others will need some help. Each recipe comes with a story of how Herb invented it, some of his &quot;Hot Tips&quot; and comments from dragons in the forest who are not vegetarians; especially MeatHook, who is a confirmed meat eater but is nevertheless tempted by Herb's cooking.

Cole detests the sham, but agrees to do the masquerade.On Christmas Eve, Cole's supervisor Anna Wesley sees him still working long after everyone else has gone home to spend time with their respective families. On a whim and feeling sorry for his being alone for the holidays, she invites Cole to join her family for a holiday meal though she knows how her parents will react to her bringing home a handsome hunk. As Cole and Anna begin to fall in love, he worries how she will react once she learns the ruse he and his dad performed.COLE FOR CHRISTMAS is a pleasant Yuletide romance due to the amusing antics of the lead couple, neither of which is prepared to fall in love.

Aikdio is the power of harmony; of all beings; all things working together. Martial arts is like religion; there are debates and arguments, philosophical differences and utter blaspheme. This thoughtful art form certainly invites discussion and study.Aikdo has at it core, the concept of doing no harm to your opponent. Personnaly, I think this concept seems to fall short when you consider what you might do if confronted with a gang of attackers intent on clubbing, stabbing or kicking you to death.It's fine to throw one attacker and then another and cause them no permanent harm, but after about the fifth attacker, when the first guy gets back up to come at you again I have to think that it might be good to have a few techniques in your back pocket that might cause some lasting damage so that he won't be coming back for seconds.The techniques depicted in the many photo sequences are valuable and insightful. I have great respect for this art and many of these techniques should be part of a well-rounded martial artist's arsenal, but you might still want some more lethal things in your bag of tricks.Still a valuable book and a good read.Kevin BrettCEO, Kevin Brett Studios, Inc.Author: The Way of the Martial Artist: Achieving Success in Martial Arts and in Life!The Way of the Martial Artist: Achieving Success in Martial Arts and in Life!"},{"Title":"The Spirit of Aikido","review":"A detailed, but brief, history of Aikido told by the son of the art's founder."},{"Title":"The Spirit of Aikido","review":"This is a book to help understand the martial art that is aikido.

The goal of this book is to let the reader know what makes Aikido stand out in relation to other martial arts, and to explain the overall goals of Aikidoka, or practitioners of Aikido. It doesn't spend much time discussing movements or katas, but rather tries to impart the very nature of Aikido, which is the harmony of mankind through martial arts. Aikido differs from many martial arts in the non-aggressive nature of its movements, and its non-violent attitude. The idea of Aikido is to disperse an attack without harming the attacker, or allowing one's self to come to harm. Written by the son of the founder of Aikido, its authenticity cannot be challenged by anyone within the martial arts world.If you are interested in getting to know more about Aikido, this is the book for you.

Through aikido practice you get a experiential knowing of 'interpersonal relationship'enjoy:note: there may be some quote throughout where i missed a quotation mark... the majority is a paraphrasing of the book- whatever statement is necessary to not be accused for plagiarism and i condone it. that being said this book report is not about me or my ego- i dont care about credit. i simply want to share for the potential benefit of those seeking.I really enjoyed reading this highly evolved book. He delivers his perspective in a really intimate and skillful way. It becomes clear the caliber of person he is.The book begins discussing general aspects of aikido and addresses the politics of competition that is sometimes voiced at aikido. It proceeds in expressing core values and beliefs that form the structure of the philosophy of aikido.Discusses ki quite comprehensivelyUltimate goal of aikido Is the unification of ki-mind-body.Synchronize ones individual ki, through the breath with universal ki.While the conceptual understanding of ki can be helpful, it's not enough. True understanding can only come through experience.A quote from the first chapter effectively emphasizes this.Ki then is two fold: the unity of individual-universe and the free spontaneous expression of breath-power. The former inherits the idea of ki held by ancient Chinese thinkers, but it is to be realized through unifying ki-mind-body in aikido training. In the process of training oneness with the ki of universe is achieved spontaneously without effort.The next section: the power of ki- goes into some subjective experiences of ki. It is followed later by a scientific analysis of ki.The next chapter is called: Nen and Mind-body clarityThe essence of aikido- the unity of ki-mind-body is to be understood holistically. \\"if we grasp it merely as a spiritual reality, we may become doctrinaire and fall into abstraction. If we see it only as a matter of technique and physical prowess, then we become satisfied with a simplistic explanation of motor movements.\\"An importance to realizing this is a \\"one pointed concentration of the spirit as it seeks union with universal...\\" genuine reality from which all arises. This principle is called Nen.Furthermore, \\"Nen is the line that connects ki-mind-body (individual ki) and universal ki.The next chapter is called: young practitioners and aikido basics.He discusses aikido for childrenUltimately- and the largest intension of aikido is as a spiritual path which aims at cultivating \\"the realization of harmony and love.\\"He discusses aikido in relation to woman. Which culminates on expressing that aikido is for all people.- great quote on this on page 62 (if it seems like there is time)In the next chapter: mastering mind, cultivating techniqueHe goes into depth of sword makingWhich he uses to demonstrate that \\"through dedication, training, and penetration, Devine performance will be born.\\"he continues to emphisize the importance of the following intentions to the fruition of realization through aikido.\\"1. Training to harmonize one's mind with the activity of all things in the universe.2. Training to harmonize one's body with the activity of all things in the universe.3. Training to make the ki that connects mind and body harmonize with the activity of all things in the universe.\\"- practicing and realizing these 3 points simultaneously, not merely theoretically but actually, in the dojo and at every moment in daily life.Poems by the founder are found later in this chapter.Later, the intimacy of aikido and swordsmanship is discussed.Next chapter is called: strength in living with natureDiscusses students training in the context of different weather experiences. More discussion into students in relation to training in the mists of whatever arises in their experience.He expresses the importance on joyful training. A sense of training with a light heart trusting in the organic process of enlightenment to unfold.When discussing different types of students (of course defined by their mindset and intentions) he expresses that based on his experience\\" the number of how many Truly enjoy a pleasant and joyful training experience, I cannot say that the number is that great. Many practice aikido using excessive force, others with grim resolution, and still others with lack of confidence and practice very tentatively.It is a delight to see practitioners who really enjoy their workout. Many have been practicing for five, ten or more years, following their own pace and making aikido part of their daily routine. They appear at the dojo, preform without much ado, throwing and being thrown, quietly following instructions, and leave when the class is over. They seem uninterested in promotion and have the manner of people who are enjoying themselves.

It is not a book about physical technique and it does not really discuss the physical or mechanical reasoning behind Aikido techniques. It is a thin book and a quick read. That's a good thing because it will probably be re-read every year or two.There is some discussion of the development of the art and it's different phases while under development. The discussion concentrates on the Founder's quest and teachings but not so much on what martial arts he studied and when he studied them.It does discuss spiritual concepts and it relates certain techniques and entries to those concepts. Most notably, Kisshomaru Ueshiba discusses aspects of harmonizing mind and body with each other and the universe such that ki flows. From that center he discusses the popularity of Aikido and why it appeals to such a wide range of practitioners. This is contrasted to other more competitive arts in which the strongest rise to the top whereas in Aikido the most ... joyful? ... stand out.What I found enlightening is that the words in the book gave meaning to some of the things that more advanced practitioners have said to me. Things about breath and reaction times and blending and relaxing.

This has been a profoundly frustrating experience. It seems that the authors, in their zeal to attain unto the dry, lifeless style characteristic of most professional engineering publications, also unintentionally created a text which is superlatively unclear.I am recurrently astonished at the utter incomprehensibility of entire paragraphs. I will read a section, cynically assert that it communicates nothing, read it over a dozen more times, show it to others who in turn read it a dozen times, only to have my first conclusion affirmed.There are extremely blatant contradictions.Terms are used at the beginning of a chapter and not defined until the end.It speaks voluminously about how critical it is to follow the prescribed techniques, only to devote less-than-the-bare-minimum amount of space to the actual descriptions of those techniques.The review questions are frequently unrelated to the content they are supposed to be reinforcing, or are simply placed in the wrong chapter.This (expensive!) book is a conspicuous example of \\"writing by committee.\\" Technical Drawing may well be a decent-enough reference book - useful if you need a reminder about material you already know - but expect to get angry at it, especially if you're learning the information for the first time."},{"Title":"Technical drawing","review":"This book is loaded with technical information for the dratsman and designer.

Readers will indeed learn about and develop precision drawing skills--whether drawing with instruments or computer.The true value of this book is in its ability to guide and therefore transform the natural artist's raw talent into that of a professional grade design artist--capable of rendering technical depictions, representations, or designs, at any time, with little effort, and without error. As with learning to walk, this of course takes time, patience, and practice.I have personally witnessed the struggles of many whom, having necessity to complete a course of study based upon this book, were ill-suited by their own admission for the discipline required of the eye, hand, and attention (or mind) as demanded by the capable sketch artist--to say nothing of the trained detail design drafter.If realizing the instructional value of Technical Drawing, 12th edition, seems to come at great pain and effort, the obvious question clearly becomes one of aptitude for drawing. However, while the aptitude for drawing is extremely beneficial, proficiency in technical drawing can still be achieved by sheer tenacity.Technical Drawing, 12th edition, as with previous editions, is therefore highly recommended for the tenacious engineer, designer and drafter. It has stood the test of time as a solid component of engineering design instruction in this nation's premiere academic institutions."},{"Title":"Technical drawing","review":"When originally published, this decades old book had exercises dimensioned in inches only. When the authors decided to include some exercises with metric dimensions, they reused old drawings, converted the measurements from inches to millimeters, rounded off to one decimal place, and DID NOT CHECK FOR ACCURACY.

Nevertheless, each new edition reproduced the same errors. My instructor gave up trying to get the authors to correct their work.As an AutoCAD student, I find the sloppiness of this book appalling. Technical drafting requires a high degree of accuracy. The whole point of drafting is precision, whether you're building a house, designing a chip, or modeling an object. This is like a color theory book published with only three out of the four colors necessary for full color.I paid a premium for the latest edition, the 13th. Don't make the same mistake! Try to find an old edition, published by the original Giesecke, with dimensions in inches only. As my teacher explained in disgust, every new edition costs a lot more for no additional value. The 13th edition has full color photographs, and for that I paid an extra $25 over the 12th. One of my classmates has a 5th edition with only line drawings, no photos, no color, but IT HAS ACCURATE DRAWINGS. It would probably cost a lot less than the $80+ I paid for the 13th edition, too."},{"Title":"Technical drawing","review":"This book is an excellent reference for anyone needing an introduction to or a reference for technical drawing. Most of the content concerning machine component drawings are geared (no pun intended) more toward traditional methods for technical drawings (i.e. compass, ruler and pencil), but the methods given are well suited to modern computer-oriented methods of solid modeling. Engineers in the manufacturing industry will find it especially useful, as it can be a helpful reference for weldment drawings."},{"Title":"Technical drawing","review":"The thing this book does best is demonstrate the inferiority of 2D drafting when compared with 3D modeling. In several parts, the 2D documentation of the parts glosses over some of the more complex implications, and simply leaves it to someone else downstream to figure out. If you try to build some of the example parts in 3D, you see that the dimensions in probably 40% of the parts I worked through simply don't add up.Shouldn't the book at least describe the concept of draft on example parts that are for the most part cast and forged parts? Some of the example parts become extremely difficult if you consider draft.Also there is the combination of some very dated material with some semi-modern entries, especially when covering computer hardware. This kind of thing is almost impossible to cover in a published hardcopy because the computer hardware has gone through two generations between writing and distribution of the book.On the plus side, it does have some nice examples, but this is far from complete if it is being used to prepare college students for jobs in the 2000's."},{"Title":"Technical drawing","review":"The book arrived on time and for that I have no problem, the shipping service worked great.

There are several different women who belong to an email loop and communicate back and forth. Most of the women who belong to the forum are normal moms who struggle to find balance. There is also a mom who projects a perfect image and comes across as judgemental. Throughout the book, we find out that the \\"perfect\\" mom isn't so perfect and has her own struggles behind her \\"perfect\\" image.I liked this book because it dealt with a lot of issues: infertility, adoption, feeling overwhelmed, marital unfaithfulness and temptation. I am a SAHM and there were so many parts of the books that pretty much explained exactly what I was feeling.This book would be great for anyone who is a stay at home mom and is struggling. It definitely makes you feel better about your own situations and lets you know that you are not the only mom who struggles to balance everything.This book is a really quick read. I read it in about 3 hours after my daughter went to bed.I only gave it 4 stars because I was kind of disappointed that there wasn't really any spiritual growth in the \\"perfect\\" mom. Her last email in the book was still judgemental and I was disappointed that she didn't realize how judgemental and hyprocritical she was being. I was also hoping that one of the moms who was struggling with fertility issues would have been able to get pregnant. I also didn't think that the son being \\"cured\\" was that realistic. I think it would have been better for the mom to have to deal wtith her son having an illness instead of just praying and it going away.I would also recommend all of the other books in the \\"life, faith, and getting it right\\" series."},{"Title":"SAHM I Am (Life, Faith & Getting It Right #8) (Steeple Hill Cafe)","review":"One needn't stay home or even have children to love SAHM I Am.

Sometimes this means staying up til 2am finishing a (non school related) book. For example, when the last Harry Potter book came out, all I did for 2 days straight minus 2 hours for church was read. (It was well worth it btw). Why am I talking about reading times? Well today at 2:00pm I started reading \\"SAHM I Am\\". I finished it at 5:07pm. I read a 325 page book in 3 hours. Even THAT is a record for me. It shows how good a book it was.SAHMs are Stay At Home Moms. Of course I am not one, but I will prally be one in the future (check back with me in about 8 years). However, even with that I totally enjoyed this book. It is written in email format, with a group of women who are members of a email mailing list for SAHMs. The book focuses on 5 women who bond together, in a chat outside of the email list, and the moderator of the list who is dealing with issues with her younger sister. The women are real and very relatable with hilarious and heartwarming situations. My favorite character is Dulcie and the funniest part in the book for me involved a romance novel inspired love letter. I laughed and laughed at her reaction. Another thing I liked is that the 5 women are not afraid to speak their mind and they let us know that they are annoyed with Rosalyn and the way that she comes off across in her moderator posts. But the reader finds out why she acts the way she does so it's understandable, but for a while yes, this reader agreed with the 5 women. I enjoyed the sarcastic emails that would follow showing how the characters would feel after a Roslayn post. It made the books feel more real. I am really looking foward to the next book.The fact that there are no chapters in this book made it very hard to put down, as there is no stopping point. You just want to keep reading and reading. You really feel as if you are a part of the list as a lurker. However even with all the different storylines going around, you never feel lost. I hope that next time if I become a SAHM I am able to find a email group or something akin to this so I can find the same friendships and bond like these women do."},{"Title":"SAHM I Am (Life, Faith & Getting It Right #8) (Steeple Hill Cafe)","review":"SAHM I amThis book will give you some chuckles, and if you are like me, some real tears of both joy and sorrow, especially around page 240.

I too have a supportive circle of friends I've met online (I'm in California, two are in Texas and three in Ohio), so I can relate to this group of online pals.The most magnetic yet repellant character is Rosalyn \\"SAHM I am loop moderator\\".

The ability to show things like facial expressions and body language - not to mention other physical characteristics had to come through in letter format rather than through the visual \\"eyes\\" of another character's point of view. A difficult task, but Ms. Efken pulled it off AMAZINGLY well!SAHM I Am is laugh-out-loud funny in spots and poignantly touching in others. Each character's story is interwoven with the others in a separate yet blended way. But when one member's life spins out of control, can these women reach outside the boundaries of their email programs and put their friendships to an in-person, real-life test? Can stay-at-home moms who meet \\"online\\" become truly good friends?I had a chance to interview author Meredith Efken on my Spotlight page of my website.

It brings to life characters who never actually meet, but only know each other through their e-mail loop for Stay-At-Home-Moms. I loved the concept, but honestly at first I wondered if this type of story would work for me. It didn't take long for me to be swept into the drama of these women's lives. The humor was to-die-for-funny and the problems each woman experienced was so real, and sooo honest. I think I got the biggest kick out of the loop moderator who used her issues with her sister to launch her self-righteous-sounding topics-of-the-week. And that Dulcie was tooooo cute. I highly recommend this story for all women, even if you aren't a stay-at-home-mom. I'm not. I work full-time. But I could relate to the e-mail relationships. I have many friends that I've never met in person, but I feel like I really know. This story is guaranteed to touch your heart.

The book recounts the witty repartee between the members of a fictional Stay-At-Home-Mothers online discussion group. The style is fresh and inventive and the writing is a laugh a minute. You don't have to be a SAHM yourself to enjoy this awesome novel. It has across-the-board appeal.The friends in this chat group swap stories, offer advice and support each other through the good, the bad, the just plain frustrating, and the sort of daily misadventures that only happen when kids are in the picture. The back and forth email threads are a blast to follow. It's fun to get to know and relate to these characters as they share their lives with each other in the loop.This is the kind of book you could easily read straight through from cover to cover... or it would be, if you didn't keep getting interrupted by the kids.In my opinion, I'd call SAHM I Am an instant classic.

Do you often feel lonely, discouraged, driven crazy?Then pick up a copy of Meredith Efken's debut novel and lose yourself in the lives of the women who belong to the SAHM I AM e-mail loop.Scattered across America, these women share their joys and tears through e-mail, drawing support and encouragement from one another.Through a sub-loop called Green Eggs and Ham, we learn of five women and their struggles. There's Dulcie, whose husband who is constantly on out-of-town job assignments and a mother-in-law whose wedding is turning into a stage show. Artistic Zelia's desire for her children to express themselves is threatened by her husband's decision for them to attend school. Jocelyn is heartbroken when her son can't seem to shake normal childhood pains. Brenna must come to grips with farm life and her husband's desire for children. Completing the group is Phyllis, the pastor's wife whose youthful mistakes resurface to threaten her family's security.Let's not forget loop moderator Rosalyn and her sister, Veronica. Their insufferable relationship prompts many of Rosalyn's weekly topics for the e-mail loop. Will Veronica's latest bid for attention destroy the last fragments of their relationship?SAHM I AM is a laugh a minute. But don't get too comfortable; just as you settle into the fun pace of the story, Meredith turns things around and touches sensitive subjects.I found Meredith's e-mail message format refreshing. It effectively pulled me into the lives of the characters, cutting away use of description and narrative. The clever dialogue gives the story a more intimate feel. The lack of chapter breaks also makes the book very hard to put down.As a stay-at-home mom myself, I would recommend this book to any woman who chooses to remain home with her young children. The issues these women face ring true for any stay-at-home mom.

While the primary email loop is called the SAHM I AM loop and moderated by the self righteous Rosalyn, there is a secondary one, Green Eggs and Ham in which the more disgruntled members diss Ros and her toady, Connie. Through the months covered, crises frequently pop up; marital woes, adoption and fertility issues, child rearing catastrophes, past mistakes that need to be paid for in the present, and health issues that may not be life threatening but are heart breaking. Rosalyn's life is not as trouble free and June Cleaverish as she pretends on the loop, and her facade could collapse if her sister is allowed to join the group, because Ronnie knows the truth that Ros is not a Proverbs 31 ideal woman.*** While there is no one main plot, a series of subplots threads together. Though this lack of coherence is a definite drawback, the characters are so true to life that there is something endearing about this novel. Anyone who has been on a loop with a troll will be doing their best bobble head impression, nodding along with the on target descriptions of the reactions of the Green Eggs group to the bad aspects of the SAHM one. Yet, there is also the very positive light that is shone on how supportive and true email friends can be. ***"},{"Title":"SAHM I Am (Life, Faith & Getting It Right #8) (Steeple Hill Cafe)","review":"I would have liked to know that the book would be so Christian.

But where else could they discuss things like...Success: Her workaholic husband is driving Dulcie Huckleberry around the bend. It's hard to love someone in sickness and in health when he's never home!Art: Let the children express themselves, opines artistic Zelia Muzuwa, and then her son's head gets stuck inside a kitty scratching post . . .Health: Surely aches and pains are normal in an active little boy, yet those of soccer-mom Jocelyn Millard's son don't seem to be going away.Motherhood: Teen-mom-turned-farmer's-wife Brenna Lindberg can deal with the mud and the chickens, but what about her husband's desire for a child of his own?Indiscretions: However youthful, they can come back to haunt you, learns pastor's wife Phyllis Lorimer.Amends: These could stand to be made between officious list moderator Rosalyn Ebberly and her pampered sister, Veronica. Perhaps the other SAHM I AMers can teach these two something about sisterhood.Camy here:This has got to be one of the funniest books I've read this year. That says a lot because I don't even HAVE children, and I tend to dislike books about moms since I can't really relate. But this book about stay-at-home mothers struck a deep chord with me.The book isn't just about stay-at-home moms, although the heroines are SAHMs. The funnier, sassier theme is hypocrisy within the church. These Christian mothers connect via the internet, but their deeper characters come through despite the \\"impersonal\\" medium of emails. The things that happen to these SAHMs aren't as hilarious as the kinds of people they interact with on their email loop and the way they relate to each other.The Christian stereotypes are all there, three-dimensional and easily recognizable. Those of us deeply involved in ministry and serving in our churches will recognize the different types of \\"Mary\\"s and \\"Martha\\"s and \\"Jezebel\\"s, but sometimes with an unexpected twist. The vibrant characterization made me laugh at my own preconceived notions but also think about my perceptions of my local family in Christ.I spend a lot of time on email with my friends and family, so the email format was both familiar and a clever fictional tool. There is a wealth of rich, hilarious subtexting going on--things NOT said versus the things actually written in the email. There's also an incredible amount of tongue-in-cheek sarcasm that had me rolling.The humor reminded me of Penny Culliford's British best-seller \\"Theodora's Diary.\\" \\"SAHM I Am\\" has the same type of dry, clever wit that I love, moreso than the more common, obvious humor in slapstick.The book is like many other Chick-Lits in that it's more character-driven (strong spiritual threads) than plot-driven by a single thread of action. However, there are five clear subplots interwoven together, taking the place of one main one, with Dulcie's plot taking precedence over the others. It wasn't difficult for me to follow them.The heroines are relatively young (twenties to thirties) so young mothers will definitely relate. I also think this will appeal to singles, because the humor is not centered around motherhood as much as it's a commentary on Christians in the church."},{"Title":"SAHM I Am (Life, Faith & Getting It Right #8) (Steeple Hill Cafe)","review":"I am falling in love with \\"Steeple Hill Cafe!!!\\" This is just one of the books by this publisher that I have enjoyed reading as a Christian SAHM.I applaud Meredith in her ability to portray different mothering styles.

Her marriage is in trouble and it's partly her fault. It doesn't help when Tom reads an e-mail about him she sent to the loop. She thought it was funny. He didn't.Brenna, who has one daughter, the result of an earlier stupid choice, is now married and wants another child, but her husband is infertile. She has to put up with remarks like, \\"If my husband just looks at me, I get pregnant.\\" One of these days she's going to slip and ask, \\"Really?

But the women in SAHM I Am have not allowed their minds to turn to grape jelly. They provide each other a support network via their email connections and show how vital women's friendships are to their well being.Having been a SAHM for twenty years, I completely identified with these women. I saw parts of myself in each character--yes, even in Rosalyn, the obnoxious list moderator. Efken does a great job of clearly portraying each character as distinct, and their problems are realistic. I laughed aloud at some of the antics in the book. Every mother has experienced a dire, but not life-threatening emergency like having her child's head stuck in a kitty scratching post.Efken's wry humor and the book's unusual format (as a series of emails), reminded me of the hilarious Up the Down Staircase, published in 1965. I look forward to \\"@ Home for the Holidays,\\" the second book in the series, due out in November 2006."},{"Title":"SAHM I Am (Life, Faith & Getting It Right #8) (Steeple Hill Cafe)","review":"Many women know what it's like to be a stay-at-home mom. Those women who have sought information, friendship, and communication on the Internet also know what it's like to be part of email loops, both large and small. Meredith Efken has captured the best-and some of the worst-of both worlds perfectly in her new mom lit book SAHM I Am (Steeple Hill Caf&eacute;, 2005).Rosalyn is the nearly-perfect list moderator for \\"SAHM I Am,\\" an impossibly-large email loop for Christian stay-at-home moms. The characters we grow to love are actually a part of a smaller sub-group they've titled \\"Green Eggs and Ham\\" : Dulcie, the wife of a workaholic husband; Zelia, a free-spirited, artistic woman; Jocelyn, a typical soccer mom; farmer's wife Brenna, who was a teen mom; pastor's wife Phyllis; and Veronica, Rosalyn's younger sister.Having been a part of many different email loops and Internet communities in the past several years, I related with much of this book. In fact, when I finished the book, I wrote on my blog: \\"This woman GETS it. In multiple personalities, no less!\\" How Efken was able to keep so many distinct email \\"voices\\" going for the entire book is nothing short of amazing.The unique format of this book adds to its charm. It is just like lurking in an email group! (For those who are not Internet savvy, \\"lurking\\" is like eavesdropping on someone else's conversation, or reading someone else's mail.) It is so much fun to unravel all the different relationships, email threads, conversations, and tensions. These women are portrayed so accurately and with such wit and humor that it is very difficult to put this book down. I was annoyed by Rosalyn's aphorisms, chuckled at Veronica's digs at her sister, cried over Phyllis's parsonage pain, understood Zelia's desire to conquer creative clutter, and felt like Dulcie was a woman I could really relate with.The support the \\"Green Eggs and Ham\\" women show each other is very much like an online community in which I'm involved. The women pray together over the challenges they face: unemployment, clutter, child's illness, infertility, and many others. They also laugh with each other when Zelia relates the story of how her son gets his head caught in the kitty's scratching post.SAHM I Am made me laugh, made me cry, and made me think a lot about online relationships and communication as well as the challenges of being an at-home mom. In tone it reminds me of Robin Jones Gunn's Sisterchick books, with just the right blend of humor and pathos.Expect more great things from Meredith Efken.

I thought that Meredith did an excellent job on the book. I loved all the relationships and the e-mails going back and forth. What a refreshing format. This wasn't just a fun book though, it was deep and caused me to think deeper about my life and my relationships with my husband, kids, and other moms. I read this book in about a day. It was too good to put down.shannon"},{"Title":"SAHM I Am (Life, Faith & Getting It Right #8) (Steeple Hill Cafe)","review":"(And yes, I have read more than a few!) It was warm, funny, but also poignant. I laughed and cried. It's an easy and quick read, but not without some very deep thoughts as well.The entire book consists of emails, which I thought was quite clever. Also quite a challenge for the author, to differentiate between the \\"voices\\" without having the usual writer's props like descriptions of the people's facial expressions, looks, etc. Meredith Efkin does a wonderful job with this new form. I have 6 friends and 3 daughters now waiting to read it, so this one will be well-read before it ever makes it to our library shelf."},{"Title":"SAHM I Am (Life, Faith & Getting It Right #8) (Steeple Hill Cafe)","review":"The SAHM I AM email loop consists of several stay at home mothers (Rosalyn, Dulcie, Zelia, Jocelyn, Brenna, and Phyllis) sharing gossip, desires, and woes with one another. Self righteous and perfect Rosalyn moderates the discussions that focus on success, art, health, motherhoods, indiscretions, and amends. Because Rosalyn behaves like everyone is beneath her, a secret secondary loop the Green Eggs and Ham has formed, which mostly complains about Rosalyn' holier than thou behavior.Rosalyn panics because her sister Veronica wants to join the SAHM I AM group. She does not want Ronnie as a member because her sibling knows the truth that Roz's life is far from perfect or close to living the pious life of the Proverbs as she implies she does.SAHM I AM is a more a series of interactive vignettes rather than a prime plotted novel, but fans of contemporary tales with a web connection will appreciate this fine look at motherhood in the modern era. The tale emphasizes the many to many relationships that IT has provided without any of the participants having to come face to face. The characters seem genuine and though an ensemble cast has differing personalities making for a fun read.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Fueling the Teen Machine","review":"Fueling the Teen Machine has been on my \\"to-read\\" list for months now, and when I finally had some free time in my schedule, I couldn't wait to sit down and check it out!My thoughts?? I LOVED IT! What a refreshingly down-to-earth approach to making nutrition accessible for busy teens!It covers diverse topics ranging from MyPyramid, carbs/fats/protein, vitamins and minerals, physical activity, sports nutrition, vegetarianism, \\"funky foods,\\" body image, the list goes on and on! Not to mention the tons of delicious looking recipes found in the back! I've already got my eye on the 3 Cheese Macaroni, Oatmeal Apple Cookies and Angel-Devil Smoothie :)But perhaps what makes this book so successful is that it isn't talking to parents or teachers, but to the teens themselves! As the transitional time between being a kid and adult, authors Ellen and Colleen speak TO teens not AT them, stressing that YOU are the only one who has the power and control over your health!Whether it's enhancing teens' abilities on stage, in the kitchen, on the field, or in the classroom, Fueling the Teen Machine has now gone from my \\"to-read\\" list to my \\"MUST-read\\" list!\\"--I've recommended it to all my friends!"},{"Title":"Fueling the Teen Machine","review":"I purchased this book as part of my homeschool health curriculum, but I found that I didn't even have to assign chapters out of it. The kids would just pick it up and read it at will. The writing style is engaging for teens, the subject matter relevant, the theme positive. The kids themselves started initiating changes in their food choices after reading it."},{"Title":"Fueling the Teen Machine","review":"Loved the book for adult reading however, I found it to be a bit heavy for a teenager's reading habits."},{"Title":"The Brandons,","review":"This is the first book I have read by Angela Thirkell and I am determined to read all of the other novels she has written.Of all the authors I have read with claims attached to them of being &quot;modern day Austens&quot;, Angela Thirkell is the only one that lives up to that claim, in my opinion.In &quot;The Brandons&quot;, as in Austen's literature, one senses a &quot;match&quot; in the offing and Mrs. Brandon spends much of her thinking on how to match up Miss Morris with one of her eligible male friends. The book is delightful, charming, funny, and full of astute observations on human nature...just like Jane Austen's writings. Read it!"},{"Title":"The Brandons,","review":"Unexpectedly wonderful. I had read somewhere that Thirkell was a bit of a poor-man's Nancy Mitford. Well that might have been for some of her novels - my knowledge of her full body of works is not great - but the Thirkells is a wonderful descent into glorious pre-World War II English Countryside.The book is chokka with great and memorable characters and has an appealing plot which has a few twists in it to keep things very interesting indeed. In fact it starts as a simple premise of a family waiting for an inheritance, as such, as ends as a very sweet romance indeed.It all starts with the sickness of a maiden aunt, Sissie - who lives in a mouldering pile and keeps threatening to will it all away from various relatives if only to keep them on their toes. Trouble is the various relatives - or at least two of them Mr Grant, and Francis and Brandon - don't actually want the mouldering estate anyway. No matter how poor they are they can see that it will be a bit of a white elephant - or at the very least a very damp hippotamus.The Brandon's come with a wonderfully vague mother who keeps getting read bits of boring pieces of writing by adoring males in the area, and Hilary Grant comes with a hideously annoying mother whom nobody - except possibly the reader - can like. This book is very much in the vein of E E Benson's Lucia Series - although those were individual masterpieces of machivellian cunning- this book is a fun and rather distinguished country romp.Apparently Thirkell wrote a number of stories in which the same characters turn up - all of which is set in the Barchester land of Anthony Trollope so there is enough connection among these books to make for quite an extensive bit of connected reading (if anyone is interested of course). It has all the satisfaction of a nice twisting plot with the pleasant relief of a happy and romantic ending to look forward to."},{"Title":"The Brandons,","review":"Angela Thirkell's books fall into a typically English genre: the gentle goings on of a set of eccentric (usually upper class) villagers. The books amusing and make an enjoyable quick read. Although I understand where the comparisons to Jane Austen are coming from, I think they are off the mark, though. I think P.G. Wodehouse is a fairer comparison, without so much silliness (which I love). These little trifles don't have the depth or subtlety of Austen's works. However, for a light read where you like most of the characters and wish them well, you can't beat Thirkell. My favorite is Cheerfulness Breaks In."},{"Title":"The Brandons,","review":"An English classic of that golden time between the Wars. Angela Thirkell writes a wonderful comedy of manners dealing with both young and mature love among the upper classes set in that time and place.Nadia May, whose real name is Wanda McCaddon,has per herAudioFilebiography, worked as a reporter, a University professor and an actress. She has narrated books under the names Donada Peters, Margaret McKay, Ann Miles and Leonarda Stafford. She is a grande dame of audio book narration and her voice, mature-- yet precise, lends itself well to this gently paced story.If you are an anglophile, an audiophile or maybe just want a story that does not involve a lot of blazing guns and dead bodies then I definitely recommend all 10 hours of this story. This will make the reader smile and maybe even laugh out loud."},{"Title":"The Brandons,","review":"I'm collecting and reading Angela Thirkell's Barsetshire books as I can find them (thank God for Amazon's Marketplace and my local used book store, as many of them are out-of-print) and I think I'm addicted - they never fail to make me smile, even laugh out loud. When her books first came out in the 1930's and '40's she was sometimes compared to Jane Austen for her humorous portrayals of everyday life and love among the country house set, although she wasn't considered in Austen's league - but then, who could be? On the jacket of one of her used books the blurb says Thirkell \\"blends the humour of Wodehouse with the social observation of Trollope to create a wonderfully witty comedy of manners\\" and I agree, although I think where Thirkell's situations are funny Wodehouse's are sillier and almost devolve into slapstick (mainly due to the mental deficiency of Bertie Wooster and many of his friends!)Thirkell's humor is dry to the bone, her characters are snobbish, witty, charming by turns, but never caricatures. You can feel her affection for even the most obnoxious or ridiculous among them (Aunt Sissie and Mrs. Grant, I'm talking to you!) I always feel that affection and acceptance of all of her characters pays homage to Anthony Trollope, from whom Thirkell borrowed not just the mythical English county he invented for his brilliant novels (Barsetshire), but many of the places and families as well. Thirkell may never be Austen or Trollope but she always makes me laugh and marvel at creating such a wonderful world full of interesting, silly, delightful people - delicious!"},{"Title":"Planet of the Apes: (Jr Novel)","review":"This book was written for kids who enjoyed the remake of Planet of the Apes. Grown-ups will probably not enjoy it but it was not intended for grown-ups. The book is a nice effort for the kids. The mediocre script for the movie did not leave the author of the book with much to work with. It is nice to see that a new generation of Apes has begun and I welcome the effort of the author."},{"Title":"Planet of the Apes: (Jr Novel)","review":"I have the hard copy, and its a very nice souvenir or memory of the Tim Burton film. The book itself has tons of awesome movie stills, hand drawn storyboards, a section on the mask making process, costume designs, amazing transformations of actors into chimps, plus the entire screenplay word for word. I also enjoyed the full page key info on every one of the star actors.Being a huge Planet of the Apes fan (as well as Tim Burton) since its inception back in my teenage years(1968)..I don't think its fair to rate the movie or plot here. The book is a nice way to learn more about the film, film making, special effects, and Tim Burton's creative process. Very nice collector's item...if you can find the discounted version even better."},{"Title":"Planet of the Apes: (Jr Novel)","review":"I liked this book overall, and it was interesting to see the changes and deletions between te script and the finished film. The big problem I had was the omission of the ending scene in the screenplay, it just seems like a cop out to protect a secret that was already out at the time of the book's release A WEEK AFTER THE MOVIE CAME OUT. I wanted this book in hardback but for somereason it never came available, and I ended up settling for the paperback version. I have a feeling the Cinefex magazine covering Planet of the Apes will be much more informative for a lot less money."},{"Title":"Planet of the Apes: (Jr Novel)","review":"The copy of this book I have does NOT have the surprise ending that is in the film.

All those elements combined make it an excpetional piece of film memorabilia.Overall, this book does a great service to a movie that continues the great myth of &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;."},{"Title":"Planet of the Apes: (Jr Novel)","review":"This has everything to do with the recent movie and nothing to do with the real book. The real book had messages that were really lost in the recent film, it was close to a modern day Gulliver's Travels, raising questions about how we treat animals, our science and our society.This will no doubt be fairly close to the recent film, which is okay hokum.

I would agree that there are several pertinent questions asked, however many of the questions seem like they are 'space fillers'. This along with a lot of spacing and extremely large font look like an unfortunate attempt to make a 'book' ... out of something that could be written on 1-2 sheets of paper. Please don't get me wrong, I strongly believe in couples preparing for their engagements and marriages, and I believe that couples should talk about many of the subjects listed in this book, I just don't personally and professionally feel that this book is worth the money.

More importantly, the author reinforces this fact in this small book and extends the purview of the holiday- Kwanzaa should be celebrated throughout the year. Moreover, I agree with this assertion-I use Kwanzaa year around to remind me of the principles that are guiding my life. More importantly, the author provides practical exercises that can help mollify your day. For example, the Susu activity from Nigeria is very interesting; read the chapter on Ujamaa to find out more about it."},{"Title":"Practicing Kwanzaa Year Round","review":"As the summer 'merchandise mart' market approaches in Atlanta, where I live, thoughts are already turning to Christmas merchandise, and gift giving for the Holidays.This short book makes an ideal 'stocking stuffer' or gift to someone who may not be familiar with Kwanza, or its close similarity to its Jewish and Christian models, or so is my perspective.As many Christian churches become more 'inclusive and diverse' in their membership, the in-centering of African spirituality which is one outgrowth of the sixties 'consciousness' revolution, is often included in their formal or informal rituals of celebration. Thus, in the church I attend, Oakhurst Presbyterian, (see separte review O Lord Hold Our Hands: How a Church Thrives a Multicultural World, Stroupe and Leach), Kwanza is annually a part of our Holiday celebration.As a way to recognize this process and celebrate it, this thoughtful short book suggests a daily attention to this celebration. While not all have the time for daily meditation,it is certainly worthwhile to suggest it, and is a welcomecontribution by this author to her other Kwanza books.Certainly, it is a title that should have perennial Holiday interest for many, many years to come.Howard M.

The author of \\"A Sense of Self\\" Susannah Sheffer was reading some of the literature and noticed a comment about how all of the girls in these studies were in the public school system. Susannah Sheffer has long been involved in homeschooling and wondered if the same types of problems were happening with girls who were being homeschooled. She was thinking outside of the box. So Susannah interviewed fifty-five homeschooled girls. She used many of the same questions in the original studies. \\"A Sense of Self\\" is the result of her study.Susannah Sheffer found that homeschooled girls had a stronger sense of self-esteem, a stronger voice, and were much more comfortable with who they were. She found that these girls had a great sense of freedom, they felt safe, and valued themselves.The author explores an idea that part of the problem for girls in public schools is they are encouraged to be passive and accept whatever the teachers and other public school employees tell them to do. In many ways homeschooling is an act of rebellion, parents are standing up to the social norms and saying they will be different. So homeschooled girls see this pattern of standing up for what they belief is best and right. Whereas in public schools, girls are taught what the teachers feel is best. Girls learn to go along with the group of children.Susannah Sheffer explores some ideas on how the public school system could provide a better environment, which would nurture girls so they could retain their sense of self.This was a fascinating book. It is well written, and has a number of interesting ideas and comments. If you are concerned with the struggles girls go through, this is worth reading."},{"Title":"A Sense of Self: Listening to Homeschooled Adolescent Girls","review":"This book is a real eye-opener for any girl considering homeschooling.

I'm looking forward to reaping some of these benefits of homeschooling..."},{"Title":"The Silence","review":"THE SILENCE is the last of Bjorneboe's trilogy of novels called \\"The History of Bestiality\\" and departs markedly from the preceding two. The first, MOMENT OF FREEDOM (1966), focuses on \\"Germania\\" as the outstanding source of mankind's brutality: the two world wars, the concentration camps, the racism. Bolshevism figures in it as just another face of fascism. The second novel, POWDERHOUSE (1969), delves into more remote history as it offers examples of the hero's research into the Inquisition, exposing the pious instinct as an instrument of control and the crowd mentality as a blood lust. In THE SILENCE (1973) the autobiographical hero finds himself in northern Africa, conversing with a character named Ali, who has much in common with Frantz Fanon. From this remote station his eyes peer at Europe, the colonializer and source of misery for the Third World. Germania no longer stands out. As Ali instructs him, the perspective inside Europe is wrong, for it holds up Hitler as a moral monster, a boogeyman, an exception to the rule; whereas, seen through the eyes of the colonialized, he is the rule--the colonial powers were equally ruthless, killed more than the Nazis and lasted longer than the Third Reich. Accordingly, the author of The History of Bestiality now catalogs the crimes of the first conquering Europeans, the Conquistadores: Cortez over the Aztecs in Mexico and Pisarro over the Incas in Peru. Incredible scenes of carnage roll across the pages with the same remorseless attention to detail and biting sarcasm as before, but with even greater urgency and rage than in the preceding novels. However, the account has become one-sided: the sacrifices of children by the pre-Columbian Indians and their pleasure in wearing human pelts replete with face and scalp until they rotted and fell away are minimized and excused by the rapacious gold-lust of the detestable foreigners.Thus Bjorneboe arrives at a position anticipating the leftist platforms in America and Europe that dominated the last three decades of the twentieth century: Political Correctness and selective Multiculturalism. All history is reinterpreted to the detriment of the First World and to the credit of the Third. All filth and evil come from the former; all goodness and hope come from the latter; and the speaker, who happens to belong to the former, is absolved of his sins by promoting the latter. It is a sham doctrine the same as Leninism, from which it derives--the vanguard speaking for the proletariat. Yet unlike the high priests of PC, Bjorneboe is not interested in changing university curricula, dominating the scholarly press or dictating hiring practices, meanwhile winning a cushy spot for himself while stabbing non-conformist scholars in the back, but rather he retains the old fire of the sixties and finally, at long last, puts his faith in revolution. The subject peoples of the world, he asserts, the insulted and the injured, the wretched and the ragged, the downtrodden and the disadvantaged, will one day rise up to claim their freedom, their rightful portion of the Earth's bounty and their sunny place in history. The present moment is but the still--Stillheten, The Silence--before the storm.Given this ideology, the didactic tone and the absence of form(the novel is mostly a series of conversations) THE SILENCE should not work. And yet it is brilliant and highly readable, thanks in part to Murer's excellent translation and in part to the author's sheer inventiveness. The hero meets a penitent Christopher Columbus in the street, converses with Robespierre and debates with God, who looks like a shabby street vendor, only \\"without a cart.\\" These scenes are absolutely brilliant, and the trilogy itself, despite its flaws, voices a passion that is exceptional in world literature and a spiritual peak for mankind.Bjorneboe did not find a solution to the problem of evil. How could he? But after reading him, one cannot fail to be a lot more distrustful of authority, a lot more skeptical of do-gooders and a lot more critical of everything. Which is good."},{"Title":"The Silence","review":"Hope and destruction are intertwined, evil is contemplated, yet not stated, historical facts are the basis of philosophical uncertanty and diffuse political firmness. This low-pitched novel has the strength of coping with brutality with both irony and fearful seriousness. Time is not a straight line, but a melting pot of friendship, arrogance, torture and thought. The crecendo of time and history leaves room for a profound silence, fluently and mastefully communicated by one of the great authors of our time."},{"Title":"Telling the Truth to Troubled People","review":"Reading this book changed the way I minister to troubled people - myself included. It is the best blend of the Truths of Scriptures and the discoveries of the discipline of Psychology I have ever read. Begining with &quot;so you want to be a counselor,&quot; moving to how believing lies hurts all of us, and ending with solid information on the realities of mental illness and the need for medical as well as psychological and spiritual help, this book offers practical information and usable applications which do not compromise on Scriptual truths. It's about time that fundamental Christians stop being afraid of the findings of modern psychology and realize that the truths of Scripture are being discovered to be just that TRUTHS. &quot;Telling the Truth to Troubled People&quot; paves the way for incorportating the truths found in scripture with the documentation found in psychology. A MUST read for anyone who finds themselves in the counseling position - whether a &quot;professional&quot; or &quot;the one everyone comes to.&quot;"},{"Title":"Telling the Truth to Troubled People","review":"I had purchased the two prior titles to this one, \\"Telling Yourself the Truth\\" and \\"Telling the Truth to Others\\" and found them very good.

This should be on every book shelf of people that love the outdoors and nature. I would give it a six or seven stars if I could. I recommend."},{"Title":"The Ways of an Atheist","review":"Katz has produced a very delicate, humorous, and scholarly book that more often points out the absurdity of religion then disproving it. In many ways the book is an essential read for many students, in all parts of the world, but especially for Americans and Westerner's in general. Katz outlines the many hypocritical aspects that are often not obvious to the everyday churchgoer.Among the most striking parts of the book Katz remembers the hypocrisy of the church from his childhood, \\"I remember when at the height of the Great Depression, when folks hardly had enough to eat, a rabbi would travel to our community from Brooklyn to collect money for Yeshiva students. No doubt they felt it was more important to buttress rabbinical studies than to help those who had empty wallets and empty stomachs. Such experiences let a rotten taste in my mouth.\\"The short book, only 152 pages, reads fluidly and easily. Among the many interesting chapters, there is a series of questions on God, Morality, Magic, Miracles, and the Bible. There is an interesting chapter on Jesus, where he is depicted as a revolutionist trying to lead the Israeli's into an armed uprising against the Roman Empire. There are many interesting ideas and facts in this book.The interesting thing about such a book is that it is obvious that many atheists will read this and smile nodding their heads, while the majority who go to church and believe in God will probably never open it. It is doubtful that a Christian or a Jew would be converted through this book, but it is surely a work that will open up some minds to the harsh interpretations that society has created out of the works of revolutionaries, mystics, poets, and everyday workers."},{"Title":"The Ways of an Atheist","review":"Excellent book, well written, to the heart of the problem, you can see that is written by somebody who has studied the Bible and other sacred text of the 3 most important world religions.I didn't like the way was edited though. In any case a good introduction of a good first book for somebody who dare to venture in such complicated topic."},{"Title":"The Ways of an Atheist","review":"There were some interesting facts in this book and trivia. I liked the section that showed the &#34;sins&#34; of Jesus- all the times he acted contrary to his own teachings or broke the ten commandments. I found myself taking notes while reading this book, as I often do with atheist books. I wish the author had gone a little more in depth on some of the things he wrote about- it seemed like each chapter was short and was just a basic overview. This made the book a quick read, but at times left me wanting more. I found the information about the Scopes Monkey Trial to be really interesting, and I wish he had written more about it. My biggest problem with the book was that at times the author really seemed to be reaching- like the part about churches and church symbols relating to sexual organs and older religions, he didn't really prove his case to me, and seemed at times to be grasping at straws. It wasn't the best atheist book I read, but definitely had some good parts."},{"Title":"The Ways of an Atheist","review":"The book is interesting with lots of references and facts. I am distressed not being able to find out more about the author... is he the well known Katz or a wanna be? I feel more comfortable when I know I am reading from a scholar other that a writer expressing their opinions."},{"Title":"The Ways of an Atheist","review":"\\"The Ways of an Atheist\\" is certainly a different cup of tea - not a typical defense of a-theism. This is a collection of about 30 two to three page essays ranging from his personel religious opinions to listings of outrageous factiods on the three Abraham religions:Judaism, Christianity and Islam. I checked out on the net some of the presented information in a few of these essays that were most questionable to me such as the Jesus-Buddha mythology and the yoni art designs incorporated in Catholic church art. Sure enough, these parallels exist. While his writing style and argument approach aren't going to win adherents from believers and certainly will piss off some true atheists, his essays will make you think. I recommend buying a used copy and spending a few hours in a coffee shop. Its a quick read."},{"Title":"The Ways of an Atheist","review":"This is the worst book I've read read on atheism. Katz's conclusions are based on false premises and misinterpreted evidence. This book is a knee-jerk reaction to theism; the very reaction that allows theists to easily dismiss the atheist standpoint. The arguments that Katz sets out to establish have been presented better by other writers, particularly George Smith. Save your time and money--there are better books out there!"},{"Title":"The Ways of an Atheist","review":"Certainly a nice change of pace for a topic of this nature. 5 starts simply for this reason."},{"Title":"The Ways of an Atheist","review":"This book is so poorly written that I would not even want to give it away. It is composed of scraps about unassociated subjects all the way to Islam, with no cohesive reasoning. A definite throw-away!"},{"Title":"The Ways of an Atheist","review":"Any book that starts out by stating that it is based on sound scholarship is, in my view, immediately suspect. That even a \\"wah-wah\\" publisher such as Prometheus would bother to print such drivel is entirely beyond me. It is, as another reviewer has stated, a pointless hodge-podge of at best minimally related subjects. The author's views on various theological and Christian issues are laughable and based on the \\"argument from outrage\\", i.e., the idea that the God of the Bible does not exist because he is branded a moral monster. For example, he concludes that God effectively raped various women in the Bible, which is of course both utterly offensive and patently disprovable. This is a claim I have heard stated by atheists before, but I never thought I would actually see it in print. By the time I got through the first twenty pages or so I knew I wasting my time, and souring an otherwise perfectly good shrimp scampi. 1 star is too much for this garbage."},{"Title":"The Ways of an Atheist","review":"This book is one of the worst books I've ever read. None of the research from the Bible is even remotely close to the context it was written in. Can Katz even do a reasonable job at researching information? It doesn't even deserve one star."},{"Title":"Why Men Leave","review":"Dr. Shoshanna has written a book filled with insight (sometimes alarmingly so) of the way men who leave think about themselves and the women they are attracted to. Directly from their own words I came to understand that some men covet their fantasies so much that they could not possibly be in a real relationship. Other men express how their pain from past experiences keeps them so defended they could not be present either. Some men prefer adventure and others want to recapture the energy from their past. She has covered a wide range of perspectives.One thing women can learn from this book is that what they did and who they are is probably not to blame for why men leave them. It's more likely that they unknowingly pick men who were never really their in the first place. By reading this book they can begin to recognize these men before getting too involved and save themselves the pain.Men can learn to understand their own feelings better, help them through rough spots and gain insight when they are tempted to leave a good relationship or tempted to stay in a bad one.Dr. Shoshanna's insights and commentary along the way help to clarify the pattern. And she offers helpful suggestions to women and men in a particular situation or working with a certain pattern.This is a unique presentation of men's thinking and feeling. I found it fascinating. I read it from cover to cover."},{"Title":"Why Men Leave","review":"As a man, this is not normally the type of book I would buy. But so many men referred it to me, I had to see what it was about. Rarely have I encountered a book so compassionate to both men and women, and so filled with profound psychological, philosophical and spiritual truths. Don't be swayed by its popular title: this is as profound and meaningful book as one could hope to find, and as important to men as was IRON JOHN. It gave me deep insights into the male psyche that I had never considered before, and kept me up half the night with its engrossing stories. If you read one book on psychology or relationships this year, this should be it."},{"Title":"Why Men Leave","review":"This is coming from a man who was given this book by a friend as a joke. I can't believe the whiners that show up as her case studies! The author makes men seem so shallow &quot;what man wouldn't appreciate a beautiful wife by his side&quot;. What is that?! As a man, I appreciate the woman who has stood by my side for 15 years. I appreciate her laughter, her anger, her spirit, her drive, and of course her love. I have been asked the age-old question many times &quot;Would you still love me when my looks fade?&quot; My answer is from my heart and soul and it is always &quot;I will love you for who are, and what you will always mean to me.&quot; These simple heartfelt words are what my father had said to my mother, and they were together till they died. Marriage is not always perfect, but if you have someone who is as screwed up as the guys in this book, go out and find a real man. There are alot of them out there looking for a good woman. This book by no means, describes entire male population. There are &quot;Men who Don't Leave&quot;, and &quot;Men who when they say I Do, mean it for the rest of their lives&quot; Just avoid the whiners, and the losers. Good Luck! By the way, if you are one of those &quot;Men who Leave&quot; Grow-up! You are the only one who you can blame your unhappiness on. Have the courage to stay and make it better!

The real value of this book is to (a) teach women to recognize a doomed relationship early enough to move on without squandering their time, energy and sense of self-worth, and (b) reassure women that they didn't do anything \\"wrong\\" - if he's not ready for a commitment, no amount of love/work/wishful thinking can change that. Why Men Leave is chock full of informative, entertaining, helpful comments from real guys who aren't editing what they say to suit a girlfriend/wife/female friend, and that makes it well worth reading.One important word of caution: Don't fall into the same trap as the author! The most consistent message from the men in the book is \\"Please listen to what we *actually say*! Don't assume we see things the same way you do, because we don't. If we don't say something explicitly, we don't mean it.\\" The author understands this well enough to discuss it in the abstract, but when she talks about specifics she consistently breaks her own rule, with comments like \\"Of course Luke *should* have realized that...\\" or \\"*Naturally* Diane assumed that Frank would eventually pop the question....\\" ..."},{"Title":"Why Men Leave","review":"I bought this book hoping it could help explain why my boyfriend, after 3 years, decided that he simply was &quot;unhappy&quot; and wanted to break up.I enjoyed some of Dr. Shoshanna's other insights into communication but this book was way off for me. It seems like she took the extreme case scenarios when most of the time things and reasons are way more subtle. I could not relate my situation to any of the men or women in the book and if a lot of people can, then that is trully sad.I was with a man that was genuinly a great person and treated me well, always good to me, but had his own self esteem issues which permeated into the relationship. He had a difficult past and bad relationships that left him scared and i think unable to really commit for fear.Anyhow if your guy did you wrong, if you had a emotionally abusive relationship or if you were playing mind games with eachother this book is for you! Otherwise you may need insights from a more subtle observationist"},{"Title":"Why Men Leave","review":"This book was such a huge help to me. It is actually what got me over my &quot;hurdle&quot; (of relationship patterns, negativity and hang-ups). The title is misleading. I bought it not for that, but based on reviews. And to understand why I was having such a hard time even accepting a date anymore. I was about to settle into being a &quot;content&quot; single, when I knew it was not what I really wanted. I knew I could be happier. It helped me realize the difference between a complete and incomplete relationship. It helped me let go of the low self esteem, I didn't know I had, and blame for both parties. And become myself again. I didn't even realize how much my last relationship changed who I was and how I view what a relationship is."},{"Title":"Why Men Leave","review":"I wasn't looking for a book on why men leave... but on the fear of commitment. I have enjoyed this author's other book about Zen and falling in love... and browsing the first pages intrigued me.I will never understand why anyone thinks this is just a masculine problem. I think that certain people, for whatever reason, value their own personal freedom above anything else, yet everyone, of course, would like to have a loving partner to go through life with. I wish this book had more insight into how TWO people like this, male, female... whatever... can find freedom within the confines of relationship."},{"Title":"Why Men Leave","review":"This book will only reinforce all the things that women hate about men. It may be the truth but basically the book says, men do this and are this way for this reason and if you don't like it or can't handle it then leave. It does explain why and how men leave, but it just makes men look like spoiled little brats who refuse to live in reality. If a man can read this and see that most men who leave and want to leave have issues that they need to work on internally and take the messages to heart and action--this book CAN be helpful to men. If you were left by a man or are a man contemplating leaving, this book can help you to know that you shouldn't take anything a man with issues does to you personally, there are just issues, mainly being in touch with their own spirituality, that will help men grow up and face reality. I agree with the reader below, Real Men Stay and don't run away, they realize that it takes effort on their part to make the relationship better. Everyone should stand back and review their own behavior and the effects once in awhile and stop being so selfish."},{"Title":"Why Men Leave","review":"To be brief, I now have an understanding of relationships I never had before.

You would not understand the book anyway."},{"Title":"Why Men Leave","review":"This book is not good or bad, just this one of the number of books out there talking about man & woman relationships, nothing groundbreaking. The approach of the book is a bit mixed, based on the Freud and Jung school of psychology. There is nothing bad with that, just to my experience, transactional analysis and/or behavior analysis is way more efficient to describe the relationships of couples. To me, the big difference between these schools is that while Freud and Jung were focused more on psychologically sick people, transactional analysis has more to say for everyday people who just have their average problems of relationships. You can really feel this difference in the book, as the examples shown are more 'extreme' than typical. Then again, there's nothing wrong with that, just it is of less practical use for everyday, healthy people.To start to explore this area, I would rather read books from Allan Pease, which sound light and funny for the first read, but are of more practical use in your everyday life. Then I would go for books of Deborah Tannen on men & women communications, which help to understand a lot about what, why and how your partner tells/talks. If you still have energy, and want to improve on the long term and understand things at a deeper level, go for the excellent Mars & Venus series of John Gray PhD, or even some more advanced psychology books in Transactional Analysis (Thomas Gordon, Eric Berne, Carl Rogers). Then, if you still have time and effort, then is a good idea to read this book of B. Shoshanna.The situations, the approach and conclusions of this book are OK to me; however you need some reading background, some kind of 'good attitude' to adequately interpret its findings. I think this book is really not a practical guide that you can 'read & use'; rather it just fits well in the big picture and is a very good book for after thinking as 'yet another aspect on the subject'."},{"Title":"Why Men Leave","review":"Hi-to the disgusted man. I didn't read this book, but I was thinking about buying it- I saw what you wrote and you reminded me that people like you really exist.

I am not looking for perfection-but I do appreciate a man with your attitude-as in if times get rough-stay together and make it through-and beyond-I like to know people are out there like that. My bestfriend (before dating)/ex-boyfriend always left when things started to get rough--everytime.

Every character in this novel was one-dimensional, and the book was so dialogue heavy. It never SHOWED me what the characters were feeling, but only what they were saying. I love Diana Palmer but this book was such a dissapointment. I wanted to love it, but I did not care about whether the characters got together or whether they lived or died. This was one of the worst books I've ever read. The only reason I finished it was to be fair to one of my favorite authors. Pass on this one; it's a waste of time. Try Palmer's Lacy."},{"Title":"The Case of the Missing Secretary (Long Tall Texans: Most Wanted, Book 3)","review":"Kit got fired from her job as Logan's secretary two weeks ago because of comments she made about his fianc&eacute;e, Betsy. Kit knows that Betsy ruined a man, taking him for all he was worth and doesn't want that to happen to Logan, the fact she's in love with him doesn't make her any more objective about the whole situation. Now Logan realizes how good he had it with Kit and wants her back, but she wants no part of it, and so begins a tale of malevolent children, wedding hungry men, sex obsessed bosses and white wedding virgins.I honestly can't begin to describe just how truly awful this book it. The plot is utterly ridiculous, the worst being Logan's young cousin's who kidnap, assault and vandalize the property of anyone brave enough to come on their property, while their father asks every woman he meets to marry him, to get someone to raise the children (read demons), he ignores. Then there's Logan, a MASSIVE jerk who doesn't think there is anything wrong with sleeping with Kit while engaged to Betsy because he's only marrying Betsy because she won't put out anyway. Once he finds out Kit loves him he uses her feelings to try to get her to sleep with him even thought she is a never been touched virgin, and he doesn't even have a twinge of continuous about having an affair with her when he's committed to someone else because it wouldn't be some cheap one night stand because he needs more time than that before he was ready to move on, Kit's feelings be damned. Not to mention he kept an apartment just to screw women in and that was the only place he ever took Kit, yeah, real classy. And finally there's Kit who is just about every spunky virgin heroine clich&eacute; combined into one annoying character.I am not what you would call a Diana Palmer fan but I have read a book or two by her before and they were fine, I didn't love them but I sure didn't hate them. This was a joke. The heroine is treated like crap by Logan, despite all their blow out fights, all he has to do is snap his fingers and she comes running to him.I can't even begin to describe how horrible this is. Maybe as some kind of spoof of a secretary/boss romance this would work but this is supposed to be serious.

The first of which, The Case of the Mesmerizing Boss, was my favorite. The second was okayyyyy and this one was pretty good. You could tell right away that the Hero was obsessed with her and wanted her. He was just the typical blind Hero who didn't get that his destiny was right in front of him - that he needed her - wanted her - and loved her until the very end. I always like the commaderie with the other characters in her stories. You always know that they will eventually have their own books.The Hero was tall, gorgeous, smoked ALOT (but I guess men smoked alot during that time period), and was domineering. Not too much for me to not like him - knowing that DP usually writes the same kind of Hero in all of her books. The heroine was beautiful, feisty, totally in love with the Hero, but strong enough not to let him just take over her life.

I've been a libertarian for as long as I've been anything; as far as I'm concerned, we'd all be better off without the governmental institutions of the territorial nation-state. (Oh, we need courts and stuff, but I'm not persuaded that these work any better with territorial nation-states than without them.)But as long as territorial nation-states do exist, it would be nice to have folks at the helm who would work to undo, or at least counterbalance, all the mischief these Leviathans cause. It's a simple matter of economic fact that the poor are poorer than they would be without government intervention in the economy. If the folks at the economic margins are, for example, receiving less medical care than they'd have received in a genuinely free society, then isn't there a case to be made that the government that caused this problem has some responsibility for correcting it?And even for hard-core libertarians, there's an argument in favor of some forms of antitrust law -- namely, that powerful megacorporations exist in the first place only because they enjoy various sorts of protection from the state, and therefore the state has some sort of responsibility to keep them in check. Sure, it would be better to end protectionism and \\"crony capitalism\\" altogether. But if that doesn't happen, an admittedly distant second best is for the State to regulate the monsters it has created. It may not be ideal by libertarian standards, but it sure beats having legislators and judges in the corporations' pockets.All of this is by way of explaining why I, a libertarian whose politics are in some respects at least superficially at odds with Stephen Gaskin's, am writing a highly favorable review of this book.See, Stephen ran for president in 2000, and this book is a collection of excerpts from writings and interviews that describe his platform. More generally, it's about what it might be like to have a hippie in the White House. And some readers will dismiss it as (what they think is) the usual hippie claptrap.It's no such thing. For one thing, as anyone familiar with Stephen's own history is surely aware, he's strongly in favor of self-reliance at the level of the local community. He doesn't want the feds to operate charitable, welfare-promoting institutions; he wants _us_ to do it, just as they do it on the Farm (the commune in Tennessee that Stephen helped found some thirty years ago; it's still there).He also has a healthy distrust of government authority, although you might not know it from his views on (e.g.) gun control. I'm against gun-control-by-law myself, not because I want to have an arsenal in my basement, but because I don't trust any government that doesn't trust an armed citizenry. I don't think Stephen is entirely consistent on this issue and I don't think making people disarm under government authority is any more peaceful or nonviolent than holding the gun on them yourself. There are other, more genuinely peaceful ways to encourage people to lay down their arms.But despite a few disagreements on some points with some of Stephen's specific views on what the government should ideally do, I agree completely with where his opinions are _from_, if you follow me. There are some differences in what we see, but we're looking out from the same place.I'd love to see the Greens and the Libertarians get closer together. And I can get behind every one of Stephen's aims as long as I'm allowed to be a little critical about exactly _how_ they're implemented.So if you're curious what it might be like to have a hippie in the White House, check this out. Stephen and his crew are kind folks, and given the extreme unlikelihood of my _ever_ agreeing at every point with a political candidate, I'd be more likely to vote for him on the basis of his overall vision than to vote for a real creep who happens to agree with me on a few specific points. As they say, when the wrong person does the right thing, it's the wrong thing; the corollary is obvious."},{"Title":"Spiritual Gifts: Their Purpose & Power","review":"If you are looking for a well-balanced book on Spiritual Gifts, this is it! In researching for a class I'm teaching in the Netherlands on the gifts I looked at and read numerous books on the topic. This was the most comprehensive and well-balanced I found. Bryan Carraway does an excellent job of approaching the topic objectively and always defers to the Bible whenever possible. This book is rooted in the Word and when Mr. Carraway offers his opinion, he's very careful to identify it as such. He clearly holds the Bible as authoritative in all things.He begins by defining and explaining the the differing points of views on the matter ranging from the Charismatic movement to absolute cessationism. I thought he gave both sides, as well as those in between, a fair hearing and presented their cases fairly. Some of the best advice offered in the book is to obey your church leaders submissively and not be the cause of dissention. Once I read that, I knew I had the right book!!! If you're looking for ammunition to blast \\"the other side\\" this isn't the right book for you. If you, rather, are looking for a serious study on the gifts of the Spirit, what they are, where they come from, how they are ideally employed, how to grow them, and some examples in history of how they were used, this is the best choice I've found outside of the Bible.The book is well documented with excellent footnotes as well as a very comprehensive \\"Spiritual Gifts Inventory\\" in the appendices. Many have been critical of these types of inventories claiming that we shouldn't limit the Spirit. I'm not one to speak for Mr. Carraway, but from reading his book, I suspect he would agree on the point of not limiting the Spirit. His inventory is properly used as a gauge for beginning to get an idea of where the Spirit is leading a person. I don't think any inventory should be used conclusively, but I do think it's accurate in identifying possible directions or confirming gifts.Read this book and expand your horizons for letting God use you to carry out His will. I heartily give this book my warm recommendation."},{"Title":"Spiritual Gifts: Their Purpose & Power","review":"\\"Spiritual Gifts\\" By Bryan Carraway is a welcome addition to the current teachings in this field. His approach to the subject is both relevant and relational. His explanations on the gifts gave me personal insight into areas I had been struggling with in my own life.The book begins with an overview of God's interaction with people throughout the Scriptures. I really appreciate this foundation and the fact that the Old Testament is brought into consideration. This flows well with his argument that God has always been active in the gifts. He gives a well researched argument against cessationism (belief which states gifts ended with Apostles).I also appreciated the outlining of the major beliefs -- constitutional versus manifestational and people like me who have a hybrid view on the subject.I have never been one for strict divisions when it comes to theology. But the classification system Mr. Carraway uses is helpful, if at least from the stance of study. Many gifts, I believe can overlap, but we do have to have some way of looking at them. The contemporary and biblical examples aide in understanding how the gifts operate on a practical level.I appreciate the addition of a glossary so gifts can be referenced quickly. Also, the study questions and inventory self-exam.I highly recommend this book, even if one has studied this field in depth."},{"Title":"Spiritual Gifts: Their Purpose & Power","review":"I recently read several books on the gifts of the Spirit, in preparation for an adult Bible class I was asked to teach. I intentionally included both very conservative and very Charismatic texts, in order to be able to present the range of opinion on the subject.

Well worth reading for anyone interested in learning about spiritual gifts (hint: that should be all Christians)."},{"Title":"Spiritual Gifts: Their Purpose & Power","review":"This book was insightful but only touches the surface of various spiritual gifts. It explains what some of the God given gifts are and touches on a factual and historical means of understanding their purpose, but doesn't really explain what one is to do if they should discover that have been blessed with a gift and what their spiritual purpose might be here on earth.

This book is like \\"one-stop-shopping\\" for everything you need to know about spiritual gifts. The author pulls on his extensive background in biblical studies to write authoritatively about his subject. But his tone is conversational and easier to read than many other books on the subject, and it's never condescending. He includes some interesting anecdotes.I especially enjoyed the Spiritual Gifts Inventory at the end."},{"Title":"Spiritual Gifts: Their Purpose & Power","review":"Spiritual Gifts is the first book I have read that deals specifically and exclusively with the many gifts of the Holy Spirit. Although I have been a Christian for many years, I never sat under extensive teaching on the Gifts of the Spirit. Mr. Carraway's book not only describes spiritual gifts in detail but it also explains the importance of determining what one's own gifts are. You turn the last page feeling not like you have just snacked on a superficial read but that you have really eaten a full spiritual meal.After reading the book and working through the questions at the end, I believe I have a better understanding of the gifts God has given me and how I can use them. Moreover, the book encouraged me to dig even more deeply into God's specific purpose for the gifts He has given me through His Holy Spirit.This is definitely a book that is well worth reading!"},{"Title":"Spiritual Gifts: Their Purpose & Power","review":"In the month of August 2008, I had the privilege of reading \\"Spiritual Gifts: Their Purpose & Power\\" by Bryan Carraway. Honestly, this book is one of the best and most detailed reads on spiritual gifts that I have encountered. Bryan lists and expounds upon 30 different spiritual gifts that are found throughout the Bible. Unlike most writings that focus only on the nine gifts of the Spirit mentioned in 1 Corinthians 12, Bryan's book lists other gifts not so frequently mentioned that are found in the Old Testament and other sections of the New Testament. He does a great job of addressing both the arguments of cessationist and charismatics in regards t if the gifts of the Spirit are still in operation today. Reading \\"Spiritual Gifts: Their Purpose & Power\\" will help believers answer such questions as....\\"Can I know for certain what my unique spiritual gifts are?\\"..\\"Are the miraculous gifts like healing, miracles, and prophecy still valid today?\\"....\\"Are all Christians supposed to speak in tongues?\\". In addition, to helping Christians answer these questions the book contains a 150 question spiritual gifts inventory designed to help Christians discover how they have been personally uniquely gifted for ministry.When the author was asked his purpose for writing \\"Spiritual Gifts: Their Purpose & Power\\" his response was: \\"The gifts of the Spirit have been a dividing issue in the church for over 100 years. Charismatics and non-charismatics read the same Bible and yet seem to arrive at totally different ideas about God's will for these gifts. I wanted to present a balanced view of the gifts that brings the church together so that we can better equip God's people to do \\"the work of the ministry.\\" My book is written as a tactful and honest correction to both camps regarding where they have strayed from biblical teaching because no one group in Christendom has a monopoly on biblical truth.\\"I HIGHLY endorse this book for those believers seeking to find greater information on spiritual gifts and find their niche within the Body of Christ.byDemontae EdmondsDirector, Freedom In Christ Ministry Alliancewww.ficmini.com"},{"Title":"Spiritual Gifts: Their Purpose & Power","review":"What a great book.

Its one of the easiest books of the Spiritual Gifts to teach from that I have ever seen or read.

A definite must for your library."},{"Title":"Spiritual Gifts: Their Purpose & Power","review":"I have read many books on the topic of spiritual gifts, and have found that Carraway's book is not only the most comprehensive, but it is extremely well-balanced. This book is for anyone who desires to know what gifts God has them to build His church. I especially enjoyed the correct use of the gift of tongues."},{"Title":"Spiritual Gifts: Their Purpose & Power","review":"Those interested in an exhaustive study of the spiritual gifts won't be disappointed here. And not only does Carraway talk about the gifts, he also helps readers explore their own giftings through the gifts inventory he has created. I recommend this for anyone interested in the subject matter and those desiring a deeper level of discipleship."},{"Title":"Spiritual Gifts: Their Purpose & Power","review":"This is an interesting and helpful book by Bryan Carraway about the many God-given spiritual gifts mentioned in the Bible that we can possess with the help of the Holy Spirit. This book is more of an intro to spiritual gifts as it talks about why they exist, how we can discover them, how they can be used to help the church, and it also gives some background information on the subject. There are 30 different gifts he examines that are demonstrated in the Bible. Some are more well known, but there are also some you may not be aware of.Overall, I found this book to be real helpful, but Carraway doesn't go into much detail on the significance of each gift and how they can be used. That might be disappointing to someone who wants to learn more about a specific gift. Also, although he covers a lot of gifts, he seems to talk as if these are the only ones a person can have and that no others exist. I'm not sure if that's true, but he does include at least most of the gifts the Bible speaks of. This isn't a big issue I have with the book, but I'm pointing it out because this is kind of a debatable topic when it comes to identifying what spiritual gifts there are, and Carraway doesn't seem to acknowledge that with his rather fixed views. You just need to be open-minded when you read this bookFor the most part, Carraway gives a lot of interesting information, and his writing is straightforward and easy to understand. The book also includes a test that can be a helpful way to understand which gifts you specialize in. If you want some in-depth information about one of these gifts and how they can be used, you may want to find another book to read or talk to your pastor or to someone else in your church. This book can be a good starting point though. It can help pinpoint your strengths and also be used as a reference guide for understanding the fundamentals of spiritual gifts and what kinds of gifts there are."},{"Title":"Spiritual Gifts: Their Purpose & Power","review":"Very inspiratonal book!

Modesty is a self-made millionaire (gained when she led a criminal network in her early 20s). She and Willie retired but found the quiet life didn't appeal and among other things, took jobs for the British Intelligence network. They are both experts in martial arts along with other various skills (lock picking, flying, parachuting, etc.)Silver Mistress concerns their actions to rescue Tarrant (head of Brit Intel and friend) from a gang of blackmailers. It contains one of the best fight sequences ever written, from whence the title comes. Modesty versus the bad martial artist.While this little review leaves so much unsaid, it is better than none at all. It is an excellent book -- one I've reread several times and if you like action books or female heroes, you can't miss it or any other Modesty Blaise books.

Modesty &amp; her sidekick/partner, Willie are off into danger once again, this time to save the life of an old friend. Peter O'Donnell has really outdone himself, in this tale of intrigue, gadgetry, &amp; oneupmanship! This tale is lighthearted and sexy throughout, but still leaves your stomach in a knot as the action continually gets hotter until the unexpected climax. Try it! You'll love it! I did"},{"Title":"The Silver Mistress","review":"\\"The Silver Mistress\\" is one of my favorite Modesty Blaise books because most of the action takes place in Southern France, around the Gorges du Tarn region and in the foothills of the Pyrenees Mountains. This is a part of the world that I know fairly well, and love, and that makes the story especially attractive for me.If I ignore this special personal appeal then this story is no longer among the best in the series, and that's why I'm only awarding four stars.\\"The Silver Mistress\\" was written by Peter O'Donnell in 1973, at a time when the Modesty Blaise phenomenon was still at its highest. It is the seventh book in the series and by now there were a large number of loyal fans who eagerly awaited each book with open arms.Unfortunately, \\"The Silver Mistress\\", together with \\"The Impossible Virgin\\" (1971), mark the beginning of the decline of the series. There would never again be another \\"A Taste for Death\\" (1969), the ultimate Modesty story that marked the high point.In many ways \\"The Silver Mistress\\" is a classical Modesty story. There are some really nasty bad guys, some with very surprising characteristics. Modesty and Willie Garvin (Modesty's loyal sidekick) get captured by the bad guys and have to break out of captivity. Some other non-combatant good guys are also held captive so Modesty and Willie have to take care of them as well when the final showdown occurs. And, of course, the bad guys get their just rewards, often in rather unexpected and gruesome ways.To start with the bad guys, the American Colonel Jim and his ridiculous wife, Lucy, make a scary/petulant pair - typical Peter O'Donnell creations. When Colonel Jim shows his wife how much he loves her by letting her choose the first of the captives to be killed we are both horrified and fascinated by this bizarre twist of human nature.The other secondary bad guys are similarly intriguing.Unfortunately, the top bad guy, Mr. Sexton, doesn't live up to his role. When the world's greatest unarmed combat fighter sets out to kill Modesty and Willie we should be terrified, but somehow Mr. Sexton never really comes alive, and remains an abstract threat rather than one we totally believe in. He's too perfect, and thus somewhat artificial.The story is fairly simple, with Tarrant (a close friend of Modesty and Willie) getting kidnapped by Colonel Jim and Mr. Sexton and being subjected to slow torture. When Modesty and Willie discover this they come to the rescue, only to get captured themselves, along with two others. Then Modesty and Willie have to break out and rescue Tarrant and the other two.Incidentally, the quote at the top of this review (\\"And anyway, 'e won't dare die on 'er, not the mood she's in now.\\") is Willie's comment regarding Tarrant's chances of surviving Modesty's chosen method of rescuing him from captivity. (pg 213)\\"The Silver Mistress\\" is not a great Modesty book, but it is above average. It has the usual qualities of the intelligent and humorous slant on things and the appeal of the unique relationship between Modesty and Willie.Among the not-so-great aspects is the problem of Mr. Sexton not being as serious a threat as he should be. There are also some plot problems, for example the silliness of Modesty inviting two other people, Lady Janet Gillam and Quinn, to join them on a caper. Of course this is a recipe for disaster, and if Willie really cared about Lady Janet he shouldn't have let Modesty do such a crazy thing.Other plot problems involve the stupidity of the bad guys staying put in their French chateau even after they know they've been blown, and an overly sugar-sweet ending.One thought-provoking aspect of reading or re-reading this book today is the relevance it has regarding airplane hijackings in the light of the Sept. 11, 2001 tragedy. In the story Quinn was a copilot on an airplane that had been hijacked by terrorists, and he tells Modesty about his feelings at the time: \\"How dare you! How dare you threaten all these men and women and kids, you mindless maniacs!\\" (pg 117)Recommended, even after 30 years. (The first couple Modesty books are now 40 years old, and I'm still giving them five stars and a \\"highly recommended\\".)Rennie Petersen"},{"Title":"The Silver Mistress","review":"One of the better of the later Modesty Blaise novels, this book expands on the relationship between Tarrant and Modesty and has a couple of villains who are more than the usual one-dimensional bad guys.

Dix Claudel, thirteen, knows he hasn't got what it takes, but having failed the Guardsmen's test, he has to do something. And after all, he can control bees, and that's a lot like mob control, isn't it?Naturally, he fails the test. So do four other teenagers. Licking their wounds later, they discover that between them they know all the basics. Why don't they go into business for themselves, and meantime, teach each other what they need for next year's test? In the course of these lofty pursuits, they are embroiled in a mystery involving ancient sorceries, a kidnapped archeologist, and deadly creatures trying to sneak across the border. Just when they've got their backs to the wall, they discover that one of their number is not who he seems.\\"Magic for Hire\\" is filled with adventure and eerie situations. Mr. Greene juggles his characters and plot threads with care, skill, and blithe humor. When Dix tries desperately to perform mob control with a calming spell, he finds that his spell doesn't work as he'd hoped. The villains still plan to kill him --but very calmly.This young adult book is well-suited to teenagers, perhaps grades six through nine. The pace is quick and the story interesting, with enough twists and frustrations to keep a reader guessing. Nice work, Mr. Greene.

Unfortunately, in the first chapters, the author quanitifies getting the most from every minute in strictly monetary terms. All activities which can be done by lesser beings (those who make less per hour than you) should be delegated. Tasks such as housework, cooking, and gardening should all be hired out so that you can focus on doing the truly rewarding work of ever increasing efficiency in paper shuffling. No where does he talk about the pleasure of polishing a really fine piece of wood while comtemplating the many hours of skilled craftsmanship required from lesser beings to produce it.

His solution to the unpaid overtime is to lie to your employer and coworkers about how much you work at home, use oversized containers to take work home so it looks like more, schedule outside appointments late in the dy so you can just go home, etc. A lot of the book is aimed at helping people take better care of themselves and get their priorities in order, which I applaud. But that isn't what I was looking for in a time management book. I was looking for practical strategies for organizing my work and time, which it is thin on.

Two reviews on this book are simply content from the book posted as a review.I read reviews to get a true picture of what people think. I'm not easily manipulated by shill reviews.

I haven't seen the first two editions, but this one certainly fills the bill, if you're looking for solutions to time-pressure problems. That the book is funny, is a real bonus. It makes it easier to get through every chapter. I found the section found &quot;Thinking Your Way Out of Timetraps&quot; to be the best part of the book. After all, much of what we face on a daily basis is self-induced.

I didn't detect that the author had any affiliations with any products or services, and even if he does, it doesn't come through in these pages. Instead, I encountered one chapter after another of sound logic, action steps, and encouragement. If the book is lacking in any area it would be on using technology to enhance your use of time. But, you can always make the argument that tools of technology change so fast, that such discussion is better handled in newspaper and magazine articles anyways.

Given all that has happened in the last couple decades, it is not so surprising. Each of us faces the specter of ever-increasing change. A new piece of technology enters our lives--more instructions to learned, a new way of doing things is instituted. Change itself seems to occur at an ever-increasing pace. In this breakthrough book, Jeff Davidson offers a plan where you can consistently win back control of your time, despite the rigors of trying to flourish in an ever-changing society. Jeff wrote this book with the specific intention of giving you hands-on, highly practical solutions to the day-to-day problems you face. Everything in the book is presented in an honest, down-to-earth, and often amusing way. I found myself smiling and nodding in agreement all the way through. Its basic truths run from page to page. Jeff starts with the basic premise that to win back your time you need to develop, or re-develop, the habit of leaving your workplace at the normal closing hour--if at first only one day a week, and then two days, and then three days, and then nearly everyday. He follows with nineteen more compelling chapters that address various aspects of winning back your time at work and your life in general. He concludes with the message that the best is yet to come, and convincingly tells us why this is so. Not just another treatise on how applying antiquated time management rules, this is a book of guiding principles, and ultimately this book is a gift to career professionals everywhere who know that the quality of their lives, for the rest of their lives, depends upon how they approach each day starting with this day. The suggestions that Jeff offers don't require an upheaval in the way you work or live; most can be implemented naturally and easily. Indeed, Jeff believes that any change representing a radical departure from what you already do, more often than not, will fail. He has presented his suggestions with great care, recognizing that you are already have more than enough to do. Nearly all of what Jeff recommends can be weaved into the tapestry of your life as it exists now. Consequently, this is a book you'll want to keep nearby and refer to often. Depending on the specifics of your situation, many chapters and many passages will merit multiple readings. At the end of each chapter, as is customary in this Macmillan series, Jeff concisely portrays the least you need to know from that chapter. If you only follow the three or four suggestions, you'll do just fine. I am enthusiastic about the results you can achieve in reading and following the ideas in this book. As you find yourself winning back more and more of your time, please do others around you the ultimate favor--share the principles in this book with them so that they too can win back their time.

It has his signature unparalleled beauty but is also unusually thoughtful, with intriguing musings on illusion vs. reality and the nature of love, beauty, and art. Keats' lament about empiricism destroying natural wonder has heavily influenced everyone from Edgar Allen Poe to Richard Dawkins, and Lamia remains central to the art/nature vs. science debate. The story is also interesting in itself; Keats brings a fantasy world vividly to life, draws us in emotionally, and even has a devastating ending. Finally, the poem is impressive technically, showing Keats' growing couplet mastery. One should certainly read his best-known works first, but this should be an early stop; that said, the fact that it is virtually every Keats collection makes a standalone very hard to justify.

He starts with a shortcomparative overview of the international varieties of messianism, and then proceeds to theorigins of Russian messianism in the late fourteenth century when &quot;the monasteries developedthe ideological claim that Muscovy and her Grand Dukes were chosen to represent the climaxof Christian history&quot; (p.11). A more elaborate version of this idea became later known under theheading of Moscow as the &quot;Third Rome&quot;.In his survey, Duncan succeeds in comparing all the different permutations of, and in providinga useful taxonomic scheme for, Russian messianism. For example, he distinguishes betweena state-oriented messianism inspired by the idea of Moscow's domination of other peoples (amessianism he classifies as &quot;nationalist&quot;), and a people-oriented messianism linked with theidea of the Russian people as being a model for other nations to follow (which he categorizesas &quot;universalist messianism&quot;; p.3). His appraisal is especially helpful in differentiating between19th-century Russian revolutionary and Leninist messianism, on the one side, and Stalinistmessianism, on the other.Duncan's study is to be singled out as a major contribution to the field of comparativenationalism studies, and a unique addition to the study of Russian intellectual and politicalhistory. Moreover, it provides perhaps the most extensive bibliography on Russian nationalismassembled so far. It will thus be of great value to students and advanced researchers alike."},{"Title":"Sacred Journey to Atlantis","review":"Wow, how wonderful it is to read such a jewel like this.

Though dated (first released in 1961), this short history (170 pages total/137 pages main) written by noted Civil War historian Edwin C. Bearss still gives the reader a good overview of the events in Southwest Missouri from Union General Nathaniel Lyons occupation of Springfield, Missouri July 13, 1861, through the end of the battle of Wilson's Creek fought by the North's Army of the West commanded by Lyon, and the South's Western Army commanded by Brigadier General Ben McCulloch (composed of Confederate forces, Arkansas State Troops, and the Missouri State Gaurd) on August 10, 1861.This was my first experience reading anything by Edwin C. Bearss, and I found the writing to be very good. Because of how much I enjoyed reading this book, I intend on checking out the rest of his Civil War history books.The maps aren't bad. Even though the theater of operations map is an old period map of Missouri, surprisingly it worked quite well at helping me follow the action upto the start of the battle. There is one good overview map of the entire battle that shows the topography of the battlefield area very well, four hand drawn maps that show different stages of the battle that allow the reader to follow the flow of the action, and one map that shows the location of the camps of the Missouri State Gaurd, Arkansas State Troops, and Confederate forces in the WilsonCreek area. Like most military history books this one could have used a few more maps but these are sufficient to follow the story.Throughout the book are 26 illustrations that show the principal characters and events, some decent information is included in the Footnotes, and the Appendix has a good Order of Battle.This is a good place to start to learn about the battle. For further reading I recommend \\"The Second Battle of the Civil War and the Men Who Fought It Wilson's Creek\\" by William G. Piston and Richard W. Hatcher III."},{"Title":"The Battle of Wilson's Creek","review":"Publisher: Wilson's Creek National Battlefield Foundation; 4th Edition (1992)Language: EnglishASIN: 1-881366-01-4170 pages, maps, pictures, indexI found this book in the bookstore at Wilson's Creek and bought it immeadlty.

Their son John makes a visit home during the \\"sacred\\" Cocktail Hour and seeks his parents permission to proceed with the play he wrote about the family. In it, he will make some revelation about the family that includes something very personal he intends to clarify.Bradley, the father, is adamant that he doesn't want this play published.Ann, the mother, believes that maybe the family information would be better suited for a book, because it is less personal than a play. And his sister Nina, is upset because enough is not written about her.This is a brilliant exchange of dialogue and interaction with characters, and with this, you gain a complete sense of this intriguing family and their share of domestic distress. ....Rizzo"},{"Title":"The Wolves of Witchmaker","review":"A really great book.

There are no maps of the routes but the author does a pretty good job of describing them. The descriptions are pretty detailed including such things as places to park, restroom locations, places to eat, level of difficulty, and condition of pavement.This book seems to be written with the casual cyclist in mind. If you're looking for a route where you can \\"hammer\\" out 40 miles at a fast pace then this book is not for you. If you're looking for a place to enjoy a leisurely weekend ride with friends or children, then this book was designed with you in mind, For example, in their level of difficulty ranking the authors consider a 3-mile route with rolling hills to be \\"challenging.\\"The only negative comment I have about the book was that it was written about 5 years ago so some of these routes may have changed over the years. For most of the routes, the author does provide a phone number to call to get more information about the route.

While it discusses difficult themes such as widespread factory farming and animal suffering, it never depresses, in fact the reverse is true, as if by just flipping through the pages the reader is made better, somehow purified.Judy Carman has researched her subject well, offering insight, prayer and wonderfully interesting anecdotes to help the reader on his or her way toward compassion and reverence for all life. Statistics help educate us in areas we might have been ignorant. For instance: \\"One pound of meat requires 2,500 gallons of water to produce. A pound of wheat takes only 25 gallons. There would be no hungry people in a world of vegans, who consume no animal products of any kind.\\" And medical facts are fascinating and potentially life altering: \\"The American Dietetic Association reports that vegetarians have a lower risk of heart disease, stroke, colon cancer, osteoporosis, diabetes, obesity, kidney tones, gallstones, hypertension, and breast cancer than non-vegetarians. A study of young American soldiers killed in the Korean war showed clear signs of heart disease as compared with the Korean soldiers, who were primarily vegetarians and had no such signs.\\"Speaking on the popular Law of Attraction: \\"When we eat meat and buy products that have resulted in animal suffering, we participate in that suffering to such an extent that the anguish of the animals becomes part of us. Much of the depression and anxiety so common in the world today, not to mention the many meat- and dairy-related diseases, are a direct result of eating and wearing someone's pain and death. We literally attract back to ourselves, in the form of human diseases and environmental disasters, the violence we have caused to the animals.\\"Peace to All Beings is a call to the world to wake up to what we've created over the last millennium and to begin taking care of our planet and our brothers and sisters the animals. I know for many people the animal cruelties that take place every day can be overwhelming, but Judy Carman offers concrete steps--for instance in the form of many different prayers for each situation--that we can all easily do.This book is never preachy or angry, but filled with gentleness and wise compassion; it is not only a great book for animal advocates but for anybody who longs to a kinder world. We can change the world for the better and reading Peace to All Beings is one beautiful step we can take.Great thinkers, spiritual leaders and writers of all centuries are quoted throughout helping animal advocates to see they think or act not alone. For instance Robert Browning, \\"I would rather submit to the worst of deaths...than have a single dog or cat tortured to death on the pretense of sparing me a twinge or two.\\" And the Buddha, \\"All beings tremble before violence. All fear death. All love life. See yourself in others. Whom can you hurt? What harm can you do?\\" Which is perhaps one of the strongest messages from this book: look into the eyes of the animal, open your heart and see yourself. As J.M. Coetzee wrote, \\"There are people who have the capacity to imagine themselves as someone else, there are people who have no such capacity (when the lack is extreme, we call them psychopaths), and there are people who have the capacity but choose not to exercise it.\\" I doubt anyone who reads this book can carry on eating meat or turning a blind eye to animal suffering. The least we can do is include all beings in our prayers.Thank you Judy Carman for opening your heart to all."},{"Title":"Peace to All Beings: Veggie Soup for the Chicken's Soul","review":"A fellow animal activist carries this book around with him always, and told me it was the single most important book he'd ever read; in fact it lead him towards activism.I was already an activist, and have read most of the animal activist literature; so I didn't really see the need but I took my friend at his word and bought this on Kindle.This book is worth every penny and more.

Keen observations told in direct but simple phrases. I don't agree with the reviewers who dismiss this book because it fails their accuracy test- to me it is a work of fiction, a closed world that reflects our feelings, not facts. For me it is an extremely sad book dealing with desperation, grief and loss, lies and self-deception. The way the narrator manipulates, or attempts to manipulate, the world around him, particularly women, unnerves me. Yet it does so because this touches on the truth of how many smart but desperate people interface with the world."},{"Title":"Applied Economics: Thinking Beyond Stage One","review":"Thomas Sowell's new book (2004 imprimatur) came to my attention as he was interviewed on radio...I pulled into the nearest (independent) bookstore in the metropolis of Austin, Texas, finding and buying the lone copy back in the dreary Economics section.I will certainly be reading more of Sowell's writings. Although a sequel to his book Basic Economics, this book stands well alone. In it, he tackles the current problems in this country involving the interaction of the political climate with basic economic principles. These include health care, housing, discrimination, risk, and the problems afflicting so-called third-world nations in economic development.He takes an interesting historical perspective. For example, his analysis of slavery through the ages, and during the period of the American Colonies and southern United States is particularly cogent, and still of contemporary interest. How could slavery have survived so long? Was there such a variety of slave &quot;status&quot; and freedoms to act as has recently been portrayed, even in such films as &quot;Gods &amp; Generals&quot;. During this film, a complicated relationship between General Thomas J. Jackson and his personal cook is portrayed. They have discussions during which it is clear that the slave's status as a well-known cook, and his desire to defend HIS home from invasion as much as Jackson's is remarkable. Within Sowell's analysis of the antebellum South, it is not difficult to understand. In fact, he describes a situation in which slaves were put in less &quot;risky&quot; labor positions than Irish immigrants, a situation derived from their economic value in a cotton baling and transport operation.I probably have not seen an economic &quot;page turner&quot; since reading George Gilder's &quot;Wealth and Poverty&quot; which was so important to understanding the Reagan era (it was, evidently, the &quot;Bible&quot; of many men responsible for early decisions during the Reagan administration and essential to understanding so-called supply-side economics).I recommend this book highly. Sowell's insights are well-explained in &quot;plain English.&quot; A short read, thoroughly enjoyable, that will stimilate the reader to think more deeply about the current issues that should lead to a more informed discussion outside the academic elite about the problems plaguing our economy."},{"Title":"Applied Economics: Thinking Beyond Stage One","review":"Sowell takes the key political issues and challenges the reader to analyze not only their short term (Stage One) political impact but to also think ahead to their long term (Stage Two, Three, etc) economic impact. He reminds the reader that politicians do not think beyond Stage One because they will be praised (and elected) for the short term benefits but will not be held accountable much later when the long term consequences appear. He lays out the Stage One benefits of each political issue and then predicts the long term consequences that politicians don't address. Price controls on drugs and health care may have an immediate benefit, but the consumer will pay years later as health care quality decreases and new drug research declines. Reducing the price does not reduce the cost. Does raising the minimum wage really help entry level workers? What happens in the long term when communities raise taxes on businesses? Is free health care really free, or better?We need to look beyond Stage One and separate politics from economics on the hot election year issues."},{"Title":"Applied Economics: Thinking Beyond Stage One","review":"Excellent book. The United States as a whole would be far better off if everyone read this book. It would be a lot tougher for demagogues to sway public opinion regarding economic matters.One reader's criticism was that there were no facts. Those people who do not believe in the free market will not want to accept certain statements from Sowell. If one wants to argue the merits of a free market versus government-controlled markets, this isn't the book. (Yes, unbelievably there are people who still think that socialism; communism and central planning are superior to free markets)&quot;This book will not satisfy hard-core economic junkies, and Sowell does not pretend it will. His target audience is the average citizen who has little or no economics background, but would like the tools to think critically about economic issues. &quot;I would also recommend the classic \\"Economics in one lesson\\" by Henry Hazlitt and Sowell's \\"Basic Economics\\". \\"Capitalism and Freedom\\" by Milton Friedman is another great book.If one wants to read one of the best (and longest) economic books ever written, then I recommend \\"Human Action\\" by Ludwig von Mises (downloadable at www.mises.org)"},{"Title":"Applied Economics: Thinking Beyond Stage One","review":"If the United States were to implement a \\"required reading\\" prerequisite to voting, this is the book I would choose for such a requirement. Sowell's thinking is crystal clear, his analysis is linear, and his conclusions, once you read them, are hard to argue with. In my opinion, Sowell is dead-on on just about every subject he tackles. This is a brilliant man.Prof. Sowell's main thesis is simple enough: we must look at the actual consequences of policies rather than merely the intentions. Unfortunately, on issue after issue, Sowell shows us that many of our so-called \\"elites\\" focus only on good intentions, because intentions are what the voters see first (the wreckage of bad policy comes later).Nationalized health care, which is a reality in many liberal democratic states, and something that the United States may be moving towards, epitomizes Sowell's basic thesis. What could involve better intentions than the notion that everyone should be able to receive all the health care resources that they need? Alas for complacency! Sowell makes a pretty strong case that when such policies are put into practice, shortages, a degradation in services, and an end to innovation are the consequences.Sowell is right-of-center; unabashedly so, and of course this may turn off some readers. But really, anyone will enjoy reading this book because Sowell's clarity of writing equals his clarity of thought--the book is a joy to read simply for its straightforwedness. This is a book capable of challenging one's belief system. Not many books can do that, but this is one of them."},{"Title":"Applied Economics: Thinking Beyond Stage One","review":"+++++Have you ever wondered about...1. California's electricity crisis: how blackouts and higher costs for consumers were the result of the state government's attempt to keep consumer prices artificiallylow.2. Planned economies: how they may turn decent people into criminals.3. Central planning: how it drove the Soviet economy into the ground and why it doesn't work.4. A free labor market: how it benefits not only the worker but also the economy.5. Price controls: why they fail.6. Geography: the important role it plays in the economies of places around the world.7. Rent control laws: why cities with them have higher rents than cities that don't.If you have wondered about such things as well as other economic matters, then this may be the book for you.This seven chapter (where each chapter averages thirty pages), non-technical, easy-to-read book, by professor and economist Thomas Sowell, has the purpose of focusing on \\"dealing in depth with particular real world problems [and] using economic principles to clarify why and how things have happened the way they have.\\" The real world economic problems discussed that each have a separate chapter are as follows:(1) medical care(2) housing(3) discrimination(4) development of nations.\\"Because these are political, as well as economic issues, some political principles will need to be considered as well\\" instead of focusing on the above four economic topics in isolation. Sowell introduces the reader to this idea in his first chapter entitled:(5) Politics versus Economics.As well, \\"neither economics nor politics is just a matter of opinion and both require thinking beyond the immediate consequences of decisions [that is, both require thinking beyond stage one] to their long-term effects.\\" In other words, economic decisions made to improve a problem may make the problem worse in the long-term if proper thinking has not gone into the initial economic decision. Thus, most of the chapters indicated above will discuss thinking beyond stage one.I have thus far mentioned five chapters. There are two more chapters. One chapter deals with the economics of labor where free labor and labor that's not free are compared. This chapter is entitled:(6) Free and Unfree Labor.The other chapter is concerned with the economics of insurance where uncertainty and risk are discussed. This chapter is entitled:(7) Risky Business.Five of the seven chapters end with an excellent \\"implications\\" section. This is where Sowell takes what has been previously discussed and draws certain inferences and even conclusions.This book contains no illustrations. I feel simple diagrams would have been helpful in reducing the book's wordiness. As well, a summary listing all the economic principles that were applied in each chapter (perhaps at the end of each chapter) would have been helpful, especially for those unfamiliar with such principles.Finally, even though I disagreed with Sowell on some issues (such as on safety movements), I still feel that this is a good book that shows how certain economic principles are applied to some basic but important economic issues.In conclusion, this is an excellent, solidly written book suitable for those who feel that economics is difficult to understand!!(published 2003; preface; 7 chapters; main narrative 220 pages; bibliographical references; index)+++++"},{"Title":"Applied Economics: Thinking Beyond Stage One","review":"Throughout \\"Applied Economics\\" author Thomas Sowell continually tries to impress the reader of the importance of \\"thinking beyond stage one\\". As Sowell so artfully points out \\"stage one thinking\\" is part and parcel of a great many politicians these days. As an economics major myself (many years ago) I was anxious to see how Sowell would argue the conservative case on many of these issues. I must say he makes his points eloquently and with great clarity. Readers who tend to be liberal in their thinking should read this book if for no other reason than to understand conservative reasoning. But I do think it quite plausable that Sowells well thought out arguments might just change some minds about some of these basic economic issues.I was particularly impressed with Sowell's presentation on health care and housing. Having done a fair amount of reading on how expensive it is for drug companies to develop a new drug I agree with Sowell when he argues against the re-importation of drugs from Canada. Now that may appear cruel on the surface but if drug manufacturers are not allowed to recoup their costs of developing these new drugs then there is really very little incentive for them to develop new drugs. In countries where drug prices are artificially held down by government intervention virtually no new drugs are discovered. Just think of the costs to our people if that were to occur here in the United States. Likewise, Thomas Sowell argues vehemently against policies like \\"rent control\\" and excessive \\"open space\\" laws in the housing arena. Such policies inevitably create shortages of well maintained rental units and new homes alike. The result: higher prices for those seeking an apartment or new home. This is not rocket science the author is discussing here...just cold hard economic facts.I tend to part company with conservatives on environmental issues. I am not at all sure that laissez-faire policies are the best way to go. Interestingly enough Sowell does not address the environment in this book. I would love to hear his arguments. All in all, this is a well written and easy to understand book. As another reviewer posited this should be required reading for anyone intending to vote. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Applied Economics: Thinking Beyond Stage One","review":"This is Thomas Sowell's amazing companion book to 'Basic Economics'. Applied Economics is his attempt to show the average voter how economic principles are applied to major current issues such as medical care and housing. He discusses what the consequences are when external forces insert constraints on the free market in an effort to 'solve' a problem. He repeatedly demonstrates how the results of a policy can have disastrously different results than from what was originally intended. Often these policies are put in place out of political expediency without considering what the long-term consequences are for the society at large. Sowell challenges the reader to think beyond the intent of a policy and consider what the actual results will be when such a policy is applied against the incontrovertible laws of economics.What is astounding about Sowell is how his mind appears to be free of the constraints of time, culture and borders. To him the world is one timeless and seamless swirl that is relatively ordered and predictable when you apply the principles of supply and demand. Every thought is supported with a cascade of facts and such impenetrable logic that it can hurt your head. He can speak on virtually any topic with resounding authority. At one moment he can discuss the northern migration of the present day Ibo of Nigeria, shift to the Roman occupation of Britain, then describe the effects of the Gulf Stream on Northern Europe's climate, and then explain how the volume of water in the African Zaire river impacts the region's cultural growth. He does this with amazing fluidity and ease. If the mark of genius is the ability to simplify complex information then Sowell easily stands as one of America's greatest thinkers.The only downside to this book is that if you're a regular reader of Sowell's columns then much of the information in the book will be very familiar to you. For example, in his review over housing, I skipped over his analysis of the Northern California housing situation. Perhaps it's because he lives in the Bay Area and doesn't like the obscene prices for ordinary homes in his community but Sowell discusses this ad nauseam in his columns. However, if you don't read his columns you'll find his book refreshingly educational.This is a tremendously insightful and valuable work from a brilliant man. This is a must read for anyone who wants to be a well-informed voter."},{"Title":"Applied Economics: Thinking Beyond Stage One","review":"This book should be required reading for any freshman course in economics. The author gives well reasoned arguments for the value of long range (beyond stage one) thinking in formulating economic policies. Mr. Sowell effectively contrasts the benefits of carefully thought out economic strategies versus the destructive effects of political expediency. His arguments are forceful but first and foremost rational."},{"Title":"Applied Economics: Thinking Beyond Stage One","review":"This excellent, short, clear book should be part of everyone's reference library, particularly those who wish to understand standard conservative economic thought. The distinctions author Thomas Sowell draws between political and economic logic should become a valuable part of each voter's mental apparatus. Writing to educate the general reader, not to further instruct the sophisticated economist, the author advocates minimal government interference. He calls for as little regulation as possible, mainly because regulations have unintended and usually undesirable economic consequences when seen with a long-range perspective. Sowell's concise, easy-to-read style cuts through the jargon of most economic discussions to lay bare the underlying, plain heartwood. It is easy to quibble here and there. Sowell doesn't offer lots of statistics and back-up material. And, he seems to argue against individual economic decision making when he tilts a drug pricing discussion into a sermon against Americans buying medicine at low Canadian prices. However, we find that his book stands on its merits nonetheless, as long as you understand that the author has a political - as well as an economic - point of view."},{"Title":"Applied Economics: Thinking Beyond Stage One","review":"Although Thomas Sowell harbors some conservative views, he does a great job of giving us empirical evidence to back up his theories behind political and economical issues. I am a recent college graduate with a degree in economics; therefore, I have heard a lot of this stuff before. However, Mr. Sowell does an excellent job of persuading his readers due to his articulate writing. For those that enjoy this book I highly recommend reading Mr. Sowell's columns on Townhall."},{"Title":"Applied Economics: Thinking Beyond Stage One","review":"This is another in a long history of books written by blind men describing the elephant's trunk. Other great books and essays in this tradition include \\"Free to Choose\\" by Milton and Rose Friedman, \\"The Law\\" by Frederick Bastiat, and \\"Economics in One Lesson\\" by Henry Hazlitt. All these books are quite good at describing the trunk (or a tree), but miss the elephant (or the woods) in the process.For what it covers, it is a fine book.However, Sowell forgets to apply all of his principles to the most influential business organization in the market, the corporation. The corporation has the perpetual life, limited liability and personhood. The qualities of limited liability and personhood could not be reproduced without government intervention in the market. Yet, limited liability and personhood are ignored so that he can focus on rent control or price controls. Are rent controls really more important to the economy than a corporation?Before the libertarians and conservatives that are reading this get their [...] bunched over a corporation being able to be created without government intervention, think about a third party being hurt by a corporate action. If a corporation mistakenly dumps toxic waste on land that you own then goes out of business, who is responsible? Answer: No one. You made no contract with the offending corporation, neither explicitly nor implicitly. You are left paying for the mistake that others made because the government granted limited liability (or limited irresponsibility) to corporate investors.Is limited liability so trivial that it can be ignored? If yes, then let's get rid if it. No more limited liability. If no, why doesn't Sowell explore the unintended consequences of this government intervention?I suggest you take Sowell's advice and think about the secondary and tertiary consequences of corporate limited liability and personhood.

The book by Thomas Sowell, Applied Economics: thinking Beyond Stage One, urges the reader to evaluate public policy beyond its hoped-for results. One needs to consider the incentives and constraints inherent in the application of a policy to understand its impact.Sowell explores topics in six categories: free and unfree labor, the economics of medical care, housing, discrimination, insurance, and the economic development of nations. He looks at public policy in these areas, and analyzes them in ways that people may not consider.Consider the case of public interest law firms, or ideological organizations and movements. These organizations present themselves as independent, unbiased intermediaries who perform a public service. Their crusade may be public safety: Sowell explores the case that Ralph Nader made against the Corvair in \`Unsafe at Any Speed,' but it could be about medication, pesticides, nuclear power, or any other issue. Nothing is 100% safe, but safety movements argue that something is categorically unsafe and it needs to be safer. Current safeguards are inadequate, and the public is insufficiently conscientious of it.The safety organizations themselves may be zealously conscientious, as their incentives are to induce as much fear as possible in order to collect the money needed to support themselves from lawsuits, donations, or taxes. Even though these movements may be with the best of intentions, third party advocates often insert themselves into potentially symbiotic deals by having their standards added to adequate products.Everybody remembers the case of the McDonalds cup of coffee. Some woman bought a cup of coffee and took it to her car, where she spilled some one herself, then sued the company for damages caused by scalding. She won her case, meaning that every other consumer pays for her carelessness in several ways: higher prices, safer tops for coffee cups, extensive warnings on the product, and even higher prices to pay for these externalities. Many people may welcome these changes, and not worry about the higher prices. Yet you'll always find some old-timer saying, \\"I used to get a cup of coffee for a quarter.\\"\\"If it saves just one life, it's worth whatever it costs.\\" Safety is an incremental decision, not a categorical one. There is a chance that we may sustain injury, or even die, in an automobile accident every time we get into a car, but we still do it to avoid the inconvenience of other modes of transit. Even pedestrians are at risk from operators of five-thousand pound missiles who are distracted with their cell phones and text messages. Lives would be saved by banning cars altogether, but at a terrible cost of inefficiency to society. You have to look at how much safer we will be in analyzing a public policy decision, while advocates tend to think of safety as something that is 'safe' or 'unsafe.'Sowell provides numerous, provocative insights about a range of important public policy issues in this 222-page book. His style is a step below the popular Freakonomics books, but steps above the stilted prose of the average economist. One difference is that Steven Levitt employs a professional writer, Steven Dubner, to write his stories. Nevertheless, Thomas Sowell and the Freakonomics authors use similar modes of economic thinking and similar ways of explaining them.The Freakonomics authors are better promoters than Thomas Sowell. They write about sexier topics and you can even make a movie about their books. While I enjoy both books, I still prefer Sowell. His topics are meatier and his findings are more relevant to public policy decisions."},{"Title":"Applied Economics: Thinking Beyond Stage One","review":"I have read \\"Basic Economics\\". I know that Sowell is not the kind of writer who writes the same book several times under different names. However...does it pay buying this one if you already read \\"Basic Economics\\"?P.D. Excuse the 5-star evaluation. Amazon asks for an evaluation and, usually, the books by Sowell deserve for me the 5-star score but I did not read this book. This is not a rethoric question but real."},{"Title":"Applied Economics: Thinking Beyond Stage One","review":"Thomas Sowell is the Rose and Milton Friedman Senior Fellow on Public Policy at the Hoover Institute, a conservative think tank. That actually tells a lot. Think Tanks are created and subsist thanks to donations from wealthy sponsors and corporations. The raison d'tre of books produced by think tanks are to advocate the policies and ideologies of those benefactors. This is not to say that Applied Economics is disingenuous but it's certainly something to be aware of.Getting rid of minimum wage has been a staple of conservativism but Mr. Sowell takes it one step further by singing the praises of zero paying jobs. To back up his support he lists a pair of rags to riches stories. Apparently F.W. Woolworth worked 14 hour days for three months for free. Since Mr. Sowell advocates workers being paid market price he comes right out and states that Woolworths' work was valueless. The defense is that America's social ladder is so dynamic that Woolworth was able to climb to the top thru grit and determination. Sowell states, \\"American families in the bottom 20 percent of income earners supply only a fraction of the hours of work per year supplied by families in the top 20 percent\\". It's difficult, however, to know exactly what Mr. Sowell is asserting. Does supplying hours of work mean the same as putting in hours and what \`fraction' of hours are being supplied? Twenty percent? Eighty percent? Mr. Sowell does no analysis of his statement. He just throws it out there as if to say \`look, poor people are lazy'.In the middle of chapter \`Free and Unfree Labor' Mr. Sowell abruptly switches topics and starts talking about gun laws and makes the mind blowing assertion that, \`After the Atlanta suburb of Kennesaw passed an ordinance requiring heads of households to keep a firearm in their homes, residential burglaries dropped by 89 percent'. What a nightmarish scenario and impingement on personal freedom. I have a suspicion that Mr. Sowell cherry picks through data since he continually mentions reduction in residential burglaries but never mentions any other crime. He makes a quick plea for putting more people in jail before returning to the actual subject of the chapter.Mr. Sowell is never as disingenuous as he is when he's shilling for big Pharma. He's against price fixing medicine because it reduces profits and harms a company's ability to finance further research but he supports selling drugs to other countries with price fixing at a drastically reduced price. He's also against re-importation because this would also eat into profits. So what's the upside for American's beyond the pleasure in living in a country that develops lots of medicines? The great irony is that measured against the top 29 industrialized nations the United States sits in the bottom quartile in both life expectancy and infant mortality. Maybe it's because we can't afford the very medicine we develop.Sadly, Mr. Sowell pulls out that ugly chestnut that spending public money on AIDS treatment is wrong because it only encourages the very behavior that propagated AIDS in the first place. He doesn't elaborate on whether he's referring to unsafe sex or homosexuality as the behavior. Sowell is also against debt forgiveness for poor nations but most surprising is his stance against government assistance in the case of natural disasters. His logic is that people will just rebuild in the same dangerous location (like half of Florida?). Even the most cold hearted conservative generally supports helping after an act of God.This book is boilerplate neo-conservativism and really adds nothing beyond parroting the ideas that Milton Friedman penned 50 years ago. I guess the moral of the story is that when it comes to American domestic policy the twentieth century was a complete failure. \`Course, on the back cover G. Gordon Liddy calls Thomas Sowell \`the smartest man on the planet' so how can it not be so?"},{"Title":"Applied Economics: Thinking Beyond Stage One","review":"The arguments in the books for a FREE market doesn't add up to the conculsions. It cited many failures in government interventions as the basis for a complete free market, however there are no hard evidence that a completely free markets in the sectors covered in the book will work. In particular, it advocate a practical appraoch in that it emphasis what is important is actual experience in the past that matters, not the idealistic socialism. It is however, recent experiences that pointed to the fact that markets are never perfected. The public is misinformed about the safety of automobiles, the pubic is misinformed about the consequences of rent control. In a perfect information market, how can the public be misinformed.The zoning of land use is against free market. On this topic, I invite Mr. Sowell to come to Hong Kong (where I live) to see how developers (not checked by a competent government) can damage one of the most beautiful natural harbour in the world.Mr. Sowell's arguments are only valid if very one in the market are thinking about stage 4, otherwise it won't work. He is as idealistic as the communist.In the real world, we are have to balance between the two exterme and I don't think Mr. Sowell's ideal world exist in any place in the world today."},{"Title":"Applied Economics: Thinking Beyond Stage One","review":"Political decision-making looks at policies and programs in terms of their desired goals, such as a \\"living wage\\", \\"affordable housing,\\" and \\"rent control,\\" whereas economic decision-making focuses on the inherent incentives and constraints at work in pursuit of such goals, as well as their actual consequences over time. Looking at public policy decisions simply from the perspective of the former prevents us from preventing many \\"unintended\\" consequences - which, from the perspective of the latter, would have been foreseeable by simply taking the necessary time and effort to look beyond stage one.This is the premise of Thomas Sowell's new book, Applied Economics: Thinking Beyond Stage One (Basic Books, 2004). In this follow-up to his 2000 book Basic Economics, where he lays the foundation for understanding economic principles by explaining them in layman's terms, Dr. Sowell applies these principles to real-world case studies to explain how and why things have happened the way that they have. He examines the long-term economic consequences of many politically popular decisions motivated by what he calls \\"stage-one thinking.\\"Consider the following example to raise taxes on corporations located in a city or state to finance government projects:State One: Such a decision might win political points for the mayor or governor, and may even increase his/her chances for re-election.Stage Two: The headquarters of corporations hit by the higher taxes may decide to shift production to places where taxes are lower, thereby reducing the locally earned income on which taxes are paid by both the corporations and their local employees.Stage Three: As corporations grow over time, they will locate in places where taxes are lower, transferring employees willing to move and replacing those who are not by hiring new people.Stage Four: Eventually, the corporate exodus from the high-tax city or state will cause total tax revenues to be less than what they were before the tax increase. Yet, by this time years will have passed and the politicians responsible for the increase will probably escape the political consequences of their decisions.Citing New York City - which has the highest tax rate of any city in the country - as an example, the author wittingly puts it, \\"... killing the goose the lays the golden egg is a viable political strategy, so long as the goose does not die before the next election and no one traces the politician's fingerprints on the murder weapon.\\" This is classic stage-one thinking at work.Price controls are very popular politically, but their negative consequences, though well documented, are never taken into account by those who do not think beyond stage one. Dr. Sowell cites the government-controlled health care systems of Japan, Korea, France, Britain, and Canada, and looks at the consequences of land use restrictions and rent control policies in the state of California to drive home this point.In the chapter on \\"the Economics of Discrimination,\\" Dr. Sowell discusses the actual costs of discrimination and the incentives and constraints that drive those costs. To give a concrete example, the late Cincinnati Reds baseball team owner Marge Schott was known to espouse racist beliefs - and often expressed them publicly to the consternation of baseball officials and everyone else within earshot. However, she was also a shrewd businesswoman who knew that, no matter what her personal feelings about blacks were, not hiring star black baseball players would have been financial suicide. She may have been a bigot, but from a business perspective she wasn't stupid.The last chapter discusses how a nation's economic development is the result of a whole host of historical, political and geographic factors, showing how and why different parts of the world have developed differently over time, with no given factor explaining the large economic disparities between the world's countries and societies. People who desire simple and emotionally satisfying explanations for such disparities based on melodramatic \\"exploitation\\" theories, would be well served to pay close attention.Whereas Basic Economics lays the foundation for understanding economic principles, Applied Economics puts those principles in action in the real world. It is too bad that more of our nation's intellectuals and decision-makers do not live in the real world. Fortunately, Thomas Sowell does, which makes our world all the better for it."},{"Title":"Applied Economics: Thinking Beyond Stage One","review":"Thomas Sowell does it again...be prepared to roll up your sleeves and plow through some heavy duty analysis. For those in the profession the book is not much of anything new; but for someone who is interested and intelligent and unfamiliar with economics the book will increase his or her knowledge of economics exponentially. Sowell takes on critical issues regarding individuals' and societies' well being and aces them using economic thinking and analysis (as usual). I hope that students pick up the book and become encouraged to take economics classes and even major in economics.The book is about as politically incorrect as it can possibly be. That's great - because as Sowell repeatedly asserts in his books, economics is not about value judgements, but simply about analyzing costs and tradeoffs inherent in decision making. This applies to individuals as well as nations. Politics and economics are intricately intertwined, according to Sowell (and I strongly agree). The purpose of \\"Applied Economics\\" is to analyze the effects of decisions made by various individuals, groups, and political systems across cultures and times in history, which in turns explains the outcomes that various people and groups have experienced. Policy making is also covered in depth, with understandable yet deep analysis and explanation of various 'hot button' issues including health care, labor, systems of government, discrimination, and risk taking. Of course, all of the theory is amply peppered with real world examples. Detailing the real world outcomes is not just the icing on the cake; it's a critical part of explaining the theory, which is one of the reasons why Sowell is a decent economist.I like the way Sowell chose to continue \\"Basic Economics\\". It's not written at a high enough level for someone who's been in the profession for a while but will provide food for thought for the open minded reader who wants to learn more about the subject. econ"},{"Title":"Applied Economics: Thinking Beyond Stage One","review":"Thomas Sowell describes economics as thinking beyond Stage One-considering the later consequences of present policies. This is a great message, and one I wish our national leaders understood. I am a biochemist and a patent attorney, and I consider myself an environmentalist. Most environmentalists, unfortunately, need to think much more about Stage Two and beyond. This book is a good way to start this process and correct some of the naivete that surrounds environmental policy proposals. Mr. Sowell's analysis of recycling, for example, is a much-needed insertion of reality into this area.I enjoyed the analyses of medical care and risk-taking. Mr. Sowell makes the excellent point that drug prices convey an underlying reality that is not nearly as easily changed as the prices are; drug price controls are therefore self-defeating. I felt Mr. Sowell did not go far enough on this, however. Life insurance works because it is reasonably easy to tell whether someone is dead or not, and because successfully killing someone for the insurance money is difficult and risky. Health insurance works poorly because there simply is no way to define &quot;good&quot; health care, much less tell whether or not someone else's child is receiving it. The demand for medical care is essentially infinite; nearly everyone would like themselves and their families to have better health than they presently do. As soon as a third party payer enters the picture, the necessary connection between demand for health care and the available resources of the patient or his family becomes a fog filled with conflicts of interest.Mr. Sowell's analysis of zoning laws is basically good. I agree that we need much more consideration of the role of zoning laws in creating urban sprawl. I think Mr. Sowell puts too much emphasis on the role of &quot;open space&quot; in this, though. The main problem is not that we don't allow people to build in the remaining open space, but that thanks to too-restrictive zoning, housing density is far too low in the locations (such as near jobs, shopping, schools, parks, and subway stations) where people want to live. In my own neighborhood (Falls Church, Virginia), demand for housing is intense and home prices are soaring, but thanks to zoning and local politics, the few remaining lots are mostly having single-family houses built on them. Ridiculous!Mr. Sowell's analysis is faulty in some areas. He too easily dismisses overpopulation as a serious problem. The difficulty is that if people are not required to pay the full costs of raising their own children, they will raise more children than they or their society can afford. If we are going to have such &quot;pro-child&quot; policies as universal free education, therefore, we must balance that with taking steps to control population.Mr. Sowell admits that there is a limit to the earth's capacity to sustain human life, but says this is not a problem because we are still far from the limit. I am not convinced that we are as far from the limit as he thinks. The earth's resources (and its waste sinks) are being used at a rate which is simply not sustainable even over a time span of decades, never mind centuries. Mr. Sowell's analysis would be correct if there were no externalities. The fact is, though, that resource use is in effect very heavily subsidized. Users of crude oil, for example, do not now have to pay the costs of air pollution, roads, auto accidents, wars to protect the oil flow, climate change, and the like, but instead shove these costs off onto others. As long as this continues, crude oil will continue to be overused and the economy will be less efficient as a result. I would like to see Mr. Sowell's formidable abilities applied to the problem of solving the &quot;Stage Two&quot; problem of externalities, rather than simply sweeping it under the rug."},{"Title":"Applied Economics: Thinking Beyond Stage One","review":"Thomas Sowell's &quot;Applied Economics&quot; ought to be required reading in every high school and college economics, politics, and English courses. While Mr. Sowell is Ph.D economist and fellow at the Hoover Institute at Stanford, his ideas are useful even to the non-economist. As a society, we tend to be taken in too easily by people who make irrational arguments that sound good at first glance but produce miserable results since no one thought about the next step. Often times, too many words are politically popular but are actually quite harmful. Such words include: &quot;living wage,&quot; &quot;consumer protection,&quot; &quot;rent control,&quot; etcetera. When these ideas are actually applied in practice, the results rarely meet the rhetoric over the long-run. Politicians only tend to care about what will get them re-elected, and as a result, few of them have an incentive to think about what will happen 10 years from now. As a result, many often escape the blame since the poor results will be far removed from their disasterous policies. This, of course, could easily be construed as a problem with democracy, but instead, my feeling is that it is a problem with our educational system. If our educational system actually educated citizens to think deeply about what would be the consequences of certain policies, perhaps the heated irrational logic emanating from certain politicians would cease. Perhaps such rhetoric would continue to work in irrational hotspots such as Berkeley, but rare for it to work elsewhere. One could only hope. This book is a must read for everyone -- regardless of who you are.Michael Gordon"},{"Title":"Applied Economics: Thinking Beyond Stage One","review":"Dr. Sowell does a superb job of explaining the unintended consequences of well-intentioned, but incompletely thought-out public policy. as a highlight, Dr. Sowell details the downstream, negative impact of rent control laws on the very people the laws are intended to protect. Rent control laws mean less income for the owner, more people in line to rent, and less income for the owner to use in the maintainance of his property. As a result the very properties protected by rent control fall into disrepair and are then abandoned.As a non-economist, I found the concepts and illustrations very accessible."},{"Title":"Applied Economics: Thinking Beyond Stage One","review":"Applied Economics is a follow-up book by Dr. Thomas Sowell to his very popular book published a couple of years earlier, Basic Economics.Personally, I have long since admired Sowell and respected his opinion, and this book certainly did nothing to change that. The book is solid, albeit short, and will serve as a very good supplement to Basic Economics in which the reader can see many basic economic principles applied. As stated earlier, Applied Economics does make a great supplement to Basic Economics, but it certainly can be read on its own.There is some criticism that can be made to Sowell's book, however. Dr. Sowell is very much a laissez faire free market economist, and some would argue as such that this book is not a true representation of what economics really says (if it indeed says anything, that speaks nothing of debate in the economic community). Indeed, there is some truth in that argument. Certainly Sowell would find himself in direct opposition to many other economic ideologies; after all, it is hard to image a quaint discussion between a neoclassical and a Keynesian. However, with that in mind, I think the criticism is largely unfounded. Certainly Dr. Sowell writes from a perspective that advocates the role of the free market, but the truth is that economics as a whole largely advocates a laissez faire, free market economic order. By and large, the things that Sowell argues for (such as free trade) and against (such as price controls) are things that would largely be accepted by most (but certainly not all) economists.All in all, a good solid book by Dr. Sowell. The major downside is that if you have consistently read Sowell, this book will most likely not give you anything new. Sowell is, without doubt, an intellectual giant, but he does possess that dreaded tendency of repetition."},{"Title":"Applied Economics: Thinking Beyond Stage One","review":"Several years ago, my father forced me to read Sowell's Basic Economics.

Hardly anyone does anything simply for the good of mankind. Perhaps it's cynical, but turn on daytime TV and tell me I'm wrong. Thomas Sowell has a remarkable ability to take something as confounding as economics and explain it in terms that even I (a confirmed number-hater and English maven) could understand without having to resort to fistfuls of aspirin.

Are you for cheap medicine? Then you will want to regulate the prices set by pharmaceutical companies and limit the length of their patents. Are you for cheap housing? Impose rent control. How about fixing the so-called \\"north-south\\" inequalities in wealth that you believe are a result of globalization and discrimination? That's simple: increase foreign aid.To these solutions, and many others like them, Thomas Sowell asks a very basic but often neglected question: What happens next? Once you have imposed rent control in a city, for example, what happens to its housing market? By providing preliminary answers to these questions based on empirical evidence, Sowell undercuts the surface moralism of those who promote these ideas.Sowell looks at labor markets, the economics of medical care, housing and discrimination, how risk affects business, and finally provides a chapter on why various countries and regions show such different patterns of development. As with all his work, his writing is crystal-clear and enjoyable.

He has talked about the role of navigable rivers in economic development several times before-- not least in his \\"Migrations and Culture\\" book among other places (columns).2. The notion that the amount of \\"dead capital\\" that is sitting in places like Haiti and other third world countries that cannot be erected because of poorly functioning legal systems is not new either. This is something that was covered at great length in William Easterly's book \\"Misadventures in the Tropics\\" and (I believe) in \\"Wealth and Poverty of Nations\\" (David Landes). Both of them are great books. Of course, Dr. Sowell writes about them in an interesting and easy-to-understand way, but the book feels very much like a secondary source since I know exactly where these arguments come from3. A lot of the data on differences in income between different ethnic groups was trotted out from older works (but updated), so one gets a strong sense of deja vu when reading this.Overall, it's a good and very readable work. It is worth reading for people who never bother to fill in their ideas with specific case studies or case examples of what *actually happened* under certain circumstances.His discussion of health care economics was also very interesting and made the whole book worth its purchase price.

When I finished the book I felt like I had actually just been to Mexico; it's that descriptive. You could read this book as an alternative to traveling! The authors are clearly very, very familiar with the place, and offer practical and often ingenious advice. This book actually changed my mind about going To Mexico.

There is truly a wealth of information out there, and some wonderful books, with up-to-date and detailed information, but having read all those wonderful guides, this is hands down the greatest--it's on another level entirely.Yez, you'll learn a LOT about Mexico, including very specific preventions and treatments for mishaps like scorpion bites and upset stomachs. But what makes this book shine are all the wonderful stories about the authors' experiences all over Mexico. And the humor (sly little comments are inserted liberally in every section, causing me to laugh out loud on almost every page.) Not jokes, exactly, just wry, amusing ways of phrasing things.All the stories could be gathered into a book of short stories, and it would be entertaining for anyone, whether or not they had any interest in traveling in Mexico. I stayed up 2 hours after I should have gone to bed because I simply couldn't stop reading the stories. I can't say that about any of the other guidebooks I've read.If you have any interest at all in Mexico, and even more so if you plan to travel there at any time in your future, treat yourself to this book. It's a treasure."},{"Title":"The People's Guide to Mexico","review":"This is not a hotel guide, but a delicious, leisurely exploration of Mexico. I read it like a novel and it greatly enhanced my appreciation of Mexico during my recent trip. Despite the fact that I stayed at a luxury resort and planned my days around the needs of my two small children, The People's Guide helped me to appreciate the people and see the country in a completely different way than I would have otherwise. This book inspired me to want to see and learn more in the future."},{"Title":"The People's Guide to Mexico","review":"The People's Guide to Mexico has gone through numerous editions, and has been in print constantly for three decades. Cult classic doesn't begin to describe this book. Although it contains typical travel guide fare, like practical information on locations to visit, currency and banking, health, and the law, interspersed are long stories and anecdotes from the authors' many years of travel and residence in Mexico. If you're looking for very specific information, like bus timetables and prices or information on specific hotels and restaurants, look elsewhere. The authors usual MO was/is to drive around Mexico and car camp, so if you are planning to camp or you don't mind blowing into town jet lagged and without reservations, you may not need to supplement this book, but most travelers would probably appreciate a little more guidance, particularly for a first time visit, or if one's Spanish is shaky (or nonexistent).Another nice feature of this edition is that the corners of the book are rounded, not sharp, so your copy will be less likely to become dogeared after being crammed in a backpack or suitcase."},{"Title":"The People's Guide to Mexico","review":"I've been roaming Mexico, Franz-like, for 40+ years, and he had ideas I hadn't thought of.

If you enjoy irreverence, humor, colorful stories, personal experience and gaining real insight- rare in the tourist guidebook genre- about the very different, yet welcoming, culture next door, then this IS your book.

It lived up to the billing. It isn't a guidebook to 'tourist highlights', it is a guide to 'going Mexican'. There isn't anything on the 'sights' of Mexico City, but there are tips on backroad bus trips, Mexican hand gestures, learning Spanish and surviving customs inspections. Rather than the 'tour', the book proposes the 'flow': get up in the morning and go with the first idea that comes into your head. Don't plan a 'return', there is only the 'next adventure'."},{"Title":"The People's Guide to Mexico","review":"This isn't a traditional guidebook. It contains no information on specific hotels, sites to see, or things to do. It has no maps and only a few rudimentary itineraries. What it does have is a lifetime's accumulation of information, insight, and wisdom regarding the culture of Mexico. The People's Guide explains Mexicans' habits, customs, and attitudes. It also provides information and advice (specific to Mexico) about driving and other modes of travel, accommodations, health and safety strategies, shopping, and other important travel topics. While much of the information presented is targeted to the \\"hippies-traveling-for-months-at-a-time-out-of-the-back-of-a-van\\" contingent, most of it is probably invaluable to the business, or resort traveler as well. Franz's happy-go-lucky personality and heavy use of stories, anecdotes, and examples lends to both the enjoyment and understanding of the material."},{"Title":"The People's Guide to Mexico","review":"I've been to some 30-odd countries and used stacks and stacks of guidebooks. None of them comes close to this one in terms of depth, insider info, and useful advice that will keep you out of a jam. This is probably the first guidebook I've ever kept on my nightstand and read for pleasure--it's that much fun. It's akin to swinging in a hammock, holding a cold Sol, and listening to a traveler talk for hours about the good bad and ugly in Mexico. Whether you're going to Mexico for a week (Cancun doesn't count) or are thinking of buying a house and moving there, this book is the best investment you can make.Tim Leffelauthor, The World's Cheapest Destinations"},{"Title":"The People's Guide to Mexico","review":"The People's Guide is a pure delight, a labor of love about Mexico. It's a travel book that is actually fun to read. It's also full of useful information about just about everything; how to travel, where to stay, how to stay healthy, how to deal with the law, some basics on the language, and much more. And every bit of it feels like advice from someone who has learned it all through years of experience, some of it painful, most of it joyful.What it is not is a book listing all the hotels, restaurants, stores, museums, and so forth. (There is a short section - The Best of Mexico - with specific suggestions, but it's just a starting point.) If your approach to travel is as footloose and unplanned as the authors, this may be the only book you need.

Highly recommended!JANA"},{"Title":"The People's Guide to Mexico","review":"There are many books on Mexico and Mexican travel. There are two books worth the weight of carrying them while traveling (or living) in Mexico. The People's Guide to Mexico is the key book on Mexican travel and culture. Harvard student written Let's Go Mexico fills in with particulars like hotel suggestions, bus schedules, and detailed travel info to sites of interest.From as common as a day border crossing to an experience as exotic as happening into a pre-Columbian religious ritual high in the Sierra of indigenous speaking southern Mexico you can deduce enough from Franz's cultural insights to save you from being off balance. Even his cooking and recipes are on target.With the rising Mexican population in the USA, I recommend that The People's Guide to Mexico is now useful reading for everyday life north of the border; businesspersons and politicians could benefit from reading it. The dream traveler need not dream longer. He can read Franz's book and use the insight to experience Mexican culture in almost every state in the USA.Everyone (including Mexican Americans) traveling in Mexico for as little as a few days to those living in Mexico permanently should have a copy. I know of no other place where this much Mexican travel technique and cultural understanding is packed into one book."},{"Title":"The People's Guide to Mexico","review":"This isn't a travel guide.

I have been an MT for 13 plus years and have seen my pay plummet by almost half for various reasons, first and foremost being company greed (they can off-shore the work to India and pay them much, much less).

The first part of the book examines the table saw itself and the coverage is excellent. Starting with an education on the various parts of the table saw it progresses through different types, blades, and functions. Next comes a thorough section on table saw maintenance and how to select a used table saw. The analysis of what to look for and how to determine the condition of a used saw is very detailed and well illustrated.The next section covers basic cuts, joinery techniques, sawing accessories and basic jigs. One of the things that I really liked about the book is the detailed information on making your own jigs. Making the cuts to create a specific joining method is fine but it can be a pain to do several of them in a row by hand. So, he not only teaches how to make the cuts to make the join but also teaches how to make a jig so that it can be used to make the cuts quicker and easier. This shows that the author not only knows his joining techniques but also has the real life knowledge of how professional woodworkers actually do it. The last section of the book contains several projects you can make using your table saw. These projects include various cabinets, a play table and chairs, and an entertainment center.&quot;The Complete Table Saw Book&quot; is an excellent reference that I can highly recommend to anyone who wants to learn about table saws and how to use them for everything from basic cutting to cabinetry. Filled with illustrations so you can easily understand everything in it, you can't go wrong with this book."},{"Title":"The Complete Table Saw Book","review":"For me, buying a new table saw is not only a cause for celebration, but an opportunity to shuffle through the shelves to find a book about my new toy. This one struck my eye - mostly because it was thicker than the others, was well laid out and seemed to cover all the salient points. Possibly not the best criteria in the world, but they have stood me in good stead for a long time now.For the most part, my initial assessment was accurate. The editor Tom Carpenter, has gone out of his way to maintain a solid, plainspoken approach to the subject matter, with a great number of illustrations and photographs. I can honestly say that there are enough ideas, pointers, and explanations to greatly enhance what you get for what is often the most expensive piece of equipment in the shop.Chapters cover Basics, Tune-up & Maintenance, Chosing Saw Blades, Basic Cuts, Joinery Techniques, Sawing Accessories, and Essential Jigs. That covers the first 160 pages. The second section, which is about the same size, is devoted to some information about Woodworking With Sheet Goods and a collection of ten projects.This latter section, while useful, is not up to the same level of quality is the first part. Not that it's shabbily done, but that the projects, which range from a bookshelf to an entertainment center, are a bit clunky looking. They are training projects rather than works of art. As such there is a good deal of explanation to help the budding sawyer."},{"Title":"The Complete Table Saw Book","review":"Very good quality book.

It is difficult to follow at times and I can understand how certain individuals may find it boring, but I would definetely recommend this book."},{"Title":"Stealth","review":"It's very difficult to review this story without spoiling it, so I decided that the concerns of the reader are more important, and that the author shouldn't be able to hide his story's faults behind some thin secrets, so here goes.\\"Stealth\\", which is very much a cold-war thriller, offers the hapless story of a DIA analyst, Michael Pretorius, used to crack open a large-scale KGB counterintelligence operation on American soil. Pretorius retired from intelligence following a disastrous mission-gone-wrong in East Germany. Captured, he was cracked. The Russians let Pretorius think that his story held, but the Americans know that Pretorius's debrief was much more thorough than the spy realizes. Without letting on, Defense Intelligence Agency brings him back. They tell him that he's needed to pose as a scientist assigned to develop warplanes and give allow himself to be captured by the Soviets. In the process, he is to turn over much flawed information on the America's newest technological achievement, the BAT-3 Stealth Bomber. BAT-3 will exceed both existing stealth aircraft and soviet technology geared to detect them. With Pretorius in their control, the Soviets will have no idea that his information has been altered, that they will be sent down a myriad of blind alleys. Unfortunately, when captured, Pretorius is almost immediately recognized, and his interrogators go even deeper, fully cracking him. Pretorius regains consciousness knowing that he has been completely compromised and that the Soviets now possess everything, the intentionally distorted stuff and the very real data. Breaking free, he finds himself on the run from the Soviets but also from his own side.SPOILER.BEGINS HEREIt takes very little time before the reader figures out the secret - there is no new Stealth bomber, it's all a sham to distract the Soviets from America's real weapon, \\"Star Wars\\". (Did I mention that this was very much a DATED cold war thriller?) I mean, if Pretorius isn't really an engineer, why tell him any genuine information on BAT-3? For that matter, why tell him that he's expected to be captured? In maintaining the sham, the Americans dragoon a captured Russian Tu-160 bomber tailored to look like the new American warplane. Going on the run, Pretorius will eventually learn that his handlers and hunters are one and the same, that there is a deeper conspiracy than the one involving the Russians - an idea that seemed old even when Coonts used it better in \\"Minotaur\\".END SPOILERThe problem with Stealth, besides its failed twist, is the fact that it's not very thrilling. The author has very unexacting ideas of what a technothriller is supposed to be. None of his major characters are involved in the stealth aircraft (they do seem to know a lot about it - rattling off scads of data likely culled from a handy copy of \\"Janes\\"). Instead, they seem to know more about fine dining, the best wines, the hautest of cuisine. Before he can even get a chance to show his hero is really a genuine character, Durham insists on letting his remote home, his antique stove, his distinguishing palette and his ability to get a fine dinner whenever he wants. This was all okay in the days of James Bond, but the end of the cold war was supposed to be lead to more believable characters, and Pretorius is at least a few steps behind in that unlike Bond, he actually manages a few bits of genuine heroism between sips of Dom Perignon '56. Nothing Pretorius does makes much sense, and like the story, he goes nowhere real fast. Reading \\"Stealth\\" ominously reminds me of Pat Robinson - like Robinson, Durham populates his stories with men who are meant to be heroic even though they navigate nothing more than the menu of an expensive restaurant. In other spots, Durham exhibits the worst traits of genre authors - not content (or able) to excite the reader, Durham thinks he's in a position to educate the reader. At best, he doesn't so much educate as try to make himself sounded educated. Unfortunately, like those pricey menus, Durham's prose on the exotic sie of espionage look like a copy of something somebody else already wrote - he names the different gun-fighting positions rather than fleshes out the severity that drives men to choose one over the other.This may be a bit demanding, but in reality the genera has done better. Looking to uplift myself, I picked up the original, \\"Flight of the Intruder\\" as well as \\"Firefox\\" and the newer \\"Dangerous Ground\\" by Larry Bond. Along with David Poyer and even Joe Buff, there is proof that the technothriller genre can still deliver good thrills along with prose that don't insult their readers."},{"Title":"Stealth","review":"This book was great.

I have always loved ships - especially pictures of old ships. The purpose of this book is simple \\"Galleys, carracks, merchantmen, and men-of-war, clippers, fore-and afters, yachts, are all presented as they appeared to contemporary masters.\\" Along with the wonderful prints the author discusses the pictures and the Renaissance books and chronicles (and later manuals) that they appeared in and other structureless ramblings about sea battles, tactics, and exploration in essentially chronological order from 1486-1895.This volume does not attempt to be a definitive history but rather to appeal to \\"our interest and pleasure\\" with the purpose of being the 1920s equivalent of a coffee table book. However, much to my surprise and joy the tome has an immense amount of detail. For example, the author describes for many pages the prints, techniques, and purpose of the 'Nuremberg Chronicle' which cataloged ships of the late 15th century. Understandably, the books is filled with the historical misconceptions of the age that more modern historians have tossed out such as the ridiculous remarks that the world was slumbering in the dark during medieval ages. My three favorite prints have to be 'Engagement between Two Merchant Ships off the Coast of Iceland,' 'Seventeenth Century Fireship' and the humorous engraving (since the man is in a full suit of armor) of a 'Sixteenth-Century Life Belt.'This book has inspired me to search out some of the original collections of engravings mentioned in the text. A very worthy buy, especially for the sailing ship enthusiast and bibliophiles like me!"},{"Title":"Old ship prints,","review":"This is a cool book even though it wasn't what I thought it would be. I bought it because I love paintings of ships at sea, particularly those of Winslow Homer. However, with only a handful of exceptions, it turned out to be historical in its black-and-white plates of ships being built, sailing in armadas, on the high seas, at war, and what they found upon arriving in uncharted territory. In fact, there are a good number of maps from several centuries ago also, which are perhaps the most interesting. The narrative discusses the artists, their methods, and their individual lives. Anyone interested in historical nautical art will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Fieldbook of Wild Birds and their Music","review":"Originally printed in 1904, G.P. Putnam's Sons. Reprinted 2000, Bedford, MA: Applewood Books.The modern American field guides we are used to -- Peterson, Kaufman, Sibley, etc. -- offer detailed migration information, pithy descriptions of each bird, and digitally enhanced images. On the internet, dozens of bird-identification sites can be found, and many more websites allow bird songs to bubble forth from our computers. It wasn't always this way, though, and F. Schuyler Mathews' 1904 Field Book of Wild Birds and Their Music, reissued by Applewood Books, is a pocket-sized reminder of what bird books used to be. Whereas our modern field guides are bent on helping us quickly and accurately identify birds, many popular field guides of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries blended the goal of identification with encouragement for readers to revel in the beauty of birds and their music.Mathews writes this about the Ruffled Grouse (our Ruffed Grouse): \\"There is no doubt about it at all, here is the kettledrum of Nature's orchestra!\\" About the Red-winged Blackbird: \\"A beautiful slim and smooth black bird with scarlet epaulets sways unsteadily on the supple stem of a cattail on the margin of the pond ...\\" About the White-throated Sparrow: \\"This handsomely attired Sparrow is one of the most distinguished members of the family.\\" Contrast this with Sibley's description of the same species: \\"Smaller and plumper than other Zonotrichia sparrows. Rufous on wings and sharply outlined white throat distinctive.\\" Looking at older field guides, one starts to wonder, in our rage to identify identify identify, has something been lost?Mathews' Field Book of Wild Birds and Their Music describes the Eastern birds (or most of them) in elaborate passages, but what is most ambitious about this book is the music. Mathews renders each bird's song on a musical scale, complete with liner notes and commentary. Don't read music? Don't worry. Mathews offers both a quick primer on how to read music and a glossary of musical terms. Paging back to Mathews' handy glossary, you'll know just what he means when the lark's song is described as affettuoso or the robin's melody as sostenuto. On the other hand, if you do happen to read music, this guide breathes new life into bird songs.Mathews concedes that\\"Of course it is a more or less problematic matter to deal with wild music. It is not amenable in any respect to law. However, the question involved is not whether the bird's song is radically different from ours - we may admit that point - but whether it may be truthfully and logically recorded upon the musical staff. That question, it is the object of this book to answer affirmatively, and with due regard for all the difficulties involved\\" (xvii).F. Schuyler Mathews' Field Book of Wild Birds and Their Music is not the only book of its time that attempted to capture bird songs on the printed page. S. Miller Hageman's Bird Songs (also of 1904), for instance, presents bird songs in the form of poems. In that book, Hageman not only poetically recreates the rhythm and tone of each bird, but works to capture the poetic essence, if you will, of each species. Many authors writing about birds have focused first on the joy of listening to birds, then on the joy of watching them, as bird songs have been considered a primary enhancement to everyday life. Mathews is simply following along in this tradition.F. Schuyler Mathews, author of numerous books and field guides in the early twentieth century, was also a careful watercolorist, and this field guide includes 53 plates. Whereas the early editions of Field Book of Wild Birds and Their Music, still available in many libraries, featured Mathews' water colors in the three-color lithographic process, the black-and-white reproductions in this volume pale in comparison. That said, this field guide is still a startling little book with the very great potential of helping us see and think about what we've come to take for granted every time we open a field guide."},{"Title":"Fieldbook of Wild Birds and their Music","review":"I collect old bird book; specializing in field guides. I have been going through my collection and writing reviews on these old books as I fear that many have been completely forgotten. I am holding the 1908 printing of this book in my hands and leafing through it as I write this review. The book is not in very good shape but all the pages are present; if a bit loose.You can imagine my surprise (and I must admit, chagrin) when I found that a fellow reviewer beat me to this one. I just read the first review on this work by a reviewer named \\"s.5.\\" I have to tell you that his review is absolutely spot on and I would have difficulty adding anything to his words and he most certainly did it better than I could have done it. I actually don't think he missed a point...sort of stole my thunder...grumble, grumble, grumble.I kid...The only things I would like to add; or in this case emphasize is the fact that the original book did indeed have some magnificent colored prints rather than the black and white in the current reproduction. These were done in watercolor and truly go beyond mere illustrations and enter the world of art. Secondly, the author's descriptive prose is just that; prose. Rather than a clinical and rather coldish set of descriptive terms, you get the feeling that F. Schuyler Mathews is actually friends with his subject - he knows them on an intimate basis.In the current world of birding where the trend seems to be falling into the court of the lister, it is rather refreshing to take a trip back to the origins of this wonderful pastime. The emphasis of this book is on bird calls or sounds and the author has actually given us these calls in the form of musical notes. I must confess to you that I most certainly do my share of \\"listing\\" and have for years. I must also tell you though that as far as pure satisfaction goes, the listening and watching far outstrips that of dashing here and there manically adding to my life list. I remember that a few years ago I had my \\"best day.\\" Starting before sunrise I dashed here and there over a eighty mile section of land on the East Coast. In that one day I spotted and identified 86 species. Wow! Just a few days ago I spent three hours setting in the woods behind our house near a stream. I saw maybe 15 species during that period but I actually heard somewhere near 35 that I could identify and maybe another 15 that I could not. To be honest, I received much more pleasure in the listening than in the dashing around to the point of exhaustion.This is a nice book. If you can find a copy of the original do add it to your collection. If you cannot find a copy, then this reprint will do quite nicely.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"Summer on the lakes, in 1843","review":"Many American literature textbooks cover the topic of Transcendentalism with selections from just Emerson and Thoreau. Why they don't include some of the essays of Margaret Fuller is a mystery, especially in our current age of political correctness and emphasis on diversity. She provides a woman's opinion of life in general and of the landscape and people of the Midwest in particular in this, her first published book._Summer on the Lakes, in 1843_ is first and foremost a travelogue of Fuller's tour of the Midwest, and we follow her to Chicago and Milwaukee and into rural Michigan, Illinois, and Wisconsin. Her trip not only predates her friends' visits to the same area (Emerson first came through by stagecoach in 1850, and Thoreau took the train in 1861) but it also offers more observations about the people and the living conditions out on the prairie. Fuller had more time to spend roaming and adventuring, and she seems to have been more interested in the local culture than the men later were. (Or perhaps Emerson and Thoreau figured that Margaret Fuller had already provided the world with descriptions of the region, so they need not bother.) Midwestern readers should particularly enjoy the historic look at familiar landscapes, written at a time when white settlements were just beginning to congeal and take hold.Secondarily, Fuller focuses much of her writing on the plight of American Indians and also of women in general. She had read a great deal about the native people and seems disappointed to find that most of the Black Hawk War survivors had already moved west by the time of her visit. She also points a critical eye to the fate of the members of her gender who were helping to eke out a living on the prairie: \\"The great drawback upon the lives of these settlers, at present, is the unfitness of the women for their new lot.\\" ... All domestic labor \\"must often be performed, sick or well, by the mother and daughters, to whom a city education has imparted neither the strength nor skill now demanded.\\" (p. 38) And yet, many of the people she meets seem to be happy; and while life is hard and without most amenities, entertainment (even the occasional piano!) and merriment can abound.The narrative tends to languish when Fuller digresses into long-winded stories of the plights of specific women she either knew personally or heard about second- or even thirdhand. While these plot interruptions get tedious to the casual reader, they are further glimpses of feminine life in the early 19th century. Seen in that light, they can provide interesting diversions to the travelogue.Original illustrations by Fuller's traveling companion, Sarah Ann Clarke (sister of James Freeman Clarke) augment the text. This edition's introduction by Susan Belasco Smith helps to bring perspective to the trip and the writing. Recommended especially for residents of northern Illinois and to anyone interested in Midwestern history, transcendentalism, or women's studies. [This reviewer was an Illinois resident when these comments were written.]"},{"Title":"The world's history and its makers","review":"I purchased this as part of my son's homeschool library. Although I'm not a history buff, I found several parts of these books to be interesting."},{"Title":"The Message in the Hollow Oak (Nancy Drew, Book 12)","review":"This review concerns the original 1935 edition and the revised 1972 edition which is completely different from the original. In the original, Nancy wins a piece of land in northern Canada in a radio contest and almost immediately people are trying to buy the land from her. Could it be valuable? Determined to see the land for herself, Nancy, along with her friends Bess and George, set out for the remote wilderness of northern Canada. Along the way the three girls meet an authoress who tells them a sad story of how she was kept apart from her first love many years ago. Upon arriving at her land, Nancy finds that a ruthless group of swindlers is trying to steal her land from her. How Nancy reunites the authoress with her first love and outsmarts the group of swindlers makes for a rather interesting story. This really isn't a mystery story, it's more of an adventure; however, it is quite an exciting book. The story grabs your attention very quickly and there is plenty of action. The northern Canadian setting is used very effectively. The end of the book was very good, as it displays two of Nancy's best qualities, her courage and her willingness to sacrifice something that is hers to help someone else. Unfortunately, this edition is not the one found in new book stores; however, if you ever find it at a used book store, buy it, you won't be disappointed with it. In the revised edition, Nancy goes to the Ohio River area of Illinois to search for a hollow oak. Legend has it, that in the 1600s a French missionary hid a treasure in a hollow oak but was killed before he could reveal its location. This version isn't bad. The book kept me interested throughout but it never had me so engrossed that I couldn't put it down.

I thought it was very interesting to see in her point of view on how to solve her mysteries. She has a very creative mind.I thought that Nancy was interesting because she always knows what to do when everyone else is stuck. She tends to always find a way to solve her mystery and help other people that are also part of it. Nancy and her friends may at some times get in a little mischief, but always, no matter how bad the situation, find different ways to get out of it. It also occurs to me that in this book, they never have gotten in any illegal problems, but had to phone the police a couple of times to keep Nancy safe. One thing that I also like is that she thinks of things that I would have never thought of before and it helps me just in case I might need something to solve, but not as intense.The Message in the Hollow Oak is a great book for young and older readers.

Filled with coincidences, contrivances and other leaps of logic, this particular installment doesn't make a heck of a lot of sense.It begins with one of the more contrived set-ups in this series, in which Nancy wins a competition when the title she submits for a novelist's story is selected. The first prize is - of all things - a tract of land in Canada. Eager to go and see it for herself, Nancy organizes herself, Bess and George for travel.Her father's latest client just happens to be familiar with the territory and suggests a friend that can provide lodgings for Nancy in Lake Wellington. Outside, Nancy just happens to run into this very woman and prevents a robbery by the man who just happens to be working with a suspicious fellow who has an interest in Nancy's newfound property. On the journey to Lake Wellington, Nancy just happens to be on the same train as the writer of the story she won the competition for, who just happens to be connected with various people involved in the case.Although when I say \\"case\\", there isn't really much of one. Instead it's more like Nancy versus the corrupt gold-miners. Various people seem to be interested in Nancy's land, but only because they suspect there is gold to be found on it. A man has gone missing, but it's reasonably easy to ascertain what's happened to him. There is a bit of a star-crossed lovers plot involved, but this is resolved quickly. Most of the plot is just manufactured situations and coincidences piling up upon more coincidences.Bess sleepwalks for no reason. A train derails just *because*. A man willingly gives up a hostage even though he already had want he wanted from Nancy, and even though the hostage's testimony gets him sent to prison. Even the titular hollow oak isn't of any particular importance to the story, save that it holds a note that Nancy couldn't possibly have deduced was there. And some plot points go completely unexplained. The tree itself is a secret letter box between two lovers who are parted because someone put a fake note in the tree - but who this person was and why they did it is never explained.Other bizarre occurrences include Nancy successfully lassoing Bess as she's falling to her death, and Nancy palming a key out of a man's hand without him noticing. How are either of these things even possible?Oh, and see how there's a skull in the tree in the cover art? There's no such thing in the book.Don't get me wrong, I love the Nancy Drew books. But there's always one bad apple, and \\"The Message in the Hollow Oak\\" falls far from the usual quality of these mysteries. Unless you're a completist, you can give this one a miss."},{"Title":"The Message in the Hollow Oak (Nancy Drew, Book 12)","review":"How did Ms. Benson write such a wide range of books in such varying locations?

What happened to the audio recordings of Nancy Drew books 10 and 11? Why wasn't 'The Message in the Hollow Oak,' book 12, circulated as a new recording, if it was/is indeed an official recording? Why no picture of the audio CD jacket cover, and no books 10 and 11 preceeding this 'only available through other sources' audio recording? As a collector of these audio books, I find this very MYSTERIOUS!!!"},{"Title":"Gods and Spacemen in the Ancient East","review":"I am the type of person that is very interested in these things.

There are however several things we should thank him for. 1. He supressed the drug trade. If we had the drugs from Cubans in Miami as well as from Cuba we would have been in a pretty pickle.2. He stopped the AIDS epidemic in Cuba using simple public health.3. He brought literacy to Cuba, something states like Arkansas and New Jersey have not yet accomplished.4. He provided universal health care for people and especially children.5. He launched a program of vaccination for all Cubans.6. He supressed prostitution and crime, unlike Las Vegas or Cleveland.This biography seeks to explain this mysterious man who has done great good but through irrecondite stuborness has allowed forty years of blockade in the name of soverignty.

In his history of this classic car, told from a British perspective, the text is easy to read, and the author displays a thorough understanding of how cars work. There are plenty of excellent photos, some in color but mostly not. I learned *why* the ignition key is on the floor (safety feature), and got further insights into this small company's heritage as an innovator, e.g. how, with the 96, they had an extremely aerodynamic car rivalled only by the Citroen DS, or how they insisted, for safety reasons, on using heavier sheet metal than other makers, explaining its enduring status among automotive brands."},{"Title":"Saab 99 and 900: The Complete Story (Crowood Autoclassic)","review":"A Saab 900 has always been dear to my heart, since my first in 83, my second in 89 and my last in 93. It was in 2001, when I traded my 93 in on a Mercury Sable wagon, but by then Saab had turned from a car that was unique, sophisticated and ahead of the artistic game into just another arm of GM. After reading this book I am reminded why I had purchased three cars from the same maker. It was the best thing on the road at the time and now I sadly wish I would never have given that beauty away. Mr. Cole has done a wonderful job of capture the allure of a car company that was way beyond the mass produce trash on the american roads at the time. Even today a Saab 900 in good condition looks far better than most of the new ideas out on the road. Sadly GM stepped in and that was the end of it."},{"Title":"Saab 99 and 900: The Complete Story (Crowood Autoclassic)","review":"This is a nice book for any 99 or 900 owner who truly enjoys their car and its history. The book concentrates on the history more than the mechanics of the vehicle and makes for a fun read. One can open up to any page and begin reading to find an interesting tid bit on either of the cars or SAAB in general. There are many different photos exploring the different variants and trim of the cars as well as demonstrating interior and x-ray shots of the car. The book is in no way a technical manual though it does give basic specifications of the car and accounts of the mechanical build; this makes for a fun read. I own a '76 99GL and the book has offered valuable insight and concise knowledge that was scattered or not even available on the net about the build and history of the car."},{"Title":"Saab 99 and 900: The Complete Story (Crowood Autoclassic)","review":"Well written and covers a lot of material but the e-book version suffers from poor layout. Specs are splayed into an annoying vertical format and are hard to read. Images are squished. It would much more enjoyable to read if these problems were fixed."},{"Title":"Saab 99 and 900: The Complete Story (Crowood Autoclassic)","review":"If you're a fan of the Saab 99 or 900 this book should be in your personal library. Along with a succinct history of Saab up to the creation and production of the 99, on through the introduction of the turbo to Saab engine design and then working through the early 900 series up until the purchase of Saab by GM, this book is pretty comprehensive. You need to keep in mind it was written with Great Britain in mind, but it does make pretty thorough references to the USA spec cars for those of us Saabists here on the American continent. I wish there was a book this good covering the 900 after GM's purchase of Saab and continuing through the 9-3, but there's not (yet). If you like or are interested in Saab design and some history, this book is worth picking up."},{"Title":"Saab 99 and 900: The Complete Story (Crowood Autoclassic)","review":"I really enjoyed reading this history on Saab cars.

Despite the title, this book tells ofthe entire history of Saab. The short length of the book is merelyreflective of the small number of Saab models that have been producedover the years.I can only reflect on what Saab could have been. Saab could have builton the success of the turbo model to equal or better BMW. That wouldhave been a tall order but it was possible. Instead Saab is now onlife support and soon production will be moved to Opel factories inGermany.

I find it to be very disturbing and not very appropriate for young children. The underlying themes that I get are those of abuse and a &quot;Be good or we will leave you&quot; sort type of threat. This becomes more apparent if you know something about the author. Each time I see this book my skin crawls. There is a frenzied energy about the whole thing which makes me uncomfortable. I think this is either a love or hate sort of book. I haven't talked to anyone who &quot;kind of&quot; liked it."},{"Title":"The Lonely Doll","review":"My 40 something daughter was delighted.

Although I could not read or remember the title, the images, characters and plot stayed with me well into adult hood. As I was randomly scrolling for dolls for my daughter on Amazon.com, this book came up, and I just had to purchase it for her. She fell in love with the book, and asks me to read it to her every night. I do not blame her; I'm sure she finds this piece of literature as alluring and fascinating as I did. The black and white photography is genius and memorable, adding awe to this timeless childhood read."},{"Title":"The Lonely Doll","review":"This is a lovely book as are all of Dare Wright's. Forget what the one-star PC-types say, children understand more than you think and all you have to do is explain to them that spanking is \\"something we don't do anymore and this was written a long time ago (1957).\\" If they cannot read, just skip that part of the text. Fairy Tales contain more weirdo stuff. You cannot shelter children from literature or what the real world is like forever. They will only rebel and find it anyway, even small ones. I raised three well adjusted daughters so I'm not just speaking out of school."},{"Title":"The Lonely Doll","review":"What I remember about all of Dare Wright's books was that reading them made me happy. The Lonely Doll did all the bad stuff I wanted to do but never did, like writing bad things all over the bathroom mirror with lipstick. Even as a five-year-old, I related very strongly to the story of The Lonely Doll, and recall finding some strange comfort in the images, which are all high-quality black-and-white photographs.However, I can't say if the images in this book are developmentally appropriate for pre-K or K-3 readers, nor am I certain whether I would read it with my own children. For those of you who don't know the specifics, the Lonely Doll named Edith misbehaves, and she gets her butt spanked by the authoritative Mr. Bear. He then promises her that he will never, ever leave her. It may not be the kind of message we want to share with our little girls. 'He hits me but then he says he loves me, and he promises that he'll never leave me'."},{"Title":"The Lonely Doll","review":"We like many other families found this book at the library and fell in love with the Lonely Doll and her family Mr. Bear and Baby Bear. Our library like probably yours carries all kinds of books, new & current books and books from long ago.... like from 1957's and older.If you take in mind when this book was orignally published SPANKING was a common way of child rearing, go ahead think back to your parents telling how they where raised. I'm not saying spanking is acceptable for todays children, in our home we don't spank we have time outs instead.To our family this story is about a little lonely doll named Edith who lives alone in a home, maybe her owner has grown up and has gone away to college or is no longer there and Edith is all a lone and longs for a family. After wishing for a family one day her doorbell rings and there at the door is Mr. Bear and baby bear and they become a forever family.Yes, you might see some of Edith's bloomers but it's not like we are seeing a t-back.... we are looking at bloomers for heavens sake! Spanking is not socially acceptable now and when my daughter and I read these books the story lends and becomes a conversion about how children where raised a long time ago and how in our family that we don't spank. Mr. Bear is the father figure in this book and family and sometimes parents don't do want we want them to do or make us do homework, stay safe and discipline us, and little bear is your typical little brother or sibling. Someone to be friends with, have fun with, get into trouble with, tease and the love/dislike you have for your sibling.The book was made using Edith AKA the Lonely Doll who is a felt Lenci Doll from the 1920s which belonged to Dare as a child. She sewed Edith's outfits for the books and changed her eye color to blue, resembling the author's looks. Mr. Bear was a teddy bear made by Schuco, and Little Bear was a special edition Steiff \\"Jackie Bear.\\"[...]When you or your child find a book at the library take a moment and check the book out before you take it home and if there is something you find questionable... spanking and possible bloomers being shown look at when the book was published. And if there is a book that looks really good, but there might be something that is questionable look at the book and see if there is a something that you can talk to your child and make it into a learning experiance."},{"Title":"The Lonely Doll","review":"One of the most charming and unusual children's picture books ever published, The Lonely Doll employs photographs rather than drawings to tell the story. Particularly appealing to young girls, Lonely Doll depicts the adventures of Edith the doll and her friend Little Bear and the stern yet loving Mr. Bear. The book has enchanted children since the 60's and is gaining even more appeal now that a doll based on the original Edith is being produced. Your child will read The Lonely Doll with pleasure now and remember it with fondness as an adult"},{"Title":"The Lonely Doll","review":"I purchased this book because I remembered I read it as a young child. I still love the pictures and the characters but I do have to agree with alot of other reiews that this book is not appropriate for children. The story is dark (a child who's left alone with no explaination of why ), spanking is used as a form of punishment, and the idea of strangers taking over a child's welfare is creepy. I love the book for the pictures and the layout. I suggest buying this book but not giving it to a young child."},{"Title":"The Lonely Doll","review":"My mother used to read this book to me when I was a little girl (I'm now 40) and I even have an audio tape of her reading it to me when I was 18 mos and I would &quot;read&quot; along with her, reciting the parts that I had memorized from her many readings. I now have a 3 month old girl and am so pleased to have found an original 1957 edition of this book to read to her. I will also get the new edition when it comes out. The story is priceless and the illustrations (which are actually pictures taken by the author Dare Wright) are wonderful. Its a good story to use to teach about friendship and discipline in love."},{"Title":"The Lonely Doll","review":"When I read this book as a child, one of the messages I got was that even pretty china dolls get spanked (not just us plain brunette children with short noses). Another message was that I should be happy with my family because they didn't threaten to abandon me.As a parent I now wonder what message of \\"family\\" this book would give adopted children or any children. Children often fear abandonment due to their misbehaviour; why would we want to encourage that?I decided not to keep the copy of \\"The Lonely Doll\\" that was given to us and I could not in good conscience pass it on to another family.By the way, I find it disturbing that the Hornbook review refers to a \\"good spanking\\".They are lovely photographs and I liked the cover."},{"Title":"The Lonely Doll","review":"i read this book as a young girl in elementary school. i loved it; it was imaginative and it made the reader feel as though they were right there with Edith and the two bears. i know it made me feel that way when i read it. years later in my early 20's, i bought this book as a gift for my kid sister who hadn't started school yet. now in my 40's i want to get this book to give to my 14 year old daughter. i think this book spans all ages and is certainly a keepsake."},{"Title":"The Lonely Doll","review":"We received this book as a gift.

I stopped reading the book and I will take it out of my house."},{"Title":"The Lonely Doll","review":"Sweet, simple and very appealing to 4-6 yr old girls. I loved this as a child and during a library trip my 4 yr old chose it for herself. We finally had to buy a copy of each of the Doll stories.

Dare Wright is very creative."},{"Title":"The Lonely Doll","review":"I have a feeling that this is a must have in the library of every sicko in the world.

I only wish I had known there were 10 books in the series since I was under the impression that there were only the original 3.

Maybe it was because they consist of photographs, while I love other types of illustration. Then I read the biography of Dare Wright, author of the Lonely Doll books. This fascinating and tragic woman piqued my interest in her books. Her photos are so detailed it's almost unbelievable. The lengths to which she went to set up each shot is phenomenal. I love this book, as I'm sure legions of children have through the years. As an adult, I appreciate it for its artistic merits."},{"Title":"The Lonely Doll","review":"Dare Wrights books, this one and all of her books f eaturing Edith the lonely doll are PURE ARTISTRY. As an artist myself, I find Dare Wright to be ahead of her time...for she gave children for decades simple themes and smiles. Frankly I am tired of reading negative reviews about her superb books by yuppie parents who read their own \\"Freudian\\" theories into every line. These books were written in an era we will never ever see again-a time when little girls looked and dressed like little girls, and children respected adults and enjoyed a nice book to read. I have a message to all of today's yuppie parents: please appreciate these and all classic children's books and art... and please remove your thoughts from today's stagnation and yuppie mindset...KMW"},{"Title":"The Lonely Doll","review":"My wife and I bought this book soon after my daughter was born (she's now 7), because of the admittedly beautiful photos and what on the surface appears to be a sweet story. After reading it a few times, we half-joked that after being spanked by the father bear, the Lonely Doll practically tells him, \\"Do anything you want, just don't leave me!\\" This bothered us enough that we put the book away and no longer read it to our daughter. As it turns out, after reading reviews of \\"The Secret Life of the Lonely Doll,\\" we find we weren't too far off. \\"The Lonely Doll\\" provides a bit of insight into the life of Dare Wright, whose father and brother left at an early age, and who had an unhealthy relationship with her mother. Unfortunately, her disturbed psychology seems to be reflected in the \\"Lonely Doll\\" books.So, unlike others, the spanking in the book doesn't bother us per se. But we didn't feel the \\"don't-leave-me-I'll-do-whatever-you-want\\" undertext was appropriate for a little girl in whom we're trying to engender independence and self-respect.Maybe we're being overly analytical about what is ostensibly a children's book, and there are certainly other children's books with less-than-ideal messages. But we thought the message in this one was particularly undesirable for our daughter and thought other parents might feel the same."},{"Title":"The Lonely Doll","review":"My father died 1 month after my 6th birthday. He used to pick me up from nursery school on his lunch break the year before, and take me to the public library. I still remember those happy moments! While searching through the library shelves recently I happened upon &quot;The Lonely Doll&quot;. In an instant I remembered my father and those wonderful trips to the library! I had loved the book but had completely forgotten about it . Seeing the book brought back such a rush of happiness and joy. It was like finding a piece of my &quot;daddy&quot; in that discovery. This is a touching story of loneliness and friendship. the pictures are still so engaging, even for a 40 year old like me!

We about died laughing! We found it at the library and I let my daughter check it out because it looked so charming with the 1950's style photos and text. I thought it would be a little old fashioned type of tale that we would read once and move on to the next. Little did I know that my kiddos would find the vernacular hilarious. I'm sure that this is not meant to be a humorous book but we couldn't help ourselves. We cracked up when the dolly shouted, \\"My hair looks dreadful!\\" And again when her little bear friend added, \\"All you need now, is lipstick!\\" And when he used the lipstick to write \\"Mr. Bear is a silly old thing!\\" on the mirror, my son announced that he thought he was going to pee his pants from laughing! Right now, they are acting out the antics of the dolly Edith and her naughty friend Little Bear. Mommy, I'm sure will soon be called upon to play the Heavy--Mr. Bear (better practice my spanking!)On a more serious note, take this book for what it is: an outdated story written in the 1950's. The photos are adorable and the language used is charmingly old fashioned but p.c. the message is not.

I recently came across it in a bookstore and was both disappointed in some of the blatant sexism it contains and disturbed by the inappropriateness of the spanking scene. As I reviewed the photo of Edith being spanked (always one of my favorite parts as a child), I felt a little thrill and realized that this scene planted an early seed that led to me developing certain sexual tastes as an adult. I'm not blaming the book, I'm just saying it isn't as innocent as some would argue and I would not share this book with my children. (Do a little research into the author and you'll see that she was a tad creepy.)I also think the spanking scene sends a questionable message to those children whose parents are trying to teach them that no one has the right to use violence against them.

To those of you who see this as absuive and sending a negative message--please consider: A) It was written when spanking children was considered perfectly acceptable (and no, I don't condone that, my daughter has NEVER been spanked) and B)my kid found the spanking thing quite amusing and smacked the picture of Mr. Bear to punish him back. In other words: It's a pretty book, with lovely photographs and THAT's what the children enjoy.Oh, yeah, my daughter ADORES the books and her Edith doll that goes with."},{"Title":"The Lonely Doll","review":"This book really bothered me as a child and at the time I couldn't say what it was that bothered me so much.

Had author Dare Wright been told by her psychiatrist (an entity that, to the best of my knowledge, she never had any much needed contact with) that it might do her some good to explicitly put her daddy/abandonment issues into a work of childhood fiction, she could not have come up with a better product than the one here before us. Children have been unwittingly exposed to this historical moment of insanity for years and years now. And what with a new burgeoning (some might say macabre) interest in Dare Wright as a person, \\"The Lonely Doll\\" has been foisted back onto the printing presses of the Houghton Mifflin Company for everyone to read once more. And what a read it is. Spanking. Petticoats. Oddly staged photographs. The whole kerschmozzle feels remarkably out-of-date but still weird enough that you can't look away. It's like watching a train wreak. A beautifully staged, hideously entrancing train wreak.Bear with me while I give you a summary of the plot. Wright's strengths may have lay in many areas but dialogue, narration, and storytelling were not the first ones that come to mind. There once was an exceptionally pretty little doll named Edith. Edith apparently had a fine little life, except that she lived all by her lonesome. One day, two traveling stuffed bears came to stay with her and be her friends. And at first all was well. Mr. Bear (the patriarch of the proceedings) would teach the little bear and Edith lessons and they got to play all the time. Oh sure, there was the occasional scolding but nothing too severe. That is, until the day Mr. Bear went out for a rainy walk leaving the two alone in the house. Before you knew it they dressed up in some of the old clothes, put on make-up, and wrote the oh-so-shocking words, \\"Mr. Bear is just a silly old thing\\" in the mirror. And for this unspeakable act of vice the returning Mr. Bear gave a thorough spanking to the two for their crimes. Now up until now, the book's been a little weird but not particularly crazy. But it is at this point that the physical punishment (Edith overturned on Mr. Bear's knee with frilly petticoats ah-showing) for these relatively minor crimes is trumped by Edith's reaction. Is she mad or upset at the spanking? Not in the least! She's miserable because she thinks this means Mr. Bear's going to take off with the little bear and leave the lonely doll of the title all by herself again. So with much bowing and scraping and oh-please-don't-leave-me's, Mr. Bear agrees to stay and all is happy and joyful once more.The plot, as I've written it, is not the kind you'd see put on the market for the first time today. Not through any reputable publisher anywho. The spankage is a far cry from the standard Kevin-Henkes-time-out punishments doled out in contemporary picture books. But just concentrating on that aspect of the book isn't an accurate way of explaining the doggone weirdness of the whole \\"Lonely Doll\\" enterprise. A lot of this is in the photographs themselves. Books of this nature, where characters are just toys that are set up and photographed so as to act out a story, are rare. Black and white photos at that. Black and white photos about an uncommonly pretty doll. Edith (whom some have pointed out bears a striking resemblance to her own creator) is remarkable partly because her face has been perfectly constructed. She can express any emotion depending on how one shoots her and what the situation is that she's in. While her hands and feet are lumpy and unformed, her face and air are always at their best. And say what you will about the book, Wright had a way with a camera. These are splendidly rendered photos that work precisely because of the time and effort put into them. So well done there.Really, it's Edith's neediness that remains the single unchallenged and most distressing point of this book. As many biographers of Wright's life will tell you, the author was abandoned by her father and brother at a young age. And here, in her new and improved doll form, they come back in a sense and... um... spank her. Hm. And when the father bear does so Edith begs him never to leave. She just can't stand the thought of ever being alone. I'm not one to tell parents what books are or aren't good for children. But I get the distinct impression here that no matter what kind of kid you have, they'll probably be as confused about Edith's wimpy neediness as you are after reading this book.Still, people who read this as kids swear by it. And they probably haven't ended up as passive doll-like schlubs. Nevertheless, I can think of far better books with similar themes. Like pretty female doll picture books? Try \\"Dahlia\\" by Barbara McClintok. Or how about a doll book that breaks through stereotypes and will expand your child's mind? Go for \\"William's Doll\\" by Charlotte Zolotow. Like stories where a lonely person finds friends through trial and error? Try, \\"Pig and Crow\\" by Kay Chorao. Or books that contain lots of fun photographs? Spend your time poring over Walter Wicks' stuff. But if you're like me and you want to see what all the fuss is about, definitely read \\"The Lonely Doll\\" for yourself. I can say with absolute certainty that while it's not going to win any parenting or literary awards, it takes first prize in the I'm-going-to-live-out-my-personal-issues-through-this-here-doll category any day. Freaky but enthralling."},{"Title":"The Lonely Doll","review":"Parents won't regret giving these stories to their children.

It was purchased for a very bright little 2-yr old girl. She is already having little pretend tea partiesof her own. So, we decided to order this book. It is truly lovely. The photographs are precious. The story line is great. I would recommend this book to anyone who has a little girl. Girls of all ages will love it."},{"Title":"The Lonely Doll","review":"I just read this book with my daughter, actually she read it aloud to me. We enjoyed the photos very much. We laughed, gasped and said \\"uh-oh\\" a lot. I must admit to finding the spanking scene a bit odd for a children's book but my daughter didn't seem to think anything of it. And no, she has never experienced anything like that herself. Maybe it is because she reads a lot of british children's books i.e Enid Blyton's Famous five series and Roald Dahl books that the darker side of kids lit does not faze her. I came to Amazon to find out what others thought of this book and was not surprised what I found. It all became clear when I learned a little about the author's early life. What a creative way to express her pain. Kids wont see any of those elements and wont care to either, they'll just enjoy the story."},{"Title":"The Lonely Doll","review":"I was given one of these books in 1963 and loved reading it through my childhood. I bought these for my grandchildren to love as well."},{"Title":"The Lonely Doll","review":"I received this book as a birthday present when I was six. It was my first real book, and I fell in love with it, and never forgot it! For years I tried to find a copy for my own collection, and then last year in a bookstore I spotted the memorable pink gingham cover of The Lonely Doll and bought it for my girls. I have a second grader who is a very reluctant reader. Yet this book with its wonderful photographs and simple story has enthralled her and has her begging me for the others. I think it's done the trick!"},{"Title":"The Lonely Doll","review":"Dare Wright, The Lonely Doll (Houghton Mifflin, 1957)Many's the time I've heard The Lonely Doll called the most disturbing childrens' book ever produced. With sudden new attention being paid to Dare Wright thanks to The Secret Life of the Lonely Doll and a forthcoming movie based upon her, this seemed the perfect time to revisit this twisted little tale and see if it's really as nightmare-inducing as everyone says it is.The short answer is \\"no.\\" The thing that I would think would induce the most nightmares, the doll itself, is actually rather neutral in expression, and doesn't give off the sense of ultra-creepiness one gets from the works of, say, Hans Bellmer. What does get a little odd is the storyline itself, which is tailor-made for years and years of therapy, with parental abandonment, sexual repression, and willful disobedience all wrapped up into a stew that is liable to give any young children it's read to deep-seated issues. But the damage will not be short-term; you don't have to worry about buying this for your kids and them not being able to sleep the next night. (Suicide attempts and alcoholism later on down the road, though, are likely possibilities.)An interesting cultural artifact for adults, but I wouldn't let my kid within ten miles of it. **"},{"Title":"The Lonely Doll","review":"Although I now consider myself a feminist in many ways, I loved this book when I was little and don't think the book is as terrible or harmful to children as some other reviewers have said. In fact, I picked this book many times off the shelf as my bedtime story. When I was little, I thought it was saddening at some parts (Wright's pictures conveyed loneliness very well) but also funny at others (call me strange, but I laughed when Edith got spanked and when the teddy bear wrote \\"Mr. Bear is a silly old thing\\" on the mirror).This book taps into fears that many young children experience, particularly being alone, fear of their parents leaving & never coming back (separation anxiety) and getting in trouble with parents. Some reviewers expressed concerns that the story tells girls to be needy and dependent to get what they want because Edith begs Mr. Bear to stay, telling him that she'll do whatever he wants if he does (or something to that extent). But remember, she is in a state of fear, and many people say \\"I'll do anything if you...,\\" in moments of desperation. Plus, how many children love exploring \\"off-limits\\" rooms of their home as Edith and the little teddy bear do? Also, I agree that spanking is an inappropriate way to discipline, but many children are spanked every day and therefore can relate (I was spanked when I was a child too). Additionally, the photographs are vivid, clear and definitely draw readers into the story. When I was a young child, I thought the doll really was alive.If you want a story with unusual-yet-beautiful pictures and a little extra \\"oomph\\" than some other children's books, I recommend it. And if you really are concerned about whatever Freudian messages might be in the book, you can always talk about the story after reading to your children."},{"Title":"The Lonely Doll","review":"Honestly, I have read all of the criticisms of this wonderful book with astonishment!I was one of the many lucky kids who discovered these books about the doll with my favorite name (mine!) at the library. I returned them only reluctantly and of course, overdue!To the criticisms: my parents raised me with the idea that I would be an independent and discerning kid. They encouraged me to make up my own mind about things. As a 6 year old, I recognized that this story was about a LONELY DOLL, not a well-adjusted, independent PC doll. She had issues and she did the best she could with them; but more than that, she turned her little doll life into something adventurous and magical. The breathtakingly imaginative and exquisitely staged black and white photographs by Dare Wright (imho, a creative genius) opened my eyes to the creative side of life in ways I am still discovering as a crusty 46 year old.You would be doing your child a disservice to deprive him or her of these works for the sake of unattainable pc perfection by overlooking their real theme: imagination, the beauty of mystery and transformation.I bought each of my nieces a copy.Edie"},{"Title":"The Lonely Doll","review":"What a pity that such a charming, aesthetically pleasing story as The Lonely Doll has become cannon fodder for overly zealous parents who are hellbent on political correctness. Previous reviewers have noted that the author, Dare Wright, was abused as a child and that the shadows of this abuse are present in the text itself. I submit that this is a bunch of baloney. By reading a nonexistent adult subtext into this sweet, simple book, many adults are depriving their children of a great classic. I adored it as a child, and my six-year-old daughter adores it too."},{"Title":"The Lonely Doll","review":"I never owned a copy of this book as a child, but I pretty nearly weared out the copy at my local public library.Of course it is a product of its time. Surely no children's book editor would dare to publish such a thing in this PC world, and that is a shame. I read the book over and over again and am a happy, well-adjusted middled aged woman who never once had a fear of being abandoned by my parents (in part because they taught me to distinguish fiction from reality).I also really loved the Puppet Storybooks (remember, the ones with the dizzying 3D covers?!), so I must be drawn to photography of puppets/dolls. Edith had beautiful clothes. It was so exciting to watch her play dress up. Really, I doubt that I read much of the dialogue (though I did read the doll's lipstick graffiti on the mirror!), but I poured over the photographs.How happy I am to have my very own copy now (and of other books in the series, though none are as well-loved as the first)."},{"Title":"The Lonely Doll","review":"I was thrilled to find this in a used bookstore a few years ago and promptly bought it for my own kids. All three have loved it. They identify with universal themes of lonliness, thrill of doing something forbidden, fear of getting in trouble and happiness at being forgiven.Plus, it's so free of the baggage of today's silliness, which makes me happy. People who object to the dolls frilly underwear showing are probably the same folks who object to the boy's exuberant nakedness in Sendak's book (The Night Kitchen\\" I think)."},{"Title":"The Lonely Doll","review":"I first discovered this book when I was six and attending a saturday story time at our school library. So enchanted was I by Edith and the bears that I never noticed the lights going out in the library or the click of the lock as I was being locked in. I was found a short time later and left happily with this delightful book. Edith is such a lovely doll and the bears so cute that even a preschooler will enjoy the photographic illustrations. The story is well written and the mischievous Edith is sure to make you smile. This is a true favorite from my childhood and now a favorite of my own kids."},{"Title":"The Lonely Doll","review":"Although Edith is a doll, she is a more realistic portrayal of a real little girl than you will find in most children's literature. She's sometimes selfish, sometimes loving, sometimes helpful and sometimes naughty, acting carelessly. She has REAL feelings like a real child - acting out in selfishness and harsh words when she is angry, etc. In Edith and Mr. Bear, Edith accidentally breaks Mr Bear's prize clock after being told not to touch it. The guilt eats at her and she makes all those around her miserable. (Gasp - she actually has a conscience!) Finally in the end, she clears it through confession and apologizes to all. I guess the parents who wish to censor these books from their children think that bad deeds should go unpunished. We are never in doubt that Mr Bear loves Edith and feels responsible for her. When she is bad and selfish, she gets disciplined but she is still loved. Those parents I see objecting to the material in this book are those who think their children can do no wrong and look the other way when they do. The whole \\"Don't leave me\\" argument is ridiculous; for anyone who has punished a child knows that most kids have said such things when they have been put in a time out. And Mr Bear goes off in search of his beloved Edith when she is missing; we never doubt his care for her. I think even children can see this. Somehow adults cant?Dare Wright uses an old Lenci doll that she came across and remade into a lovely little work of art. As a doll artist myself, I absolutely adore this book and don't find it frightening at all. The bears are by Steiff and also are adorable. These little items exist in their own little world -not as toys, but as creatures inhabiting their own world. My children all love this book and we even bought the little doll made a few years ago to go with it.I would refer the same individuals who protest this book to some of Beatrix Potter's writings. Peter Rabbit gets a pretty good dressing down; and Squirrel Nutkin finally gets his tail chopped off for his misdeeds. Going back further, Cinderella's sisters get their eyes pecked out by birds for their selfish attitudes and Little Red Riding Hood gets eaten by a wolf for straying from the path.Really; it's only in the past few years that parents have somehow sought to sanitize children's literature and purge it from all unpleasantness and consequences."},{"Title":"The Lonely Doll","review":"This book is a sort of time capsule of childhood in the 50s-60s. We were spanked. Would you ban Oliver Twist? Or Harry Potter? Or \\"protect\\" your children from all realities of life?Edith is a doll. But she is an adventurous, creative and ultimately honest character. She expresses herself. As in most families of the day, there wasn't a lot of explanation for anything. Things just were. This was long before psychotherapy was en vogue or children had rights. And yet it still speaks truly to children of today. At least to children young enough to know better. Many parents don't seem to get it."},{"Title":"The Lonely Doll","review":"The spanking scene in this book has become controversial. Well, it IS fiction. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book to my grandchildren ages 3 and 6. They loved it too. The photos are amazing."},{"Title":"The Lonely Doll","review":"I recently acquired a copy of this tale for Amazon as a gift for a young cousin. I would like to thank Amazon for its very prompt service in sending it.It touches upon my personal fascination with the famous Lenci dolls, and it is interesting to see how posable the little felt creations are.Dare Wright's sweet old-fashioned tale about her own little Lenci named Edith touches upon her own issue of childhood lonliness.Little Edith, with her long blonde ponytail, has a very contemporary look about her as she goes about her lonely life of routine chores and having no one to play with in this 1957 literary offering.Finally, her prayers for long-term company are answered with the arrival of Mr. Bear and Little Bear, with whom she can go on outings, do her lessons, and have loving and caring relationships. But at one point, when Mr. Bear goes out and leaves Little Bear and Edith alone (and bored) one rainy day, the two run amock, are disciplined when Mr. Bear comes home, and Edith fears that her faux pas will drive her new companions away, but learns that she can embrace their unconditional love.Perhaps this tale has become a classic not only because of the cuteness of the photographed illustrations, but also because it is a relatable story that deals with feelings that we may have at all stages in life.Even five decades after its original publication, this is a sweet little story that rocks! I find it highly recommendable!"},{"Title":"The Lonely Doll","review":"I had a copy of this book when I was a little girl, and I loved it. It is a slightly disturbing story of a lonely, needy doll who more than anything doesn't want to be alone, and makes friends with two teddy bears.It's primarily a picture book of photographs of Edith, the doll, and her two teddy bear friends posed in scenes to help tell the story.As much as I like this book, I don't think that it's for everyone. Even when I was four or five years old I knew that something wasn't quite right with the story and that Edith was a little desperate.There is a dark quality to the mood of some of the pictures and Edith has some abandonment issues. There is a part in the book where Mr. Bear spanks Edith (Edith over Mr.Bear's knees with skirts up and doll panties showing). Edith says she doesn't care about the spanking, as long as Mr. Bear doesn't leave.There was a book written about Dare Wright(AKA- Edith) and apparently she was abandoned by her father and brother(played by Mr. Bear and Little Bear) and well...you get the picture.(no pun intended)So, if you are a bit dark and twisted, like me, you will probably dig this book and the other Lonely Doll books. Maybe even check out the biography on Dare. If you are looking for a book for your child, the pictures are interesting, but be aware that it's a story about a maladjusted doll."},{"Title":"The Lonely Doll","review":"Nightly, my little one wants me to tell her a bedtime story, so as we lay in bed together I try to come up with a sweet little story that will soothe her to sleep.

I retold the story as I remembered it fondly, and when I was finished she said, &quot;Mommy, you tell the best stories.&quot; And she soon fell asleep.

It's one of the few I can reread about every year, and enjoy as much as when I first read it. Poul Anderson was one of the science fiction genre's brightest stars, able to write sword and sorcery fantasy and hard science fiction with equal facility. This story is one of his best.Those familiar with Anderson's work will recognize that this book ties in (however peripherally) with some of his other stories, about a post apocalyptic future where a New Zealand/Micronesian amalgam culture known as the Maurai come to dominate the world after a nuclear holocaust, and having been less hard hit by the catastrophe, are left strong enough to impose their vision of a less industrialized, more ecologically balanced ideal on the rest of the world. This story concerns a group of time travellers (whose ability is inate, and due to a genetic mutation, rather than any external time machine), led by a charismatic, but bigoted and ruthless 19th century American, whose aim is to break the Maurai domination, and re-establish industrial civilization.The book tells the story of a bright, thoughtful, 20th century American who at first joins this group, then rebels against the ruthlessness countenanced by the group's leader. (But despite this, the book is clearly not some politically correct paean to eco-nazism, and the Maurai philosophy is represented thoughtfully as a way which does embody some genuine good, but which also became rigid, dogmatic, and even repressive -- in fact this is one of the best aspects of the story: neither side is wholly right or wholly wrong, but are each representative of good ideas and bad mingled together. This is highly realistic, as two sides in any conflict almost always have their valid points as well as their indefensible wrongs.) In addition to the adventure of the main character's war against his erstwhile comrades, there is a twofold romance story (understated, but well written), an engaging account of the protagonist's activities in the late 12th/early 13th century Byzantine Empire, and an interesting philosophical speculation about the nature of time tavel and fixed destiny versus free will.This book is now out of print, but pick up a used copy if you can. As I said, Anderson was one of the giants of the science fiction genre. There is no author writing today who is his equal. This is a great little story by a master of the field, and is simply entertaining in its own right as well, and well worth the read."},{"Title":"There will be time","review":"One of the cleverest of time travel novels, in this one a child is born with the mutant power to range through time. Otherwise normal, that power gets him into trouble, especially as he struggles to figure out what to do with it, and how to contact others of his own kind. A mutant who isn't a superman, a time travel story that has many suprising twists in a genre that often seems worn out, this work is HIGHLY recommended"},{"Title":"There will be time","review":"In the genre of time travel stories, travel by will alone is fairly rare. This book posits that some very few people have an innate ability to move through time, as though walking.The main character has to deal with this reality from birth, and he does so believably. This ability is more a curse than a blessing, and his struggle to find meaning in his bizarre life, isolated from the rest of the human race is poignant and palpable.This is a love story, and a good one. Though I haven't seen my copy in years, I think about it often. If you can find this book, get it, and read it. You won't regret it.Update 2.5 years later: I found a signed first edition copy of this book. I am never parting with it."},{"Title":"There will be time","review":"Time travel is one of my favorite sci-fi themes, and I've read dozens of books on the topic. Most sci-fi books are like James P. Hogan's hard sci-fi books, full of technology and long discussions between physicists. While There Will Be Time has some tech and some science dialogue, it's really a story about some very human themes like good vs evil, finding your purpose in life, and what obligations the strong have to care for the weak.I read this first as a teenager, and thought about it for years. I found a used copy in my thirties that I've re-read several times, and I'm starting to wear that one out. This is one of those rare books that I know I'll read over and over until my eyes give out."},{"Title":"There will be time","review":"Jack Havig was born with a rare gift: he is able to travel through time. As a time traveler Jack is able to visit any era in history...or travel to the distant future. Learning who he is takes Jack many years, and through the course of those years Jack builds a fortune, falls in love, and, in his hunt for others like himself, finds an enemy that threatens what humanity is to become.In There Will Be Time, Poul Anderson takes a concept which has been done time and again in science fiction and tells a tale that is exceedingly human and believable. Born with this gift, Jack's childhood is fraught with numerous episodes where he disappears...worrying his mother to no-end. Upon reaching adulthood, Jack is ceaselessly seeking a way to determine if he is the only one of his kind. I found Jack's maturation authentic and rational. If I had this ability to travel through time like Jack, I can easily see myself traveling through the same process of error and discovery.When Jack finally does find others of his kind...and learns who they truly are; what their motives are, Jack's actions are completely plausible, even if the actual writing of this part of the novel felt a bit edited.In fact, the only discernible flaw was that Anderson seemed so focused on the story he wanted to tell, that he denied diverging upon the tales of secondary characters with a ferocity one does not normally see in a novel. This is especially true of the denouement, which definitely could have been cushioned a bit more; elaboration would have been nice at several points.Flaws aside, this is a fine, engaging tale. As a first sortie into a Poul Anderson world, There Will Be Time has left me looking forward to picking up another of Anderson's tales in the future."},{"Title":"There will be time","review":"...but by no means a classic. I like Poul Anderson because he qualifies under the classification of a &quot;hard&quot; science fiction writer. Meaning his books incorporate more scientific references than such books as Enders Game (not to say that wasn't an incredible book). Point being, I like the fact that I can read a book, enjoy a pleasant plot and absorb some nice scientific knowledge along the way.That said, the plot of this book was nothing spectacular, but it was fun. It is the story of a small town kid from Midwest or Southern America (i forget) who is naturally endowed with the ability to time travel naturally. It is part of his biological make up. I have read from other reviews of Anderson's works that time travel as a pretty recurrent theme in his books and it gets a little tiring after a while. But this is my 2nd Anderson book and so far I am thoroughly pleased.If you are looking for the Sci-Fi read of the century, see Ender's Game, Dune, Ringworld, etc. But if you are beyond those and just want some weekend fun in the realm of &quot;hard&quot; sci-fi, give it a chance. At worst you'll learn something. At best, you'll learn something and enjoy it!"},{"Title":"There will be time","review":"Like H. G. Wells' Time Machine book, this book starts out well, exploring and describing the wonders of time travel, and then loses itself in a fictional \\"future\\" created by the author. It's difficult to suspend your disbelief in a future envisioned by a 1972 writer in a post-apocolyptic like world. Just like the Time Machine, the book changes to be less about time travel and more about the microcosm of his little fictional future. I guess I care more about the time travel itself than some of the \\"author's vision of the future\\" places it can take you."},{"Title":"There will be time","review":"Here's an inevitable but different take on the time travel story. It answers the question of where you would find other time travelers and what you would do when you found them. The place to find time travelers is apparently at Jesus' crucifixion. And what you do when you find them is to form a league of time travelers who can hopefully make the future a better place. Never have I seen any other time travel author touch on these ideas, but they do seem like obvious ideas.This story was quite enjoyable and only took a couple of sittings to finish. The time travelers in this story have a genetic predisposition to time travel with their physical body instead of by using a time machine. Their period of time travel covers quite a large period of time from the crucifixion to ancient Rome to pre-Colombian America to 1970s America to the day of judgment and beyond. It covers themes of love and deception and also tries to answer the question of what the ultimate possibility could be for a time traveler.I definitely think this time travel novel is a sadly overlooked one that should have become more famous than it did. Poul Anderson wrote several other novels with time travel themes that I'd like to delve into soon"},{"Title":"There will be time","review":"If you read enough Poul Anderson, you'll find similarities amongst his works.&quot;Avatar&quot; sees a group of people travelling through space, trying to find home.&quot;The Boat of a Million Years&quot; follows a group of immortals, who start on earth and then head for the stars because they live forever.&quot;There Will Be Time&quot; tells of a time traveller who influences the future of earth and then, yes!, decides to travel through space because time is only a minor inconvenience.Anderson lays the ground rules for this time novel: Known events can't be changed, time travelers stay in the same place relative to Earth, you can meet your future/past self. And there's the ever-present suggestion of self-created time loops.Good as far as time stories go, but unfortunately not a classic."},{"Title":"There will be time","review":"I have always been a big fan of sci fi, and of historical fiction, so I don't know how I missted this book. Im glad I finally saw a recommendation for it and read it. Not only did I enjoy the characters and plot, but I enjoyed mulling over the many ideas the author has about time travel, civilizations, and the future. My only quibble was that I wanted more history, esp about Constantinople, but I susped that would have detracted from his purpose.

Whether you hated it or loved it when you read it in high school, or even if you didn't read it in high school, it is an outstanding story and Bradbury's writing is as smooth and clean as always."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This slim little novella is a rollicking story about Guy Montag, a \\"firefighter\\" of the future who loves his job. His job is not to put out fires, but to set them. Montag and his comrades burn books for a living. It doesn't matter what type of books, they have all been targeted for incineration. Apparently, in the America of Guy's time, the people, and especially the government, have decided that books are a bad deal. Books make people think and agonize over choices, which is a bad thing. The real goal of society should be happiness for everyone. Since no one can be happy if they are always worrying about things they read, the solution is clear. Unfortunately, many people seem to have a problem with this, at least on a subconscious level. Suicides in Guy's world are sky high, so high that they have special teams of medics go around and suck pills and other nasty poisons out of the people who have decided they don't want to live anymore. The government does try to placate the masses through mind numbing television and radio shows (see Guy's wife, Mildred). People that refuse to go along with the program are sent away, or worse. Guy wakes up when he meets a young neighbor who turns him on to the way of experiencing life. Guy eventually rebels and ends up as part of a group who memorize books to preserve them for future generations.I'm leaving out lots of details to the book with this description. After all, I don't want to spoil the whole thing for you. What seems to be more important about this book is its value to today's world. Although written years ago, some of Bradbury's details are amazingly prescient. The omnipresence of television and other means of electronic control certainly ring true today. Also, the censoring of books continues unabated even now, with every type of group clamoring for some type of control over what the rest of us read. Certainly, burning books of every sort couldn't be far away. Since most people read nothing but pap these days anyway, I can imagine Plato and Milton going up in flames soon enough. Who wants to read that boring stuff when you can watch TV or go to a movie? Soon after this comes what Bradbury refers to as, \\"the tyranny of the masses.\\" If enough people don't want to do something, you better jump on the bandwagon too. Try going to work and speaking out against multiculturalism and see what happens. Throw out your TV set and tell people about doing so. You'll be branded a freak and avoided like the plague. People are cattle, plain and simple. Bradbury does seem to have some hope for our sorry condition, as can be seen at the end of the book. However, getting to that state will take some time, I'm afraid."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"What would society be like if books were banned and burned? Eventually people would lose the ability to think for themselves and they would lose control of their own lives. I'm passive and a coward for the most part, but this book is a true call to arms to protect books at all costs if there is ever a movement to ban and burn. I liked Bradbury's style, this book was a pleasure to read and will be a treasure to share with others. After reading this, don't forget the lessons within. Books are vital, but as an avid reader you know that already. The key is to share the message with others. Happy reading...."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Many writers have been called ahead of their time. Raymond Bradbury is a prime example of this. His novel, Fahrenheit 451, is far and away the most original book this reviewer has ever read, not to mention one of the best written.Bradbury has a unique style which allows the reader to picture the story in their mind in the style of a David Fincher movie. Chuck Palahnuk, author of Fight Club, shares this same quality.The most striking aspect of Fahrenheit 451 is by far its plot: firefighters who burn houses, rather than put out the fires. (...) the novel itself becomes hard to put down. As the reader follows the movements and thoughts of Guy Montag, rogue firefighter who dares to read books, making him a hypocrite. Montag's progression from book burner to advocater of reading, to fugitive on the run from a world who decides that he has learned too much is as strange as it is heroic.Bradbury's unique take on the future is common only with the views of George Orwell, author of 1984. In both of these novels, the government decides that it has had enough of the uniqueness that makes America so great, so \\"Big Brother\\" must eliminate. Despite this similarity, Fahrenheit manages to distance itself with the use of censorship. Censorship as it is is out of control in the United States, and Bradbury's tale is hopefully not prophetic. Overall, few books are as captivating and original as Ray Bradbury's beautiful Fahrenheit 451."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I hate science fiction books.So why am I giving this book 5 stars? Because it's simply wonderful, that's why. You won't get that feeling from the first couple pages, but if you stick with it, I swear, you will. The end of the book is best. The thoughts that Bradbury puts into his character's minds are so beautiful, sharp, and alive. I guess I like this book because even though it is supposively sci-fi, it's REAL too. The emotions are real, and even the setting &amp; society are familiar. It's wonderful. I started out hating it. Don't give up on it! Keep reading. I'm a sophomore in high school . . . but everyone, regardless of age should read this."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I am currently reading this book for high school. This review is to all you kids out there aswell as parents and interested buyers. THIS BOOK IS ALOT BETTER THEN YOU THINK. Parents who are trying to get their kids to read this, tell them about my review. I agree with &quot;a reader from Washinton, USA&quot;. It is similar to the Giver. The book may start out slow in the beginning but as the story starts to unfold it becomes fast paced and fun to read. It has its &quot;whats going to happen next&quot; moments. Its about a Fireman named Guy Montag. He isnt the normal fireman. Now fireman are used to start fires. They burn books, but not only that, they burn the houses that they are in and people that they are with. Montag loves his job. He enjoys seeing the books go up in flames. But he meets a girl, his new neighbor, Clarisse McClellan. She is a strange girl with crazy ideas in her head. But he learns from her. He thinks. For once in many years he thinks. Montag steals a book from a house that he must burn. He now realizes burning is not the way.Ok. Recommend it as a school reading book, not as a free time reading book. That just wont work. Let your kid pick their own freetime reading book. They wont enjoy a book if their parents try to force them into reading it. I'm a kid so I would know, and please, dont try to argue. The book is a fun book to read as a school book for a book report, reading log, summer reading log or things like that."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"IN this story, moralist Ray Bradbury tells us about a country in which books are illegal to read or posses, and firemen aren't employed to save houses, but to burn books. Guy Montag a fireman, and the story's protagonist, enjoys coming home every night form the firehouse waiting for a call, playing poker and telling crude jokes to his companions (who all looked exactly like him). He also enjoys the destruction and burning of the books and he is constantly bathed in a perfume of kerosene. Coming home form work he would often feel as if someone had been on this one particular corner, waiting for him, but he never stopped and looked around. He was like all the other folks, in that he would just keep going ahead to where he was going, not looking at what he was walking past. Except one night he stopped and met a girl who taught him of the past where folks were allowed to think and to read and to have original ideas for themselves, and the ability to write them down and share them with others. As the story progresses we go deeper into the world of Guy Montag, meeting his drug-abusing wife and her \\"family\\" on the telescreens. We discover the ways that the society works, about how people are impersonal, not knowing their own neighbors, and how the television thinks for everyone so that they don't have to. This book parallels other books depicting futures where it is near impossible to be a free-thinking individual, such as 1984 and brave new world. Also it resembles present day America, even more so now then when it was originally written. Ray Bradbury's easy to read, yet descriptive text makes the story easy to read and hard to put down. The plot thickens, twists and sickens with every page. It is a warning that everyone, especially now in a world that grows more and more like Mr. Montag's, should heed to."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I read this book in two days, and was focused throughout, inhaling Bradburys words and letting the book have its effect on my mind.What the book is missing in a THICK plot it gains in its writing style. Bradbury is simply a literary genius, and post-modern Marxist environments are his playground. The way that Bradbury depicts the forest which Montag enters after leaving the river is extremely surreal, if not surrealism in its nature.What I mean by &quot;What the book is missing in a THICK plot,&quot; is that Bradbury could have developed the story in a more progressive fashion, rather than leaving out some important aspects of Montag's world. The overall politics of the time in which this is supposed to take place are not even present in the novel. The way in which the society went from not being interested in books, to burning them also seems to be under-expressed.Criticizing an artist is something that I have a hard time doing, for when a writer writes, he writes, and that is all. Bradbury wrote, and this book is him, with its perceived flaws and all, I think that it is a masterpiece in a poetic sense, not in the sense that it has become a staple of highschool literature.I will put it this way, if you like the colorful environments of Allen Ginsbergs poetry, then you will surely enjoy at least the aesthetic qualities of Fahrenheit 451."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Only Bradbury's prose, terrifying and lovely, could bring this story to its rightful place as a literary masterpiece. His narrative of Dystopian society, distressing in its reality, reflects not only the lunatic consumerism of Western nations but the fallacy of freedom in a democracy. The hero, Guy Montag, wanders from uneasy fireman to eventual pariah; the discovery of something larger than himself, the wisdom of centuries contained within the very books he doused with flame, ignites his drive to discover that the world has far more to offer than bread and circuses. Moving like a ghost through his own home, ignored by a self-focused wife addicted to narcotics and electronic stimulus, Montag is painfully aware of the void between himself and the masses. This loss of intimacy, both within one's personal life and again in that most intimate of contact -- reading another's thoughts from an open book -- is the harbinger of man's fall from enlightenment. The world of Guy Montag does not begin upon opening this dark wonder, and there is no prophecy in its pages. The story is alive, here, now, and has been since the onslaught of corporate propaganda and our apathetic acceptance of plastic culture. Bradbury's subject is not that we are advancing into intellectual oblivion; it is, instead, that mankind is complacent enough to let it happen."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; describes a society where knowledge is controlled by book-burning 'firemen'. This government-implemented censorship starts as 'political correctness' -- upset people deface controversial books. Then government decides to pacify society by simplifying education and eliminating books. Noncontroversial interactive televised plays replace books as entertainment, neighbors inform on neighbors possessing books, and firemen incinerate houses containing books.Guy Montag, a fireman, meets a young woman who chides him for living but not experiencing life. Guy examines his life. His relationship with his wife Mildred is remote and cold -- they have nothing in common. (Mildred spends *all* of her time in the 'living room', a room with an interactive television screen covering each of three walls. Mildred sleeps in a separate bed with 'seashell' radio earpieces in her ears.) During one firecall Guy observes a homeowner herself light the firemen's kerosene and then perish in the flames -- Guy cannot understand the woman's protest. And upon reflection Guy cannot understand why books must be burnt. His attitude alienates his fellow firemen, who threaten and then arrest him. Guy escapes and seeks refuge in the countryside.&quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; somewhat resembles Aldous Huxley's &quot;Brave New World&quot; and George Orwell's &quot;1984&quot;. &quot;Brave New World&quot; uses eugenic control and the drug 'soma' to pacify society. &quot;1984&quot; uses ever-present surveillance, propaganda and torture to pacify society. &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; simplifies education and bans books (i.e., eliminates controversial thinking and discussion), substitutes interactive television (e.g., video games and the Internet), and portrays neighbors as informants to be avoided -- everyone is isolated in their home. The &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; societal portrayal seems less sinister, but it is easier to implement and therefore more dangerous.There *are* many similarities between &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; society and today's United States urban society. And &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; is a beautifully-written book suitable to read aloud. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This story is a warning against reliance on media and entertainment and government for information and leisure. The Parlors are symbolic of modern man's addiction to TV and the internet. The vapid importance of American Idol and such are lamented by Montag at the house party. When Montag is being chased by the hound, the network goes live to cover it - very much like today's coverage of police chases. As Neil Peart of Rush said; \\"Hidden camera coverage from the crime scene to the courtroom.\\" These warnings should still be heeded today."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I think his writings are amazing. I know many differ on that opinion but I truly enjoy his works. 451 is my favorite of his writings. I think it is fascinating to see how much the time influenced him. How so many things you see in the movie are now in creation like the wall tv (our flat screen now). This book was required reading in my youth and I feel it should be required today as well. It's a view of a world which could easily occur if we allow our rights to be flushed basically. How we could easily fall into a dystopian world if we become complacent and lack knowledge.

One day he meets an odd girl who asks questions that force Montag to introspect and look beyond the limitations imposed by his job. The girl asks Montag whether he is happy and then disappears.The future wages war on the printed word to resist excessive thought. A long attention span it seems is the true enemy of the state. The euphoric electronic haze that society demands to keep happy ultimately serves the state's purpose. The war on books began not as a state mandate but as a devolution of the soul. The Bible has been banned and Jesus made into a peppermint colored advertising icon. First literary digests, pulp fiction, and then the ubiquitous interactive talking walls peopled with idiotic families opiated a population that wanted... indeed...demanded immediate gratification. The state has no problem exerting control after that.A woman chooses to be immolated with her books. The book pyre lights the dark recesses of Montag's kerosene soaked soul as he recounts the girl's question... are you happy Montag? Montag begins a journey of self discovery as he steals a book.As a fugitive, Montag sees his unfortunate double killed on TV as he seeks refuge with outcasts in the forests surrounding the city he has escaped. The show must go on and the networks demand a good ending no matter what the cost. Montag's wife betrays him after he confronts her and her friends with the question are you happy?The crumbling, oblivious society Montag protects is quickly flinging itself apart with suicide, abortion and mass ignorance about hostile foreign countries struggling with poverty. The introspective girl is run over by murderous joy riders...later Montag narrowly escapes the same fate. Ever passing jets hearken of an incipient war.It is remarkable how time can make a book even more prescient than it once was. As I commute to work in Germany, I see the isolated and lonely crouched over social media and muffled into oblivion by large headphones while rocking gently to the train. When Bradbury wrote this book society was struggling with the implications of a new medium called TV. Newton Minow,FCC commissioner during the sixties, called TV the vast \\"wasteland.\\" How true and yet how understated today. Social media is not only an opiate but it is a source of monitoring making it far more ominous than TV or pulp fiction.It seems that the short attention span Montag enforced with his flamethrower served the same purpose as the \\"newspeak\\"-truncated language- that Orwell's state in \\"1984\\" used to protect itself from accountability. The flamethrower state had it easy at the start, it just let the culture do the trick. The chatting idiotic wall families did the rest as Bradbury tells us in the book...P 53. There was no dictum, no declaration, no censorship, to start with, no! Technology, mass exploitation, and minority pressure carried the trick, thank God."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I admit I have never read this important book. Not even for school. Of course I knew what it was about because it is so iconic. A society where reading books is illegal and punishable. The way these criminal readers are punished? Burn not only their books, but their entire houses. Eeek.The story takes place mostly in the head of the main character Guy Montag. He is a fireman in a dystopian, alternate society. Fireman are responsible for burning things that are dangerous, case in point, books. But Guy has an awakening of conscience after meeting Clarissa, his teenage neighbor, who asks him questions that he is now forced to think about whether he likes it or not and after a woman decides to burn with her books.The story is a great deal of Montag's thoughts as he deals with his new views. They are written as a stream of conscience and there is very little container, although I could see the little house where he and his wife lived and his neighborhood and even the woods where he sought refuge. Some of the details were confusing to me at times, but they didn't take away from the context of the story.Bradbury's style is staccato and reminded me of the militant society in which the story took place. This made for powerful thoughts and ideas. It is emotional and sometimes just downright heartbreaking.The narrator is good, but I felt his voice and language a bit forced at times. I also think that for me, an audio book was the way to go for Fahrenheit 451. I'm not sure I would have been able to get out of it what I did had I been reading it myself.I can't say I enjoyed this book, but I'm glad I gave it a try. I find myself thinking about that alternate world, a world without books because different ideas are dangerous, because different views lead to trouble. Burn out anything that is politically incorrect or the least bit offensive and soon you have a sterile setting. In this world, only being entertained and pursuing pleasures are encouraged. The pursuit of philosophy will just make people unhappy because they will see how unfair life is.I like the character Clarissa, the young girl who had her mind and her eyes open. She is innocent and represents that in the way she asks questions and daydreams and wonders. I thought the wife Millie interesting because although it is apparent that she is unhappy, that she is aware something is wrong with this existence, she shuts it away and pretends everything is fine.I liked afterward by Bradbury who talks of editing and likens it to the reasons given in his book. He quotes \\"There is more than one way to burn a book.\\" He also wrote a play re-visiting the characters of F-451 and said the one who revealed the most is Baty, the Fire Chief. Baty, it turns out, in this play has thousands of books. BUT, he never reads them. The law states you cannot read them, but it doesn't state you cannot have them. He diabolically lets them die because they are never read.This wasn't the easiest book to get through for me, but it is an important one that everybody, especially book lovers, should give a try."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I've known the title for a while and with the recent death of the author decided to finally read the book; very glad I did. \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" explores a society without books - hard for me to imagine so I'm grateful that Bradbury did. On display is a war torn society where massive wall sized televisions take the place of reading and in-depth human engagement. A society populated with a disempowered citizenry, some unwilling to think for themselves, others unable not to. For me, the book is, at its core, a tale of resistance; demonstrated by Montag's instinctive urges to find out more about the history of book burning and the subsequent actions he undertakes to change things. If resistance is at the core, a collective unconsciousness and apathy are the rings that contain it. Throughout the novel Bradbury contends that the state of affairs is not something that was forced upon the people by a Big Brother apparatus; the people simply allowed it happen. They didn't put up much of a fight at all, being too distracted by the pursuit of happiness to realize the erosion of freedom. Collective memory and its importance in sustaining a viable future plays a large role in the novel and reinforces the notion that what we don't remember we're bound to repeat.\\"Fahrenheit 451\\" is a superb read; its classic status solid. I'm not sure if it remains on many high schools' reading lists but this is one that stands the test of time.

I love to read but I find I often hated the books selected by schools for children to read. Considering how dull most of the literature is that children are made to read in high school it tends to make me wonder how I, and others, maintain our love of literature.But Ray Bradbury's world and his writing style kept me hooked and made me a fan over fifteen years ago and I am still a fan of his work now. I am saddened that he is gone now but his writing will love on forever as he was our generation's H. G.

In a day when all houses are fire proof one must take different measures if they wish to get rid of things that the government bans. He and the fire department are in charge of making sure everyone follows the rules. This means no books, and those who have books must be punished. Guy Montag enjoys starting fires to burn the houses with books. He enjoys the heat, the smell of kerosine. He does not question the reason why he must burn the books he just does it, until he meets a 17 year old girl who moves in next door to him and a professor who no longer teaches but hides in fear like everyone else. The girl is different and she makes him think about the world around him and how it got to be the way it is.I really enjoyed listening to this the descriptions were amazing. There is nothing like a good book burning when described with such beauty. This is the first Ray Bradbury book I have heard/read. I have to admit I'm surprised I didn't find him sooner. Guy Montag is an interesting man who starts out just like everyone else in the book he doesn't think for himself. He doesn't love. He doesn't feel anything. The world Bradbury creates is so like our own yet so different. I wonder if we are moving towards a world like the one in Fahrenheit 451 or if books will survive in this area of immediate pleasure. The characters in here were vibrant and full of life until the very end. The mechanical hound with eight legs is such a strange hound we wonder how it can be a hound. The fire engine named after the mythical salamander that breathed fire is such an interesting image. I don't imagine wheels but legs that crawl down the roads to start the next fire and then back to the station.

In a future world, books are banned and firemen actually set fires instead of extinguishing them. The state exercises a form of social control through controlling what sort of information people have access to. It turns out that not all books are banned, only those that we would today consider \\"great works\\" - Plato, Shakespeare, The Bible, Darwin, etc. For me one of the biggest surprises about Fahrenheit 451 was the rationale that was offered for the burning of those books. In a nutshell, they offended politically correct sensibilities and the authorities felt that they would undermine the social cohesion. This expunging of the classics from the culture has an uncanny resonance with the attempts over past few decades to expunge them from the undergraduate liberal arts curriculum. And rationale is also similar: these books are not \\"diverse\\" enough and may offend the sensibilities of an ever-increasing list of \\"minorities.\\" It is hard not to wonder if a milder, softer version of dystopian future that Bradbury was worried about in the early 1950s has not in fact arrived.Bradbury's writing and ideas are somewhere between those of George Orwell and Philip K. Dick. His style is very engaging, and even poetic. His writing is at its best when one of his characters engages in a prolonged monolog. However, the plot development could use some improvement. There is very little in terms of transition from one scene to the next, and most scenes are overly compressed. It is very hard to follow the plot developments at times. Nonetheless, Bradbury is a wonderful stylist and unlike much of science fiction this book is a pleasure to read on a purely literally level as well as for its sweeping ideas.As a last note, I found it incredibly ironic that I read this book on Kindle. Based on this alone I am fairly optimistic that reading and great books will not only survive but in fact thrive well into the 21st century."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"***This review may contain spoilers**Readers (including myself initially) have praised Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 (hereafter F451) as an uncannily prophetic depiction of our current society and its alarming (no pun intended) future. Of course it is; all futuristic novels ultimately are. With only the present as a frame of reference, science fiction writers almost always illustrate a future stunningly similar to what they are living in now, except for a few described technological, social, or legal \\"advances\\" purportedly made to keep society \\"happy\\". Bradbury is no exception. In his future, books are illegal, banned, and burned because they \\"confuse\\" people and make people \\"unhappy\\". However, F451 is not a simplistic treatise on how getting everyone to read again will automatically improve society. Professor Faber says as much to fireman-turned-protestor Guy Montag. In its way, F451 argues that creating a perfect personal utopia is an unrealistic and actually deleterious societal goal. Instead, I believe F451 argues that a continuous evolutionary improvement of society truly matters, and that can only occur with the perpetuation of thoughts and ideas.In Guy Montag's society, people seek blissfull. sedentary, entertainment as life's goal. Thinking, as exemplified through book readiing, threatens that goal. So firemen like Montag actually START fires at bibliophiles' residences to stop those purveyors of literary thought. But not everyone has been lulled into hedonistic trances, like Guy's \\"media zombie\\" wife Mildred. Clarisse McClellan wasn't. Neither was Professor Faber. Both iconoclasts help develop Guy's own latent dissatisfaction with society's anti-intellectualism and keep ideas alive. His opponents are technology itself (symbolized by the Mechanical Hound) and society itself (as embodied - a bit artificially in my opinion, but still effectively, by Captain Beatty, Guy's firehouse chief). Dangerous and seductive as these enemies are, somehow Guy resists their tempting entreaties to forget this snobbish foolishness and preserve the stable status quo, and remain a subversive protestor.Guy escapes the sterile but deadly city and barely escapes annihilation as war presumably wipes out mankind. In the country, he encounters a group of displaced intellectuals and artisans led by Granger. It is Granger that explains that despite the inevitable destruction of a society that refused to develop any further, it is up to individuals to think, discuss, and plan to keep society going and evolving. He alludes to the myth of the phoenix that burns itself up every 500 years but resurrects itself from the ashes a little wiser. Furthermore, Granger explains the difficult, counterintuitive requirement that conveyers of ideas - books and men - are not really important. Books and men can be burnt, but not ideas. Men must become ambulatory books so that they can pass the information on to a new generation. Fireproof ideas must go on.Personally, F451 is an affirmation of the indispensability of liberal arts. Many have often denounced liberal arts as impractical, unproductive, and unrewarding. F451 demonstrates that is certainly not the case, even through the dichotomy of fire. Fire ignorantly left unchecked symbolizes extinction. Fire carefully banked up, fed, and distributed properly (as the mythological Titan Prometheus found) symbolizes knowledge that keeps society alive and growing."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Received as a gift, the 50th anniversary edition has some very interesting extras including an afterword from Bradbury, a coda with additional comments from him, and a Q&A; with Del Rey. Ray Bradbury is definitely one of the sci-fi masters from the 50s, and his interviews 50 years after the book is written demonstrate how much he believes that original works reflect the timeframe and mindset in which it was written - and more importantly that they should not be tweaked or edited to reflect changing values and mores.I was amazed at how prophetic his novel is, for it is clear that for many readers nowadays, a graphic novel is the only form of \\"reading\\" they have time for. He has his own version of bluetooth, interactive videos, how consuming TV has become, the short attention span of the public looking for instant gratification, and the ability of the press to provide their version of the \\"truth\\".I think that reading this book again some 20 years after originally reading it has made this book even more memorable than when I was a teenager! Every sci-fi fan should do themselves a favor and read this classic again!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"As Montag's fire captain tells him, \\"You ask why to a lot of things and you wind up very unhappy indeed.\\" An important difference between this futuristic society created in 1953 and George Orwell's world of 1984 is that Orwell's government was top-down while all the minorities (of every race, color and creed) in Bradbury's dystopia got together to burn everything that offended them. In this case, lack of tolerance for differing voices led to no voices at all--democracy has eaten itself by misunderstanding itself."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 is a marvelous example of cautionary literature, exploring a future that was possible in 1953 and that while not yet realized, has only grown more possible with the passage of time. The advent of incredible technology and the resulting loss of attention span, individualism, and creativity is the most frightening aspect of the book not only because it corresponds to modern life, but because it results in self-censorship out of insecurity and fear. There are many more themes and motifs packed in this novel--some subtle and frightening, others obvious but thought-provoking--all of which are communicated masterfully by Bradbury's prose and characterization.Bradbury packs a great deal of meaning into a relatively short book, and he explores many nuances of humanity from human nature itself to technology to knowledge to conformity. These themes are all interwoven such that they lose none of their potency; they coexist perfectly and build upon one another to form a haunting picture of humanity. Throughout the novel this occurs with the principal character, Guy Montag, serving as the \\"normal\\" human viewpoint, and his interactions showing how human nature conflicts with technology, conformity, and itself. As the novel progresses we see numerous aspects of human nature arise within this character: blind contentment, conformity, curiosity, rage, frustration, self-preservation, a desire to rebel, peace, realization, and introspection to name a few.The most prominent element of the novel, quite predictably, is fire; it is the focal point of the novel and the rope which ties all of the threads of theme and motif together. We are introduced to the story with a conflagration that enthralls Montag, then still a loyal fireman. Bradbury goes to great length to describe the beauty of fire's destructive power, in the literal sense of the bright, unpredictable flames and metaphorically with its ability to change whatever it touches. As we progress through the novel fire takes on a more malevolent character, stifling creativity and thought and destroying anything potentially offensive or differentiating by sending countless tomes filled with fantasy and philosophy to oblivion. Fire then turns upon its previous masters, burning the fire chief Beatty to death, destroying one of the nightmarish mechanical hounds, and blasting a city off the map. As the novel concludes the wandering scholars note that fire will cleanse the filth it created, and open the way for the return of critical thought and individualism.Structurally and stylistically the novel performs as wonderfully as it does thematically. Bradbury divided the novel into only three chapters, but each one is, as a result, more thematically consistent and the titles more representative of their content. \\"The Hearth and the Salamander\\" covers Montag's career, home life, and how his confrontation with Clarisse drastically changed both, \\"The Sieve and the Sand\\" shows how reading without thinking is akin to trying to hold and in a sieve, and \\"Burning Bright\\" likens humanity to a phoenix: we burn bright and quick, but are always reborn from the ashes. Each segment also corresponds to a different stage in Montag's development, with the first being his initial disbelief and curiosity, the second being anger and frustration, and the third being pity and realization. The style is fairly uniform throughout the novel, conveying a sense of futility and hopelessness until the final pages of the book, where it is noted that after the cleansing fire of war humanity has another chance to try and do things right.Fahrenheit 451 is undoubtedly a classic and Ray Bradbury a master of the written word and science fiction. His ingenuity in crafting a dystopian future and his ever present and painfully truthful themes keep the reader enthralled, and the style forces the reader to feel the weight of censorship and ignorance. In short, Fahrenheit 451 is a book that every person should read, not only for its merits as a novel, but for its applicability in our modern age of instant gratification.-Alicia, Dante, Kevin, Lucas, Sara"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is the temperature where paper combusts and is the perfect name for this classic tale where firemen don't put out fires but they set them! Guy Montag is such a fireman. In a world where book are banned to the point of burning all of them and people are fed what to believe through government controlled videos, we find all sorts of parallels to our current lives.Montag, the main focus of the story, meets a neighbor who has him questioning all he believes and yes, he finally steals a book from one of his burning gigs. It is the turning point in his life. (Reminds me of a cop who told me he read Lord of the Rings 'cuz all the hippies he busted had a copy.) Montag then reads some poetry to his wife's friends and she promptly turns him in! His subsequent race for freedom is quite revealing.I read this book more than 40 years ago, when it was not yet a classic. I found the book a little confusing as Bradbury can be at times, but a quick read with some outstanding images that still haunt me today. My terror as a young, voracious reader at the thought of no more books ever was overwhelming. The thought that the government would kill someone innocent just so the public would know it was impossible to run was stunning. But that wall size television? Boy do I want it, only I want it in the form of a computer.I give this book thumbs up for images. While the story may move a little slow in the beginning and may be a bit confusing, the overall book reads quickly. The writing is good and the characters are well done. This may not be a book to give to teenagers, but anyone with more experience in the world will find the book fascinating, not just for the story but for the foretelling of so much from the distant 1950's when it was first written."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"There really is not need to review this book as everyone pretty much knows what its about and there are so many other reviews. The reason I don't love this book is that really its more of an idea book. I mean its a book you read and think you're a bit smarter for reading it. And on many levels that would be enough because most books have nothing to offer. Only thing is, this book isn't so much fun to read. Its more of a book that should have just been a short story."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a book written years ago, but one which still resonates today. Have you ever wondered what life would be like without books? Or with the distribution of power blown out of proportion by the few people who can control the words? This idea is one that Ray Bradbury explores in his science fiction story. Taking place in a future where books are banned, this book is written from the perspective of a fireman whose job is to burn books whenever they are reported, along with any uncooperative book owners. The fireman, Guy Montag is eventually confronted with the insanity of his society when he meets a teenage girl who vividly describes a time when people could read freely, and were unafraid of their own thoughts. When Montag then comes into contact with a professor, planning for a future where books would be allowed once again, Montag realizes and harnesses his desire to live in this future.Beatty, the fire chief, had just finished bombarding Montag with quotes from various books and poems that were unknown to the rest of the firemen. Montag's feelings are unsettled after this incident, \\"Montag's head whirled sickeningly. He felt beaten unmercifully on brow, eyes, nose, lips, chin, on shoulders, on upflailing arms. He wanted to yell, \\"No! Shut up, you're confusing things, stop it!\\" Beatty's graceful fingers thrust out to seize his wrist\\" (107). This quote demonstrates one major theme of the book - the power of words. Beatty, unlike the firemen of lower rank, has had the privilege to read many books containing knowledge -- and therefore power -- because of Beatty's ability to take the words out of context and make them support his own ideas. This theme also illustrates a tactic many leaders use to control and rule their followers - keeping the knowledge for themselves so that the followers are not think too much for themselves and possibly rebel.I connected with this book on several levels, including the plot and the deeper messages contained in the story. Bradbury's choice to use Montag -- the book burner -- as the protagonist helps the reader understand the step-by-step transformation from mindless compliance with authority to independent thought and finally to a proactive decision that his society needed change. At first, I was surprised and even a little disbelieving at the ignorance of the citizens in the town; but as the book progressed I became more captivated by the methods of the selfish and controlling leaders. In this way, Fahrenheit 451 reminds me of Animal Farm by George Orwell. In both books, the leaders have been granted surprising power by their submissive followers, a power that comes mainly from words. Both books also raise questions about how tyrannical leaders control their followers, as well as why and how followers might allow themselves to be controlled by these rulers. On a more simple level, Fahrenheit 451 is also a compelling story with strong characters and plot. In particular, Bradbury affected me with sensitive descriptions of Montag, including the relationship with his wife. This relationship was an effective method of personalizing Montage and giving dimension to his transformation from blind follower to a potential activist. Over the course of the book, we get to see just how much Montag has changed or perhaps we learn how different husband and wife always were.I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoyed Animal Farm by George Orwell or The Book Thief by Markus Zusak because of the authors' similar abilities to blend powerful ideas, and set these themes inside strong plots."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Upon reading this book, it occurred to me just how much it gets quoted. The reasons for all the quoting is because of its continued relevance in spite of its age.The novel depicts a future filled with censorship and the \\"media\\" telling everyone what to worry about- and the worries which have absolutely no consequence. Sound familiar? A little too familiar. I dare say that we seem to be heading towards an age where ignorance is not merely bliss but that knowledge is loudly discouraged. I can only hope I'm wrong.A great dystopian and a much deserved classic."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In the world presented by Mr. Bradbury, books are illegal and all books here are from older times, people now hide and hoard them, and if someone is caught with books, their house is set on fire by firemen - the very same people that once prevented fires instead of starting them. Spare time is spent watching TV instead of reading, and the TVs are huge, taking up an entire wall. Some people try to have a TV room (TVs on all walls) for total immersion, which is what the main character's wife wants even though they cannot afford it all. Rather eye-opening and a appropriate commentary on books vs TV."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is truly, one of the best novels that I have ever read.

In this story the government has become so corrupt that it has banned the ownership of any sort of literature. It is not until the day when protagonist Montag realizes, while talking to a young girl, how unhappy and naive he actually was. Bradbury takes the idea of a Utopia society and turns it completely upside downThis book shows the damaging effects on the censorships of books and stresses the importance of literature. This is a highly recommmended book to those seeking to open their eyes and realize the truth of how society can be. However, the story moves at a slow pace and many undifined things are exposed in the begining. Other than that, this is an exceptioally good book with an even better moral."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 was an interesting book, not because of it's plot, but because of the way it made you think. It's exemplification of the way too much censorship can ruin the world makes you a little more aware of censorship everywhere. The book is about Montag, a fireman who starts fires that destroy books. In this futuristic world, Books are not allowed due to the controversy they create. People who do not follow the strict code of staying home and watching TV are persecuted. One day, after a meeting with a girl, Montag begins to realize the true beauty of books. Not a terribly hard book to read, Fahrenheit 451 had a few difficult vocab words and a few chaotic scenes, but mostly kept the plot simple. I would recommend this book to 6th or 7th graders trying to expand their vocabulary, or anyone else who wants a book that makes them think. I give this book a 7/10, only because I like more complex plots."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury once called himself a writer of &quot;speculative fiction.&quot; He most certainly based that statement on this very book. Bradbury's view of the future from 1953 is proving its merit now that it is beginning to come true. Similar to Aldous Huxley's Brave New World and George Orwell's 1984, Bradbury's novel tells of a world in which the government has entrapped society in a web of propaganda. Bradbury's novel differentiates itself from the other two, however, in that it focuses on this oppressive government's censorship of literature and the &quot;firemen,&quot; who burn these illegal books. Fahrenheit 451 also is far more entertaining to read, as it is in pure Bradbury style, with vivid, colorful writing, and Bradbury's standard metaphors at every turn of the page. A great read for any Bradbury fan, a science fiction reader, or anyone who wants to see society with a whole new perspective. in sum, this book proves that Ray Bradbury has got the future's number. That number is, of course, Fahrenheit 451."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury is an eerily prophetic science fiction novel written in 1953. This book deals with concepts such as censorship which was prominent in the '50's and today as fewer and fewer people read books. The story is based around Guy Montag, a futuristic fire fighter who doesn't put out fires for a living but instead burns books. One day he meets a young girl named Clarisse who changes his view on books and life. From then on Montag is a changed man and attempts to overthrow the fire department and everyone else who is against books. After killing the fire chief he flees the city and meets up with a group of outcasts who are pro-books. They have memorized entire books hoping that one day they will one day again become accepted. This is a great book and I reccommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury in his classical novel Fahrenheit 451 uses symbolism, imagery, and literary devises to create an abhorrent world filled with censorship. In Fahrenheit 451, Ray Bradbury gives a frightening vision of the future where firemen don't put out fires--they start them in order to burn books. Bradbury paints society as holding happiness as there highest goal, where trivial, useless information is good and ideas and knowledge is bad. One of the most reoccurring literary devises in this novel is symbolism. We often see symbolism in the character's names. For example, one of the main characters, Guy Montag can have two translations. Guy signifies Guy Faux a famous man we associate with effigy, and Mischief Day (Nov.4), and Montag is the trademark of the Need American Paper Company, also a brand of furnaces. More symbolism is shown when we meet Faber. Faber is America's leading pencil company and it is going to be the pencil that writes on Montag's paper."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Reading on and on, and flying through the pages of an exceptional novel, sums up my spellbinding experience with Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451. With its wide array of characters I shared their pain, sorrow, and excitement. Its many themes forced me to ponder about our civilization's future. The picture that Bradbury painted of a particular community was magnificent. Most importantly, I encountered a society that seemed alien and threatening, but also familiar enough to be real. It is a story of censorship and consumerism, a novel concerning the future, a tale describing the transformation of a man are words that merely describe the power of this novel.

The whole book, &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot;, is about the banning of books. This issue has gotten worse over the years and if it continues maybe firemen will indeed be paid to burn our books.In &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; Guy Montag, the main character, is a fireman who realizes people should have the right to read books. He realizes that books mean a lot to the people who own them and after years of never thinking twice about burning a house down he watches a woman burn herself with her house because she wanted to die right along with her books. Guy comes up with a plan to get revenge on other firemen in an effort to stop book banning.At some points of the book Ray Bradbury's writing was a bit confusing. He brought up different characters and stories out of the blue and I really had to think to figure out how those events pertained to the main story.&quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; was the second science fiction book I've read by Ray Bradbury. I also read &quot;October County&quot;, a book of short stories. I do have to say that that book was also confusing, but was good because of the author's great description of places and people.&quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; is good if you like to think while you read.

My expectations were smothered, stabbed repeatedly, and left on the floor to die. This is not a good book. Bradbury's writing is incredibly confusing, and some pivotal parts of the story are so removed from the main plot that you can't understand them.Bradbury has a penchant for killing off characters. For example, one character, that changes the life of the main character, is dead 20 pages into the book. If she was burned 'cause she had books, fine, but she got run over by a car. How stupid is that?Pass this one up, and for a real futuristic utopia, try 1984. Just not this."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"While I can appreciate Bradbury's views on television's effects on people, I believe he gave far too much credence to the communistic approach to controlling people by doing away with books. Considering the beautiful complexity of a book like Dandelion Wine, this was disappointingly simplistic and unrealistic. And as to the war and the 'bomb' at the end, he stepped totally out of reality, since by the time this was written, the world would have known that the effects of radiation went far beyond the initial destruction. And he gave no explanation as to why there should have been a war at all.

So when I happened to read the synopsis of it I was quite excited to find this classic.Any story about book burning and censorship gets me quite riled up. I adore reading books and would hate a world where they are not allowed. Even in today's world of 24 hour TV, ereaders and all the other technology, there is nothing quite as relaxing and entertaining to me than reading a book. I started this book with high expectations and a real desire to love it.The concept of the story is great. Given that it was written in 1950 as a short story in Galaxy Science Fiction and then transformed into a book in 1953, the author was very forward thinking and he got a lot of things spot on. The dependence of people on large screen TVs and the rise of reality and interactive TV along with the dumbing down of society that it seems to cause. Luckily, the whole book banning and burning has not happened!It was in the execution of the writing that I felt let down. It was just all a bit too poetical and pretentious for me. If he had stuck to the telling of the story idea it would probably have been one of my all time favourite books but he somehow tried to be too smart - perhaps I am just too dumb - but the style just did not work for me. It was supposed to be allegorical but I was just missing what the underlying meaning was!That being said, I am still going to look out the movie and give it a watch, even just to see Julie Christie in one of her classic roles.I gave the book 3 out of 5 for the concept of the story but I didn't rate the writing style very high."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is in the vein of 1984 and other great books that show amazing foresight.

Unlike today, all houses and buildings are fireproof, making you think firemen would be unnecessary. Firemen however, have a different job. They burn books. If a civilian is found with a book, Guy Montag and the other firemen burn it, and the person is sent to jail. All his life Montag had thought burning books was the right thing to do, something to which the world had become accustomed. Then he met 17-year-old Clarisse. She had what was then considered an unusual family. They would just sit and talk for hours at a time. Montag begins to form a friendship with this girl, and comes to believe she has a lot to teach him. Clarisse walks Montag to work everyday, talking to him about many things; her uncle, about how people don't talk about anything, and about the wonder of books. Then, one day, Clarisse disappears. She isn't there when Montag walks to work, making him surprised and confused. After a few days without Clarisse, Montag asks around, and finds out she was killed in a car crash a few days ago. Not having Clarisse to discuss life with causes Guy to wonder, is burning books right? What ideas do these books hold? This story is continued as a trail of where this thought takes him, and of the tragedies and joys that occur because of it. I believe the writing style of this book fits what Ray Bradbury expects life to be like in the future. It seems to be slow, dry, and boring. Bradbury uses detail to the point where it is meaningless. He gives three examples when one would do, and elongates things until they are uninteresting. At one point in the story Montag is sitting in the firehouse, listening to all of the sounds. Bradbury explains about \`the flutter of cards, motion of hands, of eyelids, the drone of the time voice in the firehouse ceiling, and the tick of playing cards on the greasy tabletop.' It would have been much easier and quicker to use two examples and get on with the story. No part about the book hooked me, and I had a hard time finishing it. Although the plot was good, this book could easily have been fifty pages shorter. The author is also very repetitive; using the same dry language many times over. Words like pretty, and nice can be found repeatedly as the story progresses. Although I'm not in love with this story, I think it's worth reading. This book made me realize how in America we always talk about being having freedom of speech, but never what we can or can't read. I can't imagine a world where one of the things I love the most was outlawed. Overall, I can't really give this book a number of stars. Scoring Fahrenheit 451 on my enjoyment, it gets about two stars, but on making me think, it gets five."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"...and seriously though-provoking.

It seems that he tried to write in such a sophisticated way that the book became boring. The Fahrenheit 451 is slow going, and very hard to understand. We had to read this book as a class and almost everyone found it confusing. Even the ending hardly made any sense. The book is going on like normal, and suddenly it all ends abruptly. Bradbury has failed to make the writing interesting, and it is not easy to tell what's going on. For example, the whole plot is not appealing. There is a society where books are not allowed, and Montag (the man who burns alot of books) ends up liking books. He has to run away from others and hide for a long time. Some details were completely unnecessary, and had nothing to do with the book. As soon as the book starts getting even a little good, Bradbury drifts off to another topic and that slows down the whole flow of the book. When some things were going on in the book, it is like Bradbury didn't want to get off that same topic at all. If something happened, or there was a discussion, Bradbury made it as long as possible. The book failed to entertain me, and I do not reccommend it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book has been raved about as a classic SF story for many years now, so I decided it had to be worth reading.

It seems that many of the classic science fiction novels deal more with man's attitude toward his surroundings rather than the stories of aliens and the future world gone crazy thru technology. This book takes the simple premise of a world where books are illegal and turns it into a Twilight Zone episode. The best part of a novel such as this is that the reader is forced to contemplate a scenario which is actually imaginable and decide how he or she would act and react. An interesting story to say the least....."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 absolutely cathes the reader's attention of the importance of books.

Bradbury takes the idea of a Utopia society and turns it completely upside downThis book shows the damaging effects on the censorships of books and stresses the importance of literature. This is a highly recommmended book to those seeking to open their eyes and realize the truth of how society can be.

No matter when you read it in you are able to imagine the future. The plot was complex and was suspenseful. And the characters in the book were not the same as some of the other characters you may have read about in other books. Montag the main character in the story was a fireman and his job was to make fire and burn books and not put fires out. Most of the people in the book seemed the same and rather dull, but there was one character that was different from all of the rest. Clarisse was a seventeen year old girl who was not as dull and flat as some of the other characters that you would read about. She would always be thinking about things others thought were foolish and strange. And when Montag meets her he begins to change. Books in this story was a danger to their society and mad people \\"unhappy\\" as the government would say. The style of the book was confusing and difficult, and it was also easy at other times. Parts of the vocabulary was difficult but it helped the story. The sentences described a lot and helped to create images of the near future. I would recommend this book to all science fiction lovers and also people who like to use their imaginations. This is because when you read the story it is very scientific and hard. If you don't like to read these types of books I would not recommend reading it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book Fahrenheit 451 is an exiting book filled with suspense, you are always waiting to read what happens next.

It is rather easy to read (7th grade level) and is also easy to follow. The writing style is different because the culture is very different from anywhere today.

The story took place in the future, when firemen start fires and not put them out. The plot involves a fireman named Montag who begins to question the way of society. At some points the plot got very confusing because the book would jump from scene to scene and from concept to concept. Ray Bradbury used many advanced words and metaphors and these contributed to the story getting confusing.

Ray Bradbury truly is a master storyteller. I instantly gelled with this book and could not stop reading until I knew what was to become of Montag (and those poor outlawed books!!). The writing contained the perfect level of description - it painted vivid pictures in my mind, yet never got hung up on the mundane.And the story! Though written over 60 years ago, I found the plot and underlying messages to be very applicable to modern life. It was a sad, yet fitting portrait of our obsession with technology and pointed towards that frightening theme of \\"the future is bleak\\". I'm always a total sucker for these dystopian novels, but this one takes the cake - or at least a hearty-sized slice of it!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 populates most \\"Best Books\\" lists and yet it is still somehow under appreciated. I think some of this stems from critics focusing much of the attention on the censorship of books, which, while certainly an important aspect of the novel, is not necessarily its most compelling point. The most devastating scenes are those where it is clear that this society has lost its soul. In commenting on the war that wages around them, Mrs. Phelps states, \\"It's always some other woman's husband that dies.\\" Montag, the protagonist, is married to a woman who has attempted suicide multiple times, who can't remember where she met her husband, and who doesn't care about...anything.The images that Bradbury can call forth during the book's climatic moments are heart-wrenching. Books die like slaughtered birds. Bombs fall like seeds scattered by the hands of God. Sparks dance like fireflies.Yet, in the middle of all of the carnage and waste, there is hope. Hope that we will not forget the past and the lessons it teaches. Hope that even in an age where the iPods, massive television screens and casual violence that Bradbury predicted 60 years ago exist that we will not lose our humanity.This is a beautifully written book that has never been more relevant."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"First off, I'm not a literature buff, I just like to read.

Will the Mechanical Hound get him? Or not? Whatever...And as the far-fetched ending occurs - a bomb that flattens the city but appears to leave the free-thinking hobos, just a few miles away, untouched, I found myself curiously unmoved.Despite its feeling at times like a book written for a teen audience, Bradbury DOES give us something to think about. Although inspired by the 1950s world of McCarthyism and restriction of books, it has become relevant in a new way to 21st century readers: our society too is in danger of 'dumbing down' with endless entertainment and meaningless chat (witness everyone texting or tuned in to an IPod as they walk along, paying no attention to the world around them); angry young people kill for kicks just like Mildred Montag:'I always like to drive fast when I feel that way...It's fun out in the country. You hit rabbits, sometimes you hit dogs.'Interesting message but not a great book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's last published book is a great thought provoking fantasy. What if we lived in a world where books were considered dangerous contraband and firemen weren't hired to put out but to start fires?

Will our attention span start to deteriorate to the extent that it is normal to only be able to focus for a few short minutes?Guy Montag is one such fireman whose wife subconsciously tries to commit suicide, and who after meeting a young neighbor, Clarisse, starts to think and question the world in which he lives.

In fact, if someone is found with a book in their possession, the fire department will burn their \\"fireproof\\" house down. The story is told from a man named Guy Montag's perspective. Montag works for the fire department, meaning he burns books for a living. In his world, people are expected to deal with their problems by watching television or driving 100 mph while hitting everything that gets in their way or putting \\"shells\\" in their ears to drown out their thoughts; people are not expected to think in his world.However, Montag begins to question the world he lives in after he meets a rather peculiar young girl named Clarisse. She is different than the rest of the people around her: she spends most of her time just sitting on the porch and thinking about the world around her. This book by Bradbury is very well-written and is a quick read. It is especially great if you are someone who enjoys books that make you think, like fitting all the pieces together at the end.Bradbury does an excellent job of predicting the future, being that the book was written in the 1950's. Obviously the future has not gone to extremes like in Bradbury's book, but he does accurately predict that people will put \\"shells\\" in their ears to drown out the world (like iPods), the numerous TV's in every household, and taking sleeping pills every night because life is easier that way. It is a little bit hard to understand what is happening at times, just because Bradbury leaves it up to the readers to interpret what is happening.

He has an amazing ability to paint a scene without unnecessary description and create tension with characters you can truly identify with and live in their skin. He will be missed."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 is a story of conflict. Conflict between the work the main character Guy Montag does and his true beliefs. These beliefs have not been fully realized by him yet.We are introduced to Guy as the model citizen of this future world. He is a public servant, a fireman. Unfortunately, something has changed and now the firemen start fires instead of putting them out. Their mission is to find and burn books and the houses that are hiding them. Guy Montag was very good at his job and for the first many years, he did it without thinking or feeling.Several things happened to Guy that made him actually start thinking about what he was doing. He started wondering why he had to do what he had to do. Why was he burning old ladies and their books? He met his neighbor Clarisse McClellan, a young girl whose family just moved in. Clarisse made Guy think about things that he never realized before. \\"Bet I know something else you don't. There's dew on the grass in the morning.\\" He suddenly couldn't remember if he had known this or not, and it made him quite Irritable\\" (p. 4). It was these little things that people didn't take time to think about anymore.Guy started spending more time thinking about his job and why he was doing it. This was partly because he saw Clarisse almost everyday and she evoked a different type of emotion that he couldn't quite understand. By just pointing out that there are more things in life than work and television, she started to open his eyes. \\"And as many times he came out of the house and Clarisse was there somewhere in the world. Once he saw her shaking a walnut tree, once he saw her sitting on the lawn knitting a blue sweater, three or four times he found a bouquet of late flowers on his porch, or a handful of chestnuts in a little sack, or some autumn leaves neatly pinned to a sheet of white paper and thumbtacked to his door\\" (p. 13).After Clarisse disappeared, his world completely changed. He decided that he didn't want to continue down the same path he was heading down his whole life until this point. When asked what had changed in his life, Guy replied \\"I don't know. We have everything we need to be happy, but we aren't happy. Something's missing. I looked around. The only thing I positively knew was gone was the books I'd burned in ten or twelve years. So I thought books might help\\" (p. 38).In the end, Guy has finally changed everything about himself and joined with a band of likeminded people. He has become what he spent ten years trying to destroy. He was now himself a book. \\"Montag. Granger took Montag's shoulder firmly. Walk carefully. Guard your health. If anything should happen to Harris, you are the Book of Ecclesiastes. See how important you've become in the last minute!\\" (p. 69)."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is one of the most famous works of science fiction, and with \\"Brave New World\\" and \\"1984\\" represents one of the most memorable and haunting dystopias. In a future world, books are banned and firemen actually set fires instead of extinguishing them. The state exercises a form of social control through controlling what sort of information people have access to. It turns out that not all books are banned, only those that we would today consider \\"great works\\" - Plato, Shakespeare, The Bible, Darwin, etc. For me one of the biggest surprises about Fahrenheit 451 was the rationale that was offered for the burning of those books. In a nutshell, they offended politically correct sensibilities and the authorities felt that they would undermine the social cohesion. This expunging of the classics from the culture has an uncanny resonance with the attempts over past few decades to expunge them from the undergraduate liberal arts curriculum. And rationale is also similar: these books are not \\"diverse\\" enough and may offend the sensibilities of an ever-increasing list of \\"minorities.\\" It is hard not to wonder if a milder, softer version of dystopian future that Bradbury was worried about in the early 1950s has not in fact arrived.Bradbury's writing and ideas are somewhere between those of George Orwell and Philip K. Dick. His style is very engaging, and even poetic. His writing is at its best when one of his characters engages in a prolonged monolog. However, the plot development could use some improvement. There is very little in terms of transition from one scene to the next, and most scenes are overly compressed. It is very hard to follow the plot developments at times. Nonetheless, Bradbury is a wonderful stylist and unlike much of science fiction this book is a pleasure to read on a purely literally level as well as for its sweeping ideas.As a last note, I found it incredibly ironic that I read this book on Kindle. Based on this alone I am fairly optimistic that reading and great books will not only survive but in fact thrive well into the 21st century."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I'm no advocate of book burning, but burn this book!

One is poor language usage--lousy descriptive word choices, lousy metaphors and similes that make inappropriate comparisons--and two, not enough attention paid to societal problems that give rise to things like book burning in the first place: the threat of the individual to the group; government control over the sheep-like masses; the modern epidemic of people's lack of interest in anything intellectual; the timeless epidemic of a fear of anything that goes against group mentality or upsets the status quo, and so on. Bradbury touches on some of these issues, but leaves them largely undeveloped."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I found this book to be very dry and boring. I tried to compare this to The Giver, and I just conuldn't.

This story has some characters that are very different from each other. The main character Montag, who is a fireman who burns books instead of stopping fires, is very different from his wife Millie. His wife just watches TV all day and they call the actors their \\"cousins\\". Also their are so many different things that happen that you can't really keep up with them and you can't really understand it because you can;t understand what the characters do. The plot does not really make sense, it is about people who burn books and let me tell you it isn't very fun to read. I think that the the book is creative, but the Author should use something else to go with this story. The vocabulary was pretty good and he used good sentence, but they got confusing and you find yourself doing nothing with this book. The book just goes on and on and then you find yourself wanting to burn it like the fire fighters do. I would say that I recommend this book to probably no one because it isn't fun to read, you fall asleep during it and you can never feel suspended. People who like Sci-Fi stuff might, but it isn't really Sci-Fi ether."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Farenheit 451 was just an ok book.

The thing about it was that I didn't comprehend it much. It was really a book that doesn't suit me that much. I didn't understand it much. At times, I felt stupid reading it because I didn't understand it. If you are a person who likes reading books about fire, this book is for you.I really don't want to have to read it again and I didn't like it. It was way out of my league. I didn't care for the Ray Bradbury. But, I am not saying I hate him. I am sayinh I might tru some of his other books as well as this book that I didn't like. Although this book does not fit my categories or my type of books, I would not recommend it to other people who like serious stuff."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In the book Fahrenheit 451 the main characters name is Guy Montag. Guy is a fireman that burns books and sets houses on fire instead of the normal fireman that puts out the flames. During the course of the book Montag goes through many different phases. The most important phase is where he starts wondering about books. Since all his life he has been taught that books are bad and only to burn them, he is curious what books are about. During the time that he is going through his mysterious phases he meets a girl named Clarisse McClellan, who opens her eyes to the emptiness of his life. Montag met this girl one night when he was taking a walk at about midnight. Montag also meets a very important character named Faber. Faber is an old English professor that likes books and knows a lot about them. Over the story Montag has Faber set him up with a retired publisher, to help publish books. At the time that Montag is trying to publish books the fireman are chasing him, because his wife turned him in.Guy Montag is a fireman who suddenly realizes the emptiness of his life and starts to search for meaning in the books he is supposed to be burning. He quickly forms unusually strong bonds with anyone who seems to have true friendship with him. His biggest regret in life is not having a better relationship with his wife. And because he didn't have a very good relationship with his wife that is why she turned him in to the fireman and got there house burned.The way that Ray Bradbury makes this book seem is incredible. He has a special talent that lets him really involve and capture the reader's attention. while I read this book I felt as if I was a silent observer that stood next to Guy Montag every where he went. I loved this book, and would definitely recommend this book to anybody who loves a great adventure and thrill."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I really did not like this book!

First of all, the story was way too jumpy. It started slow, and then randomly got fast. It had absolutly no suspense to it. I found myself forcing myself to read! I couldn't relate to any of the characters! For instance, some of the characters were too boring. Maybe if I read this book in this book in ten years I would have a different opinion. Another reason why I didn't like this book, is because the characters weren't seen enough. They were all just thrown in at different times. You didn't feel like you got to know them very well and I hate that. I would not recommend this book. I think that Ray Bradbury needs to rethink his book ideas! I do not want to be critical of Ray Bradbury, but really I couldn't stand this book. It had no meaning to me. It also, had a poor plot and setting. For instance, it was plotted in the future yet it was no different than today. I don't plan on reading anymore or Ray Bradbury's books!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"who ever wrote this dumb confusing book is in a mental state of mind!

Having it placed in the future was really cool and it was a different than other books that I have read. Ray Bradbury seemed to have a really creative imagination. I really liked the plot and the setting of the book. It (like I stated before) was different.

I would be interseted in reading more books by him in the future."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I really enjoyed Fahrenheit 451, it was a very entertaining book. I hope many of these concepts never come true though. Occurances such as burning books, no speed limit would cause the world to be very crazy. There was never dull point in this book.

This book explains what it would be like living in this type of surreal world.The idea of having no pedistrians allowed would would also be very strange. All in all, it was a great book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I thought this novel was great. Bradbury's descriptions of the characters of his novel helped the reader to understand what they had to do with this novel. This story is great for anyone who likes fictional storys.

Also speeding in legal but having or reading a book is illegal and the price you pay for having one is that the fireman burn your house down and you just might be injected with a four inch needle by thier mechanical hound.

Bradbury's novel Fahrenheit 451 was based in the future where fireman did not put out fires but started them. Speeding was legal,books were outlawed including no reading except for fireman which could have them up to 24 hours. If you were caught with a book in your house, the fireman and their mechanical hound would burn your house down. The theme of this novel was happieness. This novel was very well wrote.

Yes, we have a long way to go to be in a state where books are outlawed and firemen start fires instead of stopping them. But still, we have a good head start. People come home from work and plop on the couch and watch TV. You have to be an intellectual to read books. It's just not the norm anymore. In this book, TV has taken over people's lives with wall to wall TV screens. The imagination is lost in the hours of meaningless violence and comedy that is blasted through cables to people's homes. Then, through an array of events, the main character, Montag, starts to wonder about things and think for himself. With society frowning upon thinking, he's in a world of trouble. Fahrenheit 451 is a book that makes the reader think &quot;What really is important in my life?&quot;"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"....and not feel outraged at the well-intentioned censors of the world, then you probably didn't understand it.

Can't go for a walk. Can't read.If you had to live in a society where these were the rules how would you perform? Well in Ray Bradbury's clasic novel Fahrenheit 451, these are a few of the rules. This is a society where most people only care about themselfs. The firemen are more like policemen then firemen. They are responsible for up holding the law. If anyone if found to have a book it is the job of the firemen to take care of the situation. With flamethroughers in hand they burn not only the books but the building that houses them. It is said that firemen never have put out a fire. Guy Montag is a fireman. Occurring to Guy Montag: \\"It was a pleasure to burn.\\" Montag loved his job immensely. To him the sent of kerosene was like perfume. Montag always exempted thing for the way they were. He was \\"happy\\". He had all the things he needed to be \\"happy\\". Why should he change. He would go to work, play cards, burn books, and go home. It was a simple life which most people led.

It made me wonder if the future will be like that with the 4-wall television and the mechanical hound! also with the suicide rate as high as it is in the book! At points this story was scary! Also it was definely a cliff hanger! i couldn't put it down, i ended up so far ahead of my class that i had to stop reading so i could relate to what was going on in class!This was one of the better books that i have read in the past! especially being assigned for class i was extremely surprised that i liked it as much as i did! so i encourage that the future english classes of the sophomore year read this novel because it makes you think, learn what the true meaning of life is, and also improves your vocabulary and your reading skills!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I had to read this book for my H.S. freshmen english class and enjoyed it more than I thought I would. Bradbury uses a lot of good symbolism in connection with the theme of the novel. I realized that understanding these symbols and reading more into the novel is a necessity for a full understanding of the text and Bradbury's message. On the first quiz my teacher gave me, I got a 70%, but after reading more deeply into the novel (and taking some marginal notes to study from), I received a 100% on the next quiz. Unfortunately, when you look at our society today with all the ignorance, technological advancements, and anti-intellectual behavior practiced by many, you realize that it may end up a dystopia just like the F-451 society in the near future."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is an amazing novel, from start to finish.

We must forgive them, they are in their teens and were forced to read it for school. Its only natural, in these circunstances, not identify with Montag and his passion for literature.Fahrenheit 451 is not difficult or boring. But it isnt a normal SF book (not that I have anything against the genre). Bradbury's books tend to have more to do with Lewis Carrol than Issac Asimov. To me it is really a tale that deals with the significance of books in life and society. But like the every great book, its real meaning will be different depending on the reader or the moment it was read.Its a book to stir you. The first time I read it, I got interested in philosophy and thought deeply about my own existence.For those who read it and didnt like it... try again next year!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I picked up an old paperback copy of this book at a flea market 8 years ago. I couldn't put it down. It's a quick and enjoyable read. Bradbury doesn't hit you with the message until he's ready. He prepares you for it with the main body of the story, and, in the last few pages he provides a biblical quote, from revelations, regarding what books are really for. The quote describes the tree of life and says &quot;And the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.&quot; Quite a slam dunk ending that you won't get unless you're ready for it. True literature, he is saying, is to serve a higher consciousness and heal our world. And the tree of life is books, and the leaves on the tree are the pages in those books. This book changed the way I saw and understood things. It's amazing how one book can awaken your vision, and, in turn, awaken your understanding."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is one of the greatest books ever written. Bradbury is a master of the written word. He is the &quot;Air Jordan&quot; of the adjective. Fahrenheit 451 is a stab at political correctness. The premise of the novel is that if we try to dispose of &quot;incorrect&quot; thoughts, we may be forced to eradicate ALL thought."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I was amazed at the incredible imagery and poetic use of extremely choice adjectives and adverbs. The main impression I have is how immediate every single sentence felt; each felt totally alive and pulsating with life. To some, this style may seem to err on the side of melodrama, but he can easily be forgiven. I tend to forgive a bit of self-indulgence when dealing with such a fine writer. Those who call it boring and predictable, without knowing how to savor imagery and elaboration, are contributing to the very cause Bradbury is pointing at - a society craving instant gratification and lacking the capacity for self-reflection. It's a fantastic read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"They say that this will be made into another movie by Mel Gibson. It has all ready been made into an indifferent film by Francois Truffaut. In the end, this is one novel that deserves to stay a novel. It will always remain because it tapped into powerful metaphors - firemen STARTING fires instead of putting them out, a society ruled by interactive TV (or is it really?), banned books, and books as human beings. If we ever do reach a state where books have to live in people's heads, this will be one of them."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Farenhiet 451 is an excellent book. It's set in the future where people aren't allowed to read books. Guy Montag was a fireman whose job was to set books on fire. He meets a girl named Clarice who shows him how you should appreciate what you have in life. He also meets Faber, a professor, who tells him about a future where people can read books and think for themselves. Then, Guy Montag finnaly realizes what he has to do. It's a great book but it's not for people who like books where everything turns out happy and they live happily ever after."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book is in its own way very ironic. It tells the story of a world where the written word is banned and firemen burn books. The story talks of censorship when the book itself is censored in many countries including in some parts of America. The story itself comes from the authors own point of view. He claimed that as he was growing up he saw Hitler burn books and thought it was one of the most criminal acts he had ever scene. I wouldn't recomend this book to any who do not like to read, but if you are an intellectual reader then this is the book for you. It brings to life real issues that affect the society today and can open your eyes to things you have never noticed."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 in my mind is a very well-written book by Ray Bradbury.

This man goes out on midnight, runs and watches pages become inflamed in fire.

I read an article that said much of the band Radiohead's artwork was inspired by this book; as well as some of their little scribbles and a Tee- Shirt.Now I have always respected Radiohead as smart dudes, and have found the image of book burnings full of symbolism. Thus, I gave it a read, and low and behold what do I find? A beast of a book.All the other reviews pretty much get it right, but I didnt like how one reviewer slammed the idea of how easily the main character was converted. After all, the people who did so read books did they not? How could he debate with so little knowledge. Also look at people in our world who are converted from other religions. It usually doesnt take much. Some things just FEEL right after you hear it out loud.All in all, I do not consider this science fiction, but more of a political or social commentary.Interesting, Thought provoking, and entertaining; while maintaining a beatiful simplicity that lets the reader think and imagine."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is about a middle aged man named Guy Montag.

It was suspensfull and full of detailed descriptions about everything ranging form the color of the sky to the warmth of the burnig pages of the books. Infact I thought that sometimes there was a little too much description, but that was just me. I really liked the plot. THe idea was really good.

Even today so much of this book rings true it's downright nightmarish to think how long ago it was written.

He meets young Clarisse McClellan, a girl who changes his view of the world and of books. He begins to think and brood.

It seems like it is, but in its true form, the story about something deeper than books.The story is brilliant because it perfectly describes how willing people are to give up knowledge for something that is faster, easier. It also brings up the topic of control through the media. The government and media focus on happy, cheerful things (such as chasing Montag), rather than the war about to begin. This makes an excellent point about how we as a species are too willing to turn a blind eye to our problems, and allow someone else to fix them. This book does a fine job at shining new light on the saying &quot;Ignorance is bliss.&quot;This is a masterpiece of our time, and I suggest getting it from your public library, if you decide not to buy it. Either way, read it. Its got some insight that is very thought provoking~"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Wouldn't life be nice if we didn't have books? As a person who doesn't enjoy reading, this particular book caught my interest. Guy Montag, the main character of the story, is a book burner. In the society he lives in, the knowledge and ideas one gets from books is believed to be bad. As a fireman, Montag has the job of starting the fires rather than stopping them. This book forces you to think about what society would be like without books. Think of all the knowledge, ideas and pleasure they bring.Fahrenheit 451 makes you realize how much books really do contribute to everyday life. I would recommend this book to all who enjoy a good story and especially to those who don't appreciate reading. Maybe life with books isn't so bad after all."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451, by Ray Bradbury, is set in a terrifying world of the future. Books are not allowed. Firemen burn them and the homes of those who own them. The main character, Guy Montag, is one of these firemen. The joy of his life is setting books on fire until his loony 17-year-old neighbor suggests that maybe books are good things. She tells him of a time in the past when people read and were not punished for it. This gives Guy an unstoppable urge to see what's in one of those books. He reads one, and now he can't stop.While this was a great book with a very scary plot, I do have one complaint: Bradbury will often list completely random things for no apparent reason. They make no sense and make me wonder why they were included in the book. Other than that, the writing is wonderful. Bradbury's descriptions create vivid, sometimes spooky images of his characters and places such as the terrifying electronic hound. There's lots of great action and strange developments.Fahrenheit 451 is a wonderful work that I would recommend to just about anyone. It would be a great way to pass an afternoon. It's a very quick read that you could finish within a few hours. The writing, while confusing at times, is still very interesting. You are quickly brought into the story. Once again, this is a great book for all ages and an interesting view of the future from the past.-Fitzgerald FlabbermonkeyP.S. I'm actually over 12"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"At first I was roped into the idea of a book about book burning by fellow classmates that said it was a \\"cool\\" thing to read about. Then, later on I became enamored by this compelling story of the way others can affect the minds of the ignorant.The book begins with a section Bradbury entitles, \\"The Hearth and the Salamander.\\" The hearth being a symbol of the home and where the fire is kept/made in the home, the salamander being a symbol of fire immortality. The animal is believed by ancient cultures to be fire resistant. It can be burned and walk out without a mark made. This makes sense for Bradbury to use considering his whole book is shaped on the idea that the new futuristic firemen are unscarred by flames and find a great pleasure in creating them. So in turn the firemen of the story sport salamander logos on the arm of their uniforms. I loved this sort of symbolizing and the way Bradbury ties these facts into the rest of his story makes it a worthwhile reading. Throughout the rest of the book he takes the main character Guy Montag through a whirlwind of emotion and self exploration. After meeting a young girl by the name of Clarisse McClellan who is a self proclaimed individual Guy begins to view his life as he knows it in a different light. Clarisse is even seeing a psychologist for her \\"tendencies\\" as prescribed by society's fear of her lack of uniformity. She is a strong willed character that can open the eyes of any reader. I fell in love with her for her uniqueness as she reminded me somewhat of myself.The new future is a scary place as described by Bradbury. It makes the present and our issues with race and diversity a walk in the park as compared to society in the future. Close-mindedness sets in and people begin to close down and build walls around the passions of simple life. He shows here a real look into a frightening possibility of the way technology could affect every one of us. The idea of burning-books to me symbolizes the way media latched onto the artist and freethinker in all of us. It takes away from the beauty of really capturing a scene in a book that in some cases someone might never see in real life and it injects the fear that you might be blamed for this \\"instant gratification\\" that the book gives to you.I really loved the book and the way it took Montag on a journey to overpower his dedication to the claws of society and see past it's chains. He overcomes his enslavement to his boss and coworkers and begins to follow the path of the McClellans. With a little extra help from a friend he met beforehand Guy attacks the futuristic views and creates a full on war for freedom. Through fighting, and murders Montag ends his journies with the people he belongs with. He stumbles a bit along the way but ultimately ends with happiness in his heart.Anyone looking for a real eye-opener would enjoy this awesome fiction piece. It'll make you feel really lucky for the freedoms you have today, and look at the book you're holding in your hand in a whole new light. Aspects of family, and how cold family can be will shock you. Pick up Fahrenheit 451 you won\`t be disappointed."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Farenheit 451 is the epidomy of Ray Bradbury books.

Though, in his society, books are banned and the fireman's job is to burn them. He lived a normal life, or so it was called, until a young lady opened his eyes to the past. In a desperate attempt to know more, he finds a professor. He finds then who he truly is and follows his destiny.Ray Bradbury is one of the best sci-fi authors, in my opinion. In this book he created a futuristic society down to its individual laws and customs. His descriptions of the flames are as if they are alive like you and I. In my own mind I could see the flames burning as if they were right in front of me. His descriptions of society are a great way to show how nave humans can be.Though I had some trouble understanding this book, it's plot was very drawn out and not always clear. Overall, I enjoyed this book over &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot;, because at least this one had a single plot line and easily understandable themes. It is a must-read book for those of you who like sci-fi books that can change course in the blink of an eye."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury is an amazing story about a man named Guy Montag, living in a dystopia. In this crazy world, books are not allowed, and instead of having firemen stop fires, they make them. Guy is a fireman who loves to burn books. But one day he meets a young 17 year old who seems insane. But after many long conversations, he realizes the horror of burning someone else's work of art, and his/her ideas. He then sets out on a mission to get the books back to the people. But all the while, Bradbury is able to weave amazing, but confusing, passages into his story. His crazy use of metaphors and his symbolism makes it hard to understand, but after reading it again, it creates images in your mind. This is the kind of book that you discuss with your friends. The complex theme and plot makes it a great read. Although this book may not be suitable for young children, this is a great story for people from 8th grade up. Fahrenheit 451 is an unique book, and is defiantly one of Ray Bradbury's finest works."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 is a meaningful tale ofthe consequences of removing opinion, choice, andconflict from our world. The message is a powerfulone that will provoke and frighten the reader. The&quot;fantasy&quot; world created by Bradbury bears a strikingresemblance to our own. However, I was confused bythe loaded metaphors and symbolism. Some createdvivid pictures, but others did not make any sense. Itwas often difficult to distinguish between themetaphors and actual events happening in the story.I appreciate Bradbury's message, but I feel that I mayhave missed some important comparisons andclarificatons. I hope that you do not."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Farenheit 451 was a very interesting book. The thing that I liked about this book was that it kept you thinking. Ray Bradbury's use of similes and metaphors really related to what he was trying to explain. The fascinating circumstances about Farenheit 451 is very weird and exciting at the same time. The fact that Bradbury has taken the present time, when he wrote the book, and changed the roles of the people and firemen to which he believes the future will be like is so engaging. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I would have most likely never read Fahrenhiet 451 on my own accord. But I am glad that we had to read this book. Ray Bradbury's idea of the future is totally different than people in the 1950s would have likely imagined it to be. Even now the book holds the same sort of problem to us as it did back when it was published. I can see our country heading down the same path as the country in the book did.Bradbury's use of metaphors, similes, and other &quot;smilely face tricks&quot; are very well written. For example, instead of using the word &quot;hose&quot;, Bradbury described the hose as a great black python. I liked this book very much.~*sHoUtZ tO mIsS. o AnD tHe ReSt Of ThE cLaSs Of 2004*~"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Through all of the metaphors, complications, and similies, Fahrenheit 451 is an excellent book to read. Ray Bradbury made this book very interesting especially with his similies and metaphors. In order to get anything out of this book the reader really had to read closely to enderstand what Bradbury was trying to communicate to the reader. Also, the reader had to use their common sence to understand the story, because it is very different from our world today. The scary part of the story, was how it was written fifty years ago, but the reader can see how the society of today is becoming more and more like the book.Amagine a world were reading certain books ment that you were breaking the law, with possible punishment of death. This was the world Guy Montag lives in. He was a fireman that started fires. In the story's day and age this was a common job. Houses that contained books were houses that needed to be burnt down. Montage enjoyed his job because he did what he was told, and never had to think outside of the box. However, his thinking began when he met a girl, named Clarisse, who made him think outside of the box with three words. She asked Montag,&quot;Are you happy?&quot; To learn more about what happens to Montag because of those three words, you will have to read the book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book that I am reading is called Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury and it is about a sheltered community who has banned books from the community to read. The problem is that there s always some one or people with a little bit of curiosity to find out what is out there beyond their whereabouts and what is in the outside world. In this town the fireman are paid to burn books and this keeps everyone the same, happy, and not wanting/wishing to leave their perfect town and go search new surroundings.I think that this was a great book to read. It kept me on the edge and scared for what was going to happen next for the main character. Like when Montag's boss came to his house while he was reading a book and he hid the book but while he was talking to his boss, his wife was cleaning and almost found the book. I got really scared for him but I could help but think it was really strange that the firemen burned books to shelter the people. But what they don't know can't hurt them. Right?I think that Fahrenheit 451 is a book mostly for the teenage mind because littler kids wouldn't understand why the people had to be blinded from the outside world and such. This would be very interesting to read for the more mature age in high school. It would go over a lot better in their minds."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book painted a very dark and bleak future for mankind. Part of the future is firemen that don't fight fires but rather burn books. Why? Because the powers that be determined that what was in books could offend, confuse, depress, and sadden people, etc.Fahrenheit 451 depicts a society where it is best to make books illegal and burn them in order to keep society &quot;politically correct&quot;. Just keep people happy watching television and and doing other mindless activities.I thought the book was well done in depicting the dilemna one firefighter faces and the actions he takes while living and working in such a world.The book probably deserves 3 1/2 stars."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This Book is very cool. I liked it a lot, because of it's seeming reality to real life. The reason this book is so freaky is that it's slowly coming true. I really liked the way it ended, also the way you struggled with Guy Montag(the hero) as he struggled with himself. This book is really cool."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is an unusual book about an alternate future. In this book, firemen have to start fires instead of putting them out. But they don't just randomly burn down peoples houses. They burn down the ones in which people have books; you may by thinking why would they care about books. Well, in this alternate future, books are illegal. I bet that this seems very ironic to you, but yes, it is a book about there being no books. I didn't like this book. I felt that that his writing style was very unusual. The author, Ray Bradbury, didn't have difficult sentences, but he did seem to jump around. He would never be very clear. Within each and every page he would jump around, or lose the readers attention by rambling on in an unorthodox style. If there were a prime age group for this book it would have to be junior high schoolers to high schoolers. That is probably because it is about that difficulty and this alternate future may be the most appealing to this age."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"First off, I have to say that the idea isn't that far fetched. It's hard to imagine that someone in 1953 could depict our life so close to what it is like today. Television seems to run our lives and less people settle themselves in books. I say this because I'm one of them, although I do enjoy a good sci-fi novel (ie. 1984, Dune, Brave New World). That said, I have to conclude that Bradbury did in fact write a flop! It is true what they say about how you can't buy a book by it's cover. I, just as many others, was encouraged to read from the title. The concept is excellent and to a point, realistic. What seems &quot;wrong&quot; with the book however is the lack of depth the other characters have. Clarise, the girl who turned Guy Montag's head in the other direction, who had great potential, dies in the begining of the book. Her death seems meaningless as a result of lack of depth... Mildred, Guy's wife, who turns in her own husband, also lacks depth. The second reason which makes this book a flop is the lack of a conclusion. Not to spoil the ending of these great literary pieces, but the main characters in 1984, Brave New World, and Dune either die, are defeated, or emerge victorious (not in that order). But in F451, Guy ends up roaming the lands with a bunch of Harvard and Yale hobos. The government, Big Brother, or whatever you want to call it, which was so obviously against him, couldn't care less if he existed. And Guy's cause failed to alter anything, other than relocating him to the woods. There seemed to be no major conflict. Sure, people will argue that the chase was a conflict, but it was not solved. Now, if this book was part of a trilogy, then maybe there is some reason to leaving the question unanswered to what was the purpose of Guy's puiny uproar. But the fact is that the book is cut short. It deserved a better ending or even a better beginning. Whatever the case I felt thirsty for more at the end of the book, I had many questions unanswered, like what really happened to Clarisse, was she killed by a racing car or was she hiding from the government too? Does Faber get in touch with those printing guys or is he caught by Big Brother? There needn't be a happy ending, but to deprive the audience of an ending of any type spells out B A D S T Y L E."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is about a fireman named Guy Montag. He lives in a day and age of very high technology. Instead of having televisions they have \`parlors'. Which are rooms where pictures are displayed on the walls and it is very interactive. Guy's job as a fireman is not an ordinary fireman's job. In this future time houses have been made fire proof. Therefore there is no need for firemen who go put out fires. However the government has banned all books from the United States. They figure any book can cause disagreement by someone. Even the smallest minority could find a book that they think is prejudice towards them. Hence, Guy's job as a fireman is to burn any and all books that are found. However, a young girl moves in next door to Guy. She stimulates his interest in books. At first she just tries to get him to slow down in a world that is constantly speeding up. She tells him to stop and smell the flowers. This girl is found dead, but she left an impression on Guy Montag. Guy collects books from the ones they go and burn. He begins to hate is job as a fireman. He finds a man that also likes books and has been planning to destroy what the fireman do. Then, Guy Montage is reported to have books in his house. While on the job the fireman receive a call to go and burn some books. Guy is startled when they pull up in front of his house. The head fireman gives a blow torch to Guy and has him do it himself. Guy burns his entire house down, but by now he has almost gone insane. He ends up killing the head fireman and running. The authorities chase him for hours. Guy is able to escape down the river. He finds a group of people who all have ran away because they love books. Soon after he leaves the city the next world war starts. Guy's city is one of the first to get flattened by bombs. The people in the city had no warning. They were told it would never come so close. Guy Montag and the head fireman, Beatty, where actually very much alike. In the beginning they both went out and burned books with no second thoughts. However, Guy soon begins to think about what he is doing. This is when we find out that Beatty also once read books. Beatty found burning the books as an escape to loving them. When Beatty is about to be killed by Guy, Beatty does no try to move or jump away. He seems to just stay in place like he is ready to die. He has burnt enough books and he is ready for it to end. Death is his new escape. In this novel, Ray Bradbury shows us the importance of books and what could happen if we forget about books and what they teach us about ourselves."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is a bit boring once you start reading it, but it is a good book after you get into it.

But its not. Or maybe if it was written before the genre defining steps made in 1984. But its not. It is simply self delusional in attempting to convey an idea, plot or any form of characterisation.For starters, why did a fireman after 10 years of diligently loving his job suddenly realises the futile nature of his ways after listening to a girl talk rubbish for 2 minutes intervals over a 4 day period? Why is it OK to get high on drugs and drive 90MPH around everywhere, but not read a book about philosophy in case a conceivable minority gets offended!? And why are books banned but every other type of media isn't. The book seems to suggest its their inherently edgy content, so why just ban particular books? Why employ an entire emergency service to do this job? And most importantly, how could any of the technological devices be engineered with the risk of the fire department coming round your house at any given moment to burn it down if you dared read a single book!? This could be all be forgiven if it was written well or follows an interesting story, but it just fails in every sense of the word. I have no idea why this book got so famous, it is plain stupid."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"When looking for a book to read, do not pick this one. I give this book two out of five stars because I did not understand the language, it is irrelevant to the world today, and some parts of the book make no sense.The book Fahrenheit 451 is written by Ray Bradbury in the 1900s. It is about a fireman named Guy Montag, and is based in the future. But instead of putting out fires, like today, the firemen in this book do the opposite: burn books.I read this book about two months ago in English class. I have written an essay about many topics that come up from this book, and have done other things with it.First, this book is full of crazy metaphors and similes. I did not understand most of them. Some have nothing at all to do with any of the material or other parts in the book. It's as if you have to be super smart just to read and understand this book.Second, the author makes references to the book being how life will be in the future, but it is not. We are not obsessed with our TV's and being chased around by huge robot dogs. It makes no sense to say something like this, and then it not be true. I know he wrote this a long time and that is what he thought, but still.Finally, some parts of the book make no sense. Like the part where the main character seems to be talking to himself, but he actually isn't. I did not know this, and neither will most readers. The author should have made this clearer to the reader.Something I did find good in this book, however, is the fact that the author is very creative and is very good at writing action and suspense scenes. For example, when Montag, the main character, tries to cross this one huge street, and there as a car coming straight at him quite fast.I do not recommend you to read this book. You should definitely pick a different more interesting book to read, and one that will possibly make more sense than this one.Written by Kelsey Lamb6th period English"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book was confusing at times...boring at other...down right cruel at other.

At first, I thought, &quot;This is so weird, who would think of a future with no books and firemen starting fires instead of extinguishing them?&quot; But as the book progressed, I started to realize that this could actually be possible in reality in the future. Right now, most of us would go and reach for the remote instead of a book. Yea, don't try to hide it, you know it's true. Anyways, if this habit of ours soon becomes like a big thing, Ray Bradbury's idea of a book-burning future wouldn't be too out there, if ya know what I mean.I reccomend this book to 7th-8th graders and above, since there are many similies, metaphors, symbolism, etc. in this book(as stated before) that younger readers wouldn't understand.

Through all this symbolism, Ray Bradbury truly made this a great book because you had to piece everything together as if it were a puzzle. I liked how the setting took place in the future. Their world was always &quot;on-the-go&quot; and non-stop in a way that they had no time to socialize. They always had a controlled schedule. The government was very strict because they controlled what they were allowed and not allowed to do, and if anyone disobeyed these harsh rules, the consequeces would be severe and possibly fatal.

It was very complicated and confusing, but Ms. O., my teacher, helped explain the book. All of the metaphors and similes symbolized something. All of the symbolism in this book was so amazing once you understood it. Light and dark, symbolizing good and bad, was used often in Fahrenheit 451. I loved this book once I understood all of the symbolism. Fahrenheit 451 was written 50 years ago, but is supposed to take place in the 24th century. It's funny, because some things are reversed. The main character, Guy Montag, is a fireman, but not the kind of fireman you're thinking of, a fireman in the future. They go around lighting peoples' houses on fire if they have books. You're not allowed to read in the future, because the government knows that books create curiosity and cause you to think. The future government doesn't want anyone to believe in anything else except what they want the society to believe. You have a speed minimum, and if you drive slower then the speed minimum, you get a ticket. The whole world just rushes from place to place. The government knows that if people don't rush around, it might give them time to think. No one talks to each other, and it seems as if no one loves each other. Teenagers kill each other for \\"fun.\\" In some ways I see our society turning into this, and I probably wouldn't be very surprised if it was like this in the 24th century. It's just horrible to think that our world might turn into a mindless, hypnotized world. This book makes you think, and it makes you realize how wrong censorship is. It was written in 1953, and that's a little while after World War II, so Ray Bradbury, the author, probably got some of his inspiration to write this book from Hitler. If Hitler ended up winning World War II, I could DEFINATLY see our world turn into Ray Bradbury's \\"future world.\\" Guy Montag's big internal conflict starts when he meets Clarisse, a crazy-17-year-old. She's different from everyone else, because her family talks to each other at night instead of watching TV. She asks Montag if he's happy, and that one question starts everything. He realizes that he isn't happy, and he becomes curious about books. There is no book like Fahrenheit 451.

I hope this book never goes out of print, although I'm sure there's no fear of that in the near future."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I read the book Fahrenheit 451 as a group in my English class. I thought it was a good book to read as a group because one could get lost easily.Fahrenheit 451 had a good sequence that made the reader want to continue. The events that took place were very interesting and in a strange society. The setting was in a way a futuristic city. The houses were fireproof. The cars were traveling at fast speeds. The people were controlled by a law that stated that people are not allowed to read books.There are a few important characters in Fahrenheit 451. Montag is the main character who is a middle aged man, and works as a fireman. Mildred is Montag's wife who afraid to break a law. Clarisse is Montag's neighbor who is very intelligent and has good points. Beatty is the captain of the fire station. Faber is a very smart person who helps Montag on understanding his reading.I picked this book up because the events didn't stop. At the beginning Montag, who is the main character, talks to a girl named Clarisse. Clarisse seems intelligent, and asks Montag if he is happy. In this society they don't read books; instead they burn them. Montag is a fireman, so he burns books. After that he started to question everything in the society. Things like his job, and why they burn books instead of reading them. He sneaks a couple of books and reads them with out anyone knowing. Then he explains it to his wife who then gets scared and calls the firemen to have his books burned. Montag gets in trouble and has to hide fast. His friend Faber, who is really intelligent, helps him out.I liked couple of parts of the book.\\" They would have killed me, thought Montag, swaying, the air still torn and stirring about him in dust, touching his bruised cheek.\\"(128) In this society people drive really fast. The minimum speed limit is around 55 miles per hour. And lots of people are careless. In this case Montag almost gets killed by a group of twelve and sixteen year olds. \\"The Hound leapt up into the air with a rhythm and a sense of timing that was incredibly beautiful. Its needle shot out. It was suspended for a moment in their gaze, as if to give the vast audience time to appreciate everything, the raw look of the victim's face, the empty street, the steel animal a bullet nosing target.\\"(149) This is when the police are trying to catch Montag. Just to make the society feel safe they make it look like they caught Montag but instead it was some random person in an alley.This society that Montag lives in is much different from today. The book seems to be in the future because they have fireproof houses. The one thing that I can connect the book to is the movie V for Vendetta. Both of them take place in a society where it is run so that something is missing from the society. In both the movie and the book there is a person who stands up for a right. My group also talked about the movie Equilibrium being very similar to Fahrenheit 451.I would recommend this book to young adults. The reading level according to me is average. It is also easy to get lost in the book because it switches back and forth on a topic. There are also many metaphors. \\"Come on now, we're going to go build a mirror factory first and put out nothing but mirrors for the next year and take a long look in them,\\"(164) is an example that is used in the text.Overall I liked the book. It was not the best book that I have read. I would recommend this book to people who enjoy reading fiction, adventure, and a little bid of action."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a great book, it was interesting, and is a good for a thoughtful reader. It's a quick read, and I'm busy so it was nice to have an interesting story with some depth. Sometimes I get too busy and it's hard when I'm reading a long book and try to come back to it from a prolonged absence. 451 is around 165 pages, with really no slow tedious parts, which helps keep you on track.The gist of the book is a futuristic society/science fiction. Formerly a banned book, it suggests patterns of human behavior that very well may be the result of the changing patterns of society today. The main character, Guy Montag, is a fireman, however it is his job to burn books, and the houses that they are in. The question of what is in the books he is burning perplexes him, and it pushes him to the extreme. According to the author, Ray Bradbury, this book is just set in the future, no specific time frame, however in this futuristic world, knowledge is considered dangerous.One thing I would like to mention again is the pattern of society and social interaction. There are very little social interactions between people; they don't talk just to talk. There is very little regard for human life, and they speak of death and especially suicide as if it was as common as waking up in the morning. \\"The Family\\" entrances people for hours, and TV is now the size of the entire wall, and is nothing more but shapeless programs of color and video clips no longer than 10 seconds. Wages are much less than in today's world, for Guy Montag, $6,000.00 is his income for an entire year, and he would be considered middle to upper class.Personally, I don't think I would buy this book. Its not something that I would want to read again, however I got a lot out of it, and it gave me a lot to think about. It is a book that everyone should read, however I think borrowing it from the library is a better decision. There are a few confusing parts, and it takes a little time to understand a few things, but overall it all comes together in the end, and really is a good book and gets you thinking."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Undoubtedly you will read reviews that reveal the plot of this book, and then state their approval or disapproval of it. What makes this book truly great is that it takes you on a shocking and (pardon the pun) inflammatory journey and drops you off wondering \\"if this could ever happen\\" where you live. Great fiction does more than entertain briefly. It makes us think. Great fiction gathers us in its webs of intrigue and forces us to see our own world in new ways. This book is timeless. At any point in civilization we can see the effects of the control of information (for better of worse) on us as individuals, and therefore on each of our own very thoughts and actions that we believe to be so highly personal, the 'one thing' that no one can take from us. It is for this reason that this book should be read by everyone at an early age. This book does not proselytize: it shows us the fate of living under censorship and allows us to choose the \\"safety\\" of overt thought-control and \\"decide\\" if that is what we wish for ourselves. It is for this reason that this book should be banned ;-)"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Its no wonder this book was flagged as one of the most controversial books of its time. But don't let that scare you, it is a GREAT read. It makes you think, and Bradbury does a great job, style and themewise.

The firemen are paid to raid homes and burn any books they find there. 451 degrees Fahrenheit is the temperature at which books burn. Guy loves his job--at least, he thinks he loves his job. He has never really thought deeply about it, until he meets his new neighbor, sixteen-year-old Clarisse. She is a very strange girl, and she points things out to Guy and asks him questions that make him reconsider his life. After talking to her, he begins to think about whether he is realy doing a good thing, burning books. He thinks about his wife, who watches television all day and listens to a walkman all night, and occasionally overdoses on sleeping pills. Does Guy love her? Does he even know her?Guy begins to rebel. He starts secretly reading books, which is strictly forbidden. He contacts a man who used to be a professor and he goes to visit this man, hoping the professor will help him to change things somehow, to change the world and to turn his job back to one that fights fires rather than starting them. When his wife turns him in, Guy becomes a fugitive, forced to run away from town where he can hide to avoid prison. Will Guy be able to change the world, or will he be hunted down by those who want a world without books?This book presented an interesting view of an alternate reality, and there were good details about this society of the future. However, this book was driven more by ideas than by people. There wasn't a whole lot of character development or investigation. I would have liked to have known more about what the characters were thinking."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Some of the reviewers have panned this book for the writing style. I thought it was wonderful and honest. The emotional, and some times totally unemotional, conversations are so close to true speech. I think it was probably easier to understand that in the audiobook format. The version that I checked out from the library had an afterword written by Mr. Bradbury, after looking at the story over 30 yrs after he wrote it. In it, he addressed some of the feedback he has received over the years about this book. He also stated, in no uncertain terms, exactly his views on censoring of books and even of opinions.I REALLY enjoyed this book and some of the conversations it has sparked with my husband and friends about the subject matter. I highly recommend it. Especially to those who think there is nothing wrong with the empty entertainment that is pressed upon us today. We need to start thinking and talking again about things that matter. So we , too, can remember...remember...I love it. Read it (or listen to it)."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451, by Ray Bradbury, focuses on Guy Montag. Montag is working fireman, but his job is to do the exact oppisite of taking down fires, instead he makes the fires. All is well, until he meets a professour who tells him about the dreaded future with new and advanced technology. It's up to Montag to dispose the new future, that could be tomorrow, where burning a building gets him into big mess. In my opinion Fahrenheit 451 has a very unique and compelling plot that is dearly recommended to fantasy and science fiction novel fans. Fahrenheit 451 is also recommended to readers who focus on challenging themselfs because of some of the language and transitions the novel makes."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book Fahrenheit 451 takes a look into a futuristic where all books are banned, and simple things, such as being a pedestrian can get you arrested. The book was written around the end of World War II, and was probably influenced by Nazi Germany because of their effort to censor everything. The main character is named Guy Montag, who is a firefighter. He is not a typical firefighter that we would think of though, his job is burn books. His life changes one day after having a conversation with his neighbor, Clarisse McClellan, who asks him if he is happy or not. After this conversation he ends up on a wild journey that then leads him to fight to save the one thing that he used to destroy.This book has stood the test of time and is a true classic. It has been referenced to in many other books, TV shows, and movies since its publication in 1953. Ray Bradbury does an amazing job of writing the novel, with numerous twists and turns. It had me on the edge of my seat while reading the book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury does an amazing job at creating a wonderful tale.

Orwell's \`Nineteen Eighty Four'.It is a picture of a totalitarian State at war, where people have no friends, no families, no houses. They are surrounded only by walls of TV screens. They know only things, not the meaning of things. People are made equal, being snatched from the cradle and pounded into submission. They function with automatic reflexes. They have no time to think, no education and no responsibilities (and consequences). They have to forget the rest of the world. All books have to be burned. All memories of former times have to be destroyed.\`Intellectual' is a swear world. Those who resist (the \`antisocials') are killed.But, there are still dens of resistance of older people who escaped the brainwashing.Their message is \`stop making the goddamn funeral pyres. We must remember, dig the biggest grave of all times and shove war in it and cover it up.'This remarkably memorable book is a must read for all lovers of freedom and peace.N.B. This book contains an important interview with the author."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Great book with a cautionary tale! I don't know how anyone who could understand the books message give this book a bad review..? Anyway, all around Fahrenheit 451 is a great book!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a cautionary tale set in a world where books are banned. Named after the temperature at which paper catches fire and burns, the book tells the story of one extraordinary week in the life of Guy Montag, a \\"fireman\\" whose job it is to burn the houses of those harbouring books. Until one day he begins to think that his job is not as worthwhile as his society would make him think. This single act of questioning leads to a chain of events. By the book's end, the world that Montag once knew will never be the same again.Part fable, part thriller, Fahrenheit 451 is a fascinating and provocative read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 sees the future of the world, and it hates what it sees. People have become apathetic and worthless. No one cares about morality or the search for truth. Everyone is a mindless drone.As mentioned by other reviewers, the story is in many ways prophetic. It's fascinating how the author predicts modern technologies like projection TVs (the TV parlor), iPods (ear thimbles), and even Bluetooth headsets (Faber's \\"green bullet\\").My favorite part of the story is Beatty's lecture in Montag's house, just before he leaves. Through Beatty's character, Bradbury warns of out-of-control government growth and the brainwashing and indoctrination of children. We'd be wise to heed this warning.This book is a fairly easy read because it's short, but it provides plenty of food for thought."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"451F refers to the trigger temperature for paper to burn (though 450C is more popularly thought to be the right temperature - no matter, since \`Celsius 451' just doesn't have the same ring).Set in a postmodern era, a lawless America has turned itself into an anti-intellectual state which persecutes anyone who is caught in possession of books and worse, reading their contents.Into this setting steps a new breed of firemen, who abandon their traditional roles by actually setting fire to these books whenever a \`concerned' member of the public reports on their neighbour. Intellectuals and professors go underground as universities and higher institutes of learning are eradicated. People \`interact' with their newfound virtual families, which are akin to real-time projections of our modern day talkshows (replete with canned applause and laughter) on their walls.Fireman Guy Montag is forced to question his existence and life as he knows it, when confronted with seventeen-year old neighbour Clarisse, who tells him of a past where people were not afraid to think and question.This book is so clearly ahead of its time with chillingly accurate predictions of the numbing (dumbing?) effects of technology, which breeds complacence and unquestioning acceptance of status quo.One especially disturbing scene was the way the manhunt for the fugitive Montag turns into a televised spectator sport, not unlike reality TV programmes in the Noughties.Published in 1953, this dystopian novel still remains relevant and current in the 21st century, though one wonders at the impact of e-books and the future of the books as we know them.Highly recommended - to be read as a companion to Don Delillo's 'White Noise'."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"My daughter has to read this for her 10th grade english class and I decided to check it out myself. It is not as well written or as compelling as 1984 but it is still a very good read. The author makes a number of excellent points.

Scary look into a possible future if the censors get their way. One of several books assigned to high school students which intrigued me. Several selections in the high school cannon are introspective of the human character. The value of this theme is obvious considering the carefree attitude most of the youth have today. The afterword and the Coda point out some interesting things about rewriting books to include everyone. We don't have to be politically correct ALL the time, especially if it is read it in the historical context it was written. Look at Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Imagine you live in a world where no one thought. No one thinks about their job, no one thinks about their rights, no one thinks about their families, and no one thinks about their education. Imagine, there were no worries in the world. Does this appeal to you? Fahrenheit 451 is a novel about a man coming to know the destructive society he is living in. His culture is such that if you own a book, you are burnt along with the book. For people who read are corrupted, their minds have been filled with silly ideas and shouldn't be able to spread them to others. People aren't educated well, and have no opinion. This leads people into a culture where thought is prohibited. He meets a girl who opens up his eyes into &quot;a past where people [were] not afraid&quot;(on the back of the Book). The story outlines the struggle that came with his recognition and and a changed, happier Montag. I loved the book, and think it taught many lessons. Although the world Montag lives in is not alike to ours in that our society prohibits us to think, I would still say that we are on our way to it. This book should be read by our entire populous. It helped me realize the blinding culture that we live in. I rate this book 5 stars. Good writing. Good themes. Good story. Amazing lesson."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is quite simply an amazing book. Ray Bradbury draws a picture of a futuristic society in which books are banned-all books. Then he uses creative, real-like characters to present it to you. Each and every character has his or her own uniqueness. The opening line-\\"It was a pleasure to burn\\" is a perfect way to start off a book about burning books. I especially enjoyed the character Clarisse McClellan. It was she who introduced Montag to a different kind of world; one in which he could look at everything with more then just his eyes. The part of the book in which Clarisse was letting raindrops fall into her mouth was quite amusing. When Clarisse and Montag part, Montag tilted his head backward and let the raindrops fall in his mouth. I really think the character Clarisse was a great addition to the novel. It helps the readers feel the words of the book all the way up to the surprising ending. The overall quality of this book is great. I would recommend this book to almost anyone. I do, however, think if you are not at all into futuristic, fictional books then this is not the one for you. I would give this novel four out of five stars."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's 'Fahreneheit 451' is a classic that almost everyone should read before they get out of high school or college. It is not just for science fiction fans, but for lovers of good storytelling."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"1950: A year in which one of the greatest novels of our time was written. Fahrenheit 451 was originally written as a short story and was titled \\"The Fireman.\\" This was Ray Bradbury's first novel but definitely not the last. Taking place in a society where reading books is outlawed, firemen are paid not to put out fires, but to start them...on books.Guy Montag, the main character of the book and one of the most dedicated firemen, had his routine life turned upside down after meeting a young teenage girl named Clarisse. Meeting Clarisse was the first turning point in the book. Clarissa asked Montag the very personal question of \\"Are you happy?\\" (10). This struck Montag as a huge shock considering he did not know how to answer it. Evaluating this question took up most of Montag's time. After being called to set ablaze to an elderly woman's home, and burning her to death in the process, he knew the answer to Clarisse's question. Living in a society where knowledge is turned down, where his wife is too wrapped up in her \\"soap operas\\", and where people want to kill each other for fun, wasn't how he wanted to live. Unhappiness was the basis of Montag's life. He realized that there must be something in books that fulfill people like Clarisse and the woman who burned herself, he had to find out what was in them.Montag's boss, Captain Beatty, caught on that Montag might be exploring books, or even housing them and tried to discourage Montag. After finding an old friend to help him interpret the books, Mildred his wife, became frightened and eventually turned him in which was the major turning point or climax in the book. After that point, an adventure begins. Bradbury uses his unique literary devices and other writing techniques to truly bring the reader into the story.Many allusions were used and referred to in this novel. The most vivid was the allusion of the Phoenix. A Phoenix is a mythical bird that over time dies and catches on fire, burning to ashes, and then is reborn through the ashes. This bird can be related to the mechanical society in which the characters of the novel live in. The knowledge and the conditions of the world in which they used to live in, eventually died and burned as does the Phoenix. However, the symbolism of the rebirth could perhaps also be foreshadowing the ending of the novel.Bradbury's similes, metaphors, and other literary devices combine to allow the reader to better visualize the imagery and place themselves into the scene. The organization of his words alone, contribute to the understanding of the sentence structure. \\"They had one machine. They had two machines, really. One of them slid down into your stomach like a black cobra down an echoing well looking for all old water and the old time gathered there... It had an Eye.\\" These words are connected with a simile and a metaphor, making a better visualization for what was taking place. Symbols were also widely used throughout Fahrenheit 451.The titles of the first two parts alone, serve as very important symbols in the book. \\"The Hearth and the Salamander\\" symbolizes both the fireplace and the creature who is believed to be unaffected by fire. The hearth, where the fire is housed, symbolizes the heating of a home and the salamander which is the official symbol for the firemen. \\"The Sieve and the Sand\\" is also very symbolic. Depicting that if placed on the sieve, the sand would fall straight through, not accumulating any of it. This is comparable to Montag trying to read the books. The words were going in, but also going straight back out. He did not know how to keep the knowledge he had just gained.Overall, I think this book was a wonderful interpretation of a man who knew things were wrong and who built up enough courage to go after what he believed in. Possibly a prediction of the future, Bradbury influentially shows the readers of Fahrenheit 451 that knowledge is a very sacred thing and its sacred components, the books, should not be taken for granted."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"A book revolving about the burning and destruction of books seems kind of ironic, right? But that is exactly what the plot of Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 is based on. Taking place in the not so distant future, Fahrenheit 451 revolves around one fireman, Guy Montag, whose job was to start fires instead of stop them. Living in a world where is was a crime to read books, punishable by getting your house burned down, and where the government controls all forms of entertaining media, Montag never questioned what he did for a living. All this changes one day when he meets a strange seventeen-year-old girl on the way home from work one day, and asks him a simple question; \\"Are you happy?\\" This triggers a chain reaction within Montag when he comes to the conclusion that he is, in fact, not happy with his life. Throughout the rest of book, we see how Montag struggles with this and how he quests to do something about it.Bradbury breaks down Fahrenheit 451 into three parts. In the first, the reader is introduced to the protagonist, Guy Montag, and his life and background information up to this point. However, as mentioned earlier, when he meets the young girl, Clarisse McClellan, everything is turned upside down for him, making this the defining moment of this part. She asks him if he is happy which starts to make Montag really sit down and think, a rarity for the people in this particular setting.\\"He felt his smile slide away, melt, fold over and down on itself like a tallow skin, like the stuff of a fantastic candle burning too long and now collapsing and now blown out. Darkness. He was not happy. He recognized this as the true state of affairs. He wore his happiness like a mask and the girl had run off across the lawn with the mask and there was no way of going to knock on her door and ask for it back,\\" (Bradbury 12)Through the author's use of similes, it is easy to see that this is the beginning of the change within Montag after his encounter with Clarisse.From there on, the reader experiences the inner conflict raging within Montag, and then later, outside him. With Bradbury's frequent use of symbolism and metaphors, the reader can get a clear picture of just what is going on in the protagonist's head, yet not so much that the reader would not have to think about it. The way Bradbury writes with these literary devices also helps him depict the imagery of each scene. An example being:\\"With the brass nozzle in his fists, with this great python spitting its venomous kerosene upon the world, the blood pounded in his head, and his hands were the hands of some amazing conductor playing all the symphonies of blazing and burning to bring down the tatters and charcoal ruins if history,\\" (3).Keeping with one of the themes of the book, Bradbury is also constantly comparing things to the aspects of fire, or fire to a blooming flower and he compares books to wings or birds of purity and peace. The unique style in which Bradbury combines these traits helps to distinguish Fahrenheit 451 into the classic novel that it is.Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed Fahrenheit 451. I found the plot intriguing and oddly believable for a futuristic sci-fi piece. It was written in a way easy to understand yet not so simple that it takes away from the novel. The characters were well developed and the protagonist was likable as well as easy to sympathize with. There was little to complain about except maybe the ending seemed a bit too abrupt. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good science fiction story."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I'm a highschool freshmen and I read the book last year when was in 8th grade.

Once you read such an awkward book by the master author of science fiction, Ray Bradbury, youre' bound to be memerized by the proceedings. This slightly short book sometimes made me ill at ease, or uncomfortable, because the book is self-conscious in a way. Bradbury's book is almost a conspiracy theory in many accounts, because it deals with the banning of books in an almost non-existent world.The basic premise is that reading a book in this \\"world\\" is against the law, where the penalties are hugely severe. The heroes, or anti-heroes in my book, are the fireman. Instead of their priorties of saving human lives, the fireman are hired basically to burn books. When a unhappily married fireman named Guy Montag questions the burning of books, his view becomes to deepen more and more. He soons to appearicate books, yet his wife and collegues soon mark him as a lawbreaker. Montag soon becomes a fugitive, and details his found use of books toward other intelligent minds who also are fond of books as well.I love Bradbury's interesting vision of the world his book. His beliefs in the future world are almost uncanny to today. But his future world is frightening and paranoid as well. I read the book twice, and I have become found of the characters and terrific and knowlegeable storyline. Yet, I feel FAHRENHEIT 451 should be taken not so lightly.

The title represents the temperature at which paper burns. The author describes a future society where censorship becomes so severe, that the job of the town's firemen is not to put out fires, but rather to start them by burning books. The government tries to prevent its citizens from learning their own or independent ideas. The main character is Guy Montag. He is one of the firemen. His job is to burn the books. At first he does his job, but later he meets Clarissa, a ghostly image that could represent his conscience, and begins to question his duties. He has an internal conflict because on one hand he wants to do his job, but on the other he doesn't like burning the books any longer. Mr. Montag begins to accept books as a good thing. He starts to store them in his house, but his wife turns him in to the law and they confiscate his library. He escapes and joins an outlaw society that keep the contents of books memorized so that they could be written at a later time when such action is permitted by law.

Fire fighters no longer put fires out in this book but they start fires to destroy books and all other things that may prompt society to have an origional thought or two. They even set fire to all &quot;law breakers&quot; who refuse to give up their precious reading material.This book; though it has a slow story line; is a masterpeice and warning for today's society.

Firefighters in this alternate future created by Ray Bradbury start fires using books to feed the flame that they cherish. The reasons that books were turned to ashes were that people didn't like some books because they were opposing their beliefs and religions. Also books were also most likely burned because some of them gave revolutionary ideas. Fahrenheit 451 is a little hard to read because Ray Bradbury replaces some words with others. The replaced words make it hard to read quickly sort of like reading American writing with Japanese characters names inserted in instead of the American names. This book is best read by people who like reading quickly and can read Japanese fan fics for anime with the Japanese names instead of the American names.

It was a difficult book to read, but there were some good vocabulary terms. It was also very descriptive. On a scale one to ten I would give it a six.

He begins to take books home from many of the places he has destroyed. Clarisse, Guy's next door neighbor, and seemingly the one that set his book-stealing into motion, is one of the most interesting characters. Unfortunately, she disappears without much explanation. I did see some good messages in this vision of the future, but I felt a little bit cheated too, because I wanted to get a better glimpse at this society that spawned this fire fighter-book burners.

My opinion to you is that whatever you do,try not to read this book. I know you won't like it. I know I didn't."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"It was very confusing at some parts. Overall it had a great plot. It is a better reading if you are older."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I was to read Fahrenheit 451 for a book report in class. This book was not all that good but it brought out some specific details that the people on earth should really think about. Things such as reading and thinking for themselves. It also shows how the world would be if people don't stop taking books for granted and start reading and understanding these things because they can really help you out in the world today. This book wasn't really good but it made me think. Some people I know never read a book in their life because they say they are boring or the fact that they don't have time to read. At times, I'm like that. But I know and understand the importance of reading. Eventhough what I am saying isn't anything about the book, I'm just str8ning the facts."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradbury's attempt to pull us into a futuristic world juxtaposed with elements of the early half of this century did amaze me. It was an easy read, but I found that some people have expanded the meanings of this novel through a bizarre form of free-flowing symbolism. They have deemed it a modern American Literature Symbolism Bible, a title that I personally abhor. It's a good book, but not one of such importance that one should completely be absorbed in its meaning weeks after reading. This book's portrayal of Dentim's Dentifrice could be the key to understanding life, but I seriously doubt it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451, by Ray Bradbury, is an interesting tale of a strange and ominous future which is hauntingly convincing. It is the story of a man named Guy Montag, who's job it is to burn books. He loves his job until he meets a girl named Clarisse McClellan. When she disappears Montag begins to further question his job and his world. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The story was quite fascinating and I could often relate to the characters. I also liked Bradbury's descriptions of various objects in the book. However, the most amazing thing about the book was that the strange and twisted world it describes did not seem that far off. This is especially remarkable as the book was written forty six years ago. Bradbury was able to predict many things that would happen, for example the increasing picture quality and use of the Television. I would recommend this book to people who like science-fiction or futuristic books. I would not recommend it to people who prefer more traditional books. I would also not recommend it who will get annoyed by an eccentric writing style or find it hard to understand as even I did a few times."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book really makes you think and most of the things that are in this book about teens and technology is coming true in our world today, kinda scary."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Being one of the first Anti- Utopian stories I've read, it was very formative on how I look at life.

If you're looking for an intriguing and intelligent book, this one is for you."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I am teaching \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" as the example of a dsytopian novel in my Science Fiction class, although it is certainly one of the most atypical of that particular type of narrative discourse. Compared to such heavy weight examples as George Orwell's \\"1984,\\" Aldous Huxley's \\"Brave New World,\\" Yevgeny Zamiatin's \\"We,\\" Ray Bradbury's imaginative meditation on censorship seems like light reading. But the delicious irony of a world in which firemen start fires remains postent and the idea of people memorizing books so they will be preserved for future generations is compelling. Of course, there have been more documented cases of \\"book burning,\\" albeit in less literal forms, since \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" was first published in 1953, so an argument can be made that while all the public debate was over how close we were the Orwellian future envisioned in \\"1984,\\" it is Bradbury's little parable that may well be more realistic (especially in terms of the effects of television).The novel is based on a short story, \\"The Fireman,\\" that Bradbury published in \\"Galaxy Science Fiction\\" in 1951 and then expanded into \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" two years later. However, those who have studied Bradbury's writings caw trace key elements back to a 1948 story \\"Pillar of Fire\\" and the \\"Usher II\\" story from his 1950 work \\"The Martian Chronicles.\\" Beyond that, there is the historical record of the Nazis burning books in 1933. The story is of a future world in which everyone understands that books are for burning, along with the houses in which they were hidden. Guy Montage is a fireman who has been happy in his work for ten years, but suddenly finds himself asking questions when he meets a teenage girl and an old professor.\\"Fahrenheit 451\\" is not only about censorship, but also about the inherent tension in advanced societies between knowledge and ignorance. Reading this novel again I am reminded about Pat Paulsen's editorial on the old \\"Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour\\" (a series well acquainted with the perils of censorship) about how we might enjoy freedom of speech in this country but we do not enjoy freedom of hearing because \\"there is always the danger of something being said.\\" Censorship, in practical terms, is the effort of those who do not want others to hear what they find offensive, for whatever reasons, basically because it leads to people thinking thoughts they do not want them to be thinking. Through the rambling diatribes of Captain Beatty, Bradbury makes this point quite clear to his readers.Even though this is essentially a novella, Bradbury's work retains the charm of a short story. The recurring use of animal imagery throughout the story, the use of the mythic ideas of the salamander and the phoenix, make \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" more poetic than any other dystopian work. Even if it is predominantly a one note argument regarding censorship, it is impossible to deny that Bradbury makes a clear and convincing case for his position. Besides, there is something to be said for any work that insures that beyond the point at which water freezes the only other recognizable number on the Fahrenheit scale is the point at which book paper starts to burn."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I never attended an American highschool so this hasn't been part of my mandatory reading. I heard much about it though and finally decided to pick up a copy in the bookstore the other day. I loved the story and prose. I wish the book had been longer with more details about the world the story takes place in. Bradbury leaves many facets of daily life untouched, that I would have liked to hear about. Alas, this is not a descriptive science fiction novel though, but a rather philosophical approach, that leaves more to imagination than other authors do.One complaint I have with this edition is, that the main character's name (Montag) was misspelled as \\"Montage\\" in at least one occurence. While this is no big deal, it really bothers me, especially when the book isn't brand new but has been read and reviewed millions of times."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"+++++(Note: this review is for the book \\"Fahrenheit 451: The 50th Anniversary Edition\\" published by Del Rey in 2003.)This particular book has five sections:(1) The actual novel by Ray Bradbury that was first published in 1953 (165 pages).(2) An \\"Afterward\\" written by the author in 1982 (7 pages).(3) A \\"Coda\\" (a section that reinforces the novel's conclusion) written by the author in 1979 (5 pages).(4) An interview with the author in 2003 entitled \\"A Conversation with Ray Bradbury\\" (11 pages).(5) \\"About the Author\\" or a brief biography of Ray Bradbury, born 1920 (1 page).This novel is a dystopian science fiction novel. (A \\"dystopia\\" is any society considered to be undesirable; the opposite of a utopia.) It is set in a world where books are banned and burned and, as well, where critical thought is discouraged. The novel's title refers to the ignition temperature of paper. (The ignition temperature is the temperature at which something catches fire and burns on its own.) For paper, this temperature is 451 degrees Fahrenheit (or 233 degrees Celsius).What's eerie about this novel is that, even though it was written more than fifty years ago, it seems to be predicting what is beginning in our society.The novel itself is divided into three parts. (There are no chapters.) These parts are entitled:(1) The Hearth and Salamander(2) The Sieve and the Sand(3) Burning BrightThere are only five major characters in this novel:(1) Guy Montag: is the protagonist of the story. He is a \\"fireman\\" (or more precisely a book burner) who realizes that the world is wasting away because people live only to be entertained. Montag eventually begins collecting books by stealing them instead of burning them.(2) Mildred Montag: Guy's wife whose only purpose in life is watching television. She is very unhappy (but doesn't realize it).(3) Clarisse: the unusual girl who lives next door to Guy. She refuses the entertainment of society and is a free thinker who enjoys the outdoors and family conversations. She informs Montag that there's more to life than burning books and watching television.(4) Captain Beatty: the fire chief for whom Montag works. He is the villain of the novel.(5) Faber: a retired English professor. When Montag needs help understanding what he reads in his stolen books, he turns to this professor.There are a few minor characters in the novel. The most significant are a small group of \\"outlaws.\\" Their crime: being scholars who read books in the past.This novel might be considered a social commentary that predicts what may happen in the future. Some themes that run through it are as follows:(1) the use of fear to control(2) the dangers of indifference(3) the dangers of censorship(4) the importance of free speech(5) the importance of the individual.The afterword is interesting and is where Bradbury talks about his love of books and writers. As well, he revisits some of the main characters in this novel.The coda explains how some publishers have tried to censor some aspects of this novel. This got Bradbury very angry and he states, \\"There is more than one way to burn a book. And the world is full of people running about with lit matches.\\"In the interview with Bradbury, many intriguing things are discussed. I found Bradbury's critique of the 1966 movie based on this novel interesting. I learned that a new movie based on this novel will be coming out soon. I also admire Bradbury even more when he states, \\"Reading is the center of our lives. The library is our brain. Without the library, you have no civilization.\\"Finally, the cover of this book is of special significance. It is the original cover of the 1953 hardcover book showing a person covered in printed paper with books (presumably that he's/she's read) at his/her feet. The person and the books are shown set ablaze.In conclusion, this is a short, fascinating book that really makes you think about the future of society!!(Originally published 1953; this particular book published 2003; 3 parts; main narrative of 165 pages; afterword; coda; interview with author)+++++"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"First off, I would like to tell you why I picked this book. I picked it because I like books that have the future in it. When I first looked at the headings for this book, I was really undecided, but when I went to amazon.com I fould out that this book took place in the future with the firefighter and his troubles. I thought, &quot;Well Hey&quot;. Maybe I would actually be able to raed the book and see things differently and my thought was right. It was a book about a firefighter named Montag, who instead of putting fires out, he sets them. When I first found out I thought to myself, &quot;well thats pointless, why would you set a fire and just let it burn like nothing happened?&quot; But after I read on through the pages I found out that they dont just burn houses for no reason, they burn them because of books. If there are books in the house and they get a call, they will go and start the house on fire. One night Montag was setting a fire and an old lady was sitting there saying something. Montag tried to get the lady out of the house, but she wouldn't go. That made Montag thing, and me also, &quot;why would you want to die in a fire?&quot; Montag grabeed a book, hid it under his arm, and left. After that fire, Montag went home to his wife Mildred. (Theres something weird in the book, the walls are TVs and the TV characters on shows are &quot;the Relatives&quot;). When Montag got home, he hid the book under his pillow and he barely slept that night, and when he woke up in the morning, his wife Mildred was watching TV, or should I say talking to the relatives, and he told mildred he wasnt feeling well, and if the cheif comes and asks for him to tell him that he wasn't feeling well and would go to work. Mildred thought that it was unusual because Montag is never sick. Montag asked mildred to get him some advil and turn down the relatives. Mildred refused because she didnt believe Montag at all. the door monitor went off and it was the cheif, Montag told mildred to tell the chief &quot;I dont know, I dont want to talk about anything&quot; Mildred of course let him in and the chief had a clue that Montag had a book and that's why he didnt feel good. So the chief played it off the way I pictured it, was like this, &quot;I know that the fire last night wasnt' so pleasant, but when people have books and they know it is against the law, but on the other hand if the fireman had the book for more than 24 hours, then we would have to burn his house&quot;. That made Montag kind of scared, after the chief left, he said I must tell you something Mildred, after he went and pulled 8 books from the light fixture in the hall, mildred didn't know what to do and went ballistic. But then she sat down to read a book or two thinking it would help, all of a sudden tthe phone rang and she answered. it was her friend and she told Montag she was going out with her friend and Montag ws shocked. But then Montag remembered, &quot;I remember a guy a long time ago I was sitting in the park, he would carry a bible around, and he told me that if i ever needed help to call me and he handed me a card.&quot; Montag went dashing around the house finding the card. He finally found it and he called him, and his name was Faber.For the rest of the story you must read the book. it is actually kind of interesting if you think about it. Maybe 60 years from now, maybe firefighters will acttually start fires instead of putting them out! As for me, the book was an okay book. I have read better but it was interesting."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Guy Montag is a fireman. His job description differs from the job of firemen of our society. Guy's job is to burn books and the houses of those who conceal them. Guy stumbles upon a woman unlike any other he has met before. Her name is Clarisse. She is very different than anybody else from this society. Guy takes long walks with her and listens to her as much as possible. This is the beginning of Guy's rebel against society.One night, Guy responds to a call about a woman concealing books. They find them and Guy happens to pick one up and hide it in his jacket. The woman is so in love with her books that she burns herself with them. Guy wonders why she had done that and why people have such a passion for books. He seeks these answers and reveals 24 books he had stolen. He sought an old acquaintance named Faber to help him understand them.Faber read him the books he presented and explained the logic behind them while Montag thought up a way to beat the system of the firemen. His plan is working when books are reported at his house and he is forced to burn his house himself. He is so enraged that he burns the fire chief and races off for the country.In this rural area he meets a group of men full of knowledge. They talk for a long time until they decide to move. They are walking when jets fly overhead and drop bombs on the city in view many miles away. The city collapses and Guy is speechless while thinking about all of the lost lives. He also sees this as a new beginning; a chance to show the flaws of an uneducated society."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Guy Montag is a firefighter who burns things. Specifically books, and the houses they are found in. He lives in a state where books, and possesion of them, is illegal. Guy enjoys his job until the day he meets Clarisse McClellan.Clarisse makes Guy doubt his motives and he soon becomes daring enough to break the law and read a book. He finds he loves litereature, he keeps steals books from the houses he's burning and reads them at home. He finally goes as far as to skip work one day, and his Fire Department Captain, Captain Beatty, shows up at his home. He tells Montag that it's normal for a Fireman to go through such doubts at a stage in his life. Then proceeds to go through a long monologue as to the history of banning books. According to him, special interest groups objected to books that criticized, belittled, or undermined their causes. For this reason, books became more and more neutral in order to avoid offending anyone. However, this still wasn't enough. So society agreed to outlaw books.Montag is not convinced and begins to plot with a professor he had previously met named Faber. They plan on planting books in the houses of Firemen as a way of discrediting the profession and destroying the governments unit for censorship. However, thing go when the alarm sounds at the firestation and Montag goes to the last house he'll burn in is career, his house.Unlike its fellow dystopia-themed predecessor, 1984, much of Fahrenheit 451's depiction of modern society came true almost prophetically. Although not outlawed, literature now holds a narrow audience. And the brainwashing televisions Ray Bradbury depicts aren't far off of today's one-eyed-boxes.Ray Bradbury's adjectival descriptions in this book are strong, even at times; on occasion, one could even say they became monotonous. However, the books never crawls forward for to long; the progress, although not quick, still moves fast enough to keep the reader's attention.Overall a strong novel censorship. Although not perfectI would recommend Fahrenheit 451 to any reader interested in either mere science-fiction, or one actually interested in a political criticism of censorship. Both will find their time well spent, the latter will definitely get more out of it, as for the previous. . .Maybe you would enjoy Star Wars??"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is simply the tale of a fireman, Guy Montag, whose job it is to burn books. Life for Guy is a routine--the same lifeless relationship with his wife, the same job day in and out, the same shallow fullfillment of time.There must be something else.The humanity in Guy is writhing and struggling, but Guy knows not what he lacks. Montag is forced to choose between what he knows is right and what he feels.And the consequences make all the difference.In this novel, Ray Bradbury, in this novel of a futuristic world eerily similar to our own, critiques censorship and the education in America. Bradbury holds up a mirror to our ordinary lives, and for just 200 some odd pages, shows us how much better life truly can be.An excellent short read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I love this book!

And I saw the movie, the book follows the movie somewhat, but then again most movies do."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradbury considered this novel his best work -- identifying himself on his tombstone as the author of Fahrenheit 451. It is an intriguing piece of work, though more fable than novel. Bradbury, like Dick, was never one to develop great characters, though his dialogue is a lot better than Dick's. And while Bradbury's plots are never as brilliantly convoluted as those of Dick, the imagination and philosophy behind his plots are his strength.Here Bradbury anticipates by 60 years the plugged-in, hyper consumerism of our present society. Books and ideas are abandoned voluntarily - first the books are condensed, then outlined, then just not read at all. And finally society as a whole mobilizes against the perceived snobbery and divisiveness of intellectuals, resulting in organized bookburning. In the background is a commitment to a permanent state of war with other countries.Like the interrogator of the hero in 1984, the chief book burner who tries to keep Bradbury's book-burning hero on the straight and narrow is one of the most interesting characters in the book. One gets the impression that he's an intellectual who has recovered from his heresy with a vengeance. Also interesting is the character of Clarisse, who first persuades the hero to ask questions about his life. I wish that character had been better developed.This is a very good book, though it has a truncated feel. The novel would have benefitted from expanding the characters and from giving a better feel for day-to-day life in this imagined future dystopia."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I doubt I can add anything new to a book with over 1500 reviews. So, like always, I'll just give my personal insights. In my opinion, what makes a classic a classic is something like this. . .it's pretty obvious that this book, when it was written, takes place in the future. Never do we know exactly when, and never is it actually stated that this book takes place in the future, yet it is. The fact that the fictional plot isn't really far-fetched is spooky, and mabe that's what caused such a stir when this book was causing controversy.Another thing is that a classic can not be defined as just one genre. This book is sci-fi, but it's not hard sci-fi. It's not the sci-fi that Asimov presents, where it takes place in space, across planets and galaxies and so on (by the way, I like Asimov alot, I'm not at all saying this type of sci-fi is bad), but with the little details, such as a Mechanical Hound (who was quite intimidating I might add), and the seashell worn by Mildred. It was more science fiction than I expected it to be, yet it was far from just a science fiction novel. It is also mostly a dystopian novel, yet at times it's also a thriller, even a tad of horror, and not to mention some heavy pyschological tendicies. And all of it works beautifully together.This story also does two things that a classic does: it takes a toll, or has a profound effect, on you, and also gets you thinking. From early on, and I mean the very first pages, the mood is dark and gloomy, and already the reader feels dreary. Montag's unhappiness is so realistic, his world so seemingly hopeless. Instantly the reader pities and sympathizes with Montag. His unhappiness, his refusal to just do as he's told like everyone around him does, is so well written as to be completely relatable and realistic. The scene where he watches his wife being \\"operated on\\" after she overdoses is both intense and horrific.It's pretty amazing that this book was so controversial and so challenged, especially considering the plot. Bradbury fit a whole lot of story into 150 pages here, and whatever he was trying to accomplish, I'd say he was extremely successful. Something Wicked This Way Comes was a good book, a really fun read (one thing I really liked better about fahrenheit 451 is that Bradbury's writing is much more concise) but THIS book is the real deal, and this is what proved to me that Bradbury deserves the praise and accolades he received throughout his lifetime.

Just how old are the people who make the school board decisions about what is considered literature? Are they just too lazy to find something newer...like written in the last half century?

I almost fell asleep during the forword, I dont know how I survived the book. The book drags on and one at a painfully slow pace. As for Ray Bradbury himself, he states in the introduction that in his eyes, Hitler burning and brutally killing people is on the same level as the burning of a book.

It is an excellent read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's novel, Fahrenheit 451, is an eye-opening science fiction novel that is definitely a recommended read for anyone with a passion for reading. Bradbury takes the reader into a dystopian society where many things seem backward. Firemen don't put out fires - they start them. Books are not read, they are burned. The government tells you what to think and what to discuss. Free thinking is discouraged. Maybe the most starling thing about the novel is that free thinking is not craved. A vast majority of the citizens are satisfied with their ignorance. They are comfortable with being nave. This brings the reader to an unsettling but very real conclusion: Are we as a society becoming more and more comfortable with our ignorance?The novel focuses on chronicling the eye-opening experiences of a middle aged firefighter, Guy Montag. Montag appears content with his job, but the reader soon learns that this is not the case. He begins to question everything when he meets a young girl named Clarisse. Clarisse is a very peculiar girl. She tells Montag that she enjoys taking walks and that she rarely watches the Parlor Walls, which would be our equivalent of television. Clarisse asks questions, an uncommon practice in their society. She asks if Montag has ever read a book, and if it's true that firemen used to put out fires (Bradbury 8). Montag is taken aback at the way she freely addresses him. Most surprising all of all, is when Clarisse is about to leave. Before entering her house, she stops and asks, \\"Are you happy?\\" (Bradbury 10). Montag scoffs and pays no attention to her seemingly irrelevant question, but later he begins to think more and more. Am I happy with the life I am living? Am I satisfied with burning books, houses, and sometimes even innocent people?Throughout this masterpiece of a novel, Bradbury frequently uses symbolism. Bradbury uses fire to symbolize cleansing. For the firemen, is it the cleansing of knowledge and what they perceive to be dangerous to the minds of the people. The chief fireman even says, \\"Burn all, burn everything. Fire is bright and fire is clean\\" (Bradbury 60). For Montag, fire is a cleansing of evil within the society. Montag sets fire to the chief fireman and believes that by doing so he is helping to cleanse the evil that clings to their society. Another example of symbolism in Fahrenheit 451 is a giant mechanical hound the resides at the fire station. The hound \\"slept but did not sleep, lived but did not live\\" (Bradbury 24). The firemen played a game with the hound where they would set a few animals lose in its vicinity and place bets on which animal it would kill first. The hound represents the government and fear of the government.Overall, Bradbury's novel is a thought-provoking classic that should not soon be forgotten. This novel will make you question the way you think, the way you interact with technology, and it might even make you want to turn off the computer and pick up a book instead."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"{my thoughts} - This book is interesting. It is futuristic and very engaging for the reader. It is about a guy named {guy montag}. He is a fireman but not the in customary sense of the word. Instead of putting out fires he starts them. The only fires started are the one's at residences houses where the individuals have books any books. They are banned not allowed and therefore those caught with books are subject to losing all their worldly possessions. This book is about his defiance of such laws, his determination and his will to make a stand for things he believes to be wrong. This book is well written and and I thoroughly enjoyed reading it!{reason for reading} - This book is a well known classic. I have been wanting to read for sometime.

I find truly disturbing the sheer number of young people who have sent in reviews describing the book as &quot;boring, unfulfilling, poorly written, confusing&quot;, etc. Of all the &quot;dystopian&quot; books in the lexicon, I find this work to be the most straightforward and unambiguous(sp?). Judging from some of the vitriolic reaction above, it seems Bradbury's predictions are well on their way to coming true. The fact that so many find the book &quot;confusing&quot;, points out the failure of an American education system that emphasizes self-esteem over actual achievement, learning by rote as opposed to the actual accumulation of knowledge, and crowd control over teacher-student interaction. The book is challenging, but hardly the murky horror described by so many above. To close with a Bradbury quote &quot;If my jawbreaker sentences shatter the teeth of the weak minded(small liberty with text), let them eat stale cake dunked in weak tea of their own ungodly manufacture&quot;.

But now after having read it I see the importance of it. It forces the reader to look at the effect that technology has on our lives and what direction this increasing technolgy could lead us. The plot is interesting and mind opening. The story would have had a stronger impact had Bradbury left the main character, Guy Montag, mentally stable at the end of the novel. I felt,as the reader, that his craziness led to a unreliablity in his character and his actions. This unreliablity in his character left the novel with a weak ending, instead of a strong one."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I am 26 years old and, although I have read hundreds of books, I have never read this book before.

Even though this book is written about the far future we are getting there and its only the matter of years. To me books are everything, you learn by reading and sharing your opinions with others and from what I can see not a lot of people can actualy talk about a book. I think that Ray Bradbury wrote a book which is meant to be read by absolutely everyone."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's novel of censorship in a post-war future is a novel of many contrasts. It is about a future with no books or free thoughts and how humanity has been outstripped by our technology. The books plot and teachings are very important now since our technologies and inventions are being created and upgraded at amazing speeds. The book is also very well-written, with great comparisons and a defining language. The ending, however, is unfulfilling, especially after the incredible suspense the book builds up. On the other hand, a person with other tastes might view this book as a waste of time and money. This is not a book for everyone and the plot and writing might seem just as atrocious as it is excellent to almost anybody. Though by no means a must-read, this book is a source of insight on our ever changing world."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I simply love this book.

I had finished the book in the same night. It was just so facinating, iteresting, so well written and it made me really think. I simply loved that book and amazingly you can say that it has something common with the guide, they both question the truth we have learned to keep as the thruths. And forgive me all my typos."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I have not read the book, but I am doing a report on it in my english class. I am sure it would be a good book if I were ever to read it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I really liked the way Montag challenged his own beliefs during the novel. It seemed like the chief firefighter, Beatty could have been in the same position, but he fell victim to society either by choice or because he thought it would benefit society. These people didn't know the difference between a &quot;normal&quot; society and a totalitarian society. So to us, the reader, he looked like the hero, but he looked like an antagonist in the society he was living. If we turn the tables around and put Montag into our present day society, and he challenged our present-day society, he would look like the opponent, or the radical right-winged activist. I know I don't agree with those kinds of people, so I probably would not have agreed with Montag if I were in that society because that is the safe way out. That is a safe way of thinking. I think Bradbury is trying to say that most of us take the safe way out when it comes to activism. I'm sure if I acted as Montag did in opposite in this present day and age, I would be looked down upon too. At the end, Montag and his friends try to make a difference in society no matter how hard the path in front of them would be. Maybe Bradbury is making the point that we should make a difference in our own society by taking an activist standpoint in the media, and standing for our beliefs, no matter how radical they might be. Because without that voice of difference, there would not be an active and working society."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I hadn't read this Bradbury's classic for 15 years. I had 14 years old then and though I liked it, I appreciate it now even more. Should I think I was not mature enough to understand all the ins and outs of the book?When Ray Bradbury published his Fahrenheit 451 several decades ago, he depicted a decaying society, only preoccupied by its facade of happiness. Not that people are entirely free of the usual constraints but everything is done through games, shows, comics for them to forget the notion of thinking, source of all distress and misery. Those who resist are destroyed, dangerous books (those *who* make think) are burnt. And finally, does it work after so much trouble?Well, at first sight, it depends on the basic purpose of the system. If its aim is to make people happy, it's undoubtedly a catastrophic failure. On the other hand, if it plans on making people believe they are happy or at least act as if they were, the answer may appear less immediate but little by little, you realize that for most of the characters, and therefore for probably most of the society, it comes to the same thing.Montag, the fireman who burns the books, is suddenly confronted to the emptiness of his life. Is he happy? No. He will refuse the system and fight, like Granger and the old Faber. Mildred, Montag's wife, has accepted it all. It's so practical for her to live without thinking, with a virtual family on screens around the walls of the parlor. She has friends she can talk with. She has plenty of leisure, goes on parties, but is she happy? Can she be happy when she frequently needs a bunch of pills to get dopey to the point of risking her life? Obviously not. Same for her friends, you'll see it fast.Two characters are really apart in this book.Clarisse, for example, doesn't like or hate that fake prosperity, simply because she doesn't care. She just does what she likes and she's happy. It's probably the only person you'll meet who is. Unfortunately, it will kill her but her short encounter with Montag will have been fundamental.Okay, I admit it, even if he's not from the &quot;good&quot; side, I've a compassion of some sort for the last important character of the story, Captain Beatty, the firemen's chief. He's really disconcerting, an opponent worthy of Montag. You quickly feel his cogency, his volubility. Despite his current lifework, it's easy to suspect he read a lot in the past and reflected over everything. He would once have been a precious ally for Montag but now, it's too late. He abides by the system and resigned himself, sincerely convinced of its ineluctability. So, of course, he must oppose Montag. The way he dies, the way he chooses to die, is terrible and you'll realize then what despair has haunted that man, how strong his disgust of life has been.Oh, while I'm writing this, I've just remembered a scenery. In fact, each time I think about Fahrenheit, this one always comes to my mind. At a certain point of the 2nd part, Montag thrust himself in the parlor occupied by Mildred and her friends who were watching their favorite show on the 3 walls, the White Cartoon Clown. Montag pulls the switch, and after some words exchanged about the coming war, he simply says &quot;Let's talk.&quot; The passage that immediately follows his request is powerful, from the bewildering words of Mrs Phelps about the children she never had to the furor of Montag appealing them to get out of his house, it's a total delight! I guess it's only there that the reader discovers in what terribly absurd world s/he was dived. This passage is a great moment of literature history, I swear you! :)If you make up your mind and wish to buy that magnum opus, I suggest you buy the 40th anniversary edition for Fahrenheit deserves a choice place in your library. The dustcover is beautiful, with the back reproducing the original illustration. Now, let's remove delicately the dust cover. Wow, there's a nice hardcover under it, the main sides are light brown and my fingers can feel the author's name raised slightly in the same color :) and on the black edge, title, author and editor are in gold letters. Hum! Hum! What's more? Ah, yes, a very interesting and recent foreword by Ray Bradbury, very instructive, it explains everything: the genesis of the book, the historical context, the how and the why. The original introduction (written in 1966) is still there, as captivating as the foreword, both of them are worth reading. From all points of view, I'm very proud to own this edition. I hope you'll feel the same pride."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I just purchased the Kindle version of this classic today. I paid $9.99.

I thought, how clever, to own a book on the demise of books on my Kindle. Ironic, that the Kindle version starts off with such a sloppy mistake. Ironic, and sorely disappointing."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Books are dangerous. They're full of ideas that make people think about the world, feel passion, and perhaps act out. That's not good for society; it causes conflict, uprising, and interference with the status quo. People who read and think scare people who don't, so most citizens have happily given up the right to decide what to think about and now let the government fill their brains with constant loud mindless entertainment. This managed input has equalized society; nobody feels inferior to anyone else and there's no conflict anymore. Dull minds, constant entertainment, and conformity make society run smoothly.Guy Montag works as a fireman. He burns books at night while his wife sits in her parlor and listens to inane media shows at high volume. But Clarice, the teenager next door, is different. Her family sits around and talks. They discuss things and they laugh with each other. Guy wonders what they talk about as he watches his wife talk to the strangers on TV and pop sleeping pills...Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 presents a possible frightening future in which intellectual pursuits and nonconformity are deemed dangerous and subversive. It's been more than half a century since Fahrenheit 451 was published and we've seen censorship laws actually become looser over the years and the advent of the internet has brought on the current \\"information age.\\" But that doesn't make Fahrenheit 451 irrelevant because it's about much more than literary censorship. It's about freedom of speech and individual rights. It's about thinking for ourselves and what might happen if we let the government tell us what we can see, hear, or own.Fahrenheit 451 resonates with me on so many levels. First of all, it's just superbly written. I love Bradbury's intense style which translates especially well on Blackstone Audio's version read by Christopher Hurt (sample). Here he describes the show that Mrs Montag watches all day:A great thunderstorm of sound gushed from the walls. Music bombarded him at such an immense volume that his bones were almost shaken from their tendons; he felt his jaw vibrate, his eyes wobble in his head. He was a victim of concussion. When it was all over he felt like a man who had been thrown from a cliff, whirled in a centrifuge and spat out over a waterfall that fell and fell into emptiness and emptiness and never -- quite -- touched -- bottom -- never -- never -- quite -- no not quite -- touched -- bottom ... and you fell so fast you didn't touch the sides either... never... quite... touched... anything.The thunder faded. The music died.\\"There,\\" said Mildred. And it was indeed remarkable. Something had happened. Even though the people in the walls of the room had barely moved, and nothing had really been settled, you had the impression that someone had turned on a washing-machine or sucked you up in a gigantic vacuum. You drowned in music and pure cacophony. He came out of the room sweating and on the point of collapse. Behind him, Mildred sat in her chair and the voices went on again...Second, I share Bradbury's ardent passion for knowledge and learning. The thought of lost information, burned books, mindless entertainment, meaningless small-talk, conformity, and intellectual malaise makes my stomach twist. I don't believe that we're in danger of the anti-intellectualism that Bradbury posits, but still his ideas get me riled up.Third, I'll admit that I'm a rebel at heart. While I recognize that obeying laws and paying taxes are a necessary part of living in a well-functioning society, I feel mostly distrustful and suspicious when the government increases taxes, takes over more functions in society, tells us what to believe, and tries to revoke constitutional freedoms. In this context, Bradbury's possible future doesn't seem so impossible anymore.I'm pleased that my school district assigns Fahrenheit 451 in its middle-school curriculum, though I find it a bit ironic that some publishers have edited the language to make it more \\"suitable\\" for teenagers."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"An important statement against censorship and anti-intellectualism, Fahrenheit 451 presents a prophetic vision of a world where people are pre-occupied by 'popular entertainment' and distracted away from any serious thought and true learning (as represented by books). The disturbing similarity of this fictional world to the one we actually live in today, makes this a thought-provoking must-read.I must say, however, that I am not a big fan of the writing style. Points are driven home without much subtlety. It even sounds a little preachy in places. This style actually takes away from the importance of the message for me, much the same way that an over-eager preacher can sometimes diminish the impact of an important sermon. Even the imagery of book-burning, though very provocative, ultimately makes the world of Fahrenheit 451 seem more un-real and distant from ours than it actually is.The other problem is that the book never gets past the central premise to explore questions like why or how such a world might come to pass in any real detail. This is probably because it was originally written as a short novella. However, in this case, I would have liked to see a sequel!In the end, this is the kind of book that every thinking person should read for themselves, so read it and make up your own mind! :)"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I've been checking out some of the classics that I never gave a chance while in high school, now that I'm a much more aware and mature reader. &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; was something I always wanted to read but never got around to it. Well, I have finally read it and the time was very much well spent. Ray Bradbury offers a bleak and dim future where thinking for yourself is against the law.Guy Montag's life had always been simple. He understood the order of things, and he understood the nature of his job. He was a fireman, and that entailed burning books and burning down the buildings that hid them. He never questioned it once and never felt guilty for what he was doing. Things take a different route when he meets a peculiar girl who asks the tough questions that he has never had to answer. And with those questions, he starts to think and wonder why things are the way they are. Ever since the meeting with this stranger, Montag is curious about the true nature of his job, leading to dangerous revelations that will put his very life in jeopardy.Bradbury has created a magnificent piece of literature that attacks censorship and the numbing of society head on with no regrets and no remorse. He doesn't need to give us an exact year of this future, as that makes it all the more frightening. Even though this is a work of fiction, it seems so realistic and so possible that all of this could really happen to us. Think about it. We are now a &quot;TV Generation&quot; who spend a lot less time reading, people are trying to ban different types of books for different reasons, and anything that is deemed &quot;unpleasant&quot; is demanded to be &quot;fixed&quot; or &quot;taken care of&quot; so we can all feel happy and not deal with the pain and troubles of life. Bradbury captures all of this and does not give you a bitter rant about today's youth, but he uses all of that negative energy and creates something so profound and well established. It's no mistake that this fine novel has sold millions upon millions of copies and is forever deemed a classic.The writing is simple to read and it is a short book. You will have to give it a few pages before you can really get into it all, but make sure that you stick with it. Once it gets moving, there's no stopping the pages. Bradbury is great with imagery and provides excellent descriptions--but never goes overboard with them. It's such a short read that you could most likely finish it in a day or two if you put the effort into it. Turn off that TV for just a few hours or so and pick this up! It definitely sticks in your head once it's all said and done, and you will be thinking about everything that has transpired in this book.&quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; is a tremendous work of fiction that is both thought-provoking and terrifying (in a subtle way). It really goes to show you how terrible things can get if censorship wins, and it really can happen if you think about it. If you haven't given this a read yet, I strongly encourage you to pick up a copy as soon as you can. This is a book that I know I will be re-reading again in the very near future. -Michael Crane"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury has taken an issue so overlooked even today, to have written something about the topic of censorship in the 1950s was quite a daring act. Ray Bradbury did it well enough, and with his ficticious novel Fahrenheit 451 he explores the horrible underbelly of education and society, and forces the reader to re-examine the values of our society.In the novel, the main character (protaganist) Guy Montag, is a fireman, but not what you'd expect, his job is to burn books and the houses that contain them, but then he meets a young woman named Clarisse who teaches him the wonderful truth of books, and a place where imagination and thinking are praised. Montag become obsessive with the idea of obtaining books, knowing that they must be wonderful treasures, so great, that people would give up their lives for them.Soon, like most things in life Clarisse fades away, but so does the thin strand that was Montag's grip on life. He seems to spin out of control, the books that he once destroyed now seemed to be destroying him, becoming his every obsession. Montag finds himself becoming afraid of everyone and everything, and he feels alone, unable to be helped.Fahrenheit 451 is a fabulous book dealing with an issue that still badgers people today even in the 21st century: censorship. This book takes an immediate look at the history of censorship, and sets forth startling revelations as to what will become of mankind if we take away the creative process, the independent, thinking spirit of man and gives a warning that must not be ignored. Fahrenheit 451 is an absolutely essential read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book pictures a world where, in order to keep everybody happy and orderly, books are denied the public and burned when found.

The setting and technology isn't futuristic but that's not the focus. The plot isn't spell-binding, but it is interesting and it keeps your interest. While the book is short, it is full of symbols, representations, and philosophy. A similar book to this is &quot;Brave New World&quot; written by Aldous Huxley. In both novels, books are outlawed.Overall, the book focuses on the mind of man and what can prompt him to do certain things. This book may sound like a boring essay, but it's not.

Farenheit 451 is one of the most revealing books ever written and after 46 years, remains to be relevant. The reason being, it was written as science fiction and is slowly, but surely, becoming science fact. Although, I'm sure that he never meant it to be so, Mr. Bradbury has predicted the future to a degree.The main character, Guy Montag, is a man who is just doing his job. He's a fireman, which is kind of strange, because in the future everything is fireproof... except for books. Books have been outlawed, and it is the job of the fireman to find and burn hidden stashes of books. Why would someone want to burn books? you might be asking yourself.Throughout history man has always burned books that go against his: beliefs, religion, philosophies, government, etc.; because they saw these books as a threat. What better way to control a society, than if you take away their ability to think and reason on their own? Books allow us the opportunity to think and question our reality and what is going on around us. With out that, then we just become a society of mindless drones. Which is what we've become in Montag's future... slaves to our &quot;interactive televisions&quot;. In this book, television has become our extended families, while the real families are left by the wayside because the television families seem more real. Montag questions his actions after watching a woman refuse to leave her books, while they were being burned. He can't understand how someone could care for something so much, that they would be willing to die, instead of live with out it. Read the rest on your own, because you need to, not because you have to. Read this book and then look at the world around us. You'll see what I mean when I say that this book has turned from Science Fiction to Science Fact."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This Book Burns Your Brain!Ray Bradbury fires out another hit with Fahrenheit 451. This science fiction novel captures a society where books are outlawed. Fahrenheit 451 tingles your senses in trying to imagine a world with no written literature. Trying to imagine a society without any books is mind boggling and upsetting. Just think of how books effect our everyday lives. For instance, you wouldn't be reading this right now because I wouldn't be allowed to read this book and write about it. Bradbury paints a realistic image about a fictional society that replaces books with television because reading books or having them in your possession is illegal. The thing that is so realistic about this society that Bradbury creates is that it could very easily be the society that we live in. Our society spends so many hours watching television and watching movies that one day we could question the value of books and what they bring to our lives. The government controls censors of what we watch on television and one day they could prevent us from reading books because they have the power to do so. Guy Montag, the protagonist of the story, is a firefighter who instead of extinguishing fires, sets them. Books are supposed to be his enemy and he sets his enemy on fire with kerosene as his fuel. After Guy meets a girl named Clarisse McClellan, he starts to question the world that he lives in. He starts to wonder if books do have any real value like Clarisse says they do. She tells him how rich they are and how he should read one of them because it is a great experience. After he reads a book, he realizes that he does not want to live in this censored society any longer. The plot of the book then becomes Montag's journey with his internal conflict of censorship. He can not live in this ignorant society and struggles to get himself out of it. Bradbury, in Fahrenheit 451, has a very enjoyable writing style. His plot is fast-moving and his descriptions of characters and scenes are explicit. He beautifully depicts this futuristic society and the people that live in it. Overall, this is a work of art from Bradbury. This book was a fiery blast from start to finish. The suspense of this book never let you out of its inferno. For under six bucks you can hold the fire of the future in your hand."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"After listening to the excellent Book-On-Tape version of this book, I was depressed for a week. So why am I giving it five stars? Because this book and its characters affected me so much, this book literally forced me to reexamine the relationships in my own life.You surely know the basic story, from the Amazon description if from nowhere else. This is a depiction of a sick, but not unfathomable society. Science has advanced to the point where homes are constructed in such a way that they cannot burn, unless the fire is intentional. Firemen still exist, but they are only called out to burn books, and the houses (and sometimes people) that contain and love them.The concept is chilling, but the psychological effects of such a super-paranoid society are what I could not get out of my head. Guy Montag is a fireman, has been for decades. But in the back of his mind is an itch, that little spark of human curiosity that hasn't quite been burned out of him yet. He meets a girl, Clarisse, who isn't like all of the other people left in the world. She laughs, and doesn't conform, and challenges him with thoughts that she could not have gotten from the ubiquitous video walls that occupy most people's lives.Guy's curiosity is stoked, and adventures ... somewhat depressing adventures, ensue ...By the end of this chilling and frightening experience (which includes, by the way, scarily prescient &quot;Reality television&quot; shows a la Stephen King's The Running Man or Fox's Cops), like I said, I was depressed for a week. But I also found myself listening more to people, turning off the television to spend time with my wife, and ultimately inspired to stop being such a go-with-the-flow zombie that our shrink-wrapped culture demands."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"People say this book is no good just because it's too \\"confusing.\\" Well, just because you don't understand it, doesn't mean that the book is bad.

It begins in an unknown city somewhere in America in years and decades directly after the McCarthy era levels of censorship. Media has become the center of American culture, and many people's parlor walls are covered with giant, super-enhanced HDTVs, lowering their level of interaction with each other to almost nothing in respect to both its quantity and its quality. The main character, Guy Montag, is a fireman, but he has never actually put out a fire in his life (at least not intentionally). All houses have been permanently fireproofed with plastic sheaths for nearly 50 years, and the jobs of firemen have been changed from protecting the public from fire to \\"protecting\\" the public with fire. As reality TV, comedy shows and pulp fiction/romance novels became more and more popular, non-fiction and the classics were read less and less until, as Captain Beatty, the fire captain and primary personified villain of the novel, says, \\"(Most people's) sole knowledge of Hamlet was a one-page digest in a book that claimed: 'now at least you can read all the classics; keep up with your neighbors.'\\" As public interest in books, newspapers, and other sources of information waned, the school system and general level of education grew less and less complex/competent, until eventually the government took advantage of the situation and began cutting off all books which \\"offended\\" any minority, no matter how small, proclaiming equal treatment for all and the evils of literature loudly. In order to enforce this ban which the people had so perfectly brought down upon themselves, the government changed the fire department into its secret police, stating that they were protecting the public from the \\"harm\\" of these books while truly cutting them off from the only source of knowledge able to save them from the impending but largely ignored or unconcerning massive international atomic war. As Guy races against time, the odds, and the power of the government and its incredibly seductive mass media, he attempts to break through to someone, trying to find some way to destroy the killer system before it's too late. Can he destroy the system with the help of an old retired English professor named Faber? Or will Captain Beatty and the government's deadly Mechanical Hound catch up with him first? The playing out and ultimate conclusion of this conflict is an incredibly deep and powerful reflection on our American culture today, and on our seemingly insatiable desire for pleasure and entertainment without having to do any more work or self-education/learning in order to get it than we see as being absolutely necessary. Written in McCarthy era America before the dawn of the television, the rise of televised NFL and ESPN, and the surrealistic and ever growing worlds of video games, movies and the Internet, Fahrenheit 451 predicts with eerie accuracy directions in our culture which 50 years ago would have been regarded as impossible science fiction dystopia, but now are considered an ever growing part of normal daily life. As the quality of our public school system continues to decline, and fast cars, pornography, and having fun with friends quickly become more important than keeping on top of government, state, or even local affairs for the vast majority of the American population, one might stop to wonder between one's job and the entertainments we all seem to live for and rush home to every night why we're doing anything like this-what is it we really value in life? In Montag's world, the sources for those values have been taken away, sacrificed to the peoples' ever-growing and insatiable desire for pleasure. Will--or could--our civilization go the same way, walking blindly to the very edge of a worldwide atomic war? Judge for yourself after reading America's fate in the incredible future-predicting novel Fahrenheit 451."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"By Brian WalshThis book is set in the future. A future where the idiot reigns supreme. A future where TVs are full, 4-wall rooms, and the characters on it are called a family. A future where all learning and real thought is illegal. A future where books are illegal, and the fire brigade has been changed into a book-burning brigade. A future where the government strives to make everyone happy. A future that, thankfully, will never exist.The government abolishes anything controversial, to keep the masses happy. This includes religion, the arts, and all forms op open thought. No-one has a vent for the soul, and they become mindless mush-people. All they do in life is get up, go to work, press buttons, come home, go into the TV-room, eat, and fall asleep.To please everyone, books have been abolished, to eradicate controversy. However, the populace still kept books they liked and read them. To enforce the law, the government called book-readers insane andTurned the (obsolete) fire brigade into enforcers of this law.The main character in this book is a fireman called Guy Montag. His wife is a typical person of his time. However, he is starting to talk to a young girl, his next-door neighbour, who obviously reads books. He becomes a little confused, and starts reading books himself. His workmates start getting suspicious, and it's only a matter of time before they find out his hobby. What happens? Read the book yourself!This is a good futuristic fantasy, focusing on the pessimistic side of society, and thinking what would it be like if this were society. Ray Bradbury is a great writer, and this book, despite its faults, is a great read for anyone who is ready to read it. My rating: 4 stars (out of 5)."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"From the temperature at which books burn, Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 illustrates a frightening idea of the future, a future where firemen do not put out fires but start them. Guy Montag, a book-burning fireman, obtains a job to achieve the society's highest objective, happiness. In Montag's world, trivial information (as from television) is good, and knowledge and ideas are bad. Guy was once happy when he burnt books in the fireproof houses, but this happiness becomes questionable when he meets the new 17-year-old neighbor girl, Clarisse, who is thrilled by the ideas from books and the world around her. Before he met Clarisse (who told him about the past when people were not afraid and firemen prevented fires) Guy never questioned anything. While Guy experiences a faith crisis, his wife spends all day in front of the television wall, with her television \\"family.\\" When Clarisse disappears mysteriously, Guy becomes motivated and starts to hide books. Eventually, Mildred, Guy's wife turns him in and he must either flee or become arrested.Fahrenheit 451 is a novel with many alarming resemblances to our current world. This story talks about how books are unnecessary. To keep people happy, society only lets people remember insignificant information, mainly from television. Some people will receive ideas from books, while others may not. Therefore, books imply that people could be discriminated against, and discrimination would defeat the purpose true happiness. This is similar to what our world, where young people are more interested in television than reading.Books give people knowledge and the freedom to perceive differences. This novel taught me a lot about the importance of reading for everyone. At the end of the novel, homeless people realize how important books are and that authors spent their lives, writing their thoughts and expressions, which would eventually be forgotten in the fires. Authors write their stories to have the reader relate to the characters and plot. These wanderers memorized books to convey their knowledge to the next generation. I would recommend this novel to everyone, especially people who do not like to read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradbury makes it look effortless.

Censorship runs rapid as people seek to become more efficient.

Along with helping our society to protect our right of free press it continues to alert many of us to the necessity of books. Sure, with free press we also got some filth floating around, yet you're free to not read those, as you are absolutely free to read this and the many others of invaluable worth. We are humans, we are not perfect and we may have already taken turns we could have avoided. (Like maybe way back when, we should have chosen the steam car option instead of the gas one. Think about it, take the same years of innovation that we invested in the gas car and, well, by now we would have gotten that steamer to go pretty fast too.) But here we are and it's best to continue with our best foot forward. Books like this one, like 1984 and like Utopian Reality are not only entertaining, but also very instrumental in helping us decide the best foot to step out on. It's a comfort to know authors like Bradbury, took that difficult trip to examine the future and then presented it to us, so we can simply make the decision; well this is a road we don't want to take. Without the commotion and concern created from Fahrenheit 451, where do you think we would be right now? Well a good chance is, you wouldn't be reading this at this exact moment cause books that question our societies future would have been banned."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ok. I read Fahrenheit 451, and I have to say that I should have read it earlier. The story encased in this bound grouping of parchment is a warning to the societies of today against censorship and ignorance, which I really enjoyed.The book takes place somewhere in the 21st Century, and revolves around a man named Guy Montag, who is a fireman, but not of the conventional sense. The government of the story's time is one of ignorance and arrogance. It boasts several nuclear wars and a ban against books, which is where the firemen come into play; whereupon books are found, the firemen appear soon afterwards.The entire line of events surrounding Guy and his job is very interesting and thought-provoking, lined with intellectual discussions concerning firemen, the ban, and the emotional detachment to most other people that is sported by the entire population of the country.The conclusion of this book is surprising, and highlights a miniscule but hardy population of intellectuals living outside the public eye, just waiting for the opportunity to bloom in a society wiped clean by their own conceit and cruelty. Plus, it's nice to think that, even in a world full of lies and spite, intelligence and compassion can still survive, even if it's only in a brilliant literary work.At around 179 pages long, Fahrenheit 451 is a fairly easy read, as well as a powerful one. I was able to finish it up on a ferry ride to Victoria, and then still had time to sit around and chew on pocky for the rest of the trip.

People come on here trying to say it should be rewritten because of a couple of dry points, but it's the dead truth. The book isn't supposed to be realistic. It's supposed to be an exaggeration of what might happen if we continue to further censorship. Ray Bradbury wrote this book to warn you of that. And if you're reading this, don't say, &quot;What censorship?&quot; because you know what I'm talking about, banning books from schools, not allowiing certain things to be spoken on television, and now maybe even the internet at the rate of how things are going! Sometimes, you need to say things to get your point across, whether that's a weakness or a strength of yours. For me, it's a weakness, and I'm sorry for that, but I don't need censorship to ruin it.

But, these fireman are differerent than the fireman of today, they burn books and the houses they are found in.Guy's life was virtually the same old routine: stay at the fire house, alarm goes off, drive out to burn the place to the ground, go home and rest, do it again tomorrow. That is until he meets this 17 year old girl, Clarisse, who teaches him of a life outside of the rut. A life besides burning everything that you are called to burn. A time where books are not burned, but cherished. This lesson sends Montag into a spiraling argument inside of himself. The more that he meets with Clarisse, a side of him shows that he didn't even know existed, and Guy begins to grow curious about what books are really like to read.I love this masterful creation by Bradbury. The beginning is very slow and confusing to understand but the ending keeps you waiting for more.

In this upside down dystopia, firemen burn books, women congregate with their fake wall (television) families, youth engage in high speed car chases, killing themselves and others, and products are promoted on 200 ft billboards, and hawked by Jesus Christ. In this world where supposedly everyone has everything one wants, no one is truly happy, no one loves anyone, and unhappy people overdose on drugs. No one slows down to smell the flowers, taste the rain, sit by a fire, talk with friends, or just sit and think. No one cares that that the world seems to have been at war for as long as anyone can remember, with fighter jets streaking above their homes everyday. After all, no one has to sacrifice anything; its always someone else's spouse or child that dies.Guy Montag was a faithful citizen of this world, satisfied with his job of burning books, until he has a chance encounter with his new neighbor, a strange, precocious 16 year old who is wise beyond her years. Clarisse McClellan changes his views of the world dramatically with her strange habits of tasting the rain, gazing at the moon, and asking pointed questions as to why he became a fireman, whether he loves anyone or whether he is happy. An awakened, transformed Montag, after failing to impress and change his shallow and depressed wife and others around him with his new-found wisdom, is discovered, hunted, and is forced to flee the city. He joins a vagabond group of outlaw-professors, who plan to restore the world by imparting the wisdom they have gained by memorizing books.This is the best novel depicting our future world that I have read. Other books, likeBrave New Worldpresent a frightening, realistic future, but have poor plot and characterization. On the other hand, books such as1984andAnimal Farmare thrilling and well told, but really do not reflect our future very well. FAHRENHEIT 451 does both, and does so brilliantly. Apart from depicting a realistic and scary future, Bradbury writes a tight, exciting plot packed with suspense, including fires, chases, murder, suicides, and nuclear war. I could scarcely put the book down, wondering what Montag was going to do next. Although it is but a short story, the characters, including Montag, his shallow but deeply depressed wife Millie, the youthful but insightful Clarisse, the cowardly but wise Faber, and the disillusioned arrogant bully Beatty are engaging and fully realized.If you have the BALLATINE 50th anniversary edition, the extra material (afterword, coda, and interview) is illuminating, but should be read with a grain of salt. One of the most powerful elements of a great book is that it reaches out to the individual reader, who is able to take it in according to his or her own experiences. The message the reader gets from such books ultimately may not be what the writer intended, but still be fully relevant. Reading the author's views and intentions for the novel can upset this great experience.The afterward is quite charming, an account of how Bradbury first typed the novel using a paid typewriter (it charged him a dime for 30 minutes, he spent $9.80.) Bradbury also mentions how his characters still visit him, and gives additional insights/alternatives plots, especially a fascinating and rather sad look at how the Beatty, once a mad lover of books, became an arrogant, obnoxious book-burning fireman.The coda is an amusing diatribe at those who want him to update his works to fit the modern times (include more women, blacks), or, more disturbingly, change his work (without him knowing it!). Such censorship is indeed frightening and should be avoided at all costs. However, one also gets the feeling while reading Bradbury's somewhat smug rant, especially while reading statements such as \\"the real world is the playing ground for each and every group, to make and unmake laws (p.178)\\" that Bradbury has never been a part of a denigrated minority. One doubts that Bradbury has ever experienced the disadvantages that comes with such membership, which includes having to put up with disturbing elements in books from insults (the 'n' word, savage) to works attesting to prove minority inferiority in a myriad of ways ('proving' a lack of intelligence, propensity towards violence, lack of morals) and finally calls for eugenics to destroy them altogether. Certainly Bradbury does not seem to have reflected on the fact the real world might be a very unfair playing field- with some groups having much more power and ability to make and unmake laws than others.The interview at the end was the most disturbing for me; Bradbury comes off as out of touch with both his book and the present world. He flatly denies that the US today with its unending and nebulous 'war on terror' reflects the unending war that his own book talked about, a war in which we sit comfortably while other people make sacrifices and other countries suffer. Even worse, Bradbury very naively states \\"there's no chance for censorship today.\\" (p.184). Tell that to Don Imus, the Palestinians, anti-corporate activists, and those critical of homosexuality, evolution, official versions 9/11 and global warming, and a myriad of other topics.Sadly, fifty years after his book, Bradbury does not seem to grasp the power of his own book; he does not really seem to appreciate how his vision of a mindless dystopia is rapidly becoming our reality."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I thought the book was pretty overrated. Admittedly, the concept was interesting and the story rolls around all right, but the superfluous metaphor-laden rambling passages really irked me. I can only sit through so much.I think I would have liked this book more if I didn't keep picturing Bradbury sitting somewhere with a painfully smug look on his face. But all in all, Fahrenheit 451 is worth reading, though not necessarily all it's cracked up to be."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Reading this book for the first time at the beginning of 2003, I found it remarkable that a novel about the suppression of information in an oppressive police state stands as a powerful critique of the assaults on freedom and personal liberty that the U.S. Government is now engaged in in the name of protecting its citizenry from terrorists.Who exactly are the terrorists? In the view of the shadowy government represented in the novel, they are those who hoard and protect forbidden printed works, and they are those members of an underground information subculture that commits works of literature to memory in the hope that one day, the printed page will be welcome again.In the post-9/11 America of George W. Bush and John Ashcroft, the terrorists can be anyone with a foreign-sounding last name. Even blameless American citizens are suspect. Under a provision of the USA Patriot Act, the government can force public libraries to hand over records about what books anyone has checked out, and they've furthermore made it a crime for the libraries to inform those whose library records have been invoked.Bradbury depicts a nation in which individuality is frowned upon, in which the government is deeply suspicious of its own citizenry, in which suspected \\"criminals\\" can be hunted and murdered by the state without a trial, in which content is spoon-fed to the public. In light of news stories reporting on the Total Information Awareness project in development by the NSA, how much of this can be taken as fiction? How long will it be before the cautionary tales of Bradbury and Orwell and Huxley become a nightmare reality?"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is an excellent novel that I highly suggest to those who like well-written, thoughtful books. The plot and the story in general are extremely interesting- not only due to the actual events, but due to Fahrenheit 451's frightening connection to our lives. The futuristic, dystopian setting where the government has censored all forms of high art and learning, and where humans have 'dumbed down' to an unbelievable degree, gives way to a story where humankind fights with itself to regain a civilized society.Fahrenheit 451 is no doubt a critisism of our society and a scary prediction of may be ahead.

At first blush, there would be a few who might say, &quot;well we don't read that much now...we get most of our information from tv, our entertainment from movies, or our computers.&quot; But it's more than that if you really stop to consider that when you choose to pick up a book of YOUR choosing your are excercising not only a basic intellectual freedom, you are also exerting your privacy, your right to choose how you'll spend your time, and how you'll choose to look at the world.Bradbury considers all of these things and the choices one man decided to make as a consequence. What was so exciting for me was to be able to contemplate these ideas within the context of a story told with beautiful language and images and a story that will grab you until the very end.I know this book is one of those that gets assigned in high school and then never sees the light of day afterward......well, as an ancient 40-year-old, I think that's a shame.

He meets a girl named Clarisse who changes his views completely. He starts to become more interested in books. He hides books in his house. He suddenly realizes what he has been doing. This book is a somewhat difficult read. It may not be enjoyed by children under sixth grade. The sentences are somewhat long and complex. At times, the vocabulary is also difficult. I would rate this book fair. I would only recommend it to people who are heavily interested in science fiction."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The basic premise behind Ray Bradbury's novel 'Fahrenheit 451' is compelling. In the future, fireman don't put out fires, they start them. It is their job to seek out books and put them to the flame, making sure that no one indulges in the 'crime' of reading one. But what makes this nightmare so interesting, and relevant, is that it was not forced upon the people by their government, but was decided upon by the people themselves. Minority groups, religions, and ethnicities, who were offended by the words of writers, simply made reading unpopular and convinced the world that books were, first, a waste of time, and then the root of all evil. A wonderful 'Negative Utopia' novel in the tradition of '1984' and 'Brave New World' Bradbury's novel differs in his writing style. His prose is difficult to follow and at times leaves the reader unimpressed. If you can you're not easily turned off by Bradbury's odd and difficult way of writing perhaps you'll enjoy the deeper message of this work."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Guy Montag is a fireman who's job requires him to efficiently burn books when a call enters the station. In the future, the government, in control of millions of people, decides to make reading books against the law, fearing that a literate society would destroy itself.Guy, through the vision of a young girl and an old English professor, discovers his own wonderment of his surroundings, triggered through great ideas found in books. Discovering this universal wonderment lies at the foundation of the author's main theme, highlighted brilliantly through his distorted and domineering society.With this futuristic society and a distortion of trends found in today's culture, Bradbury captures his reader's attention and makes them open their eyes, hearts, and mind to the true importance of independent intellectual enhancement through reading."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"What a profound Novel!This should be required reading to all students. But alas, the future Bradbury predicted has come to pass.... Today, we are seeing more and more \\"Concerned Parents\\" reacting with a mob mentality in banning books from libraries and schools. Most have never read the books they have chosen to vilify. Strange that only a few outspoken right wing groups think they speak for all of society.The irony of it all is that Fahrenheit 451 has been banned from schools and classrooms because of its \\"negative\\" views toward those individuals that ban books. What is more tragic than a books that decries book banning, being banned itself?Do yourself a favor.... read this book. Pass it along to your child. Read other banned novels and keep them in circulation.The days of the Fireman are quickly approaching.\\"Play the man, Master Ridley; we shall this day light such a candle, by God's grace, as I trust shall never be put out!\\""},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I liked this book and I find it ironic that a book which deals with the issue of censorship, is itself censored and challenged. Complaints against this novel have ranged from its use of language (yes there is swearing) to characters drinking/smoking and ultimately the questioning of government. Heaven forbid that a book actually depicts things that occur in real life.What I enjoyed most about this novel was just how much it resembles life today. True, we are not a society who burns books in an attempt to repress freedom of speech and creativity, but we are a society that spends an exorbitant amount of time in front of the television watching reality programs and other mindless forms of entertainment such as video games. Ask a kitten what s/he has read recently and it's more than likely they will stare back at you with vacant eyes and a lot of hemming and hawing. Pitiful really.I also enjoyed the overall message about censorship. In fact, the part of the book I found the most fascinating was the coda wherein Bradbury gives a quick discussion of his dealings with the subject first hand. In his own words, \\"There is more than one way to burn a book. And the world is full of people running about with lit matches. Every minority...[he goes on here to list various groups]...feels it has the right, the duty to douse the kerosene, light the fuse\\" (Fahrenheit 451 Coda 177). And ultimately that is what it boils down to, the idea that every time someone tries to censor a piece of literature, or a movie, or what have you, they are striking the match against creativity and freedom of expression.Unfortunately I did run into one problem that made it hard for me to really enjoy this novel and that was Bradbury's writing style. It was extremely dry and tended towards rambling. Some of the ideas were brilliantly flushed out, but others, like the war, were simply stated with little detail whatsoever. An old tom cat professor of mine once said that in the art of writing the idea is to show the story not tell it. In this regards, I found it very challenging to picture the events taking place within the novel.Regardless of that, this is one of those books which everyone should read at least once in their nine lives."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In my opinion Ray Bradbury has written some of the best Science Fiction of the age. His use of language is versatile and poetic, his stories are intriguing and intelligent, and this one is no exception.Like all the best science fiction writers, Bradbury is not just talking about the future. His book is a message for today. It is an error to think that Bradbury is talking here about censorship and control in the manner of, say, 1984. In fact Bradbury is more concerned with a hedonistic society with an increasingly short attention span as we are spoon fed what we need to know through sound bites and adverts.Bradbury is making a case for the reading of books to enhance critical thinking, and to allow us to understand the bigger picture. He was worried about how television was eroding the reading of literature - and he was rightly worried.This book is a powerful statement, and a good read. Classic Ray Bradbury."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is a quick read, but nonetheless powerful. Montag's world mirrors our own in many ways. The parlor walls=LCD TV's. The seashell radios=constantly being preoccupied with our iPods/cell phones. Even the dog, man's 'best friend' is replaced by a mechanical hound. In Montag's world, people have become mechanized and conditioned to become mindless, selfish consumers of entertainment to the point of losing their humanity. Montag's got an itch to scratch, and it's interesting to note that he had already begun his journey out of the cave well before he met Clarisse McLellan as the book begins, so when did the initial spark actually happen? He relates his story of how he met the man in the park (Faber), so Clarisse was really just a catalyst in his transformation. Many themes are explored in this book: censorship, individuality, literacy, illiteracy, suicide, man vs. society and many more. This was required reading while I was in high school, a time when cell phones were much less ubiquitous and iPods non-existent. At the time, I understood the story, and we analyzed the book in class perfunctorily, but re-reading the book myself through the years, I've come to appreciate its themes and relevance. I smile every time I see it in Barnes & Noble at the summer reading table, along with the other classics. I'm jealous of whomever is reading it for the first time because I'll never again get to experience that genuine shock when that salamander stops at Montag's own home. It would be a shame if Fahrenheit 451 wasn't required reading in high school these days."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I mainly bought this book to read it in a plane (a 14 hours trip, and for some reason, I rarely sleep in an airplane). However, I couldn't sleep that day not because I usually don't sleep in airplanes, but because this book was THAT good. It's surprising how close to reality the narrative is. For today, people worship their TV's and laptops. The book is well written; the author utilized metaphors, similes and other writing techniques to create the dark, desperate atmosphere of the unnamed city and its people.I really enjoyed reading this book. If you want a dark, short, great novel, this is the perfect choice. However, be warned, the extensive use of similes and metaphors might confuse you (I had to re-read several paragraphs due to their complex structure.)"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I have heard that some people refuse to read books which have not been around for at least 30 years, having proven their ability to stand the test of time. In reading Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury* I came to understand this reasoning. I read the 50th anniversary edition and as I delved into it, I found myself shocked to have never read this igniting book before. It has been said that books are so patient they will at times wait centuries for the right reader to come along and bring them to life once again.\\"Cram them full of noncombustable data, chock them so damned full of \`facts' they feel stuffed, but absolutely \`brilliant' with information. Then they will feel they're thinking, they'll get a sense of motion without moving. And then they'll be happy...\\"Books such as Into the Shallows: What the Internet is Doing to Our Brains and Fahrenheit 451 though they were written years apart are trying to raise awareness that we are losing something. We hear everywhere about how education is going downhill, literacy at an all time low. These are all red flags to show the dangerous path our culture is headed down. We must listen! It's time to wakeup as individuals, and not settle for the status quo, there is such a richness we are missing in the power of reading, because we feast on momentary delights.Fahrenheit 451 is a book for book lovers, educators, and parents. Each of us has the power to influence someone in our lives and one of the most important areas which we must encourage others in is literacy. Today we live in a culture which is being robbed of literacy and creativity by lulling simplistic entertainment and never ending noise coming through such mindnumbing channels as TV, social media, gaming, internet surfing, etc. \\"Then- motion pictures in the early twentieth century.

Because your thirst will drive you to wells more deep than what you have experienced. Allow reading to take you on a journey of awakening, it may give you a glimpse of the something more you have been longing for.* I definitely recommend the 50th Anniversary version, because for those who love to know the story behind the story there is an afterward written by Bradbury, as well as an interview and some other goodies."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I have read Fahrenheit 451 several times, and it is one of my favorite novels. Its censorship themes seem just as relevant today as they did in the 1950s. In Fahrenheit 451, some books deemed illegal, and firemen are responsible for tracking down and burning every last copy.The U.S. government's efforts to stop Wikileaks reminded me of Bradbury's firemen. Federal agencies went through extreme measures to attempt to stop or slow the release of classified documents. I was also reminded of Fahrenheit 451 when the Pentagon arranged to buy every copy of Army Reserve Lt. Col. Anthony Shaffer's memoir \\"Operation Dark Heart\\" before they could reach the shelves.I would like to ask Bradbury, do you think current censorship policies are on the verge of reaching Fahrenheit 451 levels?"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Because of the current usage of terms taken from classic dystopian novels - Big Brother, Fahrenheit 9/11, etc - I had stayed away from such novels. I wasn't interested in what I thought would be whiny books about the government and the authority.Thank God, I was wrong.*Fahrenheit 451* is a true masterpiece. Known as science-fiction, it's much more, because the world Bradbury depicts shares some striking similarities with ours, and, considering the time Bradbury wrote it, one can only bow to his sense of foresight.*fahrenheit 451* is somewhere between *1984* and *Brave New World*. It combines elements from both dystopias and does something very clever with it. Instead of having a dystopia imposed from the top down, Bradbury creates a more subtle world with shades of grey. The result is a much more believable universe, which we can already recognise in our very own, current world. And that's the freaky part.The writing per se is rich, poetic, never pointless, always efficient. Everything counts, not one page for nothing. It has all the elements of a good short story - which it started as - combined with the dimensions of a novel. It's still a relatively short novel, at 200 pages or so, but that doesn't matter one bit. Bradbury's prose is terrific.I can only recommend this novel to anyone. Whether you're into sci-fi or not seems beside the point with this book; if you like sci-fi, for all the good reasons, then you should love it, and if you don't care about sci-fi, you should still love it. It may even make you appreciate sci-fi if you never did before.This novel is deep, well-crafted, and philosophical. It's one of those books you feel has truly given you something valuable."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Imagine living in a world in which you are so disconnected from other people that you spend your waking hours in your parlor surrounded on all sides by your TV \\"family\\". You sleep at night with ear buds whispering sweet nothings in your ear. There's a war going on and world-wide economic problems, but you don't notice. In fact, you don't want to notice because that would upset you. You don't read books because that might upset you too. You don't talk to people or even think because that too might upset you. So you spend your time amidst the flashing lights in your parlor or speeding 100 miles an hour down the road - anything that distracts you from anything upsetting.This is the world Guy Montag lives in, is part of and actively enforces. He is a \\"fireman\\" - one who starts fires rather than putting them out. When the alarm goes off, he races to the scene and glories in the smell of kerosene and the power of his igniter. He is merely protecting people from danger - the danger of books. He feels triumphant as he watches them flutter like dying birds amidst the flames. Life is good. He is happy.Or is he? The first clue is that Montag seems to be the only one who doesn't like the Mechanical Hound so much. But his \\"happiness\\" really starts to unravel when he meets Clarisse McClellan, a girl who's \\"seventeen and crazy\\". She does really odd things like take walks, look at the stars, talk to people. She asks Montag if it's true that firemen used to put out fires? Nah, couldn't be.Montag is irritated and infuriated by her, but still drawn to her, awakened by her. Then one day she's gone and Montag's world is never the same. He's haunted by a fire in which a woman was burned - chose to burn herself - along with her books. He secretly steals a book from the fire. Actually, his hands have been doing that all along, but he's never let his mind know it. Montag becomes drawn to - obsessed by - books. He tries to share them with his wife, Mildred, but the more he reaches out, the more she retreats to the parlor \\"family\\" to soothe her distress. He's going to ruin her happiness. Montag secretly turns to the one person left who might help him - or at least hear him. A old professor he met once, actually talked to.Of course, nothing that Montag does is actually secret. His Fire Chief, Beatty, knows the anguish Montag is going through. He tries to explain it all to Montag. How books cause insecurity and conflict. How they conflict with each other and are, ultimately, empty. How people are better off - happier - without them. How the people themselves wanted the books banned and burned. Beatty tries to teach Montag a lesson and then give him the opportunity to return to the fold. But the fabric is already rent, and things unravel as they inevitably must.This book is remarkably prescient for having been written in 1953. Not only does Bradbury accurately predict the invention of large-screen TVs that can be hung on a wall and personalized entertainment systems that can be plugged directly into one's ears, but he predicted much of the dystopian society we now live in. Wars, famine and economic crises are erupting all over the world, but we're more concerned about our \\"family\\" - Lindsay Lohan, Britney Spears, the Palins, among others. People are going hungry, but all is right with the world so long as we can have our SUVs and iPhones.\\"Fahrenheit 451\\" isn't so much about government censorship. Sure, the Firemen operate under the auspices of the government, but it's a democratic government. The government operates on behalf of the people. It is the people who have demanded the suppression of knowledge because it is messy, unsettling and \\"unhappy\\". The people don't want to be roused from their pleasurable bubble of overstimulation. True thought and relatedness - and the pauses and silences necessary for them - are far more threatening than being \\"comforted\\" (controlled) by a benign authoritarian government.Nevertheless, \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" optimistically predicts a world in which, if enough people can hold on to enough shreds of the knowledge contained in books and passed down generation to generation, eventually the cycle of destroying knowledge as threatening will cease. Wisdom will eventually permeate enough of the world to be able to withstand the destructive forces of fear and ignorance. I'd like to share Bradbury's optimism, but I'm not sure I can. Within my lifetime I've seen education devalued and ignorance celebrated. Wisdom may win out in the end, but I fear our civilization will face the same end as Montag's before that happens.But aw, heck, let's talk about something important. When does the next \\"Dancing with the Stars\\" begin?"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Very well-written science fiction from 1950. Despite being written before the explosion of modern technology, Bradbury's book-burning story makes many timeless observations about censorship and the suppression of original thought and personal interaction.Bradbury's seashells as earbuds and the parlors with surrounding interactive screens are hardly a stretch to imagine if you have ever competed with an iPod or a flat screen for another person's attention.SPOILER ALERTDespite many hopeless characters and some violent destruction, the ending is optimistic as Montag and his hideout professors devise a way to preserve the classics."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is the second time I've read this book, and it's even more engaging than I remember.

How could you not understand it? It was written in easy-to-understand language! How could you think it sucked? It combined thoughtful themes with a racy narrative.

It would be sad indeed to imagine American literature without &quot;Fahrenheit 451,&quot; especially since it reflects the tenor of the time in which it was written, the era of Senator McCarthy, when anti-intellectualism was, again, rampant in the U.S"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradbury create the book about one of the variant of future,and I want to hope , this variant will not become reality.Read more....Thank"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Of course this book is written about the obvious theme, censorship, and many in this day smugly state how well it applies to the current administration. But by digging deeper, you also find a personal struggle within Guy Montag, who transforms from the book burner to reader. By using such an everyman character as Montag (even the name Guy suggests the usual Joe), Bradbury avoids browbeating the reader with his ideals (in spite of the image of fire), and gently helps the reader understand the beauty of the written word. This does in fact contrast with an image of big government controlling lives. It is personal, not necessarily political."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradbury's novel tells of the future. Not of the \\"future\\" more commonly seen in science fiction movies, but more of a society in the future. The main character of the book is Guy Montag, a fireman for the city. The firemen during this time do not have the same job as firemen today. These firemen burn books. They start fires instead of extinguishing them. In this society, books are illegal because people do not want to debate topics or feel what a character is feeling in a book. The primary form of entertainment for the society is large televisions called parlors. Some people, like Montag's wife Mildred, depend upon these TV's and the \\"relatives\\" on the programs for emotions. Montag and the other firemen's job is to ensure that everyone is \\"free\\" from feelings.Guy Montag is a very dynamic character. At the beginning of the novel he accepts his society and his job, until one very influential character, Clarisse McClellan, crosses his path one night on his walk home from work. Until her disappearance, Clarisse shows Montag everything there is to enjoy outside of what society says you should enjoy. At the end of their first walk, Clarisse asks Guy, \\"Are you happy?\\" Guy thinks and realizes that he is not. Guy is not the only person that realizes that they are unhappy. When he returns home he finds his wife to have committed suicide. He calls in an emergency and two handymen come with small machines and heal Mildred. The men say that these cases of attempted suicide are so common that the doctors don't even bother to handle these cases anymore. This shows what how miserable everyone is in this society. Another influential part of Montag's realization in the flaws of his civilization is when he burns a lady that refuses to leave her books. Montag tries to figure out why someone would sacrifice their life for a book. He decides to investigate how a book could cause someone to give up their life. He obtains a book and is able to hide from the fire chief, Captain Beatty. Montag starts to read one of the books that he has acquired, but is unable to understand it. He seeks the help of a retired English professor, Faber. Montag and Faber agree to try and save society by destroying the firemen. Montag eventually joins a group of rebels against the unhappy society, but before they have a chance to act on the city, a bomb is dropped on the city. This gives Montag and his group a chance to rebuild the once damaged society."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"it's just amazing.aside from that, i have a leather bound edition signed by ray bradbury himself, seeing as how he's my good friend's godfather.and yeah.it's one of the greatest science fiction novels ever written-truly a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 is a book that will make you think. As you are reading this book, questions pop up that you would have probably never thought of. Set in the not so distant future, Bradbury plunges you into the life of Guy Montag. He is a fireman who was always taught to ask how, not why. His job is to burn, not put out flames, never asking the reasons behind the burnings. He goes through life happy, not knowing anything is wrong. He lives in an unperfected utopia. Due to one event, his whole mentality crumbles and chaos emerges as he goes through a transformation, making everyone around him his enemy, except the few people who have gone through this metamorphosis. No longer ignorant he becomes isolated, pushing for some way out.This book is probably one of the best books I have ever read; it might even be my favorite. If you like books such as The Giver, or the short story Harrison Bergeron, then this is definitely a book to read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I love books like this more than I can express. Utopian society type books are probably my favorite things to read. So, naturally, I picked up Fahrenheit 451. I had heard great things about it from everyone except a good friend of mine who said simply that although he didn't by any means despise it, he thought it was a tad corny. I began reading the book and immediately fell in love with the style of writing. But, as I read on, I found that the book just felt a little... off. I think that it may have been a little unbelievable really, especially the Mechanical Hounds and such. I was also disappointed about Clarisse, although I won't go into detail about that. The thing that I really liked though, was that Bradbury hit the nail on the head when it comes to the development of political correctness. Overall, the book was alright. It was a quick read and I am still certainly glad that I read it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Here's another book that I should have read in school, but somehow never did.

When his secret comes out, he has to flee for his life.Bradbury's writing is wonderfully evocative, painting clear pictures of his vision of a dark future. In this era of &quot;reality television,&quot; this book has a definite prophetic feeling to it, as if we were actually well on the way down the road Bradbury warns us about.

Whereas \\"1984\\" implies that the downfall of the elements of language and pure animal instincts led to the degredation of society and \\"Brave New World\\" argues that beauty and truth are essential, \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" places its claim on the existence of literature. This fast-paced novel transports the reader to a world where firemen don't put out fires, they start them, and where philosophers and lovers of books don't have a place in a college classroom, but rather as bums on the streets. With descriptive passages and thought-provoking characterizations, \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" is a delightful novel.However, I was slightly disappointed in the lack of depth it contains. I am an avid fan of Utopian literature, but I found it difficult to get swept up in the emotions of the novel. Without a doubt, it was pleasant to read, but if you're looking for a deep and enriching book that will make you laugh and cry and bring to light new perspectives on life and society, this isn't the most suitable novel for you."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Well, it's not a bad book. Actually it should not be considered a book though, it is, rather, a short story. The ideas expressed are all very valable but there isn't much of a story and the science behind it laughable. Bradbury makes good points and argues well, it's just that if you're reading this book (or any book for that matter) it probably implies that you already like reading and value books pretty high. So Bradbury is preaching to the converted. This book makes a great reading list though, many names are dropped and books are quoted from. Instead of reading this book you should read any of the books mentioned in it. Or just as a reminder of why you love to read so much."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This was a great book. It is very thought provoking and powerful.The future world he proposed gets more likely every year. It's message gets more important.Even if you don't like sci-fi or Ray Bradbury, this book is worth it just for the insights he makes."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I became interested in Ray Bradbury and his works ever since my freshman English teacher assigned me to read \\"The Sound of Summer running\\". Bradbury's usage of imagery allowed me to really get into his other short stories. I immediately had an interest for the book as soon as I read the first page; the way Ray Bradbury created a visual image in my mind lead me to continue reading to the very end.Fahrenheit 451 is about Guy Montag, a fireman in a futuristic world where he and his fellow firemen start fires, rather than put them out; however his whole way of thinking is put into question after meeting a strange girl who lives on his block. Ray Bradbury creates a situation where the main character (Montag), after discovering the knowledge books bring, has a desire to be heard with his ideas expressed. \\"I just want someone to hear what I have to say. And maybe if I talk long enough, it'll make sense\\" (81). Guy Montag can be described as a person who relies on others for support and direction. Guys' new way of thinking is challenged by the fire chief, Beatty, who tries to return Guy back to ignorance like the rest of the world, trying to convince Montag to burn his books. \\"Its real beauty is that it destroys responsibility and consequences\\" (115). After a long internal struggle within his own mind Montag comes to a decision that ultimately changes him. No longer does he rely on others and follow what they say, Guy Montags' knew found knowledge gives him an independent growth. \\"I don't want to change sides and just be told what to do. There's no reason to change if I do that\\" (93).I agree with other costumer review when they write things like \\"wonderful and still relevant\\", \\"wonderful book\\", and \\"short classic\\". The book in itself is a very interesting view on society and it is truly a short but still entertaining book. Touching on many key issues in our own society while putting them in a creative twist I can understand why many people gave this book such a high rating.In conclusion this book was fascinating with great characters and an even greater storyline. Though many people may not like this story, I found it to have an excellent plot and I felt Bradbury put amazing imagery within the text. I recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of Ray Bradbury and even if you're not a fan I would still highly recommend this book to someone who wants an exciting and interesting novel to read.TJHS 12th grade student"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I have long been a fan of the 1965 film \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" which is based on this 1953 Ray Bradbury novel. The two are only somewhat similar which makes reading the novel and seeing the film well worth your while. This novel paints a dystopian view of the future...a society where books are banned because of the way they make people feel. Bradbury imagines a world where people are drawn to video images on the screen (how hauntingly predictable!) and a government which has strangled creativity and original thinking. Guy Montag, a fireman, is a government \\"agent\\" whose job requires him to destroy by fire books wherever they can be found. He meets a young woman and is suddenly challenged by feelings he has long since suppressed. He begins to read some of the books seized and this sets him on a collision course with the government and his superiors. This is compelling reading and I think the reader will be satisfied with the resolution both on the film and in the novel...they are somewhat different. This gets my highest recommendation!Fahrenheit 451: A Novel"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"American writers are knows for their ability to write short but brilliant literature, and this gem is no exception. Even today Bradbury's writing still has bite, and the themes are still relevant."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"\\"What do we want in this country, above all? People want to be happy, isn't that right?\\"Guy Montag is a fireman in an American city of the future. However, with all of the buildings fireproofed, Guy spends his time burning the one thing that cannot be allowed in society - books. He enjoys his work, the purification of civilization by fire, but something is missing. When he meets a new neighbor girl, Clarisse, he realizes that it's something that has been done away with - the idea of thought.Clarisse opens Montag's world to the fact that society as he knows it is useless. Citizens walk around numb, feeling and thinking nothing, over-stimulated and constantly seeking pleasure and happiness. There is no sadness, no discomfort of thought, no desire to be a better person. Ideas and thoughts have gone away with the books who carried their message, and silence has been replaced by constant noise and activity.It is this new-found knowledge that changes Montag's life. No longer content to simply exist, he begins stealing books from the homes he burns to see what all the fuss is about. And by gaining this illicit knowledge, he begins to make changes that will impact not only him but those around him.I must confess that I picked up \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" with no clue as to what it was about. Throughout, I was shocked at how much of the horror in the book has come to pass. Though it was written less than 60 years ago, our world has come to resemble the society in the book in many ways. We've started to absolve ourselves of all responsibility in life, and we will do nearly anything for pleasure. Though I enjoyed it at first read, I know it's one I'll have to dive into again and again to truly appreciate."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book was a real pleasue to read. With laws passed to limit rights, this novel certainly challenges the censorship that today's governments enforce. I would recommend this book to anybody, whether you know anything about the topic at hand or not."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451Ray Bradbury's novel, \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" is a fascinating depiction of a world where books are banned and burned. It is a frightening vision of a fascist, future America where dissent and independent thought is discouraged. Supposedly, books conjure up to many feelings and questions; people are better off in ignorant bliss. Reading books is illegal. People are absorbed by huge televisions displaying mindless programming. Written in 1960, the novel is set around our time. In our alternate history, people stopped reading books, and humanities courses in college lost interest and were dropped. Society became ever more automic and fast-paced. War is ever-prevalent, as fighter jets are constantly heard, screeching across the sky. It is a picture of a society in decline.Our protagonist Guy Montag is a fireman whose job it is to seek out and destroy books. Houses are all made of brick now, so they can't burn. He meets a lovely, young lady who asks him questions and gets his mind thinking. In secret, he begins to keep and read some of the books and discovers a new world. He also meets an old man who used to be a humanities professor; he shows Montag his library and helps him to see things in a new light.This is an amazing classic novel. Its implications for our society are profound. People should slow down, stop being brainwashed by television, and open their mind to the world of books. This novel is intelligent, extremely well-written, and a pleasure to read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I'm not sure how I managed to gain a degree in English and never read this book. While watching Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, I was overcome with a desire to read the book when the Nazis were burning books. For years, whenever my college Christian group discussed book burning, I would accuse them of being Nazi Germany or mention this book under my breath. And, of course, I had never read it. However, after reading it, I was more right than I ever could have known . . .When I started this book, I fully expected some elaborate government coup to permanently do away with books as a way of citizen control. But I did not expect it to have originated with the people! In a society where people are focused on instant gratification and personal equality (similar to Harrison Bergeron), books are thrown by the wayside. Condensed down to small encyclopedia references, people can no longer need a college education to be up on the latest work of literature, like Shakespeare. However, seeing the pointlessness in that, books, which are about people who aren't even real, were replaced by \\"real\\" people in wall TVs.However, after the people decided to do away with books, the government saw a toehold and used it for their advantage. Reading the book really made me think more about what we put importance on. Look at all of the game shows on TV, the bigger and better entertainment systems we want, etc. We stopped asking why.Even though she did not have much time in the book, I loved Clarisse! She was a simple, beautiful, and delightful character! Just her presence and her refusal to accept life the way she was told made a huge difference in Montag's life. Her love to just talk and ask questions was pivotal in his development as a character.This book is really hard to explain. Bradbury dares his audience to think about things, talk, and not take everything at face value. This was an amazing book, and I challenge people to read it and not come away changed."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Best book about political correctness run amok ever written.It's short and sweet, and makes you think, if you are capable of thinking."}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:x,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},B={class:"card-container"},q=["disabled"],H={key:0},j={key:1};function E(s,o,n,u,r,i){const c=f("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",B,[(e(!0),t(y,null,g(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),w(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",j,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",H,"See more"))],8,q)):p("",!0)])}const U=d(M,[["render",E],["__scopeId","data-v-4d6cec60"]]),W=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/38.md","filePath":"guide/38.md"}'),F={name:"guide/38.md"},O=Object.assign(F,{setup(s){return(o,n)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(U)]))}});export{W as __pageData,O as default};
