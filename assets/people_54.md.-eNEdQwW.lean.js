It feels like a mechanical effort. Everything from names to dialog feel too contrived or constructed. There are very few real surprises or really creative ideas. On the other hand, there is a sense of humor that the author could have used more often. Unlike Heinlein, the texture of the worlds seems very flat and oddly unvarying across the worlds they travel through. It also feels like it needs an editor who would encourage less verbiage but, paradoxically, more texture. Much of the action seems unconvincing because of the lack of sufficient hand waving to explain things. For instance the loss of knowledge and solar power to name a couple."},{"Title":"UC_Runner","review":"I tried hard to like this book, and for the first 100 or so pages it was quite enjoyable. Unfortunately, after that it became repetitive and formulaic: travel to a new town/planet, encounter bad guys, beat bad guys, rinse, repeat. It felt as though Dietz was trying to rewrite Jack Vance'sBig PlanetorTales of the Dying Earth, but instead of fresh and strange, each new location was merely a variation on a theme. In the end, the book came across as a personal inner journey for the author which didn't translate well to novel form. My recommendation is that if you like the sound of this book try Vance instead or as well."},{"Title":"UC_Runner","review":"This book reminds me of the Firefly miniseries. The setting was unique, including sentient starships and multi-layered cities across multiple planets. The characters were enjoyable, especially Lanni and her \\"abilities\\". At same time they were credible and even fallible. Unlike your typical action hero, Jack wore \\"spectacles\\" and was self-doubting, not cynical as others have mentioned. Lanni was pleasant but not a gorgeous supermodel as you Hollywood would have written it, and even the arch villain Kane was believable, being cold hearted yet manifesting fear and other emotions in his efforts to redeem himself and climb the Techno Society's corporate ladder. I thought the encounters, while recurring, were not clich&eacute; at all. The silver snake choker, attacking shuttle, Lanni's attack on the \\"intended location\\", the simulacrum, etc. kept the reader entertained and guessing. Yes I knew they would survive, but so what? I'm tired of the more popular dark novels where everyone the protagonist is attached to get's butchered, ending up in a revenge novel with no redeeming value. Finally, I loved the ending where Lee got his chance to take on the true imposter, although I would have enjoyed a more elaborate Q&A process and more of a theological debate. I already bought the follow-up Logos Run on the popular auction site, picked up the first Legion of the Dammed book at my local half-priced books store, and finally ordered Prison Planet and Body Guard as well - all by Dietz."},{"Title":"UC_Runner","review":"In the far future, mankind has spread throughout the galaxy, via a system of portals between star systems. Now their location has been forgotten, so mankind is reverting back to a state where magic becomes very important, and each star system is on its own. The little interstellar travel that is left is handled by a rapidly diminishing fleet of aging ships. Only the brave, the foolhardy or professional couriers called runners make such journeys.Jak Rebo's mission is to deliver a young boy to a faraway planet, to find out for sure if he is a legitimate religious apostle (based on present-day Buddhism). This religion has two sects, and members of the other sect have plenty of reason for wanting to make sure that Rebo and his human cargo never reach their destination.Things get more complicated when a female \\"sensitive,\\" (a clairvoyant and channeler) named Lanni Norr joins the group. With the reverting of mankind away from interstellar travel, science has been reduced to the level of a religious cult. Milos Lysander, the long-dead founder of the Techno Society, seems to have chosen Norr as his way to communicate with this world. The present-day members of the Society want Norr very much, because they think that Lysander has the secret to the location of the long-lost interstellar travel portals. If necessary, they are more than willing to kill anyone who gets in their way.First of a series, this one is very good. The author has written a number of military/action SF novels in the past, so he very much knows what he is doing. This novel does a fine job of keeping the reader's interest."},{"Title":"UC_Runner","review":"Before reading Runner I had a great deal of respect for William Dietz as a \\"military\\" Science Fiction author. His Legion of the Damned series was inventive, well thought out, and believable.Unfortunately, Runner is none of the above. The entire novel is a series of chase scenes populated by characters of exceedingly low intelligence. Generally you can tell what obvious mistake is going to be made by whom a good ten pages beforehand.And the characters do not ever seem to learn from their mistakes, repeating them in different situations. The true miracle of the book is that the ensemble survives to the last page.Much is made of Dietz's interpretation of Tibetan Buddhism, and to his credit he has done his homework here and has created a believable religion. Unfortunately the same cannot be said of his post-apocalyptic inter-galactic travel infrastructure. Sentient but manic-depressive starships which can no longer be repaired set the tone for the emotional immaturity of all the characters. A network of \\"star gates\\" which only a select few know about should be used by the heros to evade capture by the bad guys -- especially since they have the ear of someone who knows where they are. However, since the heros always take the most obvious route, they have only their own incredible stupidity to blame when they are in imminent danger, which happens about every other chapter.As to the ending, it was predicted on page one. At no time in the novel do you not know how it is going to turn out. Which is a pity because while Dietz is not known for his strong endings at least you can usually count on a good ride to get there."},{"Title":"UC_Runner","review":"This book is set in a very distant future, several hundred thousand years away, when a much higher tech civilization, that spread to hundreds of worlds, has collapsed and given way to a relatively low-tech society. A small number of sentient AI ships still connect the different worlds, but they are gradually failing because the skills to build them, or even maintain the existing vessels, have died out. Rebo Jak, the lead, is a runner, a member of a guild that collects fees for transporting people or objects between worlds.The elements in this book are rather too cliched: you start with the brave, skilled but cynical and world weary (in this case worlds weary) fighter. Give him a kid to transport safely to a distant planet, with various baddies determined to kill him. Throw in a damsel in distress, who just may carry the secret of returning to a true galactic civilization, on the run from an entirely different set of nasties.So it's formulaic, but a formulaic book can be done well or done badly, and this one is, on the whole, done rather well. The characters draw you in and the story is exciting although, by the end, the scenario of our heroes heading into and squeaking through yet another ambush starts to get old.One thing about the basic premise that didn't work for me is that everybody, except for the baddies trying to capture and exploit the heroine, seems to be quite happy with this low tech culture. Since the planets in this story don't have extensive enough contact to have much influence on each other, why did all revert in more or less the same way? And why are the ruling elites on each world uninterested in reviving technology? One would think that they'd know, at the very least, that advanced science would mean a much longer life span for themselves and their families, not too mention a lot more wealth to divvy up.One sequel already has been written, with more probably on the way. But they aren't necessary for this book, which is complete in itself."},{"Title":"UC_Runner","review":"I have actually never read anything by this author until I picked up this book and I know wonder where he's been hiding all these years! This was a fun book, yes, a bit reminiscent of other sci-fi endeavors, but nevertheless a good story. The plot is sort of a cross between \\"Logan's Run\\" and \\"The Fugitive\\". It's non-stop action as three people must flee from planet to planet in old, broken down spaceships running from a variety of bad guys who all want something different from our heroic trio. I like it. If Arthur C. Clarke had ever written such an action/chase novel, it would look like this! (A higher compliment, I can not give!) Naturally, if the bad guys catch them, the whole galaxy will be destroyed or ruined or forced to vote Republican or something like that. I never understood that whole mess anyway, but the point is that it's HARD to write an entire novel about people being chased across different planets. You have to think of new planets, new bad guys, new ways to escape, etc. But Dietz pulls it off and the book reads very well. I enjoyed it and highly recommend it. I also look forward to the ubiquitous sequel.

I'm sure many authors make such errors, but ordinarily they are caught in editing. Not this time, they weren't. Dietz is in love with sentence fragments. One or two of those might be artistically meaningful, but there are closer to a hundred of them in the book. Twice he uses the word \\"perspective\\" when he means \\"prospective\\". I don't have it in front of me (I took it back to the library, grateful that I didn't pay for it!) or I would list some of the other problems. Potholes on an otherwise smooth road.

Understanding the 25 page long appendix took me as much time as the reading of the rest of the 400 pages of the book... It is a very good outline of set theory as used by Badiou, but I found it hard to understand it without the equations, that I finally found in Wikipedia. The rest of the book is much easier to read. I followed some of Peter Hallward's leads, like to read Saramago's novel \\"All the Names\\" as way of understanding Badiou's theory of love as a category of truth and event.All in all, Peter Hallward's book is an essential key and introduction to the next step: reading Alain Badiou's complex and exciting \\"Being and Event\\"."},{"Title":"Badiou: A Subject To Truth","review":"Hands down the best and most comprehensive book on Badiou to date, and probably for sometime to come. Covers just about everything the guy has written, a fair bit of it unpublished. The emphasis is more on Badiou's \`Being and Event' (1988) and subsequent work, so one weakness here is the relative lack of detailed attention paid to \`Theory of the Subject' and Badiou's other early texts. The concluding stuff on \`absolutism' is maybe a little OTT. But in general this is very solid work, and not many contemporary philosophers have been given such careful treatment so early in their reception. If you're curious about Badiou, or know something about him but are looking for some extra material, then this is an excellent place to start.And unlike the previous reviewer, I thought the mathematical and contextual dimensions of the book were mostly helpful and about as thorough as is feasible, at least for non-specialist readers. Most of Rasheed Sabar's bizarre objections don't make any sense, or suggest that he hasn't actually read this book - for instance Hallward offers around a dozen obvious reasons why Badiou is opposed to Heidegger, and Badiou himself repeatedly affirms both formalism and realism/platonism without any contradiction or confusion, etc. If you want more info I found a much more informed & reliable review by Adrian Johnston, on the Metapsychology website (http://mentalhelp.net/books/books.php?type=de&id;=1819)."},{"Title":"Badiou: A Subject To Truth","review":"This is an excellent introduction to Badiou. Even with my limited education I was able to start really getting into his ideas and move on to start Badiou's writings, himself. It includes a layman's introduction to set theory as an appendix that is excellent and absolutely necessary to really starting to get what Badiou means by things like 'generic', 'void' and many of the other terms he uses.Through the text the terms Badiou uses are explained in detail. I could not have asked for more - only wish that there were more books this good introducing other great contemporary philosophers."},{"Title":"Badiou: A Subject To Truth","review":"Badiou's project is definitely original. So original, in fact, that many people who come across his work dismiss it as hog-wash altogether and never give it the chance it deserves. I, by no means, believe that Badiou is our contemporary equivalent to Plato, but I respect his project a great deal, and I feel that the people who don't give Badiou a chance have never read this book. The problem with Badiou's work is that it's extremely complex in some works and perhaps too focused in his easier works, so for the new reader it is very difficult to come to terms with his philosophy using only his books. This is why this introduction is so helpful; Hallward's book does an amazing job of grasping much of Badiou's philosophy, and conveying it in a way that is extremely readable (but don't treat it like light reading, there are some difficult passages to be sure). It's extremely thorough (consequently, it is not short, with the book being around 330 (fairly word-crowded pages) with a 20+ page conceptual introduction to set theory, and around 100 pages of notes).These are the things that I believe to be particular strengths of the book:1. There is very little background reading needed; you should have some basic familiarity with the major philosophical figures like Kant, Heidegger, and Plato, and some Lacan wouldn't hurt either, but familiarity with these thinkers is by no means a rigid prerequisite, and if you're sufficiently interested in philosophy to be reading Badiou, you should be alright.2. With that said, Hallward does a very good job of distinguishing Badiou's work from his contemporaries so one really gets a picture of how his thinking differs from other theorists', which is really important in the case of Badiou because his work is so different from other Philosophers or social theorists whose work you may be familiar with.3. It outlines the major decisions that go into Badiou's ontology and it allows you to see, more than any other account that I have read, what \\"Mathematics is Ontology\\" actually means (and its implications etc.), and it maps out exactly why Badiou does what he does, personally, it is this ontological core to Badiou's thought that has always been the most challenging, so this helps a great deal.4. You will be able to cope, interact with, and determine the personal usefulness of Badiou after reading this book, it is really an excellent work.This book definitely deserves 5 stars, but there are some things that readers should keep in mind:1. Hallward's account of Badiou's early work (Theory of the Subject) is a good summary, but it is brief. This is perfectly fine if you subscribe to Hallward's belief that there is a major break between the Badiou of Theory of the Subject and that of Being and Event, and that a good understanding of Badiou's philosophy is not contingent upon a major comprehension of his early work (it is extremely difficult). This is by no means an unfounded belief, but it is not universally accepted. Bruno Bosteels, for example, sees a bit more continuity between the \\"Early\\" and the \\"Mature\\" Badiou.2. Badiou and Hallward have both published very critical studies of Deleuze, which both pursue criticism along similar lines. I don't want to go into too much detail with this, but I would be suspect of some of the characterizations of Deleuze throughout the book and especially in the section when Hallward summarizes Badiou's book on Deleuze; most contemporary Deleuzian philosophers/scholars hold that the main criticisms in these books are pretty weak. I tend to agree with them, and I don't want to force my opinions on others in this setting, but I would say that one should not blindly accept some of the assertions about Deleuze in the book.3.Some context is still needed for people reading this book. The state of Badiou's work has changed quite a bit since the time that this book was written (early 2000s), especially for the anglophone world. At this time, only a few of Badiou's works had been translated into English, likeEthics: An Essay on the Understanding of EvilorDeleuze: The Clamor of Being.Being and Event, Badiou's magnum opus, was not translated until 2005, and many other works referenced in this book have been translated fairly recently. This means that the purpose of this book was meant to provide an introduction to a philosophical project on a whole, rather than as a series of readers' guides (though specific textual references are never lacking in the volume). This is also probably the place to also include thatLogics of Worlds (Being and Event, 2)had not been completed upon the writing of this book, and it both completes many of the ideas that are mentioned in the book's final chapter and also responds to many of the criticisms that are leveled against Badiou's project in the chapter on specificity. With that said, this is still definitely something that is more than worth reading for someone who (a) wants a thorough introduction to one of Continental Philosophy's most important contemporary figures, and specifically for someone who (b)is not a huge fan of more discourse-oriented theoretical literature that is so common now-a-days, or just postmodernism in general (whatever that means)."},{"Title":"Badiou: A Subject To Truth","review":"This is an outstanding introduction to Badiou. Anything written by Hallward is essential reading if you are interested in contemporary philosophy."},{"Title":"Badiou: A Subject To Truth","review":"Before briefly stating my opinions on the book, let me mention that amazon reviews, capped at 1,000 words, do not provide an optimal forum for in-depth reviews. My review has been criticized as \\"non-sensical\\" by the other reviewer on this site who posted from New York. Within the next several days I will put up a website which contains a much longer review of this book. Not only will I show that my claims are not non-sensical, I will also attempt to get it into the other reviewer's tiny mind just how the book fails. The author himself, upset at the amazon review, sent me a letter, to which I will respond in depth on the aforementioned website. If you are interested in understanding Badiou (indirectly) or how Hallward's book lacks significant philosophical worth, look for this upcoming website. For now:Though indisputably erudite, Hallward's book is not only confusing but confused. The first four chapters seek to situate Badiou in the context of classical philosophy and current French thought, and to clarify the role of mathematics in Badiou's philosophy. The attempt to contextualize Badiou fails horribly. We find out, in particular, that Badiou aligns himself with Plato, Descartes, Sartre, etc; we find out that he rejects the linguistic turn. We find out that he is the \\"exact contrary\\" of Heidegger, but it is never explained how or why this is so. In other words, all we get is a cataloguing of Badiou's positions (as if he were a politician) without the argumentation that Badiou uses to ally himself with these positions. The majority of what we get by way of argument-reproduction is the trite phraseology that Badiou cares for strong subjectivity, clarity, universalism, etc. Ok. But why? And how does he defeat the linguistic turn? Why is thought before being?The explanations clarifying Badiou's equating of mathematics and ontology fail abysmally through internal contradictions. The author fails at points to keep \\"pure being\\" and \\"what can be said of being\\" distinct; at one page he will call mathematics \\"true thought\\", and at another time he will say that it is valueless--it is the event which is true thought. We do not get a clear sense what the precise connection between mathematics and reality is for Badiou: at one point Hallward says that, for Badiou, mathematics as articulating Being implies that it is \\"prior to\\" the distinction between the actual and the potential; while at other moments he attempts to understand Badiou as a partial realist and partial formalist (these terms, or at least realism, presuppose the strong divide between reality and mathematics which Badiou seeks to overcome). It is of course possible to make arguments which resolve these tensions in Hallward's text. But the book makes the reader work too hard to thread something coherent from the mess that is presented.It is only through attentive reading that these gaps and contradictions come out. A cursory reading will leave one very satisfied. But if you want to understand Badiou deeply, this book reads roughly. Unfortunately, there are few other books on the market which cover the range of Badiou that Hallward does. So i'd have to say that it is decent by default."},{"Title":"The Power of the Machine: Global Inequalities of Economy, Technology, and Environment","review":"This book is challenging in two main ways.1) It challenges the dominant worldview about the nature of material and energetic exchange enabled by the global economy, and the role of modern free markets and industrialization in perpetuating and worsening global historical inequalities.Both the global benefactors (in centers) and the direct victims (in peripheries) of this process are blind to its true nature because our historical frame of discourse about exchange obscures the realities of global resource \\"exchange\\"--a word which in itself presumes an equal trade of tit for tat. In this sense, we are all victims of \\"the machine\\"--The Matrix style--where people in global peripheries (from where high-quality resources are extracted) as subjected to exploitation at the hands hands of people in global centers (to where the resources go).Hornborg uses the machine as a means of examining and critiquing industrialization as a process of converting high quality matter/energy into low-quality, but high-priced products. Because these are high-entropy products, they require much more material/energetic inputs in order to operate and sustain them. Thus, they require \\"feeding,\\" and that is the purpose of peole in global centers. Like that quote from \\"Fight Club\\"--\\"The things you own end up owning you.\\" In a sense, \\"machines\\" take on a life of their own as they have power over us and we literally worship them as inherently \\"productive.\\"I don't think Hornborg is a luddite--technology isn't inherently evil. It is more a problem of concentration and distribution. However, unless we reach an enlightened position about the true nature of industrialization and global resource transfer, machines will continue to own us, and may push us toward the brink of self-destruction.2) The book also challenges the reader. Hornborg makes the excuse early on that it is inherently challenging because it aims to construct a whole new worldview to replace the reader's current worldview. This is partially true. However the book is also challenging because how, and for whom, it is written. It is NOT an easy read. It is fairly non-linear, uses many terms that will be obscure to anyone outside of the many fields from which Hornborg draws. He doesn't include a glossary or define many of the technical words he uses, which is a big no no IMO. So keep a dictionary close by. Be patient and be prepared to work hard to extract meaning from what he writes--it is often like piecing together a puzzle where no single part makes much sense until you can gain a sense of the total image. In the end, I think the struggle is worth it--it is actually a very intuitive and even visual argument. I can see an animated diagram in my head that embodies his argument.But I also think he COULD have written it to be more accessible--there are many sentences that could easily be unpacked. Overall, it might have made the book 100 pages longer, but overall a much smoother read.I hope his argument gains steam and more people start writing in this vein (albeit more accessibly). The implications are vast, especially among all the trendy and often-meaningless talk about \\"sustainability.\\""},{"Title":"The Power of the Machine: Global Inequalities of Economy, Technology, and Environment","review":"Before reading this book, I had read several first-rate books dealing with environmental issues; books that tended to approach the subject from a biological (ecological) point of view. Although they were very useful and I learned a lot from them, I thought that they largely overlooked human/social factors, or treated them superficially. I intuitively felt that any analysis of sustainability (or whatever you want to call it) that was not also firmly based in the social sciences and the humanities was incomplete. In short, I decided to keep looking.I first encountered Alf Hornborg in a recent issue of an academic journal devoted to biosemiotics. The content and clarity of his article there so impressed me that I searched for more information about him on the Internet, discovered that he had written this book, and took the chance of ordering it. The book is all I had hoped for, and then some. I believe this author has seen more deeply into our environmental predicament than anyone I have yet encountered.Hornborg's main thesis, as stated in the introduction, is that we are &quot;caught in a collective illusion about the nature of modern technology. We do not recognize that what ultimately keeps our machines running are global terms of trade. The power of the machine is not _of_ the machine, but of the asymmetric structures of exchange of which it is an expression.&quot;He goes on to state:&quot;My argument represents a conjunction of perspectives from the humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences. It is polemical in relation to most conventional discourse on 'sustainable development,' ecological economics, and similar topics in suggesting that solutions to our ecological predicament will have to be more profound and radical than is usually envisioned in the environmental debate. I argue for a _defamiliarization_ of our conventional conceptions of technology and development, that is, a fundamental distancing from the cultural categories through which the modern economic system operates, and in terms of which most policy negotiations are conducted. Above all, I argue that we must recognize the global, _distributional_ aspects of development, technology, and environmental issues. The intellectual ancestry of these ideas can be traced to the underexplored interfaces between world system theory, political ecology, ecological economics, economic anthropology, fetishism theory, and semiotics.&quot;The heart of the book, in my opinion, is in chapters 8 through 11. Chapters 9 and 10 are particularly outstanding. Rather than try to summarize the material, which would be hard to do in this brief space, I will close with some brief excerpts from chapter 10, which should impart some of the flavor of what is here:&quot;Romanticist critiques of Western rationality have a long history, but studies in human ecology seem now to be in a position to articulate a _rational_ critique of that rationality. The contextualist position is not romanticism or mysticism but a sober recognition of the limitations of totalizing institutions and knowledge systems. Because of the sheer complexity and specificity of ecosystemic interrelationships and fluctuations, it is not unreasonable to expect that optimal strategies for sustainable resource management are generally best defined by local practitioners with close and long-term experience of these specificities, and with special stakes in the outcome. Yet it is clear that actual management strategies are today generally informed by entirely different sets of conditions.&quot;...&quot;Metaphor is a mode of knowing that positions the human subject by _evoking_ non-objectifiable inner states associated with specific forms of practice. The significance of metaphor for the contextualist argument thus lies in its capacity to activate tacit, practical knowledge based on experience of highly specific, local conditions. This position accommodates Ingold's proposition that cultural constructions of the environment are secondary to practical action ('the practitioner's way of knowing'), while recognizing the capacity of such constructions to codify and reinforce a specific, ecological _habitus_, not least in the transmission of such dispositions between generations. A metaphorical 'cognized model' does not so much encode ecological information as provide 'cues' for the activation of specific, practical repertoires appropriated in the context of action.&quot;...&quot;The discussion on 'traditional ecological knowledge' and 'traditional resource management' is thus intrinsically paradoxical to the extent that it hopes for an appropriation and application of local knowledge by the very modernist framework by which such knowledge is continually being eclipsed. In advocating what he calls 'epistemological decentralization,' Banuri recognizes that an increasing contextuality of knowledge will render 'the expert, trained in universal sciences, an anachronism.' Clearly, an 'expert' in an abstractly conceived field of 'local knowledge' is a contradiction in terms. But this paradox, of course, is a pervasive aspect of the anthropological condition. We can engage in a meta-discourse on knowledge, but in terms of concrete expertise we can at best become awkward apprentices to specific, local practitioners.Rather than approach indigenous knowledge as another 'resource' to be tapped, ecological anthropology might concentrate on the sociocultural contexts that allow ecologically sensitive knowledge systems to evolve and persist over time. There are reasons to believe that the best conditions for such local calibrations occur precisely when they are _not_ being subjected to attempts at encompassment by totalizing frameworks of one kind or another. In recognizing implicit and inextricable local meanings as the very stuff of ecological resilience, a critical inquiry into human ecology might begin to confront the agents of destruction by modifying its own ambition to encompass.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Power of the Machine: Global Inequalities of Economy, Technology, and Environment","review":"I'm basing my criticism on the extensive excerpts from the book in the review below mine (An outstanding book, January 9, 2002 By Michael S.

When he got older he realized that, in fact, a difficult to understand writer is simply a bad (or arrogant) writer. I think he demonstrated his point pretty well by conveying so much of his theories of relativity to lay persons in written form. If Einstein could do it, what is this author's excuse? He has none.The author of this particular book may, indeed, have some good, original ideas but what is indisputable is that THE AUTHOR OF THE BOOK IS FUNDAMENTALLY INCOMPETENT AS A WRITER.

It is a must for anyone studying modern Alaska Native history."},{"Title":"Mary McLean and the St. Patrick's Day Parade","review":"This is a story of a little girl who searches for a four leaf clover so she can be in the St. Patrick's Day Parade. The fantasy and excitement of a leprechaun appeals to my students. It lends very nicely to creative writing in the classroom. This is a must, especially for primary teachers."},{"Title":"Mary McLean and the St. Patrick's Day Parade","review":"It is 1849 and Mary Mclean and her family are fresh off the boat from Ireland. Mary is excited to hear about stories and traditions from Ireland that are told by other members of the Irish community where she lives. One of the things she gets told about is the St. Patrick's Day parade. Mary is excited about this and all the stuff that surrounding it. More than anything, she wants to be part of it so she asks Mr. Finnegan, a local shop owner, if she can ride on his cart in the parade with him. Mr. Finnegan agrees but only if Mary McLean can find a perfect shamrock. This is an almost impossible task because it is winter. Mary searches and searches and she can't find one. She finally stumbles across a leprechaun who says he'll give her one later. Months later, he is back the day before St. Patrick's Day. Mary captures him and asks for the promised shamrock. The leprechaun says he lost it and tricks Mary into turning away. Mary goes home dejected. Her father comes home with a surprise! He found a shamrock for her and Mary is able to be in the parade. She's very happy.This book is priceless. The artwork is fabulous and reminiscent of Norman Rockwell. The artwork is very engaging. Each page is laid out exactly the same. On the left side, there is the text. On the right side, there is a color illustration. The moral of the story seems to be that good things do happen to good people. This is a wonderful theme. It also seems to have a theme of good things happen to those who wait. This is something important to instill in children because so often they want things right now this very instant. The story line is entertaining and easy to follow. It is a wonderful book to read."},{"Title":"Mary McLean and the St. Patrick's Day Parade","review":"ISBN 059043702x - Once you get past Christmas, the holiday book choices tend to get very thin for kids, which makes the ones I do find all that much more enjoyable. St Patrick's Day was almost tailor made for children's stories.In 1849, after several years of failed crops in Ireland, Mr. McLean and his wife packed up their family and headed to America. Once there, they settled in New York, in an area with a lot of other Irish immigrants. Mary hears vague stories about what Mr. Finnegan does each year for the St. Patrick's Day parade and, when she asks for details, learns that he drives a cart pulled by two white horses and looks like an Irish hero. Mary would really like to ride in Mr. Finnegan's cart. When she asks him, Mr. Finnegan says it's possible - but she'll have to bring him a perfect shamrock... IF she can find one!There are a couple things about this book that, as an adult, bugged me. McLean, for one thing, is a Scottish name. Surely Steven Kroll, the author, could have come up with an Irish name for his Irish family! Also, despite coming to America from Ireland and living in an Irish neighborhood, the people in the book never discuss the meaning or celebration of St. Patrick's Day, which is - at the very least - a missed opportunity.Kroll's text is fairly simple, appropriate for the 6 to 9 age group that the book is for, according to the cover. The author also improves upon the book by including some actual, historical facts about Ireland, St. Patrick's Day and Saint Patrick, in the back. Illustrator Michael Dooling gets high praise from me. His images take up the entirety of every other page in this oversized book and that's a lot of canvas to fill. A majority of the illustrations are (Norman) Rockwellian, very simple and plain and perfect for the era the story is set in.- AnnaLovesBooks"},{"Title":"Trees of Wisconsin Field Guide (Our Nature Field Guides)","review":"Great, basic guide book for gaining a more acute sense of native trees in Wisconsin including many common, non-native species as well. 101 different trees are highlighted, 16 conifers and 85 deciduous. The book has a nice layout, ideal for quick reference use, with a good full page color photo for each tree. The trees are grouped according to their leaf type. Handy icons for these groups appear in the upper right-hand page corner and down by the page number. There is also, an icon made for visually understanding the mature tree size, comparing it to a 2-story house.Short profile text describes the characteristics of a tree's overall shape, height and appearance, needle/leaf, bark, flower, fruit, fall foliage, origin, average lifespan, habitat and region. Common names appear first at the top of the page with botanical names and family classification right underneath in smaller print. At the bottom of the page is a paragraph of Stan's Notes which feature the &quot;gee-wiz&quot; facts of interest, even if the plant is known to be edible or poisonous. This basic information layout is kept consistent throughout the book for each tree. What is not consistent are comments of when in bloom or with berry. A few, though not all trees listed have small insert photos to show fruit and flowers. All trees do have a small insert photo for identifying the bark.The book has a good introduction and a nice glossary that even gives a tree example for some terminology. Plus there is a checklist at the back. A nice sized, simple, easy reading handbook, kept comprehensible for the average, everyday nature nut. Recommendable as a first-time field guide."},{"Title":"Trees of Wisconsin Field Guide (Our Nature Field Guides)","review":"As my title says this book is pretty handy. Good clear pictures of leaves and bark for verifying the actual tree. Good small size too. Pretty happy with it."},{"Title":"Trees of Wisconsin Field Guide (Our Nature Field Guides)","review":"First of all, the picture on the website is misleading. The book is small--6\\" tall and 4.5\\" wide and 212 pages. It is only useful if you are going to go out into the wild and identify trees yourself. But, if you want to learn more about Wisconsin trees and just become smarter, more knowledgeable, and wiser this is not a good book. The book does not even include pictures of the trees, just close ups of the fruit, bark, and leaves--so you can see it is only for identifying trees when you are out in the wild but not for learning and becoming smarter. There is a paragraph at the bottom of the page about the trees, but the sentences are short snippits and really does not tell you much. What good does it do to memorize a bunch of numbers about a bunch of trees if you don't know the stories and significance of all the trees? I guess it would be good as a companion for a low price but I wouldn't pay much for it. I was fooled by the picture on amazon and some of the reviews. I thought it would be bigger and more informational and tell about the stories of the trees. I only find it useful as a companion, which is not very useful unless I'm out in the wild.Here is a website that is just as good as the book, if not better, and is free.[...]"},{"Title":"Trees of Wisconsin Field Guide (Our Nature Field Guides)","review":"My wife and I bought this book to help educate our kids more in the outdoors.

Lively is one of the best British writers still working today. YOu have to admire her gift for writing things simply--but writing them simply better than anyone else.This book is ostensibly about a religious painting in a small town in England, but what it really is is a reflection of the people who live there, the changes in their lives, and their own faith. Claire Paling, an agnostic, is the heroine who comes to understand not only the meaning of the painting, but the importance of faith in the lives of the people around her.You will not be able to put this book down, it's so well-written. Fortunately, it's a quick read."},{"Title":"Judgement Day","review":"Spoiler warning: I'm beginning to wonder if it's possible to review a Lively without spoilers - the last three books of hers I've read have saved something shocking for the last few pages.Lively always has something to say, in this case about this business of faith. As ever she uses her considerable skills to make her case, although she was perhaps gilding the lily a bit with setting up Martin and Sydney Porter for the biggest of falls: like those \`dead meat' characters you know are about to die - honest old cops about to retire; earnest young men showing the hero a picture of their sweetheart before going over the top. But, sure, what do you do with situations like that? Does meaningless disaster lead you to or from faith?On the way to yet another striking conclusion, Lively turns her analytical lens on a range of characters. Indeed, in one scene she takes us house by house up the street describing the activities and d&eacute;cor in each: you can just picture her standing on a street bending her imagination towards each of the windows. She's wonderfully precise, and whether or not the characters she imagines reflect reality, you get a crystal image of what she (or someone a lot like her, like Clare Paling) thinks of the people in her neighbourhood.I can't just run with Lively, despite openly admiring her skills and insight, because of her straw men. The most she can seem to raise for anyone who might disagree with her is pity (but she's not averse to contempt on occasion). She tries a bit harder with poor old George, making him a little sympathetic towards the end, but in making him the mouthpiece for faith she hardly sets her agnostic heroine a worthy adversary. I'm not saying clergymen like George don't exist, but I am saying some pretty articulate and sincere clergy do who aren't in the least threatened or surprised by the sorts of questions she raises. At best it's ignorance, she just hasn't met anyone with a strong faith whose belief is based on more than personality defects; but that's stretching the benefit of the doubt a long way. You could pick up on this in a dozen ways, but just one that's plain silly is this absurd juvenile hubris of presenting the only ones who really understand and appreciate the language and meaning of the bible are unbelieving literary dons who dig the Shakespearian vibe of the Authorised Version. For goodness sake, it's not as if the whole business of bible translation hasn't been kicked around a fair bit by a fair swathe of Christians who could actually tell you the difference between \`love' and \`charity' (and agape and philos and eros and the rest). It's an embarrassingly common weakness in a deal of self-righteous pagans who, after reading a couple of chapters (or, perhaps, verses) or even maybe doing a six month course, then talk from the greatest of condescending heights about how, say, St. John really believed in reincarnation (or wiccan, or homosexuality, or liberal theology, or skateboarding, or whatever suits your agenda) and dismiss those ignorant Christians who may have only been studying the thing for most of their lives, perhaps even picking up the odd PhD here and there, who keep banging on about those tired old themes of sin and redemption.Lively, however, rises above the pack when she turns her spotlight towards people she does have a right to talk about - people more like herself that she really knows and understands. Clare does seriously think about the issue, for example, of why she has this comfortable life while myriad others are born to disease and want. She genuinely tries to understand why she has such antipathy towards George, and articulates this powerfully:The trouble with people like me, one of the many troubles, is not so much that we've got all the answers as that we're incapable of suspending disbelief... We try to make sense of the world, and it doesn't make sense, so we take it out on all those other explanations that we find unsatisfactory. And we pile up guilt. Guilt for not having suffered, and guilt for being intemperate and uncharitable and ... guilt today because my child is alive and someone else's isn't.I'm not sure that so many of them have the empathy to feel such guilt.Lively can really take you to a place, a time, a person. She doesn't have it all worked out, and makes some of the gaffs I've raised above, but what she does have (and that's quite a lot), my goodness she can articulate it. She can be nasty and petty and didactic, but she can also take you into some really fascinating and challenging conversations. The novel suits her wonderfully - this stuff is far more gripping in the everyday (despite the signature sensational ending) than a thousand action novels that try to distract us from their empty idiocy with explosions and prurience (not saying that there isn't a place for escapist fiction too). The novel isn't just an excuse for speculative raves - Lively is good at structure as well and carries us along from start to finish with capably executed moves of scene, interaction and dialogue. I wish I could read a lot more books as well written as hers.I wonder whether she could have written the relatively humble final chapter of this book ten or fifteen years later - blame is clearly and entirely placed on others in her later Passing On (89) and Heat Wave (96), rather than shared in any way. Some become less certain and judgemental as they age, but others, and Lively it appears among them, become more sure and dismissive. It's an odd combination really, one minute Lively can bowl you over with her honesty and self knowledge, and the next with her \`A Current Affair' tabloid news style one-dimensional presentation of \`baddies'."},{"Title":"Why I Am a Christian Scientist","review":"The author, a Scotsman, was trained to be a minister in the Church of Scotland following the similar careers of his father and grandfather.

In so doing, she manages to recreate, in writing, the exact sensation of being happily lost for an indeterminate time amid the paths and bridges that comprise this amazing place."},{"Title":"Venice","review":"Cities like Rome and Bologna have been important centers for hundreds or, in Rome's case, thousands of years. Today they are active cities that not only attract tourists, but have modern industry and culture. Venice is the old bones of an imperial power. The palaces, churches and art that exists in Venice are the relics of Venice's past wealth and power. Today Venice exists as a cultural tourist attraction.In planning to visit Venice, I've worried that it is a sort of cultural Disneyland. A place that exists only for tourists.When I think about traveling somewhere, I hope that it will be a wonderful experience. So I try to learn as much about a place as possible. Travel essays provide at least one person's view of a place. Venice by James Morris is a rich account of Venice and its history. Reading the book, I felt that I could feel the city through Morris' perspective.James Morris was one of the early transexuals and became Jan Morris, the noted travel writer. Venice was originally written when Jan was James and she did not change the authorship with later editions. From reading the introduction, I think that this is because in Jan's view James really did write the book. This was an earlier avitar of Jan's and she wishes to honor his perspective.Jan Morris is a wonderful, lyrical writer. Reading her writing, I feel a bit like I'm walking the canals and experiencing Venice. Reading this book made me much more sure about my decision to visit these old bones of empire."},{"Title":"Venice","review":"\\"Venice\\" is one of those very, very rare books that forces you to slow down your reading so as not to miss a word. This is not a travel guide... Morris lived in Venice for years, and writes as only one with intimate knowledge of every alleyway of a city's body and soul can. The writing is astonishing in its consistency: every paragraph holds a richness of language and of imagery that is at times breathtaking, and the writer's imagination routinely transforms the mundane into glorious metaphor. Here are (quite literally) random paragraphs, these on Venice and tourism in summer:-------------\\"Confronted by these multitudes, in summer the character of Venice abruptly coarsens. The cost of a coffee leaps, if you are anywhere near St. Mark's, and is gradually reduced, in topographical gradations, as you take your custom farther from that avaricious fulcrum. The waiters of the Piazza brush up their brusquest manners, in preparation for the several hundred people each day who understandably believe that there must be some mistake in the bill. Souvenir stalls spring up like garish fungi, and the market is suddenly flooded with straw hats, gondoliers shirts, maps printed on head-scarves, lead gondolas, spurious antiques, a million water-colours and a thousand paper-weights in the shape of St. Mark's Campanile.The unsuspecting visitor, stepping from the steamboat, is accosted by a pair of ferocious porters, who carry his bags the fifteen-odd feet into his hotel lobby and demand, as their compulsory payment for this service, the price of a substantial meal, with wine. The withered sacristans of the famous churches, brushing the dust from their cassocks, emerge eagerly from the shadows to drag you to the very last dismal pseudo-Titian of the vestry. Pampered young men pester you to visit their showrooms. The cry of Gondola! Gondola! follows you like an improper suggestion down the quays. There is a queue for the lift to the top of the bell-tower. Enough people peer into the horrors of the dungeons each morning to make Casanova s head reel. There is a shop near St. Mark's so well adapted to every possible shift in the balance of power that the homesick tourist may buy himself the flag of Yemen, the Ukraine, Bolivia, or even the United Nations.And chanting a sing-song melody of triumph, the guides of Venice come into their own again. \\"Guides\\", wrote Augustus Hare in the 1890's, \\"are usually ignorant, vulgar and stupid in Venice, and all but the most hopelessly imbecile visitors will find them an intolerable nuisance\\" (though in later editions of his book he dropped the bit about the imbeciles). Nevertheless the guides of Venice flourish, the directors of itineraries boom, and many a poor holiday-maker staggers home at the end of a day's pleasure as though she has been grinding corn on a tread mill, or attending some crucial and excruciating viva voce. There are 107 churches in Venice, and nearly every tourist feels he has seen at least 200 of them: for the guides and guide books presuppose an unflagging whip-lash energy in their victims, an utter disregard for regular meals, and an insatiable appetite for art of all periods, standards and purposes.\\"-------------Or this, about Venetian cats:-------------\\"Venice is... a metropolis of cats. Now and again the sanitary authorities have conducted a cat-hunt, to sweep away vagrants and scavengers: but so fond are the Venetians of their cats, even the mangiest and scabbiest of them, that these drives have always ended in ignominious failure, and the animals, spitting and scratching, have been hidden away in back yards and boxes until the hygiene men have gone. The population of cats thus increases each year. Some lead an eerily sheltered existence, and are rarely allowed out of doors, only appearing occasionally, like nuns, upon confined and inaccessible balconies. Many more are only half-domesticated, and live on charity, in old drain-pipes from which sympathetic citizens have removed the grilles, under the seats of laid-up gondolas, or in the tangled recesses of overgrown gardens. You may see them any morning wolfing the indigestible entrails, fish-tails and heads, wrapped in newspapers, which householders have laid down for them: and on most winter afternoons an old lady arrives to feed the cats of the Royal Gardens, near St. Mark's, while a man in a sweeping overcoat so manipulates the flow of a nearby drinking fountain that a jet of water is projected into a declivity among the paving-stones, forming a cat's basin, or a cat-bath.\\"-------------Sigh. Morris packs more imagery and life into each paragraph than most writers manage in a chapter - or an entire book. This is the type of book that makes those of us with delusions about our own writing want to give up and go home. Confronted by such richness, the would-be writer stalls. The one or two clever and (he feels) well-constructed phrases which he has turned over in his mind to describe some event, thought or feeling, and polished to what he has seen with a quietly sheltered pride as a burnished luster, suddenly seem, in comparison to just about anything Morris has written in this wonderful book, dull and sadly wanting. Rather like a teenaged girl who privately primps and fusses over her appearance in front of her bedroom mirror for hours until, finally satisfying herself that she must be irresistible to men, steps out of her front door to rudely discover that the street is full of supermodels.\\"Venice\\" is one of the best books I have ever read, and I have never found a book that so completely captures the life and character of a great city as this does. For those who love language - and Venice - it is pure pleasure from start to finish.Quick biographical note: Jan Morris was formerly James Morris - s/he underwent a sex change in 1964 (which explained the perplexing fact that I couldn't find any first editions under the author's female name)."},{"Title":"Venice","review":"The first time I read this book was after my first visit to Venice, sixteen years ago. I was fascinated by the virtuosity of the text but when the book was nearing it's end I've realized that the feeling I get now and then is not of elation but of a mild irritation. The tone the author chose is perfectly suitable for an essay, but at the longer run was beginning to feel a bit one note and repetitive, Morris hops from one theme to another looking to me less a virtuoso and more off an eccentric and even - forgive me for that blashemphy - a scatterbrain.But in 1996 I just thought that the reason for that exhaustion lies in my lack of true interest in Venice, it's not potent enough to carry me happily from the first page to the last.Since then I've read Norwich, Ackroyd, Tiziano Scarpa, Frederic Lane, Christopher Hibbert and others, last of all a very compilative and uninspired book of Paul Strathern, after which I've decided to revisit the work that had started me on this trip of learning - hopefully, as an antidote to Strathern.Finished rereading it couple days ago and have to admit I was getting irritated after first two thirds of the Morris' book - just like before. Author's relentless showing off, all these lists of different lions, all the chattering, hopping, making noises, not giving up on all this when you are already in the third hundred of pages made me realize my first impression was probably right, and it's not my faltering interest that I have to blame for failing to appreciate the style and substance of the classic."},{"Title":"Venice","review":"I recently bought this book for an upcoming trip I have to Venice.

What a gem...Any sexual abuse survivor can relate to this true, honest, and in many ways, universal story of one boy's experience of incest. Through the voice of &quot;Bobby&quot;, the author honestly and frankly takes the reader into the mind of a child experiencing the &quot;unthinkable&quot; and frequently &quot;unspeakable&quot; horror of incest. The reader can &quot;feel&quot; the insidious destruction of Bobby's heart, soul, and humanity, as well as the sense of helplessness and loneliness he feels, as his parents secretly and systematically terrorize him. The fact that no one believes Bobby leads him into a even deeper sense of despair.Weinstein's story does not overwhelm the reader with an overabundance of unnecessary details. He is able to powerfully and realistically convey the essence of the effects of the far too common terrorization of children by those whom supposedly &quot;love&quot; them (and whom they should be able to trust). The author also describes the inevitable heart, soul and mind destruction that results. Bobby is incredulous that no one will believe him or help him (a sane child in an insane world).This book clearly and succintly protrays the inhumanity, cruelty, and &quot;evilness&quot; of the perpetrators, the retraumatization of the child by society's collective denial and long-standing &quot;blaming the victim&quot; mentality, and the intensely, long, and often agonizing, process of recovery.The author also touches on, by the nature of Bobby's gender, how child abuse of boys is not unusual and probably far more common that expected. Any child is a potential victim. Any person could be a potential perpetrator. Perpetrators can not be identified by their &quot;public appearance&quot; or persona. In fact, perpetators are often people who &quot;appear&quot; to be &quot;fine, up-standing&quot; members of society.Most importantly, without being preachy, Weinstein courageously asserts that we, as individuals and as a society, must stop this rampant epidemic of child sexual abuse. He tells us to encourage children to TELL THEIR SECRETS, listen to them and believe them when they tell, protect them from further abuse, and make sure the perpetrators face appropriate and sufficient consequences for their actions.He also touches on how ill-equipped we are, as a society, to help these most precious victims. Resources regarding incest are surprisingly sparse and difficult to come by. This book is a gift for which I am grateful to have &quot;stumbled upon.&quot; I hope that many, many people purchase this gem, read it, and pass the word on to others."},{"Title":"Bobby and His Cat","review":"I had no expectations reading this book-It was a well written, articulate, courageous form of artistic self expression...When I read Bobby &amp; his cat for the first time, I did not know the author, who he was, or what had happened during his childhood...

When I read Bobby &amp; his cat a second time, I truly understood pain &amp; how it relates to each one of us- no matter what path we have traveled.Rob Weinstein writes a childs story For Adults...

It somehow took on the reality of how horrible our childhoods were.Rob is the bravest survivor I know. It's about time someone told &quot;our&quot; story in the truest form.

The are so few books which can display the complexity of what a child experiences the way this author has.

I felt like I was at once 'there' in that little boy's soul and also fighting with heart of lion as the adult pushed through to the other side. That anyone should go through this is heartbreaking, but to overcome it with such poetry, bravery and beauty is a testament to the human spirit and encouragement to anyone dealing with childhood wounds..."},{"Title":"Bobby and His Cat","review":"One of the scariest and harrowing true accounts of a childhood one could ever imagine. Rob Weinstein's childhood is a cavern of darkness filled with devils performing acts of unspeakable terror. This is an astounding journey of a little boy living in the midst of monsters -- his mother and father! In your worst imaginings, you could not conjure what this little boy endured, for years!The writing is elegant and spartan, just enough to convey what it was like. But really, who could possibly know what it was really like except for, Rob Weinstein. Reading, &quot;Bobby &amp; His Cat&quot; is harrowing. My admiration for Rob Weinstein abounds. How a human not only survives such travails, but works to heal others is extraordinary!Rob Weinstein's light douses the bonfire of real demons. To think that Rob Weinstein has travelled from a place so deep in hell to a life that can shed light for others is a spectacular triumph of the soul."},{"Title":"Periodontology (Color Atlas of Dental Medicine)","review":"This is an outstanding atlas for gp's with an interest in periodontics and grads starting a perio program.

Furthermore it is a good and guiding resource for planning lectures for dental audiences."},{"Title":"The New Oxford Annotated Bible With the Apocrypha, Expanded Edition, Revised Standard Version: An Ecumenical Study Bible","review":"When I was in theological school this edition ofthe New Oxford Annotated Bible (NOAB) was requiredfor many classes. I used it and my Holman StudyBible (RSV) each day during and after class. Ikept the same notes in each bible.I still believe that this edition is better forChristians to use in their study of the Scriptures.The 3rd edition of the NOAB departs from a Christianunderstanding of the OT and uses the NRSV text. TheNRSV is a good translation, but is not literal enoughfor close study of a text. It is overly inclusive too.This edition of the NOAB uses the RSV, which remains oneof the best translations of the English Bible everpublished. The notes are good, but better in the NT thanin the OT. It has fairly good cross-references. The_Harper Study Bible_ in the RSV has much better cross-references.If you can find a copy of that study bible in the RSVit would also be a good addition to your library. Cambridgestill publishes it as an RSV study bible.Again, the NOAB in the RSV is a very, very good study bible.The font size is great. I recently had my hardback editioncovered in genuine burgundy leather. I'll never be withoutit!"},{"Title":"The New Oxford Annotated Bible With the Apocrypha, Expanded Edition, Revised Standard Version: An Ecumenical Study Bible","review":"(I purchased ISBN:019528335X)Overall, I'm quite pleased with this printing. I'm very happy to finally have an RSV with the Apocrypha. The annotations and section/book introductions are great. It also includes a VERY well-done intro to the Apocrypha. The binding is sewn and flexible--a big plus. The paper is quality and the paragraph-style page layout is great.I have a few peeves, however. The genuine leather is acceptable but a bit stiff, I'd say. Jesus' words are NOT red, granted it wasn't advertised as such. Oxford has very oddly placed all of the Apocrypha and it's indroductory notes at the very end of the book, past the end notes that proceed Revelation. They just kind of slapped the Apocryphal section between the extra blank note pages and the maps. Why they didn't place it between the Old and New Testaments is a mystery to me but that's Oxford for ya! Well, as long as it's got the Apocrypha and all those great notes, I'm happy."},{"Title":"The New Oxford Annotated Bible With the Apocrypha, Expanded Edition, Revised Standard Version: An Ecumenical Study Bible","review":"I discovered this edition in my bible study class. I was impressed with the scholarly depth of the notes. I also greatly appreciate that it contains deuterocanonical books not only from the Roman Catholic tradition, but also four books important to Eastern Orthodox churches: Prayer of Manasseh, 3 and 4 Maccabees, Psalm 151.I am interested in hearing from others who compare this version with the NRSV version. This version was last updated in 1977. Given that biblical scholarship has developed further, I would suggest that if you use this edition you also get the New Jerome Biblical Commentary, or alternatively the New Oxford Annotated Bible with the Apocrypha, NRSV."},{"Title":"The New Oxford Annotated Bible With the Apocrypha, Expanded Edition, Revised Standard Version: An Ecumenical Study Bible","review":"The RSV is getting harder to find, especially in a study edition. This one is from Oxford and is a nice addition to your study bible collection. I truly appreciate the RSV translation, and this bible presents it in clear, sharp print and decent paper. Oxford bibles seem to be of higher quality than most, and this one is no exception. The binding is strong and sturdy. This one is available in both the Protestant version without the Apocrypha, and one with the Apocrypha. These books are in the back of the bible after the New Testament. There is also a history of the bible section and some other interesting articles right before the Apocryphal section.The notes are somewhat liberal, although not as bad as some of the NRSV study bibles from Oxford. I do get some good things from the notes and can ignore the ones I don't agree with. I would recommend this book to RSV readers."},{"Title":"The New Oxford Annotated Bible With the Apocrypha, Expanded Edition, Revised Standard Version: An Ecumenical Study Bible","review":"This is the best bible for study purposes, and most of the commentary is based on sound historical and archaeological sources. For those who are not religious, this is an especially nice feature - it's essentially a secular explanation of various linguistic, social, and meanings that are not clear by reading them in English.I recommend this not just for the excellent footnotes, but because the RSV (Revised Standard Version) of the Bible is an excellent compromise between the King James Version (which is as difficult to read as Shakespeare) and the NIV, in which the English is so modern that it loses much of the poetic qualities of the KJV. This version preserves the beauty of the language of the KJV while still being easily understood by modern English readers."},{"Title":"The New Oxford Annotated Bible With the Apocrypha, Expanded Edition, Revised Standard Version: An Ecumenical Study Bible","review":"As an Eastern Orthodox Christian looking for a Bible for personal reading, I pored over a number of versions before settling on this one. If you're Orthodox, it's hard to find a Bible with all the books. This one has all the books, even to the point of including 4 Maccabees, which (as I understand it) is on somewhat shaky ground even among the Orthodox.So this isn't a bad choice, I suppose. Unfortunately, it relegates the Apocrypha to the end, after the New Testament. A more appropriate place would be between the Old and New Testaments, since that's the time period during which many of the books of the Apocrypha were written.Also, the Old Testament included is the standard Masoretic Text corrected from other sources. But the Orthodox canonical Old Testament is the Septuagint (LXX).So it's not really an Orthodox Bible. Nonetheless, it's a better choice than, say, the NIV, and for personal reading it's probably the best option until a real Orthodox Bible comes out in English.Also, I had the impression that the RSV was written in stilted English not far different from the KJV. It turns out that's not the case at all. The RSV translation uses some archaic forms in address to God (\\"Hallowed be Thy name\\" and all that), but otherwise it's in perfectly modern, and quite readable, English. The typeface is easy to read, too.And whatever you make of the various source theories and such, there's no doubt that the annotations enhance the reading experience, drawing things out of the text that you might not have noticed (for instance, the nature of the changes made in 1-2 Chronicles to the original source material in 1-2 Samuel and 1-2 Kings).So if you've concluded (as I have) that you're likely to die of old age before a genuine Orthodox Bible comes out in English, this is a good choice to use in the meantime."},{"Title":"The New Oxford Annotated Bible With the Apocrypha, Expanded Edition, Revised Standard Version: An Ecumenical Study Bible","review":"Many reviewers (particularly the more conservative Catholics) think this version of the Bible, the RSV, is the cat's meow. While I entirely sympathize with them in theory, I found this particular edition to be a bit of a pain to read, for several reasons.First is the sporadic retention of archaic language - far too many thy's, thou's, art's, hast's, thereof's and givesth's for my taste, which run toward simpler and more modern English. Next, particular to the Oxford Edition, there is the dense text, unbroken by chapter separations, outlines, paragraph headings, or maps. In short, no breaks means monotony and boredom, a rather bad thing for a Bible translation to have. Then there is the problem of proper nouns - Ja'besh-gil'ead, E'zion-ge'ber, Al'mon-diblatha'im, etc. This is useful but a bit of an annoyance, and easily could have been separated into its own section of proper names. The Apocrypha section is segregated at the end of the book, which again is fine, except that some of this apocrypha is simply chapters left out of other books, which means a lot of cross-referencing. I did apprediate the addition of 3 & 4 Mannabees, 1 & 2 Esdras, & the Prayer of Manasseh, but wonder what about the Book of Enoch, which was quoted in the Epistle of Jude? Finally, the maps are excellent and in full color, but are so close to the binding that the inner inch is unusable - a minor but annoying inconvenience.On the other hand, the RSV retains much of the magnificent language of the old King James Version. And unlike the NRSV, this version came before the days of inclusive language, which annoys me. The scholarship in the footnotes and in the short chapters at the end of the Protestant Bible (before the Apocrypha) is first-rate, although I often disagree with the authors. In short, it is definitely a great reference Bible, just nor much of a reading Bible."},{"Title":"The New Oxford Annotated Bible With the Apocrypha, Expanded Edition, Revised Standard Version: An Ecumenical Study Bible","review":"This Bible has a lot of content that is a little hard to come across, and to me, that is what makes it so interesting and worthwhile. First of all, the \\"Revised Standard Version\\" has been, for the most part, abandoned in favor of the newer \\"New Revised Standard Version.\\" However, this older version definitely has its own merits. As I understand it, it is the only version of the Bible to be accepted for personal and liturgical use by both the Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church. Though I am part of neither of these faith traditions, it is interesting to know that you are referencing a bible that ALL Christians can respect, no matter what faith tradition they associate themselves with. It also contains the Apocrypha, so it has all the books that are canonical, even those that are controversial in some branches of Christianity. Nice print, good introduction to every book in the Bible, and solid, beautiful binding. Great Bible."},{"Title":"The New Oxford Annotated Bible With the Apocrypha, Expanded Edition, Revised Standard Version: An Ecumenical Study Bible","review":"This ecumenical study Bible using the RSV text still sets the standard for high scholarship in the notes and accuracy of translation. The editors and contributors are among the greatest biblical scholars of the last fifty years. While the NRSV has updated to gender inclusive language, the RSV idiom still retains the poetic flow that made it an English language favorite. The format is far more user friendly and portable in comparison to the later Oxford Annotated Bibles using the NRSV. Another plus is the inclusion of the Apocrypha at the end of the New Testament instead of following the Hebrew Bible. The typeset is very readable, and the overall workmanship of this hardcover is outstanding. Put this one on your shelf."},{"Title":"The New Oxford Annotated Bible With the Apocrypha, Expanded Edition, Revised Standard Version: An Ecumenical Study Bible","review":"In response to Stephen from Venice, the two Bibles I use for the bulk of my Bible study and reading are this one, and the NOAB NRSV (third edition). Unlike many, I'm generally indifferent to the NRSV's use of inclusive language, though it does sometimes get in the way. What I mind more about the NRSV is that it is too \\"modern\\" sounding. Stylistically, I prefer the RSV for meditative reading and liturgical use. There are some areas where I find the NRSV has improved the beauty of some passages, though for the most part, I prefer the classic beauty of the RSV, which is just modern enough, while still sounding \\"biblical.\\" With the NRSV, I miss the use of the \\"thee/thou\\" language when the author is addressing God... (present in the RSV). The preface to the NRSV dismisses this as something that wasn't done in the Hebrew or Greek texts... however, I think it's so ingrained in English biblical tradition, that a lot is lost. That being said I do trust the NRSV for accuracy, and the annotations in the NOAB are really top-notch and more complete for serious Bible study than this Bible. Also, for all my dissing, I like the NRSV stylistically as modern translations go (as opposed to, say, the NIV).As a result, I use both the RSV and the NRSV and find, in that elusive quest for the \\"perfect\\" Bible translation, that perhaps a translation that has the best aspects of both the RSV and the NRSV would be tops (with the KJV of Psalm 23 thrown in for good measure -- I mean, why mess with that?).The quality of this particular Bible was, as has been the case for me with Oxford, absolutely superb, and while the annotations are more brief than the NRSV counterpart, they are helpful and enlightened and, well, trustworthy.

The NRSV tends to render sexist language in gender-neutral translation, whereas I prefer readers understand exactly how flawed the original actually is. It helps to dispel the notion of the \\"inerrant word of God.\\" I don't mean to suggest the RSV is perfect; in fact, there are quite a few problems with it. For example, it archaizes more recent concepts into ancient texts and cultures in rendering 1 Cor. 6:9 and 1 Tim. 1:10. It also attempts to \\"modernize\\" Paul's view of slavery in 1 Cor. 7:21; the Greek is actually quite clear and presents Paul at his most characteristically reprehensible and extreme. Every translation will have problems, regardless what text is being translated. However, some previous reviewers don't seem to have the firmest grasp of ancient Greek when discussing Is. 7:14. The Greek of the Septuagint is \\"parthenos,\\" which primarily means \\"maiden\\" or \\"young woman\\" or \\"girl.\\" Since all of these are supposed to be virgins, the term can also acquire that meaning. This is nothing new to those versed in ancient Greek; just check the LSJ, the standard ancient Greek lexicon in English. So \\"young woman\\" is just as good in translating the original Hebrew as in translating the later Greek translation of the Septuagint. Jews reading the Septuagint would also have originally understood \\"young woman\\" rather than the much more restrictive and Christian \\"virgin.\\" As for the various sorts of notes, nothing at this level can now compare with the 3rd ed. of the NOAB, NRSV version--at least not at a properly scholarly level, which is my primary interest. Uniquely Christian interpretations of the Jewish scriptures are simply NOT the originally intended meanings of the human authors of those texts--PERIOD. To speak of any \\"deeper\\" or \\"truer\\" meaning is to speak as an exponent of a particular religion, which is a point of view irrelevant to the scholarly task in view in the NOAB editions."},{"Title":"The New Oxford Annotated Bible With the Apocrypha, Expanded Edition, Revised Standard Version: An Ecumenical Study Bible","review":"I was really disappointed in this hardcover version.

IT is very important to consult an evagelical opinion at the same time, not to embrace that view necessarily but to get a well rounded view of the opinion. Another interesting aspect is the articles at the end, &quot;How to read the Scriptures with understanding.&quot; This is without doubt the most beautiful essay on Bible Reading. However, these men openly doubt the historicity of the sacred text. Whether they are right or wrong, they very eagerly embrace higher critical views that can be dangerous if they are abused.

That was over 30 years ago. Although I've had a lot of other study Bibles in various translations since then, this edition is what I now use. The notes reflect reliable, mainstream, scholarship. Without being overtly exclusive, they also tend to provide a more overtly traditional Christian perspective than the successor editions with the NRSV text. As someone else wrote, at times they even have a devotional quality. While its certainly more profitable for publishers to continually push out new editions, the question always arises as to whether they really add that much more value. As for the translation, given that it's only slightly older than I am, the RSV has held up remarkably well as both an accurate and readable version. It's no wonder major churches that have been around for more than a millennium continue to stick with it rather than \\"upgrade\\" to another every few years."},{"Title":"The New Oxford Annotated Bible With the Apocrypha, Expanded Edition, Revised Standard Version: An Ecumenical Study Bible","review":"The New Oxford Annotated Bible (with the Apocrypha) is my favorite translation coupled with the highest quality study notes of any of the study bibles I am familiar with.

This copy of Holy Scripture contains all the books generally found in the Septuagint (LXX) Old Testament. This translation respects the traditional language, and usage of language, that is sadly lost with the earnest attempts of the NRSV to be \\"gender inclusive\\", but creates confusion rather than inclusiveness. The RSV is written with the scholar and student in mind, not the agenda (sincere as it is) that actually detracts from the later NRSV.

I have purchased many bibles in the past, and this one is exceptionally well made. The binding is strong, the hard cover is durable, the pages are easy to read and strong. It also comes with the apocrypha (which is put in the back of the new testament). It is good to note that The Revised Standard is not easy to come by in our current place in history. That is why I believe that this translation, along with the durability of this edition make this a solid purchase. Of course this is all just my humble opinion.There are notes in this bible, and as I mentioned before I did not purchase this bible as a study bible. However, since many colleges use the Oxford (in various translations) as a class reference I feel it is important to note a few things. 1) The approach of the professors seems to be from a secular perspective. One passage noted that they believed that a diciple of Peter's originally wrote one of the gospels. These views may not sit well with some. 2) There are maps, historical data, and indroductions to each book (again you have to take the authors approach into consideration).In the end this is a fine translation, well bound and sturdy book that should provide you a lifetime of use under normal conditions. However, I can't bring enough emphasis to the fact that I did not purchase this for it's notes or as a study bible. Secular colleges love to use Oxford study bibles as reference for their classes (makes sense since the study notes are from a secular perspective). I would give this bible negative 5 stars as a study bible. I purchased the translation, and the quality of the book itself. I use E.W. Bullinger's Companion Bible as my study bible. Please don't use this this version of the RSV as a study bible."},{"Title":"The New Oxford Annotated Bible With the Apocrypha, Expanded Edition, Revised Standard Version: An Ecumenical Study Bible","review":"The Bible commentaries included here are written from a generally liberal theological perspective. The authors discount traditional teachings regarding how the Bible originated and was preserved in favor of more modern theories, which include late dating of the books and questionable authorship.

Not for the concept of this &quot;study Bible&quot;, which is in no way ecumenical, since all notes and introductions are liberal protestant and historistic. There is not one single Orthodox Holy Father mentioned in the notes!&quot; Furthermore an Orthodox Christian will find statements like &quot;This Gospel is anonymous&quot; in the intro to St Matthew, if not blasphemous, then at least very dubious - why do the editors think it's called the &quot;Gospel of St Matthew&quot;? Ever heard of the &quot;Gospel of St Anonymous&quot;? Broken off from Holy Tradition, the protestant editors fail to grasp the Spiritual layers of the Holy Scripture, and notes never spiritually rise above being &quot;historical&quot; spiced up with a few feeble moralistic comments inserted here and there. Not a trace of the Wisdom of St John Chrysostom. St. Ambrose, St Bede, or any other interpretations from the Holy Fathers, which are indispensable to the Orthodox. This example of heretic Bible &quot;study&quot; is *not* recommendable for Eastern Orthodox Christians!

There are no other primary distinctions in study Bibles, to be fair.And these notes... aren't that good. They are mostly partisan, \\"textual criticism\\" notes from a moderately-liberal perspective: introducing suggestions of evidence for late composition and disputable authorship. Though not radical or particularly offensive, I didn't care for them.Other notes are usually reminders of over-arching context (especially in the gospels), really of no more help than paragraph headings would have been. (This seemed to occur most often and most efficaciously in the Gospels.) Progressive enough for the Anglican readership of yesteryear, perhaps, but nothing special for your dollar today.Actually helpful notes, maybe three per cent of the total, briefly (VERY briefly!) gave the historical background of events and customs. These were too sparse or minimal to really be called ecumenical or beneficial by today's standards (if not altogether one-sided), but a good sight better than nothing.VERDICT: One can do worse, but if either textual criticism (evangelical or liberal; helpful or detrimental), historical scholarship, or cultural insight are priorities for your Bible study, go with the Access Bible instead. It's cheaper than dirt, but good quality and about 50/50 brilliant academic insight and heretical liberalism.Material quality of this product is really excellent. The paper in particular is excellent, and designed to last for a very long time.

We all know of the controversy around Isaiah 7 'and a young woman shall concieve.' We all know about the Kamma Johannian controversy in 1 John 5:7-9. We all know about the abreviated Lord's prayer controversy in Luke 11. But the NRSV introduces several new problems. For instance, they translate Ezekiel's devinely given title from &quot;Son of Man&quot; to &quot;mortal&quot;, because they though God was being a bit to gender biased when he called Ezekiel &quot;Son of Man.&quot; They also mess up a number of key messianic prophecies in Isaiah and Daniel with this sort of &quot;Gender Nutral&quot; translation.Personally, I think that sort of translation is just flat out stupid. If you want a good modern translation that has a pretty smooth flow and rythm to it, check out the NIV. It's a lot less liberal."},{"Title":"The New Oxford Annotated Bible With the Apocrypha, Expanded Edition, Revised Standard Version: An Ecumenical Study Bible","review":"The New Oxford Annotated Bible, RSV, with Apocrypha is an amazing work. It uses the accurate RSV translation, and includes the study notes of great scholars like Bruce Metzger and Herbert May. I found the essays at the end of the Bible helpful as well, especially in an Old Testament class. The RSV (and NRSV) also offers the entire apocrypha/deuterocanon accepted by major Christian churches, which will enhance study.This New Oxford Bible is slightly different than the NRSV version. Many of the notes are identical to those included in the NRSV version, or else they are very similar. The text itself is of course different. The RSV contains archaic language in the Psalms, and has no inclusive language, among other differences. The NRSV however, makes more use of the better texts, such as the Dead Sea Scrolls.Overall I would say this Bible is written from more of a Christian faith perspective than the NRSV counterpart. One example I noticed is in the Introduction to Isaiah in the RSV, where it mentions Jesus as the incarnate suffering servant. This is omitted in the NRSV, probably in a desire to make it more ecumenical among Non-Christian religions.Overall I think this is a great Bible to own. The scholarship is excellent and embraces Biblical Criticism, while coming from a perspective of faith. The translation is beautiful and readable. I am proud to include this is my collection of Bibles for both personal and academic use."},{"Title":"The New Oxford Annotated Bible With the Apocrypha, Expanded Edition, Revised Standard Version: An Ecumenical Study Bible","review":"I just wanted to make a note to all the reviews referring to this particular item as the NRSV.

Nice and traditional with excellent Orthodox notes."},{"Title":"The New Oxford Annotated Bible With the Apocrypha, Expanded Edition, Revised Standard Version: An Ecumenical Study Bible","review":"The New Oxford Annotated Bible, RSV with apocrypha is not called the Common Bible without reason. The RSV and Apocrypha is the only Bible translation that the Roman, Orthodox and most Protestant denominations have authorized for use. Although the RSV's successor, the New Revised Standard Version is allowed for personal study in the US Catholic Church, it is not authorized for use in the Liturgy. While the Canadian Catholic Church does use the NRSV in some of its lectionary readings, this is largely because they were prematurely printed and they will be replaced eventually. The Orthodox Church in America has rejected the use of the New RSV for liturgical use AND teaching the faith (such as bible studies within the parish) thought it is OK for personal study. So, as it stands, the RSV is the only translation that is officially used by Roman, Orthodox and most protestant churches. That's enough for me to use it, but it also helps that it is a great translation, though I echo a former commentators view about the translation of Isaiah 7:14, at least the RSV does not go so far as to irregularly use \\"mortal\\" for Son of Man (especially in Daniel) in the Old testament and not the New, or use \\"pale green horse\\" instead of the traditional pale horse in Revelation. So, I highly recommend the RSV with apocrypha as a great translation for anyone who likes a bible that is current in scholarship, reverent with language and ecumenical in use.[Update: when I wrote this review several years ago, it appeared that the Canadian Roman Catholic Church would be forced to replace their lectionary texts that used the NRSV. I understand now that a \\"modified\\" version has been approved by the Vatican.]"},{"Title":"The New Oxford Annotated Bible With the Apocrypha, Expanded Edition, Revised Standard Version: An Ecumenical Study Bible","review":"I bought this Bible recently as a replacement for my well-worn NIV study bible. I had come to enjoy the RSV after using it along with several other translations on my PC bible software -- it is written at a more advanced level than the NIV and seems to be closer to the original language while still remaining accessible to modern readers. This RSV is sturdy, easy to read, and has the benefit of a &quot;modern&quot; translation of the Apocrypha.I often find text notes, inline maps, etc. to be merely distracting rather than helpful, and often the notes included with a Bible are somewhat questionable in their merit. (My NIV study bible has more notes than text on many pages.) This RSV edition keeps the notes short, succint, and scholarly. The maps are all in the back along with some excellent scholarly articles. Kudos to the publishers and editors for such a clean, thoughtful layout.The only thing I'd change is that there's virtually no room in the text or in the margins for making notes. I use post-it notes stuck at the various places, but that's getting cumbersome."},{"Title":"The New Oxford Annotated Bible With the Apocrypha, Expanded Edition, Revised Standard Version: An Ecumenical Study Bible","review":"_The New Oxford Annotated Bible With the Apocrypha_ is the most complete canon of scripture currently availible. It includes the entire text of the Greek Septuagint, the version of the Old Testament quoted in the New Testament by the Evangelists, the Apostles and St. Paul of Tarsus. The Messianic passages in the origninal Hebrew texts became more intense with the translation of the Scriptures from Hebrew to the Greek circa 200 BC. Tradition holds that the Septuagint, known as the Book of Seventy, was translated from Hebrew to Greek by 70 elders in Alexandria over a period of 70 days. A somewhat obscure conflict in the history of the church has arised over the number of books contained in the Bible, and the Catholic, Orthodox and Protestant Old Testaments list different numbers of books as being canonical, or of Divine Inspiration. Martin Luther only accepted the books originally in Hebrew, which excluded ten &quot;Apocryphal&quot; books in the Roman Catholic Canon and which were known to the Catholics and Orthodox as &quot;deutero-canonical&quot; i.e. later added to the Canon and being of equal value to the Hebrew Scriptures. In many Bibles translated into English, such as the King James the Apocrypha was included, but in 1825 they were removed from publication along with the rest of the Bible. In this Bible, the RSV, the entire text of the Septuagint, including Luther's so called &quot;Apocryphal&quot; (&quot;hidden&quot;) books is here tranlated. Some books in the Septuagint never made it into the Western Latin Translation of the Vulgate, such III and IV Maccabees and Psalm 151. The names of the &quot;Apocryphal&quot; books are these: I and II Esdras, Tobit, Judith, Additions to the Book of Esther, Wisdom of Solomon, Wisdom of Jesus the Son of Sirach (aka Ecclesiasticus or &quot;Church Book&quot;), Baruch, Letter of Jeremiah, Prayer of Azariah and the Song of the Three Young Men, Susanna, Bel and the Dragon, Prayer of Manasseh, I, II, III and IV Maccabees and Psalm 151. The RSV translation is better than the NRSV (New Revised Standard Version) because of the NRSV's use of fabricated gender-inlcusive language and non-traditional renderings of the text. The RSV has the same problem, most notably in the controversy in the translation of Isiah 7:14 from Hebrew where the Hebrew reads &quot;young woman&quot; while the Greek reads &quot;virgin&quot; (the KJV followed the Greek translation). However the RSV is an older and more conservative translation. The notes accompanying the text may be good for historical context and ancient culture, but they offer little spiritual wealth, merely reflecting the PC views of modern academia. But the RSV's strength in this translation and this edition lies in that it is the only Bible given approval between the Orthodox, Catholic and mainline Protestant Churches."},{"Title":"The New Oxford Annotated Bible With the Apocrypha, Expanded Edition, Revised Standard Version: An Ecumenical Study Bible","review":"This volume is a joy to sit with and read. The sheer beauty of its supple black leather, gilded (gold) pages, two silken bookmarks and an elegant but very readable font makes this a wonderful bible.

It is a pure, unadultrated, and beautifully cadenced text with minimal notes, which are of a scholarly nature (alternate words, definitions, places, interesting facts: great stuff).

It contains the most extensive canon of Scripture as accepted in the Eastern Churches. The RSV is also the finest english translation of Scripture to date (unfortunately the NRSV is quirky in some places and makes excessive use of inclusive language). The introductions and notes are, for the most part useful, but do represent a slight liberal protestant bias (see for example the notes on John 6). Also, the DeuteroCanonical books are included in an appendix in the back and should be either placed between the two testaments or in canonical order. Nevertheless, this is the most ecumenical edition of the Bible available in a translation that is liturgically acceptable to Catholics, Protestants, and Orthodox. I would use this Bible along with the New Jerusalem Bible."},{"Title":"The New Oxford Annotated Bible With the Apocrypha, Expanded Edition, Revised Standard Version: An Ecumenical Study Bible","review":"The Oxford Annotated Study Bible is pretty much that - a study bible. The strengths of this SB are:1) Excellent introductions to the books of the Old and New Testaments, including full discussions of the issues over authorship and historical and social contexts2) Helpful essays on interpretation at the end3) Inclusion of the Apocrypha, with commentary4) A helpful concordance at the end.However, this Bible also has some faults. The commentary is rather dry, languid and uninspiring; often you feel the authors are as dusty and dry as this book would be after sitting in the Oxford Theology library for half a century or so. At other times, the commentary leaps to some obscure point which the commentators assume the student would know (not all of us are Oxford students!) while other important sections are only given a very cursory examination (for example, the purpose and ideas in the 'Law' books of the Pentateuch are not explained, and the notes on very important books like Ezekiel, Daniel, Revelation, etc do not really help much in interpretation). Some more clarity and liveliness in the exposition would certainly have helped make the Bible come more alive, which the NIV commentators seem to be able to do with such grace and elegance.If you are a fundamentalist or evangelical, this Bible is probably not for you, unless you want to get a more liberal viewpoint. I would recommend the NIV, which sticks to the principle of the Bible being the 'God-breathed, infallible word of God.' Evangelicals will like the allowance of historical and literary criticism without compromising the scriptures themselves, and fundamentalists will probably also like the refusal to depart to a more liberal agenda. If you are fairly liberal though like I am, this is a pretty good resource, the flaws in the commentary aside, though a good Bible dictionary and commentary (such as the New Interpreter's Bible Set, or the NIV Commentary) are also necessary resources in my view for any serious bible study.This is a pretty good investment for your money and a useful study bible to add to your collection."},{"Title":"The New Oxford Annotated Bible With the Apocrypha, Expanded Edition, Revised Standard Version: An Ecumenical Study Bible","review":"Of all of the available translations that I have had exposure to, this is by far the best.

Moreover its truly a bible in the original spirit of the word (bible originally means something like library or collection of books); So the RSV is as universal as any bible ever, since its found wide acceptance not only with mainline Protestants and Roman Catholics, but also with Orthodox Christians. And not only among the laity, but among Clergy and Scholars. And..for our Evangelical readers; indeed, the RSV is the parent tr of the popular ESV; I would say that the Greek Old Testament books more commonly refered to as Apocrypha or Deutro Canonical, would be a refreshing worthwhile treat to those not familiar with those valuable books, especially Sirach but also the other books, as one reads these its hard to imagine why some don't consider these books canonical. If its just a matter of these not being of Hebrew origin, I believe there's evidence of particularly Hebrew fragments partiuclarly for Sirach. The only thing I would say that doesn't appeal to me, is that these &#34;apocrypha&#34; are on a section on the back after the NT even the relevant essays and explanatory materials. It would have been fitting to put them in between the OT and NT. To me that would have made them seem more a part of the OT. In my mind these books are part of the Old Testament cannon. But oh well, nothing is perfect, so I consider that qualm as superficial..This handsome Oxford Edition is well made, the red binding is a nice conservative shade of red almost &#34;cardinal&#34; the pages are thin but durable. Its actually not bulky at all especially when one considers its a study bible. it's actually compact and i would say is the I phone 5 of bibles. it feels good to hold. the font is good, and will appeal too young or old or tired eyes. the pages even smell good, reminds me of Church and Candles! its a study bible but the Editors (most seem to be IV leaguers) don't wear their religious ideas on their sleeves, yet one does detect a hint of their christian faith and reverence. Importantly, the text is continuous without bold paragraph titles so its free flowing as i imagine the originals were..I don't like popular paragraph titles or section titles for 3 reasons 1) they seem to make you focus on a particular point or theme in that section and we may miss out on other equally insightful ones, 2)the poetry or story seems choppy or interrupted and 3) i think the ancient authors intended for the text to flow in most cases. its so refreshing like reading anew. The original RSV by Thomas Nelson shares this quality with this Oxford Edition.All in all happy with this Edition. One will never really need to buy another bible. It may not be ideal or perfect for all readers, some prefer more devotional bibles, some more scholarly, However, nothing in life ever perfectly fits our ideal, and this edition is full of benefits. and for the price here on Amazon, I would say its a bargain. I remember seeing these at the book store a few years ago for $50 to $60 dollars.

Here is how I came to that conclusion:In my zeal to buy a Bible the minute I became a born-again Christian, I rushed out and bought the brand-new Fourth Edition of the New Oxford Annotated Bible (NOAB), copyright 2010, in the New Revised Standard Version (NRSV) translation. As I understand it, the NRSV tries harder than any other translation not to offend anyone. \\"Men\\" becomes \\"persons,\\" etc. I took my Fourth Edition for a test drive at a Bible study class at my new, evangelical church and found that the Fourth Edition NOAB didn't read as well as the Bibles the other church members were using. I could compare how my NRSV translation sounded in comparison to theirs by silently reading the same chapter and verse that someone else was reading out loud from a different Bible.In the end, I decided to mail my politically-correct Fourth Edition NOAB to my best friend, who is just getting his toes wet in Christianity, and to purchase a copy of the older Second Edition NOAB, copyright 1977, that I'm reviewing here----the edition with the distinctive white cross against a black circle on the red cover. Another reason I like this 1977 NOAB is that the Old Testament is edited and introduced by Herbert G. May, who taught at the former Oberlin Graduate Theological Seminary. I graduated from Oberlin College, so the connection of this Bible with Herbert G. May and Oberlin is a strong drawing card for me.Speaking of cards, Oxford U. Press includes a How-To-Care-For-Your-Bible card with the NOAB, warning the reader not to insert church bulletins or any other paper bookmarks in the Bible because using such bookmarks could damage the \\"signature\\" of the sewn pages. I guess you are supposed to use a ribbon as a bookmark, but this NOAB does not come with any ribbons attached.My favorite Bible right now, however, is neither of the above; it's the paperback New American Standard Bible (NASB)New American Standard Bible Updated Edition, which is also available on Amazon. To make this paperback Bible last longer, I covered it with clear shelf paper that I bought at Walmart. Now I have a compact, durable Bible in the same NASV translation that my pastor uses. I carry it everywhere in my tote bag and read it whenever I'm stuck in a checkout line or waiting for a drawbridge to lower. Because this Bible is an inexpensive paperback, I don't have to worry about damaging the glued-together binding by using a paper bookmark. Even though this Bible is cheap, it is printed in nice, dark type that is easy to read in spite of the small font.If font size is an issue, you might prefer a larger-format version of the NASB. The larger-format version my pastor recommends is the Ryrie NASB Study BibleThe Ryrie NASB Study Bible Hardback- Red Letter with DVD.

Like any study bible, this one is also hefty but actually a little smaller than the NOAB NRSV 4th Edition (2010) making this NOAB-RSV (1982) just that bit less heavy and perfect for taking along.2. Main text I think is between 10 and 11 point while the notes perhaps 8-9 point. Clear enough for me without using my reading glasses.3. The leather feels luxurious and shiny, flexible yet just stiff enough to let me comfortably hold the book open with my left hand while turning the page with my right hand. I couldn't do this with my NOAB-4th Edition whose leather cover is so soft it just flops in my hand.5. Concise book introductions and study aid essays.6. As far as I have read, the notes and book intros have none of the high level biblical criticisms that challenge the authority and authenticity of the bible or parts of it that you might find in other study bibles.7. The notes read like they were really written by a believer. Concise yet meaty, they speak simply without pandering to any particular extreme views.8. This is the Revised Standard Version so none of those inclusive language issues to deal with.9. Expanded coverage of the Apocrypha which is located after the Old and New TestamentWhat I didn't like:There are signs of crease on some pages located near the middle of the book. But considering that the publication date as mentioned in the amazon product page was 1982, this book is still in pristine condition today, April 6, 2011! of course, the volume I ordered could be a much later reprint.Other stuff which I don't mind but might be an issue for others:1. No concordance2. No schedule of Mass (this is an ecumenical bible after all)3. No extensive graphs, timelines, and other illustrations found in other bibles.4. Words of our Lord in black, no red letter text here.5. The publishers put the cross references within the notes. This saves space and also puts the cross-references within the context of the notes.6. They also put the section headings in the notes, not on the main text.7. The book needs a little bit of gentle breaking-in to make it lay flat while open.Highly recommended! If you're thinking of getting the leather, I suggest that you don't hesitate. It's worth every penny you pay for it!Thank you Amazon and Oxford University Press for keeping the NOAB RSV with Apocrypha Expanded Edition still in print."},{"Title":"The New Oxford Annotated Bible With the Apocrypha, Expanded Edition, Revised Standard Version: An Ecumenical Study Bible","review":"The most recent edition of a book is not necessarily the best!

May), as well as to the first in the successive editions of of the \\"New Oxford Annotated Bible with the Apocrypha\\" with the New Revised Standard Version (is that perhaps just one too many occurences of the word \\"new\\" to maintain publishing seemliness and decorum?), which was the last edition that Metzger edited. Those which followed after that simply are not worth enough to have at all unless, perhaps, they are available priced considerably downwards! This is because Bruce Metzger, while somewhat Neo-Orthodox and/or moderately liberal-influenced in his theological views, was a genuine believer in the Protestant Christian faith (and an important, believing ecumenist), whereas the editors of this study Bible who have followed upon Metzger\`s demise are utterly modernist from top to toe (thus essentially unbelievers). The annotations in the later N.R.S.V. edtions, i.e. in those under the direction of Metzger\`s successors, too often became tiresomely tendentious and negative; there already had been rather too much of that kind of thing even when Metzger was editor, but, in the later N.R.S.V.-based editions after his time, refusal to accept the reliability of what Scripture itself asserts has come to prevail much too overwhelmingly.The R.S.V. is a Bible version rather superior to the N.R.S.V., so it is better to have Bruce Metzger\`s editing as he did it for the R.S.V. Also, unlike the first edition with its Apocrypha limited to what the Anglican Apocrypha includes (overlapping, of course, the more limited Catholic deuterocanon and with the Lutheran Apocrypha), the Apocrypha section in Metzger\`s second R.S.V. edition has has had the deuterocanon expanded (in 1973) to embrace all of the writings included alike in the Anglican Apocrypha, Catholic (and Lutheran) deuterocanon, and within what the Eastern Orthodox Churches consider to be the the full Old Testament canon of Holy Scripture. The \\"New Oxford Annotated Bible with Apocrypha\\" of 1973/1977, of course, incorporates the 1971 revision of the text of the R.S.V. New Testament.For those who may be wondering about the matter, the same edition trotted out slightly anew in 1977 amounts to what it already had been in 1973, except that some additional new introductory matter was added for the printings of and following upon 1977, namely and mainly (and unpaginated), a 1 pages-long \\"Foreword\\" and a brief, 3 pages-long feature titled \\"The Number and Sequence of the Books of the Bible\\" written by Metzger. Otherwise, the edition in its 1973 and 1977 manifestations is the same. Those who have the 1973 volume will have not real need of the edition in its 1977 form.This reader used this edition of the \\"New Oxford Annotated Bible with the Apocrypha\\" for many years (though having several of the others, they never seemed to be of anything near so much use), along with the Authorised \\"King James\\" Version (A.V.), the latter in various text and reference editions of it, for many years, until more soundly Confessionally Protestant or otherwise conservative study Bibles of exceptionally sound scholarship displaced the \\"New Oxford Annotated Bible with the Apocrypha\\", with the R.S.V. text, from favour, e.g., \\"The Lutheran Study Bible\\" with its companion volume, \\"The Apocrypha: the Lutheran Edition with Notes\\", both published in Saint Louis, Missouri by Concordia Publishing House, using the English Standard Version (which is superior both to the R.S.V. and to the N.R.S.V., though, of course, not to the A.V.), which looms forth imposingly among three currently favourite study Bibles of scholarly stature. The R.S.V. \\"Oxford Annotated Bible with the Apocrypha\\" retains its place on a believer\`s lower shelf somewhere or other, but it is not the most important study Bible to keep most closely to hand, however helpful it certainly can be on occasion."},{"Title":"The New Oxford Annotated Bible With the Apocrypha, Expanded Edition, Revised Standard Version: An Ecumenical Study Bible","review":"I have several Bibles and this one is - by far - my absolute favorite. The RSV translation is extremely accurate and contains no denominational bias. They stuck to translation accuracy over evangelical necessities. They maintain the beauty of the KJV and really only updated language, consulted more accurate manuscripts, and constructed a more modern literary flow. The study helps provide clarity on translation questions and background data rather than giving you someone else's interpretation of what is being said. The Bible can speak for itself, you do not need someone else's commentary to make sense of it (I am not a fan of \\"Study Bibles\\").

The RSV, IMO, and that of many others, is simply the best translation for everyday reading and study out there. It maintains the beauty of the DR and the KJV, while using more modern English, yet NOT bringing in the inclusive language nonsense of the NRSV.

Not worth buying."},{"Title":"Thanksgiving Night","review":"I enjoyed Richard Bausch's short stories immensely. He is a true master at capturing the moments of grace and humanity in true-to-life situations and presenting that slice of life within a short story.Sadly this does not translate well into a more prolonged form like this novel. There were many characters jostling to take centre stage in this book, and they look interesting enough to be expanded on, and the end result is dispersed bits and storylines that try to weave themselves together.There is the pair of eccentric old ladies who cannot live with or without the other, unaffectionately called the Crazies by one of the ladies' son, Will Butterfield, a bookstore owner who has a seemingly perfect marriage with school teacher Elizabeth at the beginning of the novel. Oliver Ward, a building contractor and his single-parent/police officer daughter Alison. Throw in a disillusioned priest who is an old friend of the old ladies, and Butterfield's discontented children from his previous marriage, a mysterious sexy new neighbor who tempts straight-laced Will, and you have the beginnings of a middle-class neighborhood soap opera about suburban discontent that culminate in some denouement in the Thanksgiving scene.The predictability of the plot is somewhat salvaged by the fine writing, and the descriptions of the neighborhood that sets the scene for each part of the novel (demarcated by the months leading up to Nov of 1999). The premise of the approaching catastrophic millennium is hinted at and then clumsily abandoned, which makes one feel Bausch shouldn't try to do a DeLillo.A pity, because this novel would have done well if they were short stories that examined the lives of some of these characters or showed a part of their lives. The whole, alas, is less than the sum of its parts for this novel."},{"Title":"Thanksgiving Night","review":"This book is well-written with memorable characters, if a bit long. The lead character, Will Butterfield, is a bit of a schlump, and none of the characters is 100% sympathetic. I did feel that the story moved along well, smoothly integrating a large cast of characters. The writing is way above average, very lyrical at times. It just seems to bog down a bit in the last third of the book, so it was something of a relief to finally get to the finish line."},{"Title":"Thanksgiving Night","review":"The novel is set in \\"Point Royal, Virginia\\" (is it modelled after Fort Royal?), which apparently is Bausch's stand-in for small-town America, or at least small towns in Eastern United States with relatively affluent and educated folks. It recounts the intertwined lives of a dozen or so of the town's residents over four months leading up to Thanksgiving 1999. The strength of the book is that the story is well told, often with gentle humor (although occasionally with awkward, flat humor). Indeed, in a way Bausch can be commended for making as much as he does -- a readable 400 pages -- out of such meager material. For the weakness of the book lies in the characters. Many of them are far more eccentric than the average small-town resident, several to the point of being bizarre, and except for two or three, they are neither credible nor particularly likeable. (Indeed, the central character, Will Butterfield, is downright pathetic.) Worse, for the most part their lives, thoughts, and preoccupations are too self-absorbed and vapid to be worth the reader's time or interest. Maybe the point is that that is small-town America, but it does not make for engaging or worthwhile literature."},{"Title":"Thanksgiving Night","review":"why doesn't anyone write good fiction anymore? why is everything I read pushing an anti-Catholic/anti-Christian,pro-socialist ,leftist agenda??

I have traveled throughout Sicily and Southern Italy - even to Corsica - and the tiny town of Montepuccio, the timeless setting for this novel, is so vividly portrayed, that reading about the place and its inhabitants brings back sights, sounds, even the heat and smells of lemons, olive oil, wildflowers, sage and the sea. I mention this first, because the author's extraordinary descriptions, luminous paintings with words, add so much texture and richness to the narrative, but tend to be overshadowed by the drama - the love, lust, crimes, sacrifices, idiosyncrasies and many secrets of the characters of \\"The House Of Scorta.\\"Beginning with a most serendipitous error in 1870, the House of Scorta was founded. A donkey and rider, male, enter the village during the scorching heat of summer. Tiny Montepuccio, \\"a small, white town, with houses huddled together on a high promontory overlooking the calm of the sea,\\" is silent in the burning sun - it's inhabitants resting after their midday meals.The man, Luciano Mascalzone, a bandit who makes his living on poaching, plundering and even highway robbery, is bent on revenge, muttering to himself, \\"If a single one of them tries to prevent me from passing, I'll crush him with my fist.\\" As he passes through the town, he notices that nothing has changed since he was last there. \\"Same lousy streets. Same filthy houses.\\" He dismounts in front of the Biscotti home and knocks at the door. A woman, about 40 years-old answers. He thinks she is more beautiful than when he last saw her, 15 years before. She is his obsession. He is determined to rape her if she resists. She does not resist. She smiles. In his passion, he whispers \\"Filomena.\\" He forgets all about vengeance in the sweetness of the moment.Although it didn't change the pleasure of their first and only union, the woman Luciano made love to - and he did make love to her - was not Filomena, but her sister, Immacolata. She had thought of Mascalzone from the time he unsuccessfully courted her sister, during the fifteen years he spent in jail, long after Filomena died. Immacolata's most memorable moment of happiness became the brief period when she and Luciano were together and she was, \\"for once in her life, a man's woman.\\" Luciano paid for fulfilling his fantasy - even if it was with the wrong woman - with his life. The villagers stoned him to death. Of this union between Mascalzone and the forty year-old virgin, a son was born.Rocco Scorta Mascalzone, the bastard son, is the village outcast. Immacolata, the only potential source of love for the small boy, died when he was born. A compassionate priest, Don Giorgio, takes the baby to San Giacondo, a neighboring village, to be raised by a fisherman and his wife. Rocco returns to the town of his birth as a wealthy man. \\"While his father had been a good-for-nothing scoundrel...Rocco was a genuine brigand.\\" His dreadful exploits are woefully detailed in the novel. Upon his return to Montepuccio, he marries a deaf-mute. She bears him three children: Domenico, Giuseppe, and Carmela. They too are ostracized by all Montepuccians, except for Don Giorgio, as had been their grandfather and father before them. Before his death, Rocco makes a terrible bequest, giving the townspeople a gift they cannot refuse and making his children paupers. He condemns Domenico, Giuseppe, and Carmela to life without rest. He only asks that all Scorta Mascalzones be buried like princes.\\"The House of Scorta\\" then, is the story of the Scorta Mascalzone family from 1870 to the present - their vows, struggles and secrets. And let me tell you, this family's motto could be, \\"If something comes easy, it is not worth it.\\" Everything must be done the hard way for the descendants of Luciano Mascalzone. And, in truth, theirs is a life without rest, befitting Rocco's curse. But, in truth, their hardships make a most fascinating and original story. And perhaps, at the conclusion, you might decide that they were not cursed at all.

He's an author who is extremely careful with words, they're well considered, and always on-point perfect to describe a scene or person. The very lack of verbosity renders his writing all the more compelling. Gaude has twice won the Concourt Prize, and once you find yourself in the spell of this story, you'll think, \\"Deservedly so.\\"\\"The House of Scorta\\" spans five generations of a Southern Italian family that labored, cheated, loved, stole, and survived. The story open in 1875 with the return of Luciano Mascalzone to the sleepy village of Montepuccio. He has spent the last 15 years in prison, years in which he dreamed of Filomena Biscotti. Now, he has come to \\"make her his own.\\" He knows that he will be killed for this, the townspeople will stone him. Yet he goes on until he reaches the door of the Biscotti home.Luciano's dreams of possessing Filomena seem to come true, but later as he lay dying in the street he learns that the woman who welcomed him was not Filomena but her younger sister. His visit resulted in the birth of a son, Rocco, and shortly thereafter the mother's death. Rocco is despised by the villagers, they want to put him to death. A kindly priest saves him by giving the boy to a fisherman and his wife. Upon reaching manhood he takes their name to become Rocco Scorta Mascalzone. He is a beast, attacking peasants in the fields, murdering burghers on the road, never forgetting that those in his home village would have killed him.He does not return to Montepuccio until he is a wealthy man, \\"When his reputation had been made and he ruled the whole region like a lord over his people.\\" Soon thereafter he marries a deaf mute who gives him three children, Domenico, Giuseppe, and Carmela. The children are ostracized by the other youngsters in the village save for Raffaele who becomes like a brother to them.In an amazing gesture Rocco gives all of his money, including the farm on which they live to the church. Thus, his children are impoverished. \\"They understood that a savage will had condemned them to poverty, and that this will was their father's.\\" The townspeople largely ignored the Scortas. \\"They were three hungry souls, a brigand's spawn.\\"How they managed to survive is related in the voice of Carmela as the narrative alternates between past and present, carrying readers along in prose so richly descriptive that one can feel the heat of the sun and taste the golden goodness of olive oil.\\"The House of Scorta\\" stands alone, remarkable for its radiant prose and sensitive yet unsentimental portraits of men and women seeking a place in the world.Highly recommended.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"The House of Scorta","review":"There's nothing like falling in love with a book and this summer I fell in love with \\"The House of Scorta.\\" I devoured it over a long hot weekend, which seemed fitting given the novel's setting in the dry, hot region of Puglia in the southeast of Italy as described in the first paragraph of the book:\\"The heat of the sun seemed to split the earth open. Not a breath of wind rustled the olive trees. Nothing moved. The scent of the hills had vanished. The rocks crackled with heat. August weighed down on the Gargano massif with the self-assurance of an overlord.

Impossible to believe that any animal or plant could have ever found sustenance under this arid sky.

Laurent Gaude, the book's French author whose wife is of Italian descent, paints an incredibly detailed picture of the complex social rules and interactions in southern Italian culture. Gaude captures the dark shadows, age-old rhythms and brutal realities of southern Italian life in a way I have rarely experienced in prose, except maybe for the classic \\"Christ Stopped at Eboli.\\"Throughout the twists and turns of the narrative, the themes of family, community, belonging, sacrifice, judgment and redemption are weaved together. Readers will gain an appreciation of the history of Italy, which was just a new country as the novel opens, and the prejudice that has long plagued the South.Originally published in French as La Soleil des Scorta, the book has won France's highest literary prize and sold over 400,000 copies in that country.

Cast out from the Italian village after his birth, Rocco Scorta Mascalzone holds only bitterness for Montepuccio, his mother's village. Rocco is \\"violent and insatiable\\", the only remaining member of the Scorta clan, who will come to be known for his thievery and repression of helpless travelers, building his family's fortune on the backs of the innocent who suffer the misfortune of crossing his path. His three children, Domenico, Giuseppe and Carmella are made paupers by their father's dictate. Consigning his fortune to the church after his death, the children are propelled into poverty, the villagers made rich by Rocco's posthumous gift, repaying the debt of his ill-gotten gains. The only caveat to his death bed bequest is that any Scorta's be buried like princes.After their father's death, the children leave the country for New York, their experience on Ellis Island never to be forgotten. Returning to Montepuccio, they find their mother has died; contrary to Rocco's contract with the priest, she has been buried in a pauper's grave. The homecoming is marred by this news, but the grown children are delighted to be reunited with their childhood friend, Raffaele, whom they embrace as one of the family. The four confront the new priest, who refuses to honor the agreement of his predecessor. Outraged, the Scorta's dig up their mother's remains that night; at least she may at least rest in a grave dug by her sons. Surprisingly the town backs the Scorta's instead of Don Carlos Bozzini: \\"The Scorta's are good-for-nothings, but they belong to us!\\" Throwing their energy into the survival and financial success of their line, all their efforts share that goal. The three remaining Scorta's, and Raffaele, marry, procreate children of their own and pass along family secrets, instilling pride in each new child that is born to them.A family line begun in infamy, the Scorta's, although secretive, have the most noble of motives, not adverse to a little black market smuggling. They are insular and protective of one another, understanding since childhood that this small village is capable of great cruelty, old superstitions and hot-headed judgments ingrained in daily life for centuries. Montepuccio is their home, their destiny. The House of Scorta is a piece of history, such villages no longer viable in a modern world, young people gone to the cities, the old waiting to die, the cemetery more familiar as loved ones join their ancestors. In a culture rapidly growing extinct, this intimate portrait reveals the passions, obsessions and immense appetite for life in a people who carve a living out of the land, feast on the bounty of the sea and their olive groves and give the evil eye to their enemies. In the southern Italian tradition, the Scorta's relish family, work and the meals they share, each generation adding to the family folklore.

While the reader observes changes in the village over time, paraticularly at the end when the village becomes a tourist destination, social history is not emphasized. Instead, there is an epic quality to the family's history. Some of this is due to the writing, but I was far less impressed by the writing than most of the other reviewers: at least in translation Gaude just does not have a great gift for the word or analogy or detail which startles and delights, it is rather ordinary stuff. The epic cast to the novel mainly arises from the loves, friendships, hatreds and determination of the family, and their penchant for the dramatic. Would I have awarded this book a prize? No. Still, it is good reading."},{"Title":"The Prince Must Die","review":"Finding oneself in modern day England, Gower Leconfield introduces us to a police inspector to rival TV's Inspector Frost with his down-to-earth street cop style and uncanny savvy in seeing beneath the surface. The Prince Must Die lays an interesting view of political awareness and introspection as the plot opens with the groundwork of disapproval for the monarchy's staid existence, especially the lackluster presence of Prince Charles. The view of many in the old philosophies hold that power is an illusion and the right illusion must be created.Tactics and intrigue working toward the assassination of Charles open a fascinating world that Miss Marple and Poirot would not recognize in an England where a break down of law and order coincides with developing racism and the cultural integration of immigrants. Men in posts of influence find concern at the mediocrity under Prince Charles and feel that the purpose of class divisions presupposed everyone belonged somewhere. This idea imbued a country with a civility making it unique on the world stage. Some in the old order of politicians also tout the belief that Thatcher and Blair did everything to undermine the national identity for the sake of the marketplace, thus allowing mystically British traditions to be tainted by new world approaches. Herein one discovers the land being transformed from one of \\"hope and glory\\" into a quagmire of despair and ridicule.As we view the citizenry of the country wishing to recapture the pride of being English, Leconfield explores the irresistible interest in lineage of heads of monarchy, comparable to the silver spoon elite in America. We are introduced to social changes in a police force integrating women on a large scale into positions of management and supervision as a counterbalance to the requirements of ascending the throne: Protestant, Church of England, and descendant in male line. In addition, the monarch is expected to be a role model and basis for emotional stability. Charles presents a man of contradictions in this realm with his adulterous affair with Camilla and the guilt he feels at knowing his mother must die before he can become king.The marvelous quality of the story centers on a Bavarian prince working as double agent and assassin with gender issues of sexual ambiguity, possible multiple personality disorder, and financial concerns who uses others without hesitation to achieve his connections. With the smooth integration of historical derivations we see the offset with a fierce English group of the past to a Bavarian oasis of calm and civilization. Today's scenario in the novel presses \\"the Prince,\\" Bavarian, into the position of ruthless German Intelligence agent for survival without the privilege of a dowry from the monarchy.Amid twists and surprises as the characters - both knowledgeable and unwitting - within the campaign against Prince Charles become manipulated and used, the reader discovers truths about men and women and their relationships. The struggle to be a man seems constant and ongoing and serves as a metaphor for surrender of the British to change. So we also find that women would not define existence through a man, but with passionate connection, a deep metaphysical meaning. Through quirks of code names and double meanings, the tale leads us back to the everyday man in the street and his place and pride in his country and heritage."},{"Title":"The Prince Must Die","review":"The author of this book uses a pseudonym. Given the controversial subjects and scenarios of The Prince Must Die, a hidden identity might be in his best interest. Wow! This one is a political thriller in the best British tradition, with a few dashes of good old American action and excitement thrown in for good measure. I don't very often say this, but it has MOVIE written all over it.A select few powerful, wealthy, and well-placed British subjects have devised a plot to rid themselves of Prince Charles. The glory days are over for the Realm, and the Crown, the British Pound, and the Church of England no longer stand for anything. Race riots, unwanted immigrants, and neo-Nazi influences are tainting their elite existence. In their minds, Prince Charles is a socialist who has forgotten the importance of position, so Prince William will make a far preferable King. Prince Charles must die to make room for William.The assination plot fails and must be revised. The group engineers the death of several citizens who threaten their secrecy. Detective Inspector Stanley West is on the case. He makes a dogged and determined adversary and a memorable character. Stanley loves being British and all that used to stand for. He misses the old Tory England, where fairness and decency prevailed and certain things were simply not done. Keeping a stiff upper lip is his mantra, and protecting the Royal Prince is his goal.Oh, these characters were very well drawn and believable. In addition to Inspector West, I particularly liked the privileged doctors, Michael and Monty Rogerson and the stunning, cross dressing accomplished bisexual Christian Von Oberman.Intrigue and double dealing MI5 and MI6 operatives abound as Stanley West attempts to solve the convoluted plot to kill his prince. Along the way we learn some fascinating bits of British history. The author keeps this plot moving at breakneck pace, and pulls it all together nicely.This is indeed the stuff good movies are made of. (Think the Bruce Willis and Richard Gere version of The Jackal.) Recommended for adult readers due to sexual content."},{"Title":"Standing Down Falling Up: Asperger's Syndrome from the Inside Out (Lucky Duck Books)","review":"This is one of the best books on Asperger's I have ever had the pleasure to read. The young author gives an excellent accounting for spectrum related behaviors and accompanying emotions. I just loved it when she described her outre wardrobe - her individuality and wonderful gift for expression is what makes this book so good.One of my favorite parts was when Nita Jackson said how it was hard being happy for the good fortune of others. While it is only natural to be glad things are going \\"terrifically well\\" for them, it IS difficult to keep envy at bay. That is an excellent point - it is taxing to keep seeing others get the breaks, bonuses and benefits one also hopes to receive. It makes me think of the 1964 Animals' classic, \\"It's My Life\\" where Eric Burden says, \\"it's a hard world to get a break in/all the good things have been taken.\\"I love this book. I really do. This is a book I wish I'd had all along and I can't recommend it highly enough. It is not only an excellent explanation of life with Asperger's Syndrome, which is a neurobiological condition that shares a place on the spectrum with autism, it is a wonderful teaching tool for the neurotypical population. If you have Asperger's, you will want to celebrate having it while and after you read this book. Kudos to Ms. Jackson for reiterating the point that the world and acceptance is for all and not just the neurotypical population. WE NEED THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Standing Down Falling Up: Asperger's Syndrome from the Inside Out (Lucky Duck Books)","review":"This book doesn't shy away from the horror that living with Asperger syndrome can sometimes be in some circumstances and situations. I found it brought back some uncomfortable memories for me, but that is not necessarily something to avoid. It is honest and frank, but warm and charming also. Nita is a very interesting character. I have seen her interviewed on local news, and she's not kidding when she describes the different accents she speaks with either."},{"Title":"True Blue: True Stories About Real Cops","review":"We all know that cops tell the best stories. Here is a collection of stories that are all true. They are written by a real street cop who has a unique talent for weaving stories that are sometimes serious, some times sad and many times funny. Anyone who has met the author, Ed. Nowicki, knows he has one hell of a sense of humor. In this collection of stories, Ed. as always, \\"tells it like it is.\\" Cops are known to be secretive, but this book reveals the true nature of the law enforcement officer who does not run away from danger but runs to the sound of the guns being fired. This book is entertaining, interesting and very humorous at times. In conclusion, if you like true police stories, you will love true blue. (Just a note: Ed. is also working on a new book with numerous cop stories)Rating 5 stars. Joseph J. Truncale (Author: Walking with Warriors: the best of the street warrior)"},{"Title":"Better Than I Ever Expected: Straight Talk About Sex After Sixty","review":"This book is not a sex manual but rather a warm and thoughtful guide for mature women of any age. Joan Price reminds us that sex begins in our minds and we need to accept that the changes time has brought to our bodies are not an ending but the beginning of a new way of life and love.We need to free ourselves from the popular cultural stereotypes and explore our own sexuality. Before we can cherish our lovers, we must cherish ourselves. Those of us who grew up in the '50's and early '60's may still carry and conform to an outdated sexual mindset: give it up! Bodies are made for fun, sex toys are made for fun, sexual exercises make for better fun! I expect to read this book many times and discover something new with each reading. I have recommended it to my sista's of all ages.Thank you Joan!"},{"Title":"Better Than I Ever Expected: Straight Talk About Sex After Sixty","review":"This is a wonderful book that's not just for women over 60. Yes, it's for them, but as a man who simply loves reading about people, this is a wonderful book of stories. These happen to be stories about \\"seasoned\\" women having sex and doing all the things everyone does when it comes to sex: thinking, wondering, worrying, and enjoying. I also read A Round-Heeled Woman and as much as I liked it, found this much more human, warm, and heartfelt. I recommend this book to anyone who even *knows* a woman!"},{"Title":"Better Than I Ever Expected: Straight Talk About Sex After Sixty","review":"Great book. I bought it after reading Seasoned Romance, and there were so many comments there about Joan Price's Better Than I Ever Expected and Naked at Any Age.These books are filled with heartwarming stories and inspiring information. It's realistic, but the info is also quite tantalizing and makes you want to experience the best sex for the rest of your life.I'm 76, and Grandpa and I are still going pretty strong. Books like this one keep inspiring us to enjoy the ride more and more.As I've mentioned in my comments somewhere else for another book, this book is for lovers of any age, and the best part is the knowledge that an active sex life can benefit your overall health and self-image. I mean, how cranky can Grandpa be when he's just had a good poke?"},{"Title":"Better Than I Ever Expected: Straight Talk About Sex After Sixty","review":"Have you ever noticed that look of incredulity when adults in their 30s and 40s discuss over-60 sexuality? Next time you witness this, slip them a copy of Joan Price's book! Not only does she debunk those myths (and snide comments) about post-menopausal women and sex, but she reminds us that we have the capacity, the tenderness, and the right to have it, ask for it, and enjoy it. I'm quite sure that no one in the States is a stronger advocate for sex after sixty...for life after sixty...than Joan Price. Imagine discussing Better Than I Ever Expected at your next book club gathering!"},{"Title":"Better Than I Ever Expected: Straight Talk About Sex After Sixty","review":"This book was a delightful surprise. I'd had the book recommended to me by a friend, as part of some research related to my career. I thought that perhaps as someone in her late 30's maybe I wouldn't get anything out of it. After all, I'd read other books on the same subject, and while they were often informative, they were not often engaging.This book changed all that. Joan writes as though you are talking to her over coffee. It's an approachable writing style that also incorporates the voices of other women as well as her partner. In my experience, the shared experiences of women - the kind of storytelling talk you get when you are chatting during dinner, for example - are a powerful method of illustrating a larger point. Joan is adept at relating the real-world experiences of women to the medical/philosophical issues surrounding sex for those over 60.There's also a great deal, however, that would appeal to almost all women. The passage on how to effectively do a Kegel? That's useful at any age. The essay by Ellen Barnard on suggestions for vaginal dryness/painful sex? Page 80. I know because I've photocopied it about a dozen times already. I haven't yet reached age 60, but this book has information that would be useful to those who are perimenopausal as well.Last but not least - this book is FUN. Think back to when you learned about menstruation; did you learn more from the film they showed in 5th grade health class, or did you learn more from talking with your girlfriends? For me, the film (woefully outdated by the time it got to us) gave me the mechanics. But it was talking about what was happening with the girls around me that helped me to articulate and place what I was going through in a larger context. The best books help you learn about yourself as much as you learn about the subject. Bravo, Joan!"},{"Title":"Better Than I Ever Expected: Straight Talk About Sex After Sixty","review":"Although I wouldn't call \\"sex after sixty\\" a subject in which I was formerly interested, I have to admit, I love this book! Joan uses her own history and experience as well as interviews to teach women over 60 that their sex life need not be over. More to the point she shows them \\"the way.\\" In detail. With honesty. And sensitivity. Quite a feat if you ask me.Sex is so important in every relationship (we all know this) and the over sixty crowd would be no exception. Sadly, though, there's not much out there for folks who face the challenges that some older women (and men) face who would like to continue a healthy sexual relationship. Joan debunks the myths, solves the mystery, and leads the way to a happy and successful sex life for as long as two people wish for it. Her exhaustive list of resources, tips, and helpful products are to die for!I found the preview of what might be waiting for me a bit disconcerting, but hey, I'm happy I now know how I can handle it. The best defense is a good offense, right? Further, I found myself thinking about all the older women I know - those who have lost spouses and who (gasp) desperately want a healthy sexual relationship. Joan's story is inspiring, helpful and most of all hopeful. This is a book that if you are around my age (ahem 35-45) you might want to share with your mom or mother-in-law and then ask her to hold on for you for later."},{"Title":"Better Than I Ever Expected: Straight Talk About Sex After Sixty","review":"I enjoyed the book. I have recommended this analogy of content to my friends. In fact I have read the book twice. This is a recommended read."},{"Title":"Better Than I Ever Expected: Straight Talk About Sex After Sixty","review":"This morning, I finished reading Better Than I Ever Expected and was telling a friend about it. She asked, \\"Do you recommend it?\\" Yes! Here's what I like about this book. I found the author's personal story, her joie de vivre, her direct facing of the realities of making love with an aging body both refreshing and inspiring. By interweaving her story through the various chapter topics and providing the comments of other women on those same topics ... from finding a lover to using sex toys ... we get to see how much company we have at this time of life. I met things in the words of these women that I have pondered or struggled with in my own life and realized that however unique we are and however different our life paths have been, we are all sisters under the skin with bodies going through the same changes. Very reassuring. And at this time in our cultural history when sex is so controversial and often under attack, it's wonderful to find books that see sex as a normal, healthy part of life ... something necessary for one's health and well-being, whatever form it takes for each of us.Which reminds me, I've also recently finished reading Being French! A Frenchman's Guide to a More Sensual Life (Kindle only), a book I absolutely adored for its humor, wisdom, the breadth of the topics covered and the inspiration it gave me to lead a more sensual life, and I have to say that Better Than I Ever Expected was a fine companion read.I would add, however, that the first part of the book is overall better written than the end, that sometimes the formatting in Kindle got a bit confusing ... with author narrative stopping and a new section of quotes or a side bar from another expert ... and then the narrative picking up again. My sense is that this is an issue with the Kindle edition and as the author intends to reissue the book, that should be cleared up in a later edition. Sometimes there was an extra space mid-word that was only a little distracting. Again, Kindle formatting.But those little things aside, this book is definitely worth it for the sweet love story Joan Price shares, for the way it gives voice and guidance to women embracing sex in later life, and for the the great collection of resources she assembles at the end of the book. I've already ordered a book she recommended. And I plan to take part in her next survey. (Details on that in the book.) And honestly, this is a book I wish I had had in my 40s. If you're younger than 60, don't hesitate to read it. You'll learn so much, and your after 60 sex life will be better for it."},{"Title":"Better Than I Ever Expected: Straight Talk About Sex After Sixty","review":"When we're younger, we often tend to take much for granted, and that's my downfall! Had I known that \\"use it or lose it\\" should have been tattooed on my forehead, I've have done things differently. In this valuable book, Joan shares life experiences of many, many women she's interviewed to gain insight into different perspectives, experiences, and goals. She has a website by the same name and in her own name. I count this as an invaluable resource - each page, each chapter opened my eyes to possibilities."},{"Title":"Better Than I Ever Expected: Straight Talk About Sex After Sixty","review":"I found some of this informative and some I already knew.

Nothing new and not even very interesting. Not recommended."},{"Title":"Better Than I Ever Expected: Straight Talk About Sex After Sixty","review":"Please save your money. This book was not written well, was not particularly entertaining or informative. It was a too personal look at the author's sex life. She mentioned her boyfriend, now fiance, is a private person. She certainly did not have any respect for him at all."},{"Title":"Better Than I Ever Expected: Straight Talk About Sex After Sixty","review":"If a person is very very liberal, this book may not be troublesome for that person. I tend to be conservative, so I did have trouble with this book. I was just about to turn 60 when I ordered this book. I was worried about my age, etc. I didn't need to worry about that, or anything else. Some experts say that late middle-age ends at 70 years old. Example: \\"Late Middle Age: (Ages 55 to 70). For other experts that age may be later on. This book did not help me. I feel that some of this book goes against God's will."},{"Title":"Better Than I Ever Expected: Straight Talk About Sex After Sixty","review":"I was very dissappointed in the content of this book. I would not recommend it to anayone."},{"Title":"Better Than I Ever Expected: Straight Talk About Sex After Sixty","review":"If you're trying to decide which of the new \\"sex over 60\\" books to buy, definitely choose this one. It is not a step-by-step \\"how to\\" book that might offend people, although it does cover every aspect of sexual activity--married, single, solo, gay, straight, young, old, one-night, long-term (50 years and even longer). Instead, the book provides practical, encouraging advice from experts and from ordinary women about the joys of loving relationships, dealing with sexual problems of menopause, loss of interest in sex (or your partner's loss of interest and/or ability), how to approach sex with a new partner, helpful exercises, and even a detailed discussion of sex toys and assistive devices. (I thought these were only for \`adventurous' couples, but the book explains how they can make sex possible and more enjoyable for older people).Plus, this book is also a beautiful love story which could stand on its own, even without all the excellent sex information. The writer chronicles her many relationships, from her first teenage romance (You'll be furious to learn how her father broke up what might have been a lasting relationship), to a succession of sexual affairs, including a short failed marriage. It's easy to see why she had given up on finding true love. But she never gave up on having an active, fulfilling life as a dance and exercise instructor, despite two devastating auto accidents that left her with many scars and lasting injuries.And then, magic! In the form of a trim, gray-haired, older man she spots in one of her dance classes. These are true-to-life 60-plus people, not wrinkle-free, gorgeous-body super models, but the story of how their love and sexual relationship blossomed is a real page turner. And be prepared for a few tears when you come to a troubling revelation near the end of the story.This is a thought-provoking, informative, encouraging book you'll definitely want to share with friends."},{"Title":"Better Than I Ever Expected: Straight Talk About Sex After Sixty","review":"Better Than I Ever Expected: Straight Talk About Sex After Sixty by Joan Price lives up to its title! Like sex itself, it is fascinating, fun, and educational: a how-to book for staying sexually active and enjoying it as we, men and women, mature.

It gives a variety of suggestions on how to surmount dryness, wrinkles, flaccidity, and the like, in order to continue exploring the frontiers of pleasure and intimacy. Wise and very respectful, Joan reminds us \\"Great sex is what's happening between two souls, two minds, two hearts--not just two bodies.\\" This book is a testimony to love and creativity.

One of the recurring criticisms of the book is that it paints a dishonest picture or too rosy a picture of Maria and the Trapp family (This book was written in the late 40's or early 50's.) Several reviewers mentioned the recent story on the TV series, Biography, which told what they felt was the &quot;real story.&quot; Well, it's a shame that the book, Maria, is now out of print. This book was published in 1972, and Maria is much more honest about her sad childhood, and she does not leave out many unflattering pictures of herself. She also tells about her time of atheism and how she came back to her faith. One part of the book details how &quot;blazing mad&quot; she was with God after she married the Baron, and felt that God had &quot;rejected&quot; her as His bride. In another part she details her deep guilt after her husband's death, since she felt that in many ways she had made his life miserable by her &quot;terrible temper&quot;--she makes it clear that the Captain was the quiet and gentle parent in the family, and also discusses how much she disliked the fact that the &quot;Sound of Music&quot; portrayed him as a stern disciplinarian. Maria also tells how much trouble she had letting go of &quot;control&quot; of the family business and how she feels she made mistakes as both a wife, mother, and grandmother. So, you see, Biography's &quot;expose&quot; really had to come, at least somewhat, from Maria's own words. The only reason I didn't give the book five stars is that, at times, the writing is a little hard follow in that it jumps around. However, I did get the feeling that Maria was talking and reminiscing, which is part of the reason for the &quot;jumpiness.&quot; Maria's earlier book was written in a different time when people didn't reveal as much about themselves as they do now. The later book is not a &quot;tell all&quot; but strikes a good balance in that I think Maria genuinely wanted to let people see her strengths and weaknesses and what God could do with such a flawed and imperfect individual."},{"Title":"Maria,","review":"The Sound of Music is a favorite movie.

It is simple. When her lips are not moving. In her first book, written in 1949, she tells of the time she met the Captain and the children for the first time. She describes a scene that is very similar to the scene in the play and in the movie. She even mentions that the Captain used a whistle to call the children.In this book, she states that the Captain was not at home when she arrived, and that Baroness Matilda introduced the children to her.Hoping that no one will notice her contradictory lies, she blames the producers of the play for (falsely) portraying her husband as a stern disciplinarian. Well, give me a break. It was her 1949 book, telling of the whistle, that gave them the idea. There is also a chapter in the 1949 book about &quot;the baron doesn't want it.&quot;So, she invents the story, and then blames us for believing it."},{"Title":"Notes of a Nude Model: & Other Pieces","review":"This book is beautifully written and full of basic truths about life, love, loss and the ways humans behave.

It fits within that pantheon of women of the Beat era like Joyce Johnson, HattieJones, etc. But it is something much more than that interms of &quot;woman power&quot;. Why not longer??? I'm sure drawing from her life experience that Harriet could do an extensive amazing chronicle of her life &amp; times in bohemia. I certainly wanted to hear more about her relationship with Alfred [Chester]--there's a lot more she could tell us. But I'm sure that Alfred is just one character among many others she could give insight into. As I mentioned previously to you: I find the 50s American ex-pat community in Europe fascinating material &amp; yet largely ignored... You get a taste of it in The Beat Hotel but those guys were almostinsulated from the action compared with some of the others who made the decade. &amp; Harriet is a real international bohemian! But let's not forget Harriet's own personal story.What an adventuress: a genuine personified spirit ofEros battling the forces of Thanatos! And she is astylist in her own right. I think that the title pieceis one of the best descriptive essays that I have ever read in terms of how it turns-the-tables &amp; gives us the perspective of the object-of-gaze as both observor&amp; participant.

And - in all fairness - Williams' book offers a number of hints that helped me to understand Deleuze's magnum opus. But that is really all this book has to offer: hints. As one reviewer pointed out, it can work to Williams' detriment that he insists on keeping a constant dialogue with analytical philosophy. I would go one step further and say that Williams' habit of repeating the same complaints which would-be analytical philosophers might raise, and always deferring any lucid answer to these questions, borders on tedium. This is not the only thing that is tedious about this work, as one quickly becomes aware after sampling just a bit of the prose. For instance, Williams often interrupts his train of thought with bizarre and unhelpful remarks (e.g. \\"Who are you stranger? What reasons brought you here?\\").If you're looking for a clarification of Deleuze's chef d'oeuvre, this book will help to some degree. If you don't feel like weeding through the tedium of \\"Gilles Deleuze's Difference and Repetition\\" I recommend looking elsewhere - Manuel Delanda's \\"Intensive Science and Virtual Philosophy\\" is a nice alternative."},{"Title":"Gilles Deleuze's","review":"There are two commentaries on Difference and Repetition in English. There is this book by James Williams and there isDeleuze's Difference and Repetition: A Reader's Guide (Reader's Guides)by Joe Hughes. I have gone back and forth in terms of which I think is better. The first time I tried reading through both of them I thought Joe Hughes' book was clearly superior. I am currently taking part in an independent study/reading group on Deleuze and have started reading through them again and this time around I am finding James Williams' book to be superior. Ultimately I think they both have strengths and they both have weaknesses. Neither one of them is perfect, but they complement each other fairly well so I recommend reading both of them. Anyone coming to Difference and Repetition for the first time is going to need all the help they can get.I will try to list some of the strengths and weaknesses of this book. A number of the reviewers have complained about Williams' tendency to bring in critiques from analytic philosophy as well as his tendency to throw in sometimes cryptic interjections throughout the text.I actually think that both of those \\"weaknesses\\" are strengths, at least in principle. In regard to his tendency to bring in critiques from analytic philosophy, I think it is often very difficult to understand a philosopher if you do not understand the reasons or arguments that underlie their positions. Simply listing a philosopher's positions on various subjects is usually not very helpful. Williams attempts to present the kinds of critiques he thinks analytic philosophers would make in regard to Deleuze's positions and then attempts to figure out how Deleuze might go about answering them. Again, this seems like a good tactic in principle, as a way of clarifying the nature of Deleuze's arguments. Unfortunately I do not think that Williams is always entirely successful in clarifying Deleuze's arguments. The major problem I had with Williams' execution of his plan is that he almost always puts off answering the questions he raises which forces the reader to \\"keep them in mind\\" as they await the answer. Ultimately the ability to hold onto questions and search for the answer is a skill that is necessary if you are going to study philosophy seriously; however, for an introductory text it seems to me to be asking too much of the reader. The first time reader of Difference and Repetition is going to be struggling simply to understand what is being said. In my opinion, requiring first time readers to hold onto questions (questions that they are unlikely to even understand on a first time through) and await the answers is too much to ask. Personally, I think it would have been better if Williams had either answered the questions as soon as he raised them, or waited to raise them until he was ready to give the answers.In regard to the interjections that Williams intersperses throughout the text, I think this was also a good idea in principle. It is often impossible for first time readers to understand highly abstract ideas without examples, and it amazes me how few philosophers offer concrete examples of their abstract ideas. It almost seems as if philosophers got together and decided as a group that providing examples was below their station and should be left to commentators. The interjections that Williams intersperses throughout the text are meant to be concrete illustrations of the abstract ideas he is discussing. On many occasions, I thought this really helped. Unfortunately, on many occasions I did not feel like Williams' interjections were successful in clarifying the text.Ultimately I think another reviewer hit it on the nose when they said that Williams offers hints. Anyone coming to this book hoping that Williams will make sense out of the whole of Difference and Repetition is going to be disappointed, and, to be fair, that is probably too much to ask of any commentary. I think what Williams does offer is what my Kant professor liked to call \\"islands of intelligibility\\". Williams will be able to make small patches of Difference and Repetition more intelligible for the reader but it is up to the reader to expand on those patches. Williams is also forced to leave out a great deal but that is simply due to the nature of the text. Difference and Repetition is an extremely rich text so any commentary is going to have to be selective in terms of what it includes and what it leaves out.So those are some of the strengths and weaknesses of the book. I think some of the weaknesses are balanced out by Joe Hughes' book so I recommend reading them together. There is also, apparently, another commentary on Difference and Repetition on the way by Henry Somers-Hall which I believe is supposed to be released sometime in 2012. So hopefully it will provide another angle from which to view this amazing and frustrating text. And finally, I cannot end my review without mentioning what I think is the best book on Deleuze in English:Difference and Givenness: Deleuze's Transcendental Empiricism and the Ontology of Immanence (Topics in Historical Philosophy)by Levi Bryant. If you only had time to read one book on Deleuze I think it should be Bryant's book. But hopefully you have more time to devote to Deleuze than that..."},{"Title":"Gilles Deleuze's","review":"This book is good. But, if you want something more complex, more historical, this is not the book you need. The quotes of other philosopher are zero. The confrontation with other works of Deleuze is nule.Anyway, in so far as this book is introductory for the reading of DR is a decent book.I spent this dollars, and I don't have any regrets about that."},{"Title":"Secrets of the Jedi (Star Wars)","review":"This was one of my favorite's by Jude Watson so forgive me if this review is slightly biased. I truly loved this book. Instead of focusing on a mission, grand scale battles and beheadings of certain Bounty Hunters, Secrets of the Jedi emphasized the morals and sacrafices of the Jedi. We get to see the three different Jedi (Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan and Anakin) deal with their love in three different ways. Qui-Gon, first of all, did not have the chance to make the tearing decision that Obi-Wan had to make in Secrets of the Jedi, thus, there was no internal conflict. I must add that I thought the conversation between him, Yoda and Obi-Wan at the end was wonderfully potrayed. I felt just as awful as Obi-Wan when he had to make his decision. Then we see Obi-Wan faced again with the choice of continuing his life as Jedi or bailing out again for something else (this 'something' to be Siri.) His love for her was geniune but yet he made the choice to let her go. And finally we see Anakin's and Padme's relationship which can only be summed into one word: Possession. I think this book was a nice fit for Episode Three, in the sense that we can see that possession between Anakin and Padme. We can see the foreshadowing and why Anakin was never truly committed to the Jedi and why it was so easy for him to turn.I enjoyed this book and I could really sense more passion put into it than many of Watson's last few. A must read for those who aren't fond of swinging lightsabers (although there is plently in the book) and are more fond of seeing character development. Toasts to Watson for this exciting read!"},{"Title":"Secrets of the Jedi (Star Wars)","review":"Jude Watson is an amazing writer for teens, and she really gives them something to think about in this book. No doubt about it the fact that I'm an adult, but I think everyone can read her books and enjoy them (I have the entire Jedi Apprentice series, gotta love Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon! LOL). This book focuses on the love that is forbidden in the Jedi Code, and for good reason. I was glad to see a book where Qui-Gon explained his lvoe for Tahl. Obi-Wan, understanding this, was able to finally give up and let go of what he loved the most, in contrast to Anakin, who never would. Obi-Wan, is such a true Jedi, like Qui-Gon, where he sacrifices all to make the choices he must. Anakin cannot sacrifice his love for Padme' because it consumes him; in a sense, he possesses her, and that's what this book defines for people who read it. You come to understand why Padme' and Anakin's love is different than any other Jedi's even after in the New Jedi Order--it's about possession and power. It is almost as though he has to OWN Padme' to protect her. It explains so much of the future events. This book is a great read, and is really good. I hope everyone enjoys it. It makes Obi-Wan the Jedi he is, and it shows reasons why Anakin will never be the Jedi he should be."},{"Title":"Secrets of the Jedi (Star Wars)","review":"Overall I thought this was a pretty good book. I've read every Star Wars book written by Jude Watson and this was a different type then I was used to. It's all about how all of the main jedi= Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan, and Anakin felt love at different points in their lives. Qui-Gon and Thal, Obi-Wan and Siri, and Anakin and Padme. It points out some of the main issues about why love is forbidden for jedi, but addresses if it should be. All of this is happening while they are tracking the story of Taly Fry, a boy who is very smart but while setting up a security system over hears bounty hunters, now the bounty hunters are after him, and while Obi-Wan and Siri are watching him thier relationship becomes closer. 20 years later Obi-Wan, Anakin, Siri, and Anakins wife Padme are on a misson with the same boy - Taly Fry. Anakins and Padmes relationship will get stronger, but what about Obi-Wan and Siris. A surpising ending that is not that surprising. Read the book to find out more. If your in to normal Star Wars with fighting and missions, it's an okay book, but it is more about the the relationship growing between jedi as the clone wars go on...Overall good book... But I think that I am Jude Watsons number 1 fan, so what else should I say !"},{"Title":"Secrets of the Jedi (Star Wars)","review":"I have enjoyed Jude Watson's Jedi Apprentice and Jedi Quest series (as an adult).

Qui-Gon is trying to overcome the loss of his lover Tahl. Attatchment is forbidden for a Jedi, so he cannot share his feelings with anyone else.Obi-Wan brings his master Sapir Tea in the morning although Qui-Gon tries to discourage him. Obi-Wan ,however, keeps coming.Part 2Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan join another Jedi team, Adi Gallia and Siri Tachi, to try to escort a boy - called Talesan Fry - to the Senate so he can testify about an assassination. Qui-Gon and Adi Gallia (the two masters) leave their padawans to protect the boy. They try to find a new ship, since they had to crash their old one to escape a bounty hunter.Qui-Gon and Adi end up as stow-aways on the bounty hunter's ship. There they find the way to Rondai-2 to stop the assassinations.Obi-Wan and Siri are forced to steal one one of bounty-hunter's, other ships to escape Quadrant 7. Soon they find the ship is rigged to explode. This results in the Padawan's relationship becomeing closer than friendship and also in Taly getting captured.Soon all four Jedi reunite and rescue Taly and halt the assassination.Part 3Twenty Years later, Obi-Wan and Siri have taken the trials and become Jedi.Anakin Skywalker, Obi-Wan's apprentice, and Padme Amidala, his wife, have also developed a different type of love - possession. This book shows how much different attatchment is from possession.Obi-Wan and Siri find themselves reunited with Talesan on a certain mission with Anakin and Padme. A bounty hunter from the past again comes into the story and lives now could be lost.RecommendationsI recommend this book for any Star Wars fan who doesn't think they'd die of a broken heart.

For those of you who love action, this has a lot of it, but focuses on the relationships of the Jedi in this book. My cousin and I read it, and we both agree that Qui-Gon may have been a little selfish in the end. I mean, that is the first time, I've ever heard of Obi-Wan crying! I mean, Obi-Wan understood what happened between Qui-Gon and Tahl. He knew it was forbidden, but did he bring the council in? No, he comforted Qui-Gon. Qui-Gon just made him tear his heart in two.If you read this book, you can decide if Qui-Gon was selfish or not.Being Jude Watson's Number One fan, I thought that this was definitly the most emotional Star Wars book by her so far.

Yet, within the space of close to 200 pages, POMOSEXUALS touched upon issues most of us either ignore (because we can) or lack the words to discuss. And indeed the essays within the anthology managed to challenge assumptions of gender and sexuality, creating, hopefully, words and spaces to talk about the unspeakable. As the collection proved, gender and sexuality can no longer be thought of in binary notions, rather a full-range of transgressive possibilities exist--which I think is the root of pomosexuality (postmodern sexuality problematizes our assumptions of gender/sexuality). And in my opinion it is exactly those possibilities that make life exciting; such an opinion as shown in several of the essays is threatening even to 'the lesbian and gay community' and especially to society as a whole. I found all the essays well written, provocative, and honest; each of the essays moved me in one sense or another. This is a collection not to be missed. It is a quick and enriching read.

In this anthology, writers talk about their most personal experiences of themselves as sexual beings: the gender they feel they are-sometimes in contrast to their physical bodies, what sexual experiences feel in synch with their arousal, and how each of these are changeable over the course of a lifetime.None of the authors fit the general expectation of lesbian, gay, bi, or transgendered. If a self-identified lesbian and a gay man are partnered sexually, how do they then define themselves? Why are bisexuals so often discriminated against by gays and lesbians as well as by the general public? And in terms of being part of a community, how do others label them?Understanding the fluidity of desire and identity can reveal these mysteries, which challenge the queer community as well as mainstream folks who worry about how children will be raised and what makes a family.\\"PoMo\\" refers to postmodern as the editors articulate so well on page 21 \\"Postmodern thought invites us to get used to the Zen notion of \\"multiple subjectivies\\" ---the idea that there is no solid, objective reality, that each of us experiences our reality subjectively affected (or influenced) by our unique circumstances.

Frankly it feels like the essays were collected first then the table of contents fitted around them leaving some a bit odd feeling. The quality of the essay varies with the author frankly.

All of these writers had something important to say. Whether or not I was comfortable with what I was reading, or could find something (or not) in my own experience to relate to the author's experience, each essay was, in my opinion, well worth reading. These writers never failed to make at least a couple of points that provoked me to think in a new way about sexuality, gender, relationships, power, friendship, social interaction, clothing, bodies, pronouns, art, science, well I could just go on and on. I was bored, aroused, disgusted, astonished, amused, mentally stimulated, and moved to tears. I won't tell you which essays I liked the best or least, because everyone who reads them will relate - or not relate - to each one differently, depending on their individual life experience.

These books are better if read in order,otherwise you will end up confused. This is a good series, I liked every one of them and wish the author would write more of them. The relationships between the charactors is why I enjoyed this series as much as I did. Along with Hex there are knew protagonists in this book.

I'll stick with Tinker."},{"Title":"Bitter Waters (Ukiah Oregon, Book 3)","review":"\\"Bitter Waters\\" picks up where \\"Tainted Trail\\" left off -- litterally, one day later. U. and his partner, M., are private detectives. They arrive home and are immediately drawn into investigating child kidnappings and a cult that has turned to crime. If you haven't read the previous books, U. is an alien pretending to be a human, and the detective work is greatly complicated by alien threats to Earth.My problems with \\"Bitter Waters\\" were twofold. First, if you have read the previous novel, the beginning of this one goes really slowly. After the first 57 pages, there really isn't any reason to go back and read either \\"Tainted Trail\\" or the book before, because you've just read it. To be fair, I prefer stand alone books to sequels. Second, the main plot is that U.'s son is kidnapped, and I abhor kidnapped children plots, particularly when the main character's child is kidnapped. I'm a parent, and this just isn't a laughing matter for me.I recommend this novel to people who don't mind kidnapped children plots and either haven't read Spencer's U. books before or adore sequels. All else is well done."},{"Title":"Bitter Waters (Ukiah Oregon, Book 3)","review":"Although the human race is unaware of it, there is a war going on between two rival groups of an alien race. The Ontongard infects humans and makes the species one of them, an individual cell in an organism. The pack aliens retain their individual identities while having access to the group memory. The pack wants to kill the Ontongard so they won't destroy the human race. Ukiah Oregon, half alien and half human is the only breeder on the planet and the Ontongard want him to create more of their kind.Oregon has a son who has been kidnapped. Ukiah, his friend Max, and the pack are doing all in their power to get him back but since the people who kidnapped him are human, they have to be very careful not to let any government official know about Kitt's alien origins. To make matters even worse, the kidnappers are using Ontongard biological weapons, which means that people who don't have any understanding of what they are doing are playing with something that could destroy the world.Wen Spencer has written an exciting science fiction thriller that stars a vulnerable and powerful hero who is impossible not to cherish. The war between the two alien factions feels real and believable in a Twilight Zone kind of way. The investigation of the kidnapping by aliens, Homeland Security, the FBI, the local Pittsburgh police and a human once possessed by the Ontongard is exciting to see unfold as each group has its own agenda. BITTER WATERS is a must read.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Bitter Waters (Ukiah Oregon, Book 3)","review":"Wen Spencer's writing grows with each book. I got home yesterday after 8 days away to find my copy of Bitter Waters waiting for me. Finished it at 7 AM this morning. (Yawn!)It is absolutely amazing to see how well her writing improved from Alien Taste (pretty darn good) to Tainted Trail (yep, not a one book wonder) to Bitter Waters. This is a mature writer working here! And she's still eligible for the John W. Campbell Award in 2003 for Best New Writer!!! She ought to win hands-down.The ability Wen have manifested to climb into the heads of some very strange people (like Rennie, or even _Hex_) is terrific. Few SF writers write believable aliens, fewer still write believable human interactions with aliens from the alien point of view.Bravo!Buy this book. Better yet, buy Alien Taste and Tainted Trail and lose a weekend reading them all in sequence...."},{"Title":"Bitter Waters (Ukiah Oregon, Book 3)","review":"BITTER WATERS by Wen Spencer manages to pull off the difficult task of being a series novel that stands on its own. I came across BITTER WATERS by accident and fell in love with it--enough so that I special ordered the first two Ukiah Oregon books to read them all in order.Briefly, Ukiah and his private invesitgator partner, Max Bennett are just back from Oregon (Minutes out of the airport back) when the police call them in on a missing child case. Ukiah, an alien hybred, manages to locate the missing child only to find that other children have turned up missing--and his enemy, the very alien Ontongard, seems to be involved. Then his son/clone Kittaning is kidnapped, a Homeland Security agent turns up investigating a cybercult and everything gets skewed sideways.It is a difficult feat to write mystery/suspense stories in a science fiction setting but Wen Spencer pulls it off, in large part because her story is deeply rooted in our own familiar world and set only months into the future. Add to that well written characters and you have great story telling.THough I read BITTER WATERS first, I do reccomend that you read all three Ukiah Oregon books in order so you get his full story in proper detail. Each book stands alone, but together they form a compelling story. I'm looking forward to the next one."},{"Title":"Bitter Waters (Ukiah Oregon, Book 3)","review":"In this third book in the series, Ukiah Oregon is still reeling from his discovery about his alien origins and from his son's creation, and he finds himself put to the test when he becomes involved in searching for some missing children. His reputation as the Wolf Boy continues to make his life and his detective partner Max's life a challenge, and a government agent is suspicious about their connection to a strange cult. Luckily Ukiah's lesbian caretakers also take care of his son, so he can focus on his job. Before Ukiah can investigate this connection himself, his son is abducted and his hunting powers are put to the test. Joined by his girlfriend Indigo and his Pack brothers, Ukiah and Max try to elude the mysterious government agent and find Ukiah's son before it's too late. Although it's rather heavy with plot elements, &quot;Bitter Waters&quot; is a captivating thriller with a variegated cast and starring one of the more intriguing characters in fiction."},{"Title":"Bitter Waters (Ukiah Oregon, Book 3)","review":"I just finished and... WOW, it deserves more than 5 stars! Wen Spencer has officially made my list of automatic &quot;must-have for the keeper-shelf&quot; authors. She weaves complex characters and intricate plot details to create a world that is at once wildly fantastic and utterly realistic. This series has it all: good and evil, love and hate, individuality and hive minds, mysteries and clues, death and immortality, decency and depravity. Did I mention aliens, bikers, the FBI, way-cool tech toys, big guns, cool cars, Kevlar and a quest to save the human race? You simply MUST read this book - but read Alien Taste and Tainted Trail first. There are enough back-story explanations in Bitter Waters, that it could probably pass on it's own, but you'll enjoy it more if you've read the first two books."},{"Title":"Bitter Waters (Ukiah Oregon, Book 3)","review":"I've read all four of the Ukiah Oregon books, and have to disagree with the reviewer below that described plot inconsistencies. The order of the books are: Alien Taste, Tainted Trail, Bitter Waters, and Dog Warrior. The action of each one flows naturally to the next with no obvious inconsistencies. Ukiah's son enters the scene in the first book, Alien Taste. Almost all the action in the second book, Tainted Trail, takes place in or around Pendleton Oregon -- so naturally it's mentioned in the third book. There is only one character Ukiah interacts with in Bitter Waters that could have been deceased in Tainted Trail, and that character was in fact alive and well by the end of Tainted Trail. Finally, the \\"cult\\" mentioned in Bitter Waters is completely new to the action (and continues into Dog Warrior). The reviewer may have gotten them confused with the Ontongard in Tainted Trail, which are a completely different problem, persistent through all the books.I agree with the reviewer that the books are great and well worth reading, just didn't want readers to believe those plot problems the reviewer mentioned really existed."},{"Title":"Bitter Waters (Ukiah Oregon, Book 3)","review":"This is the third in a series of books featuring 'Ukiah Oregon,' a 'wolf-boy' who was found running feral with wolves by a pair of lesbians, who, after hiring a private eye to try and locate his family - and failing to do so - raised him as their own. This wolf-boy, Ukiah, is an interesting character in and of himself, but things get complicated fast in his world.In the first book, 'Alien Taste,' and the second, 'Tainted Trail,' we learn that Ukiah is in fact an alien hybrid of strange DNA, and for all intents and purposes, cannot die (though parts of him that are cut, bled, or broken off tend to change into animal shapes and try to re-merge with him later when he wakes up. Ew.)Now a full partner with the PI who first tried to find him, Ukiah is asked to help on a missing children case, and hasn't made much headway when his own 'child' (actually a portion of himself that managed to form a human baby on its own) is stolen. The stakes rise, cultists appear - but could the hive-mind-mentality Ontonguard be involved as well?Well crafted, fun stuff, and light enough reading to be enjoyable on the bus.

One of the advertising blurbs said \\"Don't plan on getting anything else done if you start a Wen Spencer novel; they are exceedingly hard to put down!\\" So true. I read it in one day and then went scrambling to get the other three in the series. My only regret is that now I have read them all and wish there were more. Definitely a keeper.

The initial work in this sequence isAlien Taste.In the previous volume, Alicia and Rose had come to Oregon to do a geological survey. Then Rose sprained her ankle and Alicia went for a hike on her own. After she did not come back, Rose called the Sheriff and then Kraynak.Kraynak hired Max and Ukiah to find her. Ukiah asked Indigo to mind Kittanning and she agreed. So Ukiah dropped off Kittanning on the way to the airport.First they flew south to Houston and then north to Portland. There they took a commuter flight to Pendleton. Kraynak was airsick for the whole trip.In this novel, Ukiah Oregon is a young alien-human half breed. He has been killed at least twice and recovered from the condition. He is also the only breeder on Earth able to truly propagate his kind.Maxwell Bennett is a private detective. He was hired to discover Ukiah's origins. Now they are partners in the private investigator business.Kraynak is a detective in the Pittsburgh Police Department. He and Max were military policemen in the same unit during the Gulf war. Since they were both from Pittsburgh, the friendship continued after the war.Alicia is the niece of Max's friend Kraynak. She has known Ukiah since he started working for Max. She is slightly older than his official age.Indigo Zheng is an FBI special agent. She investigated the Janet Haze case and became Ukiah's lover.Kittanning is an infant derived from a blood mouse of Ukiah. Kitt had been abducted by the Ontongard Gets (seeAlien Taste).Ari Johnson is a Pittsburg policeman. He had helped Ukiah with baby supplies for Kittanning.Sam Killington is a private investigator in Pendleton, Oregon. She had divorced her former husband two years before, but has recently gotten a court order to keep him from stalking her.Rennie Shaw is a Get of Ukiah's father Prime and the leader of the Dog Warriors. The Ontongard Gets have alien blood, but cannot propagate their kind except by making other Gets.Grant Hutchinson is a Homeland Security agent. He has been interested in Max and Ukiah.In this story, Ukiah and Max receive a message in Houston about a missing child. After arriving in Pittsburg, they drive over to the missing boy's house. The street is crowded with police and TV news vehicles.Ari meets them at their car and tells them the details. Four other children have been abducted within Pittsburg in the past two weeks. The police are wondering whether this disappearance is related to the previous cases.Ari also mentions that Hutchinson had interrogated him about Ukian and Max. He had shown Ari professional quality photos of both of them. He had also given Ari a card, which Ukiah memorized.Max fetches one of the boy's blankets. He also says that the boy was known to disappear into strange places. Ukiah smells the boy's scent and senses his DNA on a blanket.Ukiah follows the boy's chase after a lost ball down the hillside and along a lower road. He loses the trail for a while, but regains it in a storm drain. The pipe is too small for him, but he creates a blood mouse and finds the boy inside the drain.Then the mouse gets washed downstream. Max and a policeman have found a manhole and Ukiah lowers himself into the drainpipe. It is slightly east of the other drainpipe, so he goes downstream to a larger pipe and heads west.He finds other smaller pipe that should lead to the boy. He finds the blood mouse just inside this pipe and the boy is only a little further away. The boy is wedged tight by the ball in his back, but slips loose when Ukian eases the ball away.The boy is alive and taken away in an ambulance. Ukian and Max drive back to the office. Ukiah sheds his clothes and scrubs off the storm draim stench while Max checks the phone messages.Ukian checks the refrigerator and finds everything covered in mold. But the freezer has ice cream bars. Max is still listening to the phone messages.Somebody has called five times and hung up on the answering machine and the caller ID matches a number on the Homeland Security agent's card. The other messages are fairly routine. But the last call is from Sam, who is driving Kraynak Volkswagen van back to Pittsburg.Max sends Ukiah home to his moms. He finds Kittanning asleep in a crib and picks him up. Kitt wakes and calls him Daddy.The next day, Ukiah takes Kitt with him to the office. Ukiah answers the phone and talks to Hutchinson. The agent makes an appointment at four in the afternoon.Ukiah tells Max about the appointment. Max leaves to run errands, including checking up Kraynak and Alicia. Then Indigo walks into the office. She takes Ukiah upstairs to welcome him back to Pittsburg.Indigo is upset because of the abductions. They had just found another of the lost children. She has to go watch the autopsy later that day.Ukiah and Kitt go to the store for diapers and other wares. Rennie and other Pack members follow him into the store. They are buying food for a cookout at McConnell's Mill. Besides, Rennie wanted to see Kitt, who he called his grandson.Hutchinson comes to the office an hour and a half early. He seems a bit hostile and makes some wrong assumptions. When Max returns, the agent tells them about a woman who joined a cult.Later, a man empties his pistol at Ukiah and abducts Kitt. Sam has finished a shower, but chases the getaway car through rush hour traffic until it turns off onto a busway. Ukiah is shocky, but recalls the man and the driver of the car.This tale involves Indigo in the case because of the kidnapping. Max gets a ransom note from the kidnappers. Ukiah leads Indigo to a good set of prints of the shooter.The hunt for Kitt leads to more complications. The next installment in this series isDog Warrior.Highly recommended for Spencer fans and anyone who enjoys tales of alien invasions, human cults, and a touch of romance. Read and enjoy!-Arthur W.

In fact, it's so relevant that it should be required reading for anyone in power, actually it should probably be required reading for everyone on the planet. Period.On the Beach is set in Australia, and it becomes clear quite quickly that something horrible has happened. And that horrible thing is a full out nuclear war in the northern hemisphere of the Earth. Those left in the southern hemisphere are either dead or waiting to meet their end from the slow drift of radiation heading their way. The story follows several characters through to their respective ends: Dwight, a submariner from the US, Moira, a young woman who is bitter about her life being cut short, a young couple with a baby and a scientist who chooses to spend his last few months racing a car he probably shouldn't be driving. The way that the characters choose to live their lives, even after being handed a death sentence, provides you with a little faith in the general goodness of human nature. The dignity with which they carry themselves is a nice respite on the generally inevitable bad behavior that usually takes place in post apocalyptic novels They don't start rioting and destroying things around them, they just...go on. You get to know the characters and that's what makes the ending heartbreaking, their realness really drives home that this kind of thing could happen to normal people if we aren't careful. If this book doesn't affect you, well, there's something wrong with you.Shute's style in this book is a little wonky and some of the prose seems a little stilted. Since he wrote it in the 50's there are some words that don't ring true today, but that doesn't detract from the book at all. I watched the movie right after I read the book because I was so enamored with it, but I ended up being disappointed with it because it didn't carry the same impact. Read the book, it makes you want to be a little bit kinder to everyone in the world."},{"Title":"On the Beach","review":"The basic story is that Albania sends a plane with another country's markings to bomb the U.S. and we retaliate. However this is not a pacifist (don't build bombs book). This is not a sci-fi book. It could be a speculative fiction or just speculative.The story begins after the war is completed and radiation is now covering the world. Australia is the last place to be covered. You read how different people are about to meat their end, some with hope, others with reckless abandon. Still there are those like the US sub commander Dwight Towers is loyal to his country to the end by not allowing U.S. property in the end to fall into the hands of the Aussies.The book was written in the Cold War Era environment. So many people think that it is about countries and war; others think this story is some anti war story. The reality is that it is a study of people meeting a sure end and how they react. Other readers will balk at the actions of the people in this story; yet when they meet the same situation we will see how realistic the characters are. Still others will balk at the predictability of the characters. Still this is how many people get over a crisis by being predictable. It is these characteristics that make this novel timeless. Someone else must think so or they would not have made an updated version for our not too distant future."},{"Title":"On the Beach","review":"I read this book several years ago but didn't pick it up. (foolish me) Once I found it again I had to add it to my collection. Both the book and the movie show a very scary possibility of what might happen. Imagine that a cloud of radiation is coming toward you and there's nothing you can do about it. It's a countdown of how long it'll take to reach you and you have lots of time to think about it.How would you spend your last few days?A very well written book and the movie was very good also. I'd recommend getting both and keeping them handy."},{"Title":"On the Beach","review":"One of the two books I read as a child on the aftermath of nuclear war. Amovie was made, so most people know the story. Still a well told storyabout the struggle for psychological and emotional survival in a dyingworld with no hope of continued physical existence.

It discusses all the algorithms and tradeoffs, and comes with free downloadable source code to experiment with. Some of the material is standard, but covered in more implementation detail here than anywhere else. Some of the material is novel: you won't find better coverage of compression unless you hand-assemble twenty research papers, and reverse-engineer them to figure out how they're implemented. But with &quot;Managing Gigabytes&quot;, it's all here. (Although, after a particularly envigorating discussion of how to string together a bunch of techniques to compress their corpus and save a couple 100MB, I did a check and found you could buy 512MB of RAM for less than the cost of the book. Knowledge is Power, but sometimes a little cash is more powerful.) The only negative is that this book is not called &quot;Managing Terabytes&quot;, as the first edition promised/threatened it might be.

However I think it spends a little too much time on compression techniques and lacks a good discussion of incremental or on-line indexing. The book tends to assume that the set of texts to be searched is static - if new documents can be added or old ones deleted it makes the whole problem much harder and many of MG's techniques are no longer relevant.

The comparisons of algorithms on realistic sized collections is unparalleled in other texts.I have used this text for the past 5 years in a graduate level information storage and retrieval class but I believe it has a much wider audience due to the quality of writing.Additionally, the free availability of the mg system which implements many of the best algorithms of the text allows the reader/student to take advantage of the technology without having to start from scratch.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Managing Gigabytes: Compressing and Indexing Documents and Images (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Multimedia Information and Systems)","review":"Managing Gigabytes is the best book out there on information retrieval.

Additionally, the coverage of compression algorithms is the best I've found in any book. All algorithms and pseudo-code in the book are presented clearly enough such that any competent programmer should be able to implement them. If all else fails, however, the free downloadable source code for the mg system can fill in any gaps.All in all, this is the best computer science book I've purchased in years.

The option to look up compounds by any of the kanji is of immense utility to me. I have a more divided opinion on the simplified radical system they use. I don't know how much more difficult it would be to search through all 214 radicals rather than the 79 that Hadamitzky and Spahn use, but i do have occasional problems deciding which radical to use when none seem to match exactly. They do include a feature to help in this regard. Similar looking kanji are listed in the chart under the wrong radical with a pointer to the correct entry. All in all a worthy tome and one which sees great usage in my hands."},{"Title":"The Kanji Dictionary (English and Japanese Edition)","review":"If you are a student of Japanese, you know how difficult it can be to identify Kanji and how many combinations they appear in. This dictionary is exactly what you need.Trying to identify Kanji on your phone or iPad is difficult because the software expects you to know the precise number of strokes and to get them in the right order. But all you need to do with this dictionary is to pick out a &#34;radical&#34; (a familiar component of the character) and look it up from there. Not sure how many strokes are involved? No problem -- just look through the list of characters with that radical. Not sure which radical to use? No problem -- you can look up a character using any of the radicals it involves.The next problem faced by students of Japanese is that Kanji characters appear in countless combinations, and these change both their meaning and pronunciation. This book is an excellent solution. Once you've looked up the first Kanji in the sequence, it lists all of the combinations that can follow. For each it provides a pronunciation and definition.This is a hefty book and it has a slip cover to keep it from getting too banged up. My copy is always on my desk because I'm always using it.

Even though I consider myself an advanced learner of Japanese, I have not felt the need to buy a \\"Japanese\\" Kanji dictionary yet: this one by Spahn and Hadamitzky has more than met my needs. Here are some of this dictionary's plusses:-Just about every kanji or kanji compound you can think of is included (they claim 47,000+ compounds which sounds about right).-The look-up system is easy to use, and the index is similarly helpful-The appendices are surprisingly interesting and informative, including information ranging from the reigns of the emperors to geography to even a list of the most frequent Japanese surnames.My only possible complaints are:-not enough radicals: they chose to categorize the kanji using 79 radicals instead of the 214 historical radicals. This resulted in almost 300 kanji that are \\"without\\" a radical, all lumped together at the beginning of the dictionary by the number of strokes. Many of these are very common kanji, which can cause frustrations if you're trying to figure out which radical to look up only to find that it's in the \\"no radical\\" section.-it would have been great if they'd had accent markings to show how the characters are pronounced. In Japanese, context and an accent shift are the only difference between saying \\"Let's have success!\\" and \\"Let's have sex!\\" (sex and success are both romanized \\"seikoo\\"). Native Japanese presumably know the difference in pronunciation, but learners of a second language are not as likely. This can result in awkward situations. Knowing the correct accent in general makes you much more understandable, and it is a shame that most dictionaries don't include this information.Overall though, this is a great dictionary. I highly recommend it for beginners, experts, and everyone in between!"},{"Title":"The Kanji Dictionary (English and Japanese Edition)","review":"I bought this dictionary just when I was beginning my fourth semester of japanese lessons, to help me with my future translations and with the learning of new kanji (which is always a useful thing, since many tend to get disappointed when they know they have to learn about 2,000 to read the newspaper).I have always thought that with any given dictionary, there are two main issues you have to keep in mind: how complete it is, and just how easy it is to use.I have not as of yet searched for any kanji I have not been able to find, so I'd say it is fairly complete. This is an extremely thorough dictionary, covering not only an incredible amount of individual kanji, but a whole lot of compunds (the dictionary claims over 47,000. I'll take their word.), so there is a very good possibility of you too finding the character you are looking for.As for the second issue, I must say I'm surprised at how easy it is to find kanji. When i first heard of the system kanji dictionaries used for listing them, I was appalled. I was pleased to find, nevertheless, a full two-page-and-a-half brief manual on how to use the dictionary that gave me all the preparation I needed: I was succesfully looking up kanji in now more than 10 minutes.Basically, there are two ways in which you can find a given kanji in this dictionary: by their readings (either the on-yomi, or the kun-yomi), and by their stroke count. The 79-radical system can be a little confusing at first, but is fairly simple to get used and not at all as illogical as one might think.The only complaint I have so far is the lack of internal references made in the dictionary. For instance, one of the appendices lists the 1006 \\"gakushuu kanji\\" (the kanji taught in elementary school), but their are numbered straight from 1 to 1006, without the reference to the dictionary entry for each of those kanji. The same thing happens to the kanji in \\"the 100 most frequent kanji\\", \\"the most frequent kanji used in family names\\", \\"the 284 extra kanji for use in given names\\", etc. Adding that would be a real time saver if you are planning, as I am, in using the dictionary as a learning tool.Still, it's a great tool, and I'm really convinced that this was one of my truly great buys. Definitively 5 stars."},{"Title":"The Kanji Dictionary (English and Japanese Edition)","review":"I have used many Japanese dictionaries over the years, and this is by far the single most useful one for kanji. This is largely because many kanji that are frequently-used don't often occur at the beginning of a compound. So to get a picture of the usage of one of these, you need a dictionary that gives lists of compounds with the kanji in positions other than first. This is the only dictionary to do that."},{"Title":"The Kanji Dictionary (English and Japanese Edition)","review":"This has been my primary Kanji Dictionary for several years. It is impressively comprehensive, covering over 7,500 single kanji characters (compare this to the Japanese Ministry of Education's list of 1850 \\"standard\\" Kanji) and almost 47,000 multi-character compounds. The dictionary itself is about 1700 pages. Unlike \\"Japanese-English\\" dictionaries which are ordered according to the Hiragana/Katakana (alphabet) sequence, this is a Kanji dictionary and thus is based primarily on ideogram (kanji) construct. Since a single kanji character can have a wide breadth of pronunciations given the context, strokes or stroke composites hold the key to unlocking the kanji universe. Greater minds have determined that all Kanji characters are (nearly) comprised of 79 \\"radicals\\". Using the analogy of chemistry, if a Kanji character were the chemical compound, the list of 79 \\"radicals\\" is the periodic table representing the core components from which the entire system is built. Thus once you become familiar with the 79 radicals, the massive world of Kanji becomes all that less intimidating."},{"Title":"The Kanji Dictionary (English and Japanese Edition)","review":"In 15 years of professional translation work, I have found no kanji dictionary better than this.

I have to admit, the first thing i started to translate was not from a textbook. it was a doujinshi, or japanese fan comic. i was able to find almost all of the kanji i looked for. it is a very comprehensive list of all the kanji you're likely to encounter. i highly recommend it to help you in translations and so forth. a drawback to this book is its size though. it's gargantuan. unless you have a very strong back or are slightly masochistic this is a reference book for home use only. it is also time consuming to search through all the entries to find the kanji you need to know. despite that, this is still a great kanji dictionary."},{"Title":"The Kanji Dictionary (English and Japanese Edition)","review":"when I did an internet search to locate this, I found a number of negative reviews. Basically the consensus seemed to be that the character lookup system is new and therefore bad.I disagree. The system the authors developed is the first \\"rational\\" approach in that it does not require that you know what the important radical is in order to look up a kanji. Morever, the ability to look up compounds using any character in the compound is very useful.However, there are some negatives:(1) the authors are not entirely consistent within their own approach.E.g., the characters under the radical for hand are grouped under the three character radical, which is the way it is written except when it is written as a single character. However, the character for hand is written with four strokes, and you must know that in order to find it under the three stroke index.this is the example that comes to mind most immediately, although I believe there are others.(2) the binding is not of a very high quality. if you use this frequently (which you will), it will eventually break the spine.i gave away my first version after it split in two. my current version is in four pieces.on the positive side: this is so extremely useful that I am going to order a third copy.HIGHLY RECOMENDED."},{"Title":"The Kanji Dictionary (English and Japanese Edition)","review":"I'd used a Kanji dictionary twice in my life before buying this, but I had to do a few translations and after playing with this book, there was no looking back.To be fair, I don't read Japanese fluently, nor do I speak Japanese fluently, far from it.

From me personally, it's for karate history.I find this book excellent, especially when compared to the others of its type, especially when it comes to numbering the kanji. The indices into the kanji characters are intelligent, that is, they contain information about the kanji itself. As an example, character SHIN, meaning &quot;mind&quot;, &quot;soul&quot; has the index 4e5.1: 4 strokes for the radical (radical 4e), 5 strokes for the rest of the character.

(The latter was written decades later and written with the benefit of hindsight). The Nightmare Years has a nice section on how Shirer managed to smuggle out the diary manuscript out of Germany.This review addresses the Johns Hopkins University Press edition (2002).1. The snide introduction by Gordon A. Craig was unfortunate. Note that Craig the historian wrote a review that did not particularly appreciate Shirer's Rise and Fall of the Third Reich (see Shirer's comments on the paperback edition). Craig's allegation that Shirer overlooked or failed to give sufficient attention to the plight of the Jews is plain wrong. The persecution of the Jews is one of the main themes of the diary, starting with page 15. Also, Shirer knew how to read and speak German (see Craig's comments re Mein Kampf).2. The JHU press paperback edition is very overpriced at listed price of $30. The paper is of fine quality, but the glue binding is atrocious and the book will crack in half in a year. The type setting appears to be a facsimile of the 1941 Knopf edition (large, pleasing font). The back blurb by JHU Press production is awful and silly (\\"Wliiam L.

For anyone who wants to understand World War II, I highly recommend three works as a starter:Shirer, William L: Berlin Diary,Churchill, Winston: The Second World War, vol. l, The Gathering Storm, andShirer, William L: The Rise And Fall Of The Third ReichThese books tell the story of what was going on in Europe during those critical years after World War I when Hitler came to power in Germany. Berlin Diary tells how these times were met by the German people, The Gathering Storm about the almost uncanny vision of Mr. Churchill who foresaw the war when the rest of the world was unwilling to listen to him. The Rise And Fall Of The Third Reich carries on from the beginnings layed out by the first two books.Mr. Shirer was a news reporter stationed in Berlin from 1934 to 1941 and had a unique opportunity to observe first hand the inner workings of the Nazi Party during those years in which it achieved its greatest strength. His diary tells of what its various leaders did and said, and how the German people reacted to them. Berlin Diary is a must read for anyone who wishes to understand the origins of the Nazi movement which in a few years would plunge the world into the worst catastrophe of the twentieth century.

I liked it then, but had a different perspective. Shirer kept this journal as his personal diary during a period of significant change. He was in a very good place to make the observations and was a very well informed observer. His descriptions display both a critical eye to events, and the youth of the observer. Looking at the political turmoil, the slick courting of the population by the German political machine, the control of the domestic press and the almost criminal negligence of the allied governments can provide a lens through which we can observe events today.A critical reader and student of history will be drawn to make the obvious comparisons with the current government of the US and its cozy relationship with an adulating domestic media. The ease with which the German political machine was able to convince a majority of the public of their good intentions may well be a warning sign to voters in America today.There are lessons to be learned from history and Berlin Diary may well be a lesson book for us all today."},{"Title":"Berlin Diary: The Journal of a Foreign Correspondent 1934-1941","review":"Even though I had read Shirer's book \\"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich\\", his \\"Berlin Diary\\" book still gave me the chills.

The first best is Shirer's other book &#34;The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich&#34;. This man was a journalist in Germany on the radio during the war and has written with amazing insight to the events that led up to Hitler's realm of power and eventual collapse. If you have ever wondered how events could have gone that far, these two books tell it as it was through his own personal experiences at the time and other correspondences from the newspapers, radio, and personal connections with the Nazis. This diary is written and notating his thoughts as the events were happening all around him. It has great personal worth and feelings. The &#34;Rise&#34; book goes into all that happened combining his personal experiences as well as info that occurred during the Nuremberg trials. You can't know as much as you think you do about Germany WWI until you have read these 2 books. I also recommend that you also go one step further and should read &#34;Mein Kampf&#34; by Hitler. It is not just an evil book written to talk you into hating Jewish people. Don't worry , you won't be brainwashed into becoming a Nazi, I promise you. It is an amazing book that actually tells you directly from Hitler's own mind (not from some writer who conjectures what was going on) why he did what he did. When you read this book, you will understand so much more about why and how Hitler did his infamous deeds. (He actually believed that God inspired him to his actions for the sake of Germany, the fatherland and its owners. It is ponderous and at times you may want to quit it, but you will be rewarded with many scary and insightful statements that give important clues about his reason for his actions. You will be amazed about how astute he was on some issues and psychology. It is unfortunate that he, like so many other dictators, eventually go completely mad with power which, fortunately for all of us, result in their eventual downfall.

This book was completed months before Pearl Harbor (last entries were December 1940). So it is a great page turner watching mediocre politicians blunder their way to war.Also the inside story of the founding of broadcast journalism.The only type liberal most Americans know is a \\"Make love, not war\\" stereotype. Shirer was a different type. The type that was willing to fight facism in any form straight up, blow for blow, shot for shot. (Yet, he also personally knew Ghandi and was a great admirer. I guess Shirer could recognize the limits of non-violence.)Some other reviewers were upset by Shirer's opinions of Nazis and Germans. I recently read \\"My Four Years in Germany\\" by ???? Giraud who was the USA ambassador to Germany from 1913 to 1917. His observations dovetail and add validity to Shirer's observations about the mindset of Germans and their ambitions to dominate Europe, if not the world. He also had chapters on the German education system and Prussiaism which explains the Kaiser Cult. Nazism was a direct descendant of Kaiserism and Pan-Germanism. I spent ten days in Germany and Austria in 2004. While at the Dachau concentration camp I observed 100s of 16 year old German students. One of them told me all German students are required to go to a concentration camp. My son's school field trips are to Disneyworld or Busch Gardens, theirs is to walk through gas chambers. I doubt those bright, active German children regard Slavs as subhumans to be treated like cattle, but that does not mean their grand parents and great grand parents did not.Another reviewer slammed Shirer for describing with relish the food he ate on short trips outside of Germany before the War in contrast with the rationed poor food in Berlin he had to live on. Obviously that reviewer has never missed a meal in his life.This is going to turn some people off, but I was also struck by similarties between Nazi propaganda and Fox news.

Shirer is best known for his work: \\"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich.\\"I'm rather shocked by how openly racist Shirer is over against Germans.He says the huge problem in Europe is not Fascism or Communism or Socialism but\\"Germanism.\\"Several times he goes out of his way to pronounce Germans the ugliest people in Europe and goes out of his way to single out German women for particular scorn. He denounces the way German's \\"think\\" and their behaviors and attitudes, in a way that is highly racist in nature.It is important to grasp Shirer's deeply held racist attitudes toward Germans in order to understand why, and how, it is that he is eager to find what can only be regarded as a bizarre \\"genetic\\" cause for German aggression during WWII and before, thus, making it easy for him to make a direct link from Luther to Hitler.What Shirer seems incapable of understanding is the depth of evil that exists in all human beings, and given the right conditions, it explodes in horrible manifestations.There is no doubt in my mind that Germany, particularly the Prussian strain, was militaristic and aggressive to a fault, and that these feelings along with systemic anti-Semitism played right into the goals and aspirations of Adolf Hitler who masterfully played off the sentiments of the German people.At the heart of Shirer's erroneous interpretations is his failure to grasp the horror of the anti-God and God-less philosophies of Communism and Fascism alike, which in turn were bred from Rationalism's worldview."},{"Title":"Berlin Diary: The Journal of a Foreign Correspondent 1934-1941","review":"William L. Shirer is often praised for his works about Nazi Germany. I don't understand why. Shirer was never an unbiased reporter while in Germany. An unbiased report showing both sides of an issue is what we demand of our finest reporters. Shirer was very prejudiced and hostile towards the regime in Germany at the time. He was bullheaded and arrogant, making demands and walking around like a king on German soil. He writes about his boldness time and time again throughout his diary. Again, I must say that many reporters of the time were similar to Shirer when it came to a lack of knowledge and respect for other cultures. Shirer may have known some French and German, but it stopped there. He had no feeling for the German people and their situation. He was a total outsider and, therefore, could not give an honest report of the true situation. I gave this book a 3 on a scale from 1 to 10 due to the general observations made by Shirer; some were interesting bits of trivia, and could be appreciated.

He hints at the compromises he had to make to continue broadcasting from Berlin, but disparages those who &#34;worked with the enemy&#34;. I am conflicted about the book because it is really not a good book to read if you do not know the history, he wrote and published this book while the war was still occurring, so he presumes a level of knowledge that today's reader may not have. He is obsessed with the personality of Hitler and the German people, but it mostly comes off as pompous, self important prattle. He appears oblivious to the role the army played in preparing Germany for war in the 1920s...ie years before Hitler was a factor. (not to belittle the importance of Hitler, but to blame all of WW II solely on him is to ignore the role of the German government in building up their war resources, the rabid desire for peace that led the allies to avoid confronting him, and the stupidity of diplomats who bungled diplomacy and pushed Russia into a treaty with Germany.) An interesting perspective but very very limited."},{"Title":"Berlin Diary: The Journal of a Foreign Correspondent 1934-1941","review":"The author makes a large number of observations about what is happening and how it is done.

The conflicting reviews caused me to read it. I wanted to judge the work for myself. I am sure that Mr. Shirer has embellished his deeds in the reworking, and some of it comes off like allied propaganda of the day. I think you can learn a great deal from actual accounts of what people thought and felt at the time. He makes some unflattering generalizations about the German people as a whole but he lived the frustration the time. I think that holding this book up as a book to be taught in history class is a mistake. Everyone has a window on the World and Mr. Shirer is letting us know what he saw from his.

The authors have known what happened, and often why, and have (sometimes) simply described historical events. Shirer's diary gives us a day by day look at Europe and Nazi Germany during the crucial years of the thirties and after. The reader may be chilled as the book progresses, knowing the horror in store for so many.And again and again it appears Shirer knows what will happen in advance. He is rarely wrong in his predictions. For instance,he predicts the German attack on Holland in May of '40 and British survival later that year. He finds the German Jews in 1935 to be 'too optimistic' and says that Hitler will turn on Russia before the USA. At times I was inclined to believe Shirer had backdated his diary after the fact.It would have been nice if the diary could have been continued to the war's end, even if the author no longer had access to sources so close to the action. I suppose this would have made for too long a book, though."},{"Title":"Berlin Diary: The Journal of a Foreign Correspondent 1934-1941","review":"I have read about Hitler for years, but this book tops all.

William Shirer also wrote The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich. That book really moved me to search for what causes a people to go to war. Hence I have done a bit more reading on the subject with Germany as a central subject. Albeit it there are others that could have provided my center piece, Germany has too much available to a casual historian such as I have become. Germany has a history from the First Reich during the early days of the Crusades, through the Thirty Years War, the Reformation, the Unification, and finally WWI &II; to be at the forefront of Wars shaping modern Western European Civilization. In related a book Causes of WWI by James Joll, he suggests numerous causes of WWI where Germany again becomes a prime protagonist. As you read this review I want to ask you to focus your thought on the word mood, that mysterious word that instills foggy intangible phenomena that I believe breeds a nation's penchant towards territorial war. James Joll touched on it but did not bring it to the fore as I will attempt to do here in this review/essay. In part One of this report essay, I'll summarize the book. Then I'll circle back in Part Two and take excerpts of the book that demonstrates fertile ground found in their traits that allow for a mood in the German people for war. And finally I'll attempt to demonstrate how Hitler's only genius was to tap into the soul of the German mood, his mood, of the 1930's.This book takes the form of the diary of William Shirier the young reporter turned CBS News correspondent in the time of Hitler's rise to power and through Germany's conquest of France. To draw a parallel from a 21 century American perspective, I reflect on present day conversations on Vietnam, Iraq, or Afghanistan. The conversations about our leaders, the war, the adversaries, and the personal demands that war puts on our populace in general as well as direct personal experiences of individuals of either era. The history of Germany strikes both parallel and perpendicular lines with present day America. Shirer unfurls the events as they happened. Parallel lines are beginning to present themselves today. He captures the mood of the people, how the Germans reported them, the direct reactions of Germans he came in contact with, and his personal views on paper where turning each page is like turning any corner in Berlin of the 1930's.The picture you come up with is a tragic picture of a psychopathic leader and a group of subservient military leaders with too much of the same traits. Lack of Tantrums being the saving grace for 95% of them it was still a prominent trait in too many of them. In a rolling timeline from left to right, Shirer tells of his days event and then take a moment to drill down from top to bottom to capture either a focal point of Hitler's strategy to manipulate millions across the world and punctuate that strategy with a human trait of either the German people .'TIMELINEWith regard to Hitler' s strategy, he leveraged the mistakes made by world leaders of 1919 against a pragmatic thinking German society to tap into the mind and spirit of Germans. I'll talk more about the constitution of the German people but first focusing on the strategy Hitler used which at high level is to talk to his ability to bring forward the emotion he felt through 12 years of a punishment banding that with a finality of hubris superiority by world leaders of 1919, including our own Woodrow Wilson, Britain's Lloyd George, and France's Clemenceau. Hitler promised the fulfillment of the German soul with more land, land that was destined to the German people, and exacted the acquisition with a sense of revenge to upon the world's injustices toward the Fatherland. Just to use the world Fatherland with reference to one's country then begs the unique German mind and heart of which Hitler played his tune on.Hitler's rants began earlier but began to resonate with a fervor in where for example Shirer describes an event in Nuremberg, September 4, 1934: About ten o'clock tonight I got caught in a mob who jammed the moat in front of Hitler's hotel, shouting: We want our Fuhrer.\\" I was shocked at the faces, especially those of the women, when Hitler finally appeared on the balcony for a moment. They reminded me of the crazed expressions I saw back in Louisiana of some Holy Rollers who were about to hit the trail. They looked up at him as if he were a Messiah, there faces transformed into something positively inhuman. If he had remained in sight for more than a few minutes many of the women would have swooned from excitement. This was the mood of frenzy that Hitler drew out in his appeal for the Austrian Anschluss.That mood was punctuated with an event described two days later in Nuremberg, September 6, 1934: Standing there in the early morning light which sparkled on their shiny spades, fifty thousand of them, with the first thousand bared above the waist, suddenly made the German spectators go mad with joy when, without warning, they broke into a perfect goose-step. Now the goose-step has always seemed to be an outlandish exhibition of the human being in the most undignified and stupid state, but I felt for the first time what an inner chord it strikes in the strange soul if the German people. The ease for which German people could be led in to war is described shortly after: Nuremberg , September 10, 1934, Today the army had it's day, fighting a very realistic sham battle in the Zeppelin Meadow. It is difficult to exaggerate the frenzy of three hundred thousand German spectators when they saw their soldiers go in to action, heard the thunder of the guns, and smell the powder.There is much more to this review.

There is quite a bit of history in this book and I found that it functions as a good introduction to the early history of WWII. It is also enlivened by some of Mr Shirer's personal anecdotes regarding broadcasting. Mr Shirer's close access to many of the leading figures in Germany and his observations of some of the war torn areas of the early German invasions gives a very realistic and graphic portrayal of how the war evolved in Europe. It is also fascinating to hear the speculation about which path the war would take. This is one factor that makes Mr Shirer's book much more interesting than a standard history text which has the benefit of hindsight. In the Berlin Diary, the reader sees history literally being created and develops a better understanding for the difficult choices the allies faced at that time."},{"Title":"Berlin Diary: The Journal of a Foreign Correspondent 1934-1941","review":"This diary by U.S. journalist William L. Shirer (1904-1993) provides a superbly personal look at life inside Nazi Germany. Shirer was stationed in Berlin from 1934-1940, watching and reporting as Hitler crushed freedom, rearmed the German military, and eventually launched his devastating war of conquest. Readers feel like they are right there as events unfolded; from the Nuremburg rallies, to the Rhineland, the sellout at Munich, and the first year of World War II. The author sensed danger from Hitler early on, while too many others embraced appeasement or isolationism. Shirer returned home in early 1941, and within months his diary was the year's top selling non-fiction, boosting interventionist sentiment prior to Pearl Harbor. I particularly liked the author's eyewitness accounts and his quiet outrage at Nazi abuses.BERLIN DIARY is readable, gripping, and inconclusive - it was published while Hitler held most of Europe.

There are very interesting observations about the attitudes of Germans toward the dictatorship of Hitler (mostly favorable) and the war (surprisingly unpopular, although the easy conquests of German-speaking areas of adjacent countries was appreciated).The book is well worth reading, although it shouldn't be mistaken for history. Shirer was unaware of many things, and because of severe censorship he often couldn't determine what was really going on.

What I particularly liked about this book was the wealth of description of everyday life: the shortages of butter and fruit and the increase of inconvenience in daily life even as early as 1937. He paints a droll terse picture of much of the pettiness of the censorship he was subjected to and yet he acknowledges small human gestures on their part where it occurred. Rightly, he excoriates the senior Nazi leaders, Goering, Himmler and in particular the incompetent Ribbentrop, Hitler's foreign minister whom Shirer met at all too numerous press conferences. He also gives a vivid description of the horror of wartime Holland and Belgium during and after the Werhmacht campaign in 1940.He describes how the German government imposed a absurdly expensive Reichmark on the occupied territories thus enabling soldiers and officials to buy goods from these countries at ridiculously cheap prices effectively looting them. We also relax with him as he makes short journeys to neutral Switzerland to see his wife and family. His ability to paint a picture of the everyday is the real strength of this book along with his dissection of the failed policy of appeasement showing the relief of Hitler as France failed to react to the occupation of the Rhineland. It is not heavy but yet thought provoking,a first rate read."},{"Title":"Berlin Diary: The Journal of a Foreign Correspondent 1934-1941","review":"I grew up during WW II, & I have long been fascinated with what went wrong in Germany leading up to it."},{"Title":"Berlin Diary: The Journal of a Foreign Correspondent 1934-1941","review":"This was a good book but a hard read.

William Shirer was a very brave man, suffering many indignities and dangers to tell the world the true story of exactly what Hitler was doing and why. His sympathy for the British cause is obvious, and at the same time, he is perfectly honest about America's failure to step in and help at this critical time in the history of the world. This was America's disgrace, not to see the truth about Hitler, or at least not to act on it, as Britain did."},{"Title":"Berlin Diary: The Journal of a Foreign Correspondent 1934-1941","review":"I can&#8217;t say enough good things about this book, which I equate to modern day live blogging in that Shirer provides a more or less day by day account of the momentous events taking place in Europe in the lead up to World War II. Like the bloggers of today, Shirer reports from Europe (mostly from Berlin though Shirer makes his way all over the continent at various times) in relatively short entries on what is taking place in Europe. Shirer begins the account from Spain and ends it from Lisbon at the end of 1940. In addition to the current events of the time, for which Shirer has a front row seat, Shirer also provides insight on what life was like as a foreign journalist in the radio news industry and what was transpiring in his personal life. All of this makes for very fascinating reading and there are portions of this book that are quite engrossing. If Shirer had a blog at the time I would have bookmarked it and made sure I did not miss any updates. Anyone coming late to the show would make sure to get up to speed by compulsively reading all of the older posts, which while I equate to blog posts, are of a much higher literary quality to what a lot of even professional bloggers produce today.Almost all of the events of the time period are covered here and Shirer is present for many of the more important ones, e.g., the signing of the armistice between Germany and France in 1940, the initial British air-raids over Berlin, etc. Shirer also reports on a lot of more mundane goings on, e.g., attempted German censorship of his broadcasts, day to day life in Berlin and Europe at the time, etc., and this is equally fascinating. Moreover, Shirer also meets or at least has some sort of interaction with many of the leading German figures of the day.To the extent that I have any criticism of this book it lies in what I view as some excessive editorializing by Shirer regarding the politics of the day, and repeated critiques of the German people and their nature that seem overly harsh in my opinion. At times this can get somewhat tedious, overbearing and, in one case, a bit loony (when he maps out towards the end of the book how a German invasion of the United States would take place &#8211; once they hit South America they just need to roll up through Texas and then it&#8217;s over). Nonetheless, I don&#8217;t begrudge Shirer his opinions and think this is a very well-written and useful work. For the most part, Shirer&#8217;s personal take on various characters, personalities and events, adds to the work as a whole.I read this book on my Kindle iPad app and paid $1.99 when it was a Kindle Daily Deal special. I more than got my money&#8217;s worth on this one and even at the regular price of $4.99 it&#8217;s a bargain and a must-read if you have any interest in the time period. I suspect that I&#8217;ll be returning to this one for a reread in the future."},{"Title":"Berlin Diary: The Journal of a Foreign Correspondent 1934-1941","review":"Very compelling book full of stories and the telling of events that took place before World War II started and what led up to such a terrible, brutal war."},{"Title":"Berlin Diary: The Journal of a Foreign Correspondent 1934-1941","review":"It was tightly written.

They seemed to have had either a lack of understanding or lacked the political will to stop Hitler. He points out how easy it would have been to stop Hitler during the mid 1930's. It also details the character of the German people at that time. They tended to feel the war didn't affect them personally. Mainly because of the very tight control the government had over the news media, plus their feelings of nationalism.

He accurately predicts much of what was going to happen from the fall of western Europe; the Allies kowtowing to Hitler prior to the war; the machinations of the Nazi machine. The Allies should have used William Shirer as the next Nostradamus - he was that good. Nevertheless, I just read the 1940 1st edition of Berlin Diary and he certainly gives the reader a &quot;you are there&quot; feeling. I've read lots of WW2 German history and I was quite surprised to read how accurate his predictions were. Well worth reading."},{"Title":"Berlin Diary: The Journal of a Foreign Correspondent 1934-1941","review":"This book allows people of today's generation a view back through history by way of its first person narrative, but more importantly, it gives us a very important look into the character and psyche of the German people leading up to WW2.Despite a certain disdain for Aryan superiority and a tendency of the author to stereotype Germans, he emphatically and convincingly argues that the German people did NOT want war. His witness to events bears out this viewpoint, and helps one gain a deeper understanding into how an entire society can be hijacked by the ambitions of one man.It is more than a history lesson; it is a warning about current events. Today, the muslim brotherhood, a holdover from Nazi facism holds its knife to the throat of the world, just as Hitler once did.

Even in something as innoucuous as a book review we have to be vigilant for any attempts to lessen the absolute horror and revulsion we should feel for any and every aspect of Nazi Germany. The above reviewer should be profoundly ashamed of himself because this is a simple question of good vs. evil and there is no acceptable middle ground in this matter."},{"Title":"Berlin Diary: The Journal of a Foreign Correspondent 1934-1941","review":"Mr.Shirer was the right person in the right place at the right time, and fortunately recorded a contemporary account of this momentous period in German history for posterity. His detailed writings of the news industry, and its perversions of events by propaganda, afford us a ringside seat to these important world events. I was particularly struck by his insights into the German value system at the time and how Hitler so ably and instinctively exploited them. Had world leaders had his dairy to hand, history may have evolved differently. In this age of instant 24 hour television news, Facebook and Twitter, it is fascinating to watch through Mr. Shirer's eyes how news could be manipulated and even controlled for so long during an age when even radio broadcasts required vast technological complexities to effect, and news content was tightly censored.The dairy sent me to independent news sources for a more complete background of the larger world stage several times, and contributed immeasurably to my understanding of World War II in Europe, all while providing wonderful entertainment. Far from providing a mere quotidian recitation of daily events, Mr. Shirer propelled me irresistibly through history from a viewpoint that could have been provided by no other. One can only wish his posting to Berlin had lasted 5 more years."},{"Title":"Berlin Diary: The Journal of a Foreign Correspondent 1934-1941","review":"I was not sure what this book had to offer. I must say that it drew me in right from the beginning. Shirer's account of the happenings in and around Germany is fascinating. You can feel the pulse of events before they evolved , during and after.

It makes one wonder how we ever won the war and how Great Britain survived. I anticipated eagerly each new day's journal events.

Shirer offers a day-by-day history of life in Germany during the rise of Nazism and beginning of the war. That alone would be enough for a great book, but there is much more. Shirer covers many aspects of the war; he writes eloquently and accurately about the naivety of pre-war British diplomacy, strategy on both sides, and the Nazi clique. He provides an early glimpse at horrors of Nazi genocide. And his personal story is fascinating, as he travels across Europe, worries about his family, and matches wits with his censors to get as much of the story out as he can. Berlin Diary is very well written and hard to put down. Gems of description abound; for example, he describes a visit to a Lisbon casino: \\"Tonight, Ed [Murrow] and I did the casino. The gaming rooms were full of a weird assortment of human beings, German and British spies, male and female, wealthy refuges who had mysteriously managed to get a lot of money out and were throwing it about freely, other refugees who were broke and were trying to win their passage money with a few desperate gambles with the fickle roulette wheel...\\" Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Berlin Diary: The Journal of a Foreign Correspondent 1934-1941","review":"I enjoyed this book's sense of &quot;being there,&quot; and its quiet outrage against Nazi brutalities. Shirer's diary has lost none of its power since 1941, when as the world's best-selling non-fiction work it aided interventionist sentiment in the U.S. It's companion published in 1947, End of A Berlin Diary, adds illumination but isn't as moving. Although raised Presbyterian, Shirer's sympathies led some to believe him Jewish. Still, the last line of introduction sets the chilling tenor of that era; &quot;The Gestapo will find no clues.&quot;"},{"Title":"Berlin Diary: The Journal of a Foreign Correspondent 1934-1941","review":"If you haven't yet read Herr Schirer's all time classic \\"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich\\", or if you just completed it, this is the greatest companion book. Heck - even if you don't intend to read \\"The Rise and Fall\\" - read it anyway. It gives such great insight into the mind of one of the greatest correspondents of the modern era and the great historians of the Third Reich. It also helps you to see the war from the side of the German people - after all, they did have to deal with Hitler - and his legacy the longest. As you will see, this is Shirer's personal diary, in which he speaks lovingly about his wife and newborn and worries about their safety in Switzerland. He deals with his trips to the front and contacts in the foreign ministry. Extremely well written - and a great reference during the long haul of \\"The Rise and Fall\\" (Personally, I'm still pushing through \\"The Rise and Fall\\" after a year and a half - and yet it's one of the greatest books I've read) Come on!

After reading \\"The Rise and Fall,\\" though, I stumbled on \\"Berlin Diary\\" and I was riveted. Shirer's life as an American correspondent in pre-war Nazi Berlin gave him a unique position from which to observe and chronicle life under the 20th century's most bloodthirsty regime.Shirer's day-to-day observations are both precise and chilling. I was especially fascinated with how he sparred with--and often outwitted--the Nazi censors. He walked a fine line with many of the stories he filed; he was committed to giving his American readers an accurate depiction of life in Nazi Germany but knew that his characterizations were being closely monitored. I came to really admire his courage and determination, and found the book a pleasure to read."},{"Title":"Berlin Diary: The Journal of a Foreign Correspondent 1934-1941","review":"A well-written contemporaneous account of a correspondent's life in Nazi Germany up to 1940. Shirer is almost prescient in his assessment of Hitler's actions and their consequences. It is unfortunate that he could not continue his reporting after 1940, because an account of this caliber of the years when Germany was at war with America, made from inside Germany, would have been a valuable historical record. Shirer is a true journalist; while he offers opinions, they are clearly labeled as such, and do not get in the way of dispassionate reporting of the events he witnesses."},{"Title":"Berlin Diary: The Journal of a Foreign Correspondent 1934-1941","review":"There was a previous reader review of &quot;Berlin Diary&quot; on this site. It gave it a 3 on a scale of 10. I could not disagree more strongly. This is probably the most fasinating book I've ever read. I was sad when it ended. The previous reviewer criticized William Shirer as hardly being objective in the manner required of a journalist. Keep in mind you are reading a diary. A personal account of the beginning of our century's most horrific period. It was written by a man who was the right person in the right place at the right time. Berlin, Munich, Paris and Compiegne. It is the observations of someone witnessing peace slipping away because of driving tyranny (German) and bungling diplomacy (The Allies - where was the U.S.?) If I were teaching a class on WWII, &quot;Berlin Diary&quot; would be the text. Not only does it give us insights into a wide array of subplots to the war but it is the most readable bit of history ever written. I stand by that statement. Read the book."},{"Title":"Berlin Diary: The Journal of a Foreign Correspondent 1934-1941","review":"\\"Berlin Diary\\" is a classic in reportage. Shirer was a journalist stationed in Berlin from 1934 to 1940 and thus an eyewitness to the growth of Facism in Europe, especially the Nazi regime in Germany. He observes and reports on the events leading up to World War II and the stunning German victories during the first year of the war. Shirer seems to have been about everywhere that anything happened and his eye-witness accounts are priceless as background to the \\"gathering storm\\" in Europe.This is a diary which Shirer admits in his introduction was written with the thought of publication. Thus, like others I was irritated by the ethnic slurs he directs at Germans and by his obvious political partisanship. For example, he bemoans the defeat of the Republic in Spain with the statement, \\"our side has lost.\\" I can only interpret that remark to mean that he personally identified with the Spanish Republic. His remark about \\"our side\\" certainly would make me suspicious about the objectivity of any of his reporting on Spain. Clearly, however, Shirer saw his diary (published before the US entered World War II) less as a balanced piece of reportage than as an anti-Facist manifesto backed up most impressively by his personal experiences. Read in that context, \\"Berlin Dairy\\" can be appreciated as one of the essential books on the origins of World War II.Politics aside, Shirer paints an interesting picture of the life of young Americans in Europe during the 1930s with capsule descriptions of who he met, what he ate and drank, and his day to day life. Throughout the book is the atmosphere of impending doom. Shirer sensed it early and is thus one of the prophetic voices coming out of the 1930s.Smallchief"},{"Title":"Berlin Diary: The Journal of a Foreign Correspondent 1934-1941","review":"\\"Berlin Diary\\" is one of the more unusual documents to come out of World War II. First published in 1941, not long after America's entry into the war, it acted as a crucial means of informing the American public of the state of affairs in Germany up until the start of the war. Shirer spent the years from 1934 to 1940 in Europe as a foreign correspondent, and was mostly posted in Berlin during that time. As such, he witnessed the rise of Nazi fanaticism from a privileged position, often being given access to Nazi functions that the public could not attend. Shirer's better known work, \\"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich,\\" is more exhaustive and examines the subject from a slightly more detached point of view. \\"Berlin Diary\\" is the pithy, day-by-day account of what it was really like on the ground in Berlin, including all the personal difficulties and aggravations that occurred as the end of 1940 approached. It's a fascinating book which will add vital colour to anyone's attempt to understand the period."},{"Title":"Berlin Diary: The Journal of a Foreign Correspondent 1934-1941","review":"This is a great book and a terrific read. Originally published in 1941 by William L. Shirer, who worked in Berlin during the war with Edward R. Murrow and the radio team of Columbia Broadcasting System, it went on to sell almost 350,000 copies by August and remained at the top of the best-seller-list until after the attack on Pearl Harbor.Shirer worked in Berlin at a time when all of the world got its news through foreign correspondents writing in newspapers. Later, he made the leap to CBS and radio to work with the legendary Edward Murrow. The two captivated all of America with their radio broadcasts from Berlin and Europe as the war unfolded.\\"Berlin Diary\\" offers unparalleled insights into Hitler's Germany by an intelligent and talented news correspondent writing as events unfolded. Shirer was quick to learn that German Army reports on the fighting in the opening years of the war were usually frank and accurate, while those of the German Navy and especially the Air Force were not. Afforded regular access to Adolph Hitler he ponders later in the book on how easy it would have been to assassinate the German leader And he provides first-hand descriptions of Nazi leaders such as Rudolph Hess, Hermann Goering, and especially Joseph Goebbels, who most of the foreign news correspondents detested.Shirer also describes the tremendous effect the British bombing of Berlin in the early days of the war, even by small groups of Royal Air Force bombers, had on the population, depriving them of sleep and forcing the German war industry to lose valuable hours of production time. The author notes that if the British had sustained the bombing campaign and sent over even more bombers, the pressure on Hitler and the Nazis to end the war might have been tremendous.\\"Berlin Diary\\" is also a tribute to Shirer's analytical talents and his ability to piece together what is actually happening or will happen next in the war is uncanny. He is quick, for example, to find out about the Nazi extermination of those who are mentally retarted or otherwise physically incapacitated throughout Germany, a move resisted by many Germans. Of course, it is clear that the author had a wide network of contacts, who kept him informed as to developments in the Third Reich. Indeed, Shirer shows that resistance to Hitler and the Nazis early in the war, both passive and active, was at a much higher level than was generally appreciated abroad, both during the war and even after it.\\"Berlin Diary\\" is a tribute to an incredibly talented individual and to all civilian war correspondents, who lived dangerous lives in a dangerous regime to bring the news to the world. Shirer's reporting showed America the threat Hitler posed to free countries everywhere and no doubt played a role in President Roosevelt's decision to get involved in the war."},{"Title":"Berlin Diary: The Journal of a Foreign Correspondent 1934-1941","review":"Some of the reviews listed criticize this book for it's \\"opinions,\\" \\"harsh jugdements,\\" etc. This was written as a private journal, and not to betaken as an indepth, researched, polished project.

It's a true diary written day by day by someone who was at so many of the major, as well as ordinary, events throughout the thirties not only in Germany but throughout Europe. He gives you a real sense of what life was like back then, how the people felt, what the Nazis were doing, and what it was like being a foreign correspondent in a very turbulent time. Shirer vividly conveys his excitement, frustrations, and opinions in such a way that at times I felt like I was watching a 1930's movie about being a foreign correspondent. Very enjoyable, but also unsettling in a way. Shirer and the other foreign correspondends knew how bad the situation was and how bad Hitler was, but simply couldn't get that message across to their home countries. The home countries' desire to avoid war; the disbelief that war was a possibility; network policies to just report and not provide opinions; Nazi censorship; and the hope that things would change for the better were too powerful to overcome.

As a refresher for WWII and considering the current media reporting of the Far East (not much) I thought it might be a interesting look at war from the correspondents point of view. It is more than that, for history lovers and concerned current event followers, as it reads like a novel but gives much insider information that is gathered by a reporter, that either doesn't get printed and written up in later history books and then current large newspapers and publications, even from inside a highly difficult and censored German and Europe preparing, than entering WWII.The author, reporter wrote his book from his journal, kept while living and traveling inside Germany before and during WWII. It amazed me what was known and actually published, after heavy censureship by the nazi regime, but also highlighted the difficulties getting both written and voice information through to American and English communications and publishers.One of the most revealing aspects to a me, as a child of the 40's and grown child of a WWII Vet, and knowing how little many Americans knew of Germany before the war broke out, is how much and how accomodating, in some respects, the Germans were to reporters that they did censor, but allowed to stay. If indefinitely and seemingly capriciously. The interactions with Germans, Nazi's, and others higher up the Command structure after living and working in country, seemed to be much more informal but usual than todays reporters, living in country or in the States, seems able to develop. Of course today from the President down to the lowest city manager, it seems everyone can afford a Public Information Officer who filters and translates the most minor facts and propaganda, ie talking points, with little personal observation or knowledge arriving in either print or media, except as the &#34;annonomous source&#34;.Shirer, author and reporter, first copyrighted the book in 1941 and it was renewed in &#34;68&#34; and again in 2011. He travels throughout Germany, Switzerland and France alone and with members of Hitlers Reich, and from 1934 through December 1940, only occasionally visits his wife in Switerland, and later wife and new baby, who also have trouble after war starts, getting back to America.I would have given this a five star, and probably should have. It reads fast and very easily, well organized by time throughout his assignment and the history as it unfolds in Germany, well documenting the total passiveness of the German people, in part because of the control of media from almost the beginning, by Hitler and company. Shirer is kind and writing in journal style, is rather amazed (my word) at the acceptance of events like poverty and stress, by the German people, when new cutbacks (our current terms) and limits on consumption are constantly ordered, due to Hitlers orders and war preparation. It seemed to me that Hitler was very adept at the very blame and justification for inconvenience, want, rationing, rationalization etc that most major politicians and media stations and papers perpetuate today in our correspondence and media. Instead of straight answers to the 5w's and H questions, Hitler and goring were masters of blaming abuse of the German Race and nationality on any country that was inhabited by a former German, or was divided or impacted in any way by the Versaille Treaty. Of course as many know, Versaille did impose horrible restrictions on Germany, post WWI, but Shirer takes you alone with the insiders view and knowledge of how rational was transmitted to the German people with expanded irrational and expanded power and racism propaganda and ideology, through the day to day news &#34;on the street&#34; and from insiders who communicated but knew Shirer couldn't transmitt or honestly write about what was really going on.The book is well worth the reading and price, and brings many questions to mind, when watching the quick soundbites and blips on news and world reports of events in other countries. Also, rather sadly, makes me wonder if our reporters, especially in the video's and TV reports, can really report what they hear and see in the one minute sound bite and hope more of them are keeping diaries and journals, of their personal observations and knowledge. In other words, are todays reporters as open and connected in foreign lands, as these dedicated reporters of the 30's and 40's seem to have been? Will they ever be able to write about who, what, where, when and why with the same openess that Shirer seems to do, after he was able to smuggle most of his journal home to the U.S.A.? Lets hope so.With 1st amendment everywhere, hundreds if not thousands of outlets for communication, it still seems that the lesson from this book should be to question what do we actually know about foreign news and where are we getting it from? Most of us have favorite stations and many can't or won't seek out alternate views or papers and stations we don't like, even to getting in ruts with internet and blogs. But one source can have many branches from the same root, and Shirers book is a good lesson in history from the insider or &#34;boots on the ground&#34; perspective and a lesson in gathering diverse facts and intelligence, if one would be fore-warned and fore-armed. That is my opinion not a actual conclusion of the author.The only reason I didn't give this a five, is that I just finished the second but of the Churchill Trilogy The Last Lion: Volumne 2: by Manchester. Excellent also, but as it is about Churchill 1932-1940, the two books fairly march in step through pre war and war, but with my aging memory, all the politics and events in Great Britain often brought to mind some daily or weekly event in Berlin Diary, that I wished I could compare with a timeline or connect readily together. As an example, a speech or movement in Berlin with a political or apeasement move by Chamberlin, at the same time in London. The fault is mine, but it is the only reason for giving Berlin Diary a 4 star rating rather than 5.This is a older book and many people and historians have probably read it, but I hope others buy it and especially young reporters and correspondents or even Bloggers, who live or work in the Far East. It is hard to believe that leaders in N.Korea,Iran, Iraq, and Venezuela etc, quasi and outright Dictatorial regimes, and even those like Palestine who voted in a Hamas controlled government without Statehood, don't use Hitler and the 3rd Reich as the primer for international and border manipulation and propaganda.One has to wonder if &#34;leaders are born or taught&#34; how to be good and evil managers of people. Shirer gives all the daily moves as he saw them, for the total takeover of Law, then Control of Germany, by using democracy and nationalism and religious words to his advantage, prior to election through democratic means. Words have meaning, and in many ways Hitler and the Reich were masters of using them to justify arousal, then support and lastly mollify the German people to do and withstand, just about anything the regime did.Sadly, as most know, reward and punishment for disagreeing with anyone in the National Socialist Party, quickly became a fear of the average person in the general public and the international news reporters, so Berlin Diary is a good read even if one hasn't been interested in history, but is wondering how so much media can be controlled and biased today. That would be the words &#34;command, control and fear&#34;, words that are real and have varied meaning, even in our Democracy. Read this book and think about it. This isn't about the camps or much about atrocities, but is the daily politics and man on the street society of Berlin prior to and during the take over of countries and boundaries, up to 1940's, as the reporter who lived there reported and failed to report due to cenorship. Well worth the money."},{"Title":"Berlin Diary: The Journal of a Foreign Correspondent 1934-1941","review":"Extremely interesting perspective on Hitler and Germany in light of the popularity of contemporary visits (both historical and fictional) such as Erik Larson's &#34;in the Garden of Beasts&#34; and Jeffery Deaver's &#34;Garden of Beasts&#34;.

Beyond the battles, I wondered how a sane country could allow clowns and maniacs take over with an obvious agenda of hate. I also wondered how other countries were so afraid of war that they allowed Nazi Germany to thrive to a point where war was inevitable. This book doesn't answer everything, but it gives you a reporter's personal view on the ground as Hitler took over. You see how radio news reporting grew and covered these events through technological challenges and censorship. You need to know your pre-war history and not get frustrated by the lack of historical explanation, but it is worth the insights gained on how fragile the regime was if somebody had taken a strong stand."},{"Title":"Berlin Diary: The Journal of a Foreign Correspondent 1934-1941","review":"Mr. Shirer's Berlin Diary is filled with fast flowing new information and fact supported insights into events which spiraled the United States into WWII.

It makes me wonder if this could happen again, not so much in Europe but in the middle-east. People will believe anything, as the German people did and as did the people in the countries he sent his armies into and took over so easily. William Shirer's \\"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich\\" is truly the definitive story of WW2 but this one is equally shocking."},{"Title":"Berlin Diary: The Journal of a Foreign Correspondent 1934-1941","review":"I have read this book numerous times over the years, and have enjoyed reading it every time (but this one, see below). Shirer does a marvelous job capturing one slice of life in Nazi Germany, and has a marvelous viewpoint into life both for the common man in the street and the government bigwig.===The Good Stuff===* Shirer is a shrewd observer of people, and has excellent abilities to communicate those observations to his readers. He makes very perceptive comments about events he sees in everyday life, and even if his observations are not 100% accurate, they give a great picture of life in Nazi Germany.* As he is dragged through many \\"official\\" press conferences and staged events, Shirer is able to piece together the news behind the news. He translates some of the censored comments that people are allowed to make into their real message. A great example is his translation of the death notices commonly published by German families for relatives lost or killed either in war or \\"other government actions\\". While the messages were heavily censored, individual citizens managed to tell their family members' stories, which are often horrific.* Even though he is a \\"serious\\" journalist, and from an era where that really meant something, this is more of a memoir than an CBS news broadcast. Shirer sort of lets his hair down a bit, and communicates what he is feeling, his revulsion at what is happening right in front of him, and his frustration at not being able to say what he really thinks because of Nazi censors.* Although it is accidental, I found some of the technical aspects of his broadcasts to be very interesting. At the time, CBS, like most radio networks, didn't allow taped broadcasts. News had to be live. The gyrations Shirer went through to get access to telephone, and later shortwave links, between Europe and the US was fascinating. And since he was part of a very small foreign news team in Germany, Shirer often had to double as producer, broadcast engineer and politician just to keep himself on the air. The contrast between these stories, and the current crop of \\"talking heads\\" on modern news is staggering.===The Not-So-Good Stuff===* Occasionally Shirer lets his emotions get the better of him. No doubt the hypocrisy, half-truths and outright lies of the Nazi regime infuriated him. But his inability to ask direct questions of Nazi officials when he knew they were lying, and even worse, the censorship which precluded his telling an honest story, seem to have driven him crazy. Some parts of the book, particularly the later chapters allow this emotion to get in the way of the story. To be fair, the man lived in a very trying situation, and did a better job than 99.99% of his colleagues would have done.* My biggest complaint. Amazon evidently decided that having hypertext links to EVERY indexed word in the book was somehow a good idea. It was bad enough on my monochrome Kindle, where all these works just showed up as grey, underlined words. It was absolutely unbearable on my iPad, where the links all showed up in BLUE UNDERLINED text. Some pages had 15 or more of these indexed words, often in clusters. Imagine reading a book entitled \\"Berlin Diary\\" where every instance of the word NAZI, GERMANY, and HITLER is in blue underlined text?This was almost enough for me to stop reading the book, and the only reason for the 3 star rating instead of a 5 star. That may seem harsh, but it drove me nuts, broke my concentration, and in general just ruined the reading experience. And there seems to be no legal way to turn off this nonsense on either the iPad or the Kindle.===Summary===If you have never read this book, or Shirer's other worksThe Rise and Fall of the Third Reich: A History of Nazi GermanyorThe Collapse of the Third Republic: An Inquiry into the Fall of France in 1940, they are a treat for even casual WWII history fans.I have no idea if other readers will find the hypertext as annoying as I did, but I believe I will return any future books with this feature. It is just too distracting for me."},{"Title":"Berlin Diary: The Journal of a Foreign Correspondent 1934-1941","review":"These are the notes for the &#34;Rise and Fall of the Third Reich&#34;.

Knopf first edition over the internet a number of years ago as a gift for my father. As my father read Shirer's book he found himself reliving those tumultuous times which lead to his own service in World War II. My father found this book, as I did, to be a compelling read. \\"Don't give me another book like this,\\" he cautioned me later--\\"because I could hardly put it down!\\"Shirer's book is, from all appearances, an actual diary. Every short section (many of which consist of a page or less) gives the city and date of the account. Shirer criss-crosses Europe as he follows events spanning 1934-1941, beginning with Lloret de Mar, Spain on January 11, 1934 to Lisbon on December 13, 1941. The cities that he visited included Paris, Berlin, Prague, Warsaw, Nuremberg, and Munich, to name a few. On August 15, 1940 in Calais he observed \\"German bombers roaring their way to England.\\" On August 18 he was aboard a German army transport plane from Brussels to Berlin. On June 18, 1941 in Paris he described the eerie feeling that came with the 9 PM curfew that the occupying Germans had imposed on that great city.For me, Shirer's most compelling account is that of the 1938 Munich conference and agreement. On the eve of that infamous accord, on September 27, 1938 in Berlin, Shirer assessed the body language of Hitler while it still seemed possible that the Germans might have to fight to overcome the Sudenten mountain fortifications that might well have stymied their advance.\\"Hitler has finally burned his last bridges. Shouting and shrieking in the worst state of excitement that I've ever seen him in, he stated in the Sportpalast tonight that he would have his Sudetenland by October 1--next Saturday, today being Monday.\\"Shirer goes onto to say:\\"I broadcast the scene from a seat in the balcony just above Hitler. He still got that nervous tic. All during his speech he kept cocking his shoulder, and the opposite leg from the knee down would bounce up. Audience couldn't see it, but I could. As a matter of fact, for the first time in all the years I've observed him he seemed tonight to have completely lost control of himself.\\"Reporting from Munich just a few days later, on September 30, 1938, Shirer observed Hitler after he got everything he wanted with having to fire a single shot:\\"It's all over. At twelve thirty this morning--thirty minutes after midnight--Hitler, Mussolini, Chamberlain, and Daladier signed a pact turning over Sudetenland to Germany.\\"Shirer also had the opportunity to observe Hitler very early that morning in Munich:\\"How different Hitler at two this morning! After being blocked from the Fuhrerhaus all evening, I finally broke in just a he was leaving. Followed by Goring, Ribbentrop, Goebbels, Hess, and Keitel, he brushed past me like the conqueror he is this morning. I noticed his swagger. The tic was gone!\\"Shirer's book is truly an amazing account--to think that he was often near enough to Hitler that he was even able to evaluate his body language!"},{"Title":"The Team That Couldn'T Lose","review":"I have this book &amp; it is very good.

Dragonsblood for the most part falls into the second category, with a few flaws that move it down a bit within that tier.It isn't such harsh praise to say the book doesn't match the first two series (dragonflight/quest/singer/song/drums, White Dragon) since they were so good, but one does miss the deep characterization, the passion, the originality of those earlier works. It's also not on par with some of the later \\"good-but-not-great\\" ones, such as All the Weyrs, but it does a decent job of storytelling within a familiar world.Unfortunately, one of the flaws is that it's a bit too familiar plot-wise. We've seen much of Dragonsblood's story before: the plague, the race against time for a cure, the use of timing it to heal wounded dragonriders, the girl who can hear all dragons, the intemperate and/or incompetent weyrleader/weyrwoman who threatens the weyr's survival, found technology from the past helping out in the present, and perhaps most egregious, the use of a song from the past to inform the future of what they should be doing. It would have been nice to have been given a more original storyline.Dragonsblood tracks two time periods, the second generation after original colonization, focusing mostly on Wind Blossom, and 500 turns later, focusing on Lorana. During threadfall, a plague strikes first dragonlizards and then dragons themselves, calling into the question the very survival of the humans on Pern. Without going into how, both time periods race to find a cure. Wind Blossom and others must also figure out a way to get that cure to the future. It's a more compelling and fast-paced plot than most of the later Pern books, and the time switches are handled well for the most part, with little confusion. Some confusion does arise, however, from the sheer number of characters, many of whom seem a bit superfluous. Some judicious editing would have helped here.The characters range from fully fleshed out ones such as Lorana and Wind Blossom to several who are more shallowly presented and a few who simply appear and disappear both in the text and in memory.There are a few clumsy attempts to \\"explain\\" why things happen as they do in the future, those awkward \\"so that's why people call them that\\" moments that often occur in prequel books. Even worse, there are a few times where things seem to contradict earlier, accepted Pern history. The suspension of disbelief at those moments is pretty hard.The ending has a bit of a deus ex machina feel to it and is greatly burdened by the sudden influx of techno-speak. Here again, it's hard to believe what is happening, as characters in a barely-technological society are suddenly spouting gene theory and actually performing experiments, and doing it all quickly and smoothly. The ending, therefore, pulls the book down a bit in its rating.In the end, while it has its many problems, Dragonsblood isn't a bad addition to the Pern canon, though it doesn't add much. Since it's better than Dragon's Kin, the previous book and one which McCaffery worked on as well, the trend is towards improvement, which bodes well. I'm not sure there are a lot of Pern stories left to tell (the overly familiar plot in this one gives pause), but with Dragonsblood's improvement over Dragon's Kin, McCaffery junior shows he might be able to handle what ones are left. Recommended for fans of the series, who won't be as disappointed as they've been with others. But for newbies, go back and start with Dragonflight and read in publication order. Then you'll understand why so many people flock to buy even the weaker ones."},{"Title":"Dragonsblood (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"Please ignore all but the first review of this particular book. Honestly, this was *not* good work, in a few ways, it was superior to Dragon's Kin, but not by very much. And it spoils more than it helps continuing the story of Pern.~*Mild Spoiler alert.*~Anne has made a reputation for not allowing fanfiction to be written (up until very recently) about her world, Pern. Her fear was that people would warp her world in ways she did not want. However, she seems to have allowed Todd to do plenty of warping on his own. And to be honest, I have seen better fanfiction than this book! (Track down Dragonschoice, if you don't belive me.) Where this book mostly fails is in it's treatment of previous canon, storyline and characterization.Dragonsblood does not follow earlier story canon [Whers *were* an error, *not* a secret back-up plan, meant to look like a mistake]. Years of Anne telling us it was supposed to be a mistake, cannot suddenly be undone by deciding that \\"No! They weren't a mistake! They're supposed to eat Thread at night! Yeah! Because the air's all thick and stuff, and they fly in teams just like dragons!\\" Let's forget completely for a moment that: 1. Whers aren't that social (Dragonflight), and have lousy telepathy, so they couldn't really organize themselves anyway. 2. They have stubby, nothing wings that are clipped on top of it (Dragonflight). 3. How does the air get \\"thick\\" at night? 4. Anne's said in more than one place that Thread does not fall at night (http(colon)//www(dot)ids(dot)org(dot)au/~annac/dr/drmain/ammsg(dot)html, and Skies of Pern, and if it does, that's what the grubs are for. Not whers that have suddenly developed the ability to fly, and somehow eat Thread without it eating them from the inside out before it dies.Todd also unfortunately forgets basic details about the very creatures he's writting about: whers have only 2 toes on each foot, not 3, *cannot* fly, and cannot hang about during the day. Experienced Weyrfolk do not suddenly forget that gold dragon eggs are 30% larger than regular eggs, and golden-tinged, so cannot \\"regular\\" eggs cannot be confused for gold ones.And also about the world itself, Tea plants simply didn't take to Pernese soil, they were not lost because of the Crossing (Dragonsdawn), Pern does not have honey, because bees didn't survive the trip (The Dragonlover's Guide to Pern). Forgetting one or two of these things isn't so bad, its the fact that so many of these little facts are wrong and the incorrect statements repeated so much that rankles the mind of anyone who loves the original Anne books.The storylines are a tangled mess, the jumping back and forth between the first and third Passes makes following the story difficult. Between having a new character being added every few pages and sumarilly forgeting they exist or killing them, leaves little opportunity to empathize with many of the characters or even care much when they do die or dissapear. Many plotlines were started, and nothing was made of them, Todd's editor should've snapped those out when she saw them. It probably would've helped kept the book from being a 400+ page monster if she had. That's disgraceful really, just because the McCaffrey's write-something, doesn't mean it has to go into print. There is such a thing as viciously and heartlessly murdering your darlings in the editing and polishing phases of writting.Characterization was poor, lacking both in nearly any empathizing qualities or even likability. Wind Blossom was nicely portrayed as a somewhat bitter woman, forever living with the memory of her mother's standards, this created a good area of sympathizing with her, but she has no real redemming qualities to either make her even somewhat likable or able to be seen as anything but a plot device.Lorana is a Mary Sue character if there ever was one, entirely too sweet and naive for anyone's tolerance, all she wants is to do good for the world, sketching pictues (I take the time now to remind you that at the 3rd Pass, paper was replaced with hides for record keeping, only paid Artists got canvas to paint or draw on), but all those icky-bad people and that yucky-yuck disease just make things so hard for her to do all those lovely sketches that people find so enchanting. Because she's had such a hard life after that plague; \\"Wait, wasn't there The Big Plague in Moreta? Yeah, but this is another plague. They happen a whole lot, just no one talks about them, for some reason I don't really explain all that well.\\" Like they've never seen a portrait made before Lorana showed up.... She's too damn wishy-washy. And let's not start on the Talent universe infringements: her carisaks (you just couldn't say shoulder bag, could you Todd?), her Damia-style God-like telepathic powers. \\"She's so strong not only can she talk to other dragons, all of them talking all of the time doesn't seem to drive her out of her mind, and she can toss dragons /between/ to the colony days, and they aren't even hers!\\" It's nauseating, for once can we have a sona solve problems with a bit of ingenuity? Not all that tossing about of super-powers like they've been doing since Skies of Pern.Aside from those two, every other character tends to slip through the cracks of one's mind, there's nothing in particular to keep them stuck in your memory. They basically did nothing but be plot fodder, and not even good fodder at that, choking their way down the throat of the reader as they struggled to find the signifigance of naming every single person in the Lower Caverns, and medical tents, even as some of them did only minor things like bringing food in for the main characters to eat, or offering Wind Blossom a cup of klah. Is it really necessary to mention all of those people? When they have absolutely no influence over the storyline or even in the actions of the main chracters?Dragonsblood is unpolished, sorely needed to be cut by 50 pages, the hanging plots needed to be tied up, and for Faranth's sake Todd, Read ALL of your mother's books first! Get your facts straight, and make post-it notes of them somewhere where you can see them to remember that whers have two toes, that Pern doesn't have honey, that whers were an error and no amount of covering your ears and saying \\"nah-nah\\" won't unmake that statement, and for all of those little things that ruin the atmosphere of the world we've all come to know and love."},{"Title":"Dragonsblood (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"This book is nice enough on its own, but only if you disregard everything Pernese from Dragonsflight onward. While reading this book, the phrase that most popped into my mind was \\"Did Todd even READ his mother's books?\\" He basically takes Pern canon and throws it out the window, unceremoniously and unapologetically. The only way I allowed myself to enjoy this book at all was to consider it part of a parallel universe, certainly not the Pern I've been devoted fan of for the past 23 years. Canon, Todd, canon! I'm not sure which of the many, many deviations from canon I was most horrified over, but I think one of them was Todd's addition of steps (steps!!!!!!) from every single weyr within a Weyr. No! Only the queens weyrs have steps. If all the weyrs had steps to them (and can you imagine how this would be accomplished as far above the ground as some weyrs are?), I think this would have been mentioned previously. What HAS been mentioned previously is snippets that prove there are no steps; for instance, Menolly requires a ride from Mirrim and Path to reach Jaxom while he's sleeping in one of the weyrs. Moreta requires a lift from Malth to reach Berchar in S'gor's weyr. I won't even comment on the watch-whers, since others have here. I really have no problem with different writers in a series adding new content and material, but...don't make major changes to canon! There's plenty that could be added to Pern without blatantly refuting all that's been suggested throughout the series!"},{"Title":"Dragonsblood (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"I sit here wondering exactly how to describe this trainwreck and I'm totally at a loss. I have been a fan of McCaffrey's work (well, Mom's) since the mid 70s and this... its like finding out the Mona Lisa really is a man and the full version of the painting has him wearing pantaloons. I am not done with this book yet because I just...can't... force myself.I don't understand why so many female main characters in these books can speak to every dragon (Moreta couldn't, she could only speak to Orlith and Hoth) and yet each time its discovered all the secondary characters act like its so amazingly uncommon.We have a female character who - through a jumble of unrelated and to some extent unfinished incidents - makes her way to become Impressed by a queen dragon. All this takes place a few weeks prior to Threadfalling. Our heroine starts by being an artist, turns into a beast healer (vet?) and then Weyrwoman all in the first half of the book with the help of characters who vanish and never return to the story line.The \\"first fall\\" story has been done several times, but never so abysmally as here. Apparently decades of training means nothing - with each Threadfall there are dozens of dragon deaths as a planet full of inept dragonriders tries to do what in every other book they were born to do: fight thread. And the weyrfolk reaction? I've seen more enthusiasm from Oakland when the Raiders lose than Benden Weyr showed when half their dragons died.Basically, the characters are shallow. The writing & editing are poor (he makes up his own words). Instead of coming up with any plausible explanation for the things Wind Blossom hints at, he makes them all \\"secrets\\" that she is forbidden to reveal - even the fact that she had dophin assistance in retrieving objects lost in the ocean is something she had to keep secret. So many of the characters have such similar names I almost had to keep notes.Todd is nothing more than a small child dressing up in his parent's uniform pretending to be a policeman. Please, if you're a fan of Anne's, read her writing. Stay away from his."},{"Title":"Dragonsblood (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"This is another book in the long-running Dragonriders of Pern series, first started by Anne McCaffrey. Todd McCaffrey (author's son) has co-written one book with her before, but this is his first solo effort. In a nutshell, it is very bad.The problems with this book are numerous, and have all been well documented in the previous (bad) reviews. I will therefore make this brief.To begin with, the plot is incredibly complex and switches back and forth between two timeperiods 500 years apart. It was very difficult to keep the characters and events straight between the two. Also, there are way too many secondary characters that serve no real purpose. Perhaps the most annoying thing though, was that there are many characters that all have very similar names. Do we really need a D'gin, D'gan, and D'vin? It's ok to use more than 4 letters to make a name.The plot itself was pretty dry and uninteresting. The planetary plague plotline has been done and better than this. I understand that in such a long series you are going to have repeats and recycled ideas, but it needs to be done better.The thing that bothered me most was the writing itself. The prose is clumsy and I had a lot of trouble following the ideas the characters were trying to get across. The author seems to be fond of having the characters realize something without feeling to need to tell the reader what it is exactly. I spent a large part of my time wondering what the heck Wind Blossom was talking about.All in all, the diehard fans of the series will read it no matter what. If you can avoid this one do so. It does not improve the series and really adds nothing to it at all."},{"Title":"Dragonsblood (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"As a former Publisher's Weekly reviewer, I have no idea how this clunker got a starred review. Its greatest virtue is that it makes Eragon look like Pulizer material. The writing can only be described as terrible. I've taught high school fiction writing and frankly, my students' products were less clunky, repetitive and difficult to track than this. The quality is so poor that it repeatedly intrudes, making it difficult to engage with the plot. I have a high tolerance for unevenness in this series, but I may not be able to finish this one."},{"Title":"Dragonsblood (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"Overall, I enjoyed Dragonsblood by Todd McCaffrey. However, after years of reading the wonderful stories by his mother Anne McCaffrey, I have to say it definently falls short of any expectations I might have had. It was not nearly as disappointing as Dragon's Kin, but I found myself extremely frustrated by some aspects of the book. Yet, I am glad I read the book, as I did enjoy it once I was able to force myself past some of its problems.I think the major failure in the book was the emotional disconnect. One of Anne's strengths has always been drawing you into the story and into the characters. Although Todd was able to give an exellent description of the characters involved (as many as there were), for some reason I never felt connected to any character, even Lorana.I also had major frustrations with the discrepancies between Dragonsblood and the rest of the Pern series. Although there have been some explanations as to why this novel refers to Windblossom as Kitti Ping's daughter rather than granddaughter (as Anne's previous works did), I found it incredibly distracting from the story. Todd redundantly harps on the mother-daughter relationship between Kitti and Windblossom, and it seems completely out of context to the story, not to mention out of context with the rest of the Pern series.I was also bothered by Dragonsblood's claims about watch whers, starting with the one that watch whers were not accidents, and that they flew and ate Thread at night. Well, to start with, watch whers were an accident NOT an intentional design by Windblossom. Windblossom tried to make a second batch of dragons after Kitti Ping died just after finishing the genetic alterations necessary for the first ones, and she was a failure and created watch whers. Secondly, how could they EAT Thread? Thread eats all carbon-based life (including dragons, fire lizzards, and anything else in its path), so it would also eat watch whers. Finally, in all of Anne McCaffrey's Pern novels, watch whers are described as guarding the holds being CHAINED in watch wher caves. How could hords of watch whers fly thread at night and eat it if they are chained in caves? Besides, IF Thread falls at night (which I believe it was discussed that Anne previously state that this did not happen), why don't the dragons just fight Thread at night?Even beyond all the discrepancies, I had one major problem with Dragonsblood. *WARNING -- spoiling ahead!* Throughout all of the Pern series, Anne McCaffrey has made it very clear that there is an extraordinary bond between dragon and rider (example: L'tol later Lytol). In those cases, when a dragon or dragon and rider died, the entire planet of dragonriders were devestated. And the rider of the dragon who became a dragonless man or woman was completely destroyed. In most cases, they would commit suicide rather than bear their life alone as a \\"shadow of a man\\". In Dragonsblood, Todd seems to kill off dragons left and right, and although everyone is sad, the riders aren't \\"shadows\\" of themselves. In fact, when Lorana's dragon dies, she is commatose for a little while, but then she just shakes it off and goes back to saving the world. *spoiling over*All in all, I think this book could have used a MUCH better editor who actually knows the Pern books, and perhaps a little something about characterization. I did enjoy reading this book, but probably only because I enjoy reading anything about Pern. I found this book forgettable and for the first time in a Pern series book (well, beside Dragon's Kin), I had NO problem putting the book down. And I did. A lot. I recommend reading this only because I always enjoy reading more about the Pern story, but keep your expectations low and just try to ignore the discrepencies."},{"Title":"Dragonsblood (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"I am severely displeased with Todd McCaffrey's writing. It's sappy, sugarcoated, and the stuff of Disney princess movies. The corny ending made me gag and I cannot believe Anne McCaffrey chose this moron as her prodigy for Pern. Surely there are better writers out there who can continue the legacy of Pern...anyone!? I am saddened to see how Todd McCaffrey is desecrating the world of Pern one book at a time. If there were a lower rating than one star, I would give this vile waste of paper.I will never again buy another book with Todd McCaffrey's name on it!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Dragonsblood (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"Disappointing and frustrating, I sadly say. And I say this as a loving loyal Pernese.Page after page I was hoping for a breakthrough, something truly original, to reflect the creative mind of Todd. Instead, he regurgitates ideas from previous books, written by his mom. His first visit to Pern - \\"Dragon Kin\\" was to be tolerated. Now, without his mom, I found myself moving from page to page, desperately hoping for an original idea, a surprise, SOMETHING.Instead, I was reminded of Breke's loss of her dragon, Lessa's survival as a drudge among other great moments that made Pern's book what they are for me - a great reading.The psychology of mother-daughter relations or the complexes associated with scared or disfigured face, Asian culture and values, none of these is enough to make this book meet the challenge of the standard set by Anne McCaffrey. Robington's relations with his father and redeeming him through his relationship with Menoly's set a high standard for that, as did Jaxom's relationship with Laytol. The weaving of the psyches of the characters in this book doesn't even come close to that.Please, read it if you, like me, must read anything Pernese. Once you are done, try to forget it. Eventually, the bad after taste will go away."},{"Title":"Dragonsblood (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. It was so bad, I actually didn't finish it. At some point about half way through I could see where the whole plot was going, I felt no connection to any of the characters that managed to live more than 10 pages, and I was sick of the plot re-runs. Come on, is there anyone on Pern who has been able to speak to all dragons that hasn't lost their own? Lorana is an irritatingly naive character that I could see was going to kill her own dragon through stupidity. I just didn't want to have to read about it. It seemed that any character that had depth was soon to die and only the insipid or barely drawn ones were left. As others have said, there are way too many superflous characters named for no reason. The plot is a re-run of several previous dragon books. Mainly, there is no one to identify with and to like, not dragon or human.Don't waste your money."},{"Title":"Dragonsblood (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"Todd McCaffrey books are great!

And why wouldn't everyone else who went with her end up deranged too?And then there was D'gan and his riders. I'm willing to buy the fact that his dragon was so ill that it went between to die. But the rest of the fighting dragons are lost too? We've had far too many instances in which people are still thinking and sane while between. And no one from that group was healthy enough to give good coordinates to the dragons? It had to take Lorana to do it who wasn't even there?And then there was Lorana. I wanted to like her. But she was also unbelievable. Anyone who has experienced that kind of emotional pain - which kept recurring with the death of each dragon, isn't likely to be the person who can concentrate enough to learn biomedical engineering.On the whole, the book was terribly painful with all the death and had far too many confusing and non-sensical parts. I wanted to like it. But it was depressing and just just too far fetched.Why did I give it 3 stars? I guess because there were parts of it that filled in some of the gaps in Pern history and in the development of dragons, watch whers and their relationship to fire lizards.

This novel ties in nicely with the collaborative effort between Todd and Anne, Dragons Kin, and explores territory both new and familiar to Pern enthusiasts.Todd has captured his mother's gift for characterisation (although perhaps there are a few too many characters mentioned), and the action, storyline and dragons are captivating - I couldn't put this down once I started it!One major difference between Todd and Anne's writing is that Todd is not afraid to 'kill off' both characters and dragons (a major departure from Anne's work), and this adds a new dimension or edge to the story.I found this novel to be exquisitely plotted, and, as an avid and multiple reader of all the Pern novels, I challenge anyone to pick flaws with the continuity or realism of the story - well, none that haven't already been made by Anne herself.If I have one complaint, it is that towards the end of the novel the technojargon became quite incomprehensible in places, but I was able to skim through it to the essence of the story with no more than a faint grimace.Well done Mr McCaffrey - you are a worthy successor."},{"Title":"Dragonsblood (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"You know I love Pern.

I adore the world, and find Anne McCaffrey an incredible writer.That said, I've been less than interested with the most recent endeavors into my favourite world - they've all seemed rather bland, as if being written simply to continue the saga instead of because there was a compelling story to be told. I had, unfortunately, begun to believe that Pern was going the way of the dinosaurs - or the dragons, as it be!Not so, as was proven by this latest installment by Todd McCaffrey! While there are certainly elements of his writing that could stand for improvement, I was captivated by this new story; I sat down with the book around two just to do a little bit of reading before getting to my chores, and closed the book at the end of page 436 at seven having completely lost the five hours inbetween.Dragonsblood is a capable continuation of many of the characters we were introduced to in Dragon's Kin - once again we meet J'lantir, M'tal, and Kindan. The only hitch between the two books is a brief mention in Dragonsblood of Nuella's \\"gold\\" watch-wher, when we all know that Nuelsk is green! For those readers that were always intrigued by the watch-whers and felt that they deserved more, Todd McCaffrey once again shines a little bit more light onto these most mysterious cousins of the dragons, making for an altogether satisfying read."},{"Title":"Dragonsblood (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"Anne McCaffrey is the quintessential writer of fantasy books pertaining to dragons.

I enjoyed this book very much having been a loyal Pern resident since the very beginning. The only problem I had with Todd's book is his tendency to over describe the scientific portions of the plot.

I don't know if his mother will write any more books for this series, but her son is a good substitute. I recommend this book to all those who love Pern."},{"Title":"Dragonsblood (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"Dragonsblood was a brilliant variation on Anne McCaffrey's Pern series.

Looking forward to the next one."},{"Title":"Dragonsblood (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"First, a little nitpick to all you other nitpickers. In the UK edition, which both Anne and Todd McCaffrey personally state as being correct, Kitti Ping is Wind Blossom's mother, not her grandmother. Both McCaffreys say that the detail in the US editions of Dragonsdawn is an editorial error, and the UK editions should be taken more as Canon.Second, leave the nitpicks aside, it's a good book.There is actually some amazing character development in this book. She whom we assume is the bad guy, the thorn in our side, is a complex character worthy of our pity and sympathy.If I have ever encountered a flaw in Anne McCaffrey's writing, it is terms of plot development. With the worthy exceptions of the Masterharper of Pern and Dragonquest, the plots tend to be predictable and samey. The plot devices emgaged in this book were superb, with the intercutting between time periods making for an interesting read. An added sense of urgency.The reason I give this book only four stars is because of my experience of reading it. An instance which is so shocking and deeply saddening in this novel affected me so much, i could barely stand to go on except for the superb overall quality of this book and that i have never yet left a Pern novel unfinished.Finally another note to the nitpickers. Remember that this saga is a labour of over thirty years. Things change, are added to the universe as time goes on. They are not written as one great novel like LOTR or Harry Potter (shudder), subsequently broken into bits out of necessity. They are written as stand alone novels as part of a greater universe. If they were to be rewritten in the former fashion, doubtless the errors would be corrected. Just enjoy them. And look forward to the next.

Much better than Dragons kin. I've been reading the Pern books for 20 years and have enjoyed the evolution of the Planet and storylines. I always thought Anne didnt explain stuff like \\"between\\" and the draconic death/suicide in depth enough, therefore leaving ends open to be tied later. I think that the whole Benden rooms plot was excellent as this had never been explained before and the time travel and \\"Between\\" parts really capture the imagination.As Anne herself said, if she had known the series was going to go on for so long, she would have left herself a few more escape routes, as it happens I feel the conflicting storylines are passably covered up.Someone in an earlier review criticized the whole watchwhere thread eating plot,I remember in Dragonquest someone saying firelizards \\"ate\\" thread, and in Dragonsblood, the watchwhers do this also, though how they do it is a mystery without being eaten by the thread from the inside out. Maybe their intestines are acidic?Anyway, I loved it and am recommending it to all my fellow Pern fans. Cant wait for the next one!"},{"Title":"Dragonsblood (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"As a reader of Pern since Analog's publication of the short story, Weyr Search, in 1967, I've enjoyed the glimpses Anne McCaffrey has given us of Pern and its people. It was great to see that Anne had opened up Pern to another writer, her son, Todd.Dragonsblood is Todd McCaffrey's first solo foray into the world of Pern. Dragonsblood gives us new insight into the time at the very start of 3rd Pass, the third time the Red Star gets close enough to Pern for its parasitic \\"thread\\" to rain down and threaten to destroy all organic life on the planet. Once again the dragons of Pern, bio-engineered by the original colonists from the indigenous fire lizards, must flame and kill the thread before it reaches the ground.The Weyrs are preparing for the first threadfall in hundreds of years. Though no dragon or dragonrider alive has ever actually fought thread, they have kept up the traditional drills and, baring a few problems, are as well prepared as they can be. But just before thread is due to fall, the dragons, usually quite hardy, begin to get sick and die from a bacterial infection. The level of medical knowledge available to those of 3rd Pass has so degraded that not much can be done for the dragons. It seems that dragonkind on Pern is doomed. Nevertheless, the dragonriders use all of the resources and knowledge available to them and gallantly fight thread, even though they suffer terrible losses of dragons and riders with each fall.Woven into this story of the pandemic of the 3rd Pass is a second story line taking place 450 years earlier in Pern's history. The last of those who were children during Landing are now old and dying off. Because of various unforeseen hardships the colonists have faced since coming to the planet, it is obvious that much of the technology they brought with them will be almost entirely lost within the next few generations. But though strange circumstances, it becomes obvious that sometime in Pern's future, the dragons, bio-engineered only a generation ago, would be threatened with extinction and put into question the continued existence of the colony. Those who still have the knowledge necessary to create a solution to the problem, must find a way to teach it to their many-times great grandchildren, as well as preserve the necessary equipment and supplies.Some story elements might be considered clich&eacute; when used by other authors; however, in Dragonsblood, Todd McCaffrey successfully twists and blends these elements in the unique way that makes it a Dragonriders of Pern story. Todd obviously has the intimate understanding of the Pern universe expected of someone who has literally grown up with it. Though mechanically it has some rough areas, Dragonsblood is a very well crafted, fun, and emotionally wrenching Pern story that both those who truly know Pern and those who are new to Pern will enjoy. (Have your tissue box ready.)I look forward to continue following the people of 3rd pass in Todd's next Pern novel. I also look forward to reading in the new worlds I'm hoping Todd will give us entirely of his own molding and shaping, in the near future!(One request: Could you please include a list of characters to help keep track of the who's who in future stories, as we used to get with the earlier Pern novels? It would be much appreciated!)"},{"Title":"Dragonsblood (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"I have been a fan of the Pern series of books for as long as I can remember. I even loved the collaboration on the most recent book written by both mother and son. However, this recent book leaves a lot to be desired. The book was good, but it got very confusing with regards to the names of the characters. There were just too many people whose names were the same. I especially had problems with M'Hall and M'Tal (I think those names are right, anyhow). The book was fairly slow in spots as well. All in all, I was disappointed with this book, and have no intention of ever re-reading it (which is odd, since I have read all of the other Pern books over and over and over)."},{"Title":"Dragonsblood (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"With so many books in the series it can be hard to come up with a completely original plot line. As has been noted in history books, movie reviews, and the other reviews of this book, there are some plot areas that have been used previously, both in this series and others. Dragonsblood does have several hanging plots (the ship scene, the green dragon rider, and others). There are some historical inconsistencies between this book and the others. It has happened in the books Anne wrote and doubtless will occur in any future books written for the series. I was struck by the way that the book was written to show how portions of the future (read the first books in the series) may have come about or were influenced by events in the past. I noticed also that there is some attempt to make apologies and restitution or excuses for events that occured in Pern's first days (read the later books). Many have focused on the watch-wher conundrum. All I will say on the subject is that if you pay attention, even in the last days of the First Pass the creatures are already misunderstood and treated poorly. It is not so impossible for them to be almost completely removed from the Thread defense equation over the centuries and millenia of Pern's history. Our own history clearly shows that even with a written history and well known tribal knowledge some things are still inevitably lost or forgotten. The book does well to show that even the mighty dragons are not invulnerable to disease and some human failings. This book is obviously an early effort book for a new author. Not even Anne's books in the beginning were instant classics. Dragonsblood with its mistakes and some inovations serves to both show more of Pern's history and open the possiblities for more books. This book is definitely love or hate both because of the series it has been written for and the newness of the writer with his attendant mistakes. Try it at the library first if you must.

Long before Lessa made her historic leap between to the past, Lorana, another Weyrwoman, sought aid from Pern's founding mothers who were long dead in her era. To stop a plauge, much like the one detailed in Moreta, Lorana looks to the past where Windblossom, one of the women who helped colonize the planet, faced much the same thing. In both eras, the planet faces extinction, not so much from Thread as from disease.*** It is often stated in the series that it is difficult for one person to live in two times, it's hard on the reader as well. With each chapter, one must reorient themselves to what the setting is. However, the junior McCaffrey does show promise. Though Lorana lacks the vibrance of Lessa or Moreta, and any book without the MasterHarper seems deficient, there is much reason to hope that a series that had begun to sag has found new life. ***"},{"Title":"Dragonsblood (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"The fantasy of Anne McCaffrey is turned around, here,by her son who invents a three string DNA andmakes the genetics of the dragons a \\"possible\\"if improbable world. Before this we were ledto believe that this 'just happened' at some past date.The people in this episode of the series are as believableas in the past, but not maybe as well done.The result is a mixed one, but mostly on the positive side.Before reading this book the series ranked withdemons and goblins in the fire breathing dragon phase.I like the book better than the others written by the motherof the dragons."},{"Title":"Dragonsblood (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"Having read all of the Anne McCaffery-written Pern books, I took this off a shelf while staying in a friend's home. I can only agree with many of the prior reviewers who absolutely deplore the wretched inconsistencies in this tale, and add a heaping helping of criticism for the characterization in DRAGONSBLOOD.I know that Ms. McCaffery has always been opposed to fan-fic, but the quality of fan-fic would have to better than this. Plague or not, the rapid 'recovery' from dragon deaths by riders is ridiculous in light of early canon novels. The inconsistency of how riders behave when 'timing it' is involved is inconsistent even within this book, let alone when one looks at the Southern Expedition in DRAGONSFLIGHT as an example. Passionate fans typically have a greater regard for continuity than Todd McCaffery has achieved.Characters in this book are also poorly formed. Many subplots seem to be there because they amuse the author, not because they forward a plot point. Several seem to exist solely to flesh out characters -- characters who have very little to do with the overall point of the novel! Few of the characters have any unique qualities that promote reader interest in their fate, which probably makes the failure to wrap up so many of the plotlines less grating."},{"Title":"Dragonsblood (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"I am all for the son taking the reins from the mother and attempting to continue her legacy. However this time I think maybe the reins were a bit too much for the son's hands. This story is a really good attempt by Anne's son to continue and add to the Pern lore, but his writing is not quite as smooth and his storytelling is not quite as gripping. There are HUGE plot holes in the story, which I won't bring up, but suffice to say this book just didn't flow as smoothly for me as mom's do. He tried, and god love him for it, but it just didn't feel like a real Pern tale to me. He did, however, fill in some of the gaps nicely. Nice little touches that tie it to other Pern books, but it was almost like he tried too hard.I sound like a mega-fan, and I'm not that finicky. I just wanted the subtleties that Anne provides to be there, and they weren't. It was a dark story, and I honestly don't recommend it as part of the Whole Package. Sorry, son. :( You tried, but it didn't have the Magic that your mom has."},{"Title":"Dragonsblood (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"I am a long-time fan of the Pern series and this was definitely a book worth reading. I enjoyed the plot line and character development. It answered several questions raised by previous books, such as \\"What happened to the fire lizards?\\". However, Todd is not Anne and there are some weak points that a more experienced author would probably have addressed. There were places where the story seemed to have a gap. We were left at the end of a chapter wondering how a character recovered from a traumatic incident. While the jump from near-death to health was jolting, the information was not necessary to the storyline. It was, however, frustrating. In similar situations, Anne filled in what had happened either at the beginning of the next chapter or in someone's remembrance, Todd leaves it empty so the reader is left somewhat unfulfilled. If you are a Pern lover, you can enjoy the book anyway."},{"Title":"Dragonsblood (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"I'm afraid I can't agree with the first review on this new book. I love Pern and I so want Todd to carry on the legacy of his mother but he's not there yet. Anyone reviewing this book critically will, I think, have to agree with the following:1. The characterizations are good.2. The storyline is intriguing but not developed fully. Way too much time is spent on irrelevant and scientific detail. Seemed like filler to me.3. This book jumps around so much from time to time and place to place that it's difficult to keep up with who is doing what to whom.4. Too many characters! There are a startling number of dragons, dragonriders, healers, sailors, assistants, weyr folk, scientists, drummers, bystanders, etc. etc. who enter the story and are never heard from again.5. Too many tangential stories left dangling. Why all the time spent on facial surgery when nothing every happened? What about all the Iridani (did I spell that correctly?) hints from Wind Blossom without thorough explanation, etc. etc.6. What was the deal with Talia (the queen rider who suffered from timing it)? Since when do characters living in their own time suffer from timing it? It's the living in the past that causes them to suffer, i.e. F'nor timing it ten years earlier to allow the dragonets to grow up. F'nor suffered while staying in the past--he wasn't a wreck in the present during the period of time that overlapped.I really, really want Todd to succeed but he's going to have to tighten it up quite a bit to come close to his mother's fascinating creativity."},{"Title":"Dragonsblood (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"Todd McCaffrey shows promise. He has a sympathy and a knowledge of his mother's world of Pern (having grown up there, in a sense), so he knows the world and its workings intimately.He certainly has stories to tell, but there is a LOT of room for improvement in how he does so.As has been pointed out, there are WAY too many characters that appear, strut and fret their tiny moment upon the stage, and then disappear, leaving us none the wiser and the plot none the advanced. It is very hard to keep track of them all. This makes it difficult to become involved with the important ones for a while, until you realize that they are the ones that KEEP appearing.Is this rather casual (to say the least) attitude towards continuity a genetic thing?I have noticed this in a lot of Anne's books, not only in the series, (the sudden unexplained revival of the deceased Lord Oterel in \\"Dolphins of Pern\\" being the most glaring) but in the same book -i.e. the aging of characters is often a problem. For instance, most two year olds stay at that age for only one year or so... not three years (All The Weyrs of Pern). Another reviewer has pointed this out much better than I could, but addressing this could improve the stories immensely. Some of us have these nit-picky brains, and these little discrepancies just break the illusion and ruin a story which is otherwise quite enthralling.Don't get me wrong. I LOVE the Pern series! I have read all of the books multiple times, but there ARE glaring inconsistencies, and they disrupt the Harper's tale.Todd DOES rather fall into the deus ex machina plot device at the end for 'The Cure, and it is not altogether believable. The understanding of the biology and the technology that would be required to comprehend what they were doing was no longer there, even with the intensive tutoring they were supposedly getting from the Hidden Labs.He did do a very nice job with making some of the less sympathetic characters believable though... D'gan, while inflexible, stubborn and apparently experiencing testosterone toxicity had more than two dimensions. Wind Blossom was not a Nice Person either, but sometimes a Nice Person is not what is needed to get the job done...and effective does not always imply nice. I am glad she was able to redeem herself in her own eyes at the end...she deserved to do so.This, however is offset by his almost offhand treatment of what is going on in the Weyr. In \\"Dragonquest\\", losing one's dragon was guaranteed to cause suicidal depression at best. Here, it is treated almost as \\"Aw man, lost my dragon. Bummer. Oh well, life goes on...\\" Again, inconsistency....or maybe the bond between human and dragon has just deepened over the centuries as the dragons have evolved?The hardest thing a writer must do is to edit his/her own work...cut out that golden prose, get rid of that dead wood. Once Todd gets the hang of that, (*and hires a good (read: obsessive) continuity person!*) I think we can look forward to more Pern novels of the early high quality."},{"Title":"Dragonsblood (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"I love the Pern books. Anne writes characters you care about. I have cried more than once at the death of one of them. Todd writes shallow boring characters impossible to be the least bit interested in. His plots are unintersting. I will never buy a book he has written again. I might keep reading to see if he improves, but i'll get them at the library. Don't waste your money!"},{"Title":"Dragonsblood (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"First, I just want to say that I've loved the Pern series since I first read the initial trilogy in middle school over 10 years ago. It has and always will be my favorite series. However this book does not do the series justice. I could handle all of the other Todd/Anne collaborations, but when he goes off on his own...things loose their coherence. *spoiler alert* The book seems to be a mash-up of all previous books at once while adding plot points that contradict previous books. It lacks true creativity and has too many things going on at once to truly enthrall the reader. Todd also goes a little death happy. Virtually every dragon we learn the name of dies. The bond with the dragons is what makes this series, and that isn't allowed to develop in this book. We barely have time to acknowledge the main character's dragon, Arith, before he kills her. I cried every time a main dragon died in Anne's books. I wanted to with Arith, but I simply wasn't given enough reasons or time to feel attached to her. Moreover, I didn't feel like finishing the book after that. I have NEVER had that happen with a book before. Not even when I choked down the Eragon series. It leaves me very dubious about reading his next book. I think he could improve, but Anne gives him such high praise that I fear she had rose-colored glasses over her eyes for his writing and may never give him the guidance he needs to reach her level.And I just wanted to add- they need to get Whelan back illustrating. These bio-mechanical messes on the last few covers make me cringe."},{"Title":"Dragonsblood (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"I started reading Anne McCaffery when I was 12 when I picked up The White Dragon, and fell in love. I've read and re-read the series and have never lost my enjoyment or love for what she's created. When I heard that her son had continued the series I decided to give it a go and picked up Dragonsblood. The main character is a classic Mary Sue. She has no faults, amazing powers, and what not. The deaths of the dragons are treated in an offhand manner. It bends the rules and plot lines made by Anne McCaffery, it's poorly written in my opinion with the same phrases used and reused constantly. I actually couldn't finish it, and trust me I've read a LOT of horrible things before, but I couldn't. If you love Anne McCaffery's series, then read it and reread it. Don't pick these books up, they're not only a waste of money it genuinely makes me wince when compared to his mother's works."},{"Title":"Dragonsblood (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"This is probably the third time I have read through the series. You can get lost in their world feeling their triumphs and tragedies. Enjoy, become immersed, and live their lives in your mind"},{"Title":"Dragonsblood (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"While I won't come right out and say that I disliked this book, I will say that it's definitely not one of my favorites in the Pern series. It may just be that Todd McCaffrey is still coming into his own and finding his voice as a writer, but I think poor editing also played a part.I find it very hard to believe that any decent editor wouldn't have immediately chopped at least half of the characters in the book. So many people, pets, and other random names walk in and out of scenes that I found myself dizzy after only a few chapters. Also, there are far too many half-developed plotlines that initially seem to have some importance, but fade away halfway through the book.The biggest problem, however, seems to be an utter lack of emotion. The characters have no passion. It seems almost like they KNOW they're only characters in a book, and no matter what happens in the end, it doesn't really matter in the scheme of things. Their attempts at emotion fall flat, and even the death of several dragons- an event that, in Anne's books, was enough to emotionally devastate a character- seems to be forgotten after a few pages.Crucial details also seem to be missing. In Anne's Pern, you can see the vivid blue of the Harper's clothing, smell the spicy scent of dragons in their weyrs, and taste the bubblies. In Todd's Pern, however, everything seems to be a flat, dull gray, with very little in the way of scent or sound, and even after reading the entire book, I had no idea what most of the characters looked like.Todd has potential- you really, really want to like and feel for the characters, and there's always a small part of you that wants to find out what happens next- but he just doesn't reach it in Dragonsblood. He is fairly good with plot and pacing, but he desperately needs to work on a few other areas. Perhaps his next attempt will do better."},{"Title":"Dragonsblood (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"Because Pern is one of my all-time favorite sci-fi series, I've been getting each of the new books in hardcover ever since the late 1980's. Anne McCaffrey has accomplished what we lesser writers can only dream of: she has created a universe so compelling, so real, that millions of us wish that we could be whisked away \\"between\\" to visit Pern, or even stay there for good.Anne is well along in years now, so her son Todd has inherited the mantle as the official chronicler of Pern. \\"Dragonsblood\\", set at the very start of the Third Pass, some five hundred years after the arrival of the first colonists, is Todd's first solo effort. How does it stand up?Well, from a purely technical point of view, it admittedly has its share of problems. Other reviewers have gone into these in depth, so I won't dwell on them much here. I will, however, address a couple of issues before I go on to explain my four-star rating (rather than, say, two or three).One big weakness of long, sprawling, epic series, especially when the inevitable prequels start to crop up, is the problem of plot contradictions. After all, Anne McCaffrey couldn't have envisioned back in 1968 that her books would be so hugely, enduringly popular, any more than Gene Roddenberry could have predicted the same with his Star Trek series, also plagued with continuity problems. (Remember, in the original TV series, the Eugenics Wars took place in 1996, and Khan Singh is already on his way to the stars on a sleeper ship!) I'm not sure how many thousands of pages Anne and, now, Todd have written between them, but it would have to be a major headache to go back through it all every time they started a new book, and try to keep all the minutiae straight. Allowing too large a circle of hard-core fans to review (\\"beta test\\") the manuscript virtually ensures that someone will leak juicy tidbits to the Internet, so I can well understand why the authors might be hesitant to do that.If you want to talk about vexing contradictions within the Pern series, here's a real doozy for you: the sudden change in the behavior of the Red Star. In the earlier books, it was depicted as being locked in a weird resonant orbit with Pern, and the gravitational interactions of the two planets would periodically whip up batches of Thread which would rain down on Pern. It could be predicted mathematically, and would occasionally be influenced by tidal forces from other planets in the solar system. This allowed F'nor all the time he needed to observe the Red Star's cloud formations through Wansor's distance-viewer, then attempt that disastrous, near-fatal interplanetary jump astride Canth. It was all possible because the two planets never got that far away from each other, until the end of the Pass. If the Red Star tended to lurk inside the orbit of Pern, the Threads would tend to fall only during the day, as \\"Dragonsblood\\" points out.It turns out that some asteroids, most notably one called Cruithne, have been found in recent years in weird resonant orbits around the Earth. So the celestial tango of Pern and the Red Star might not be so far-fetched.However, back in 1988 or thereabouts, none of this was known. Anne McCaffrey decided that the afore-mentioned scenario was too improbable given the science of the day, so she changed things around. Starting with \\"Dragonsdawn\\", the Red Star merely passes through the inner Rukbat solar system, trailing Threads in its wake, scooped up from the Oort Cloud. Somehow, the Threads contrive to rain down on Pern in a consistent, predictable fashion, like time-released, slow-motion disaster capsules. Personally, I don't buy into it. I wish Anne had left well enough alone. But that hasn't prevented me from enjoying her later books anyway, by and large.So, compared to all that, having \\"Dragonsblood\\" mention honey, when bees were supposed to have not survived on Pern, is pretty small potatoes. Or should I say \\"tubers\\"? I winced a little, but kept reading.Another weakness in Anne McCaffrey's later novels in several series has been her villains, and it's not all that surprising that Todd would have inherited this from his mother. It's easy to understand the greed for land and power of a Fax or a Toric. Kylara was a stupid ditz out only for a good time, and deserved to lose her dragon. The Abominators, with their knee-jerk, Luddite hatred of the technological rediscoveries made late in the Ninth Pass, are echoed in real life by the deranged screeds of the Unabomber. But what are we to make of Tullea, the Weyrwoman of Benden, with her irrational hatred of Lorana, the main protagonist of \\"Dragonsblood\\"? True, we find out why, but it all seems too pat. She's like a cardboard cut-out dropped into the action only in an attempt to make it more interesting.And yet. And yet. I still couldn't put the book down. I plowed through it in a couple of days. Sometimes the entertainment value trumps the technical issues. I enjoyed the parallel plot lines, linking Wind Blossom in the First Pass with Lorana in the Third. It was nice, if bitter-sweet, to say farewell to some of my favorite \\"Dragonsdawn\\" characters, like Emily Boll and Sorka, rider of Faranth, and get to know others a little better, like Torene and Wind Blossom. As any good prequel does, we're introduced to places like a certain newly constructed sea hold, with an over-sized cavern, which will become Menolly's childhood home two millennia later. This wasn't very important to the over-all plot, but was still fun. We also get to see the Benden Weyr room which young Jaxom and Felessan stumble across in \\"Dragonquest\\"; it plays a vital role in the plot of \\"Dragonsblood\\".The characters, if not as strong as those in the early Pern books, were still by and large engaging. I found it easy to grieve for man and beast as the dragons started to die off from that mysterious, deadly malady. And it's interesting to learn more about the watch-whers, even if it doesn't quite jibe with what we knew before. If some of the plot twists remind us of \\"Moreta\\" or of the time-travel experiments in \\"Dragonflight\\" (we need more dragons, fast!!!), it can be explained away simply by observing that history has a way of repeating itself. And, after two thousand years, many things once common knowledge can well be forgotten, the very records crumbled to dust, their tattered remnants gnawed on by tunnel snakes.Anne McCaffrey herself recommends that you should read the Pern novels in their order of publication. \\"Dragonsblood\\" is certainly worthy of inclusion at the end of the list, even if it isn't the greatest of the stories. No doubt I'll read the follow-up novel which Todd is currently working on. I'd be inclined to wait until it comes out in paperback, but that's what I said for \\"Dragonsblood\\" as well. In the end, like any major fan, I just couldn't resist the temptation."},{"Title":"Dragonsblood (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"After a lifetime of picking up every Pern book I could find, I've finally reached the end. I started with DragonSinger when I was 9 years old, and even into the later books (which were somewhat irritating for me) I still was an avid reader.Todd McCaffrey has cured me of this. His books are inconsistent, boring, and have little bearing on the Pern I grew up with. If he cannot be bothered to read his mother's books, he shouldn't sit down to write in her universe."},{"Title":"Dragonsblood (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"This book is SERIOUSLY flawed. Anne would have done better to have found an accomplished writer who was familiar with her world to continue the series. It is apparent that Todd had no practical experience writing fiction and it does not seem he is well versed in his mother's work.The book is rampant with inconsistencies, logic errors, and science flaws and in several points appears to contradict what his mother wrote back in the 70's and 80's. It is rough to read, switching scenes seemingly at random, with some of those scenes appearing to be completely pointless. There are plot elements that are abandon, never to be brought back up again. The use of \\"Timing\\" to solve dilemmas borders on \`Deus Ex Machina' and is repetitious of earlier books in the series.I would recommend that the older fans of Pern, the fans who grew up reading the series, avoid this book."},{"Title":"Dragonsblood (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"I picked up this book out of curiosity and a great love of Pern. I was deeply dissapointed with Todd's previous work, Dragon's Kin. In Dragonsblood, he does better, making a book for more mature audiences.For hardcore Pern fans, the book is a bit annoying. Maybe because he is Anne's son, he takes a few liberties with her world, such as fire lizards with names ending in \\"th\\", watch whers flying, and Thread falling at night. It doesn't get in the way of the story, but it will grate some reader's nerves.The plot is all-too-similar to Moreta and Nerilka's Story. This time, the plague hits everything that the plague in Moreta does not: dragons and fire lizards. In this, Todd does a poor job. In Moreta, every loss of a rider was felt, had weight to it. In Dragonsblood, 30-40 dragons would die in a single fall and he would keep running the story. In other words, the deaths seemed trivial and unimportant, no matter how he wrote about them. Todd tried to make the crisis in the book worse to make us feel for the characters more, to make up for a thorough lack of character development in most areas, and it did not work.On the good side, reading about Wind Blossom and the other original settlers was interesting, and I personally have wanted watch whers to get more story behind them like the firelizards had (Remember the impact firelizards had in Dragonquest?). The transitions in time are labeled and easy to follow.To sum things up, if you are a more casual Pern reader, rent this from the library and see if it tickles your fancy. Longer or more die-hard fans, stay away! You may be too irritated to finish."},{"Title":"Dragonsblood (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"I am so fond of a great many characters in the Pern books, but somehow, by page 120 in this book, I still had not warmed to anyone. No one seemed real. No one came alive. I just gave up on the book.It's such a contrast to Dragonseye, which I first read about the same time. THAT was one of the best of the Pern books. It may be that Todd cares more about plot and details of Pern and less about characters. I'll definitely flip through any further book by him before buying it."},{"Title":"Dragonsblood (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"Frankly, I found this book very confusing. I was about two thirds of the way through before I realized that the plot was flipping back and forth between two different time periods (my fault for not reading the date stamps at the beginning of the chapters.) I ended up having to read the book a second time immediately after I finished it just to clear up all the confusion in my mind-- but unfortunately I was still left with many unanswered questions.The plot centers around Lorana, a girl of many talents- she can draw, she can heal, she can hear every dragon. (Although I don't know why that is supposed to be such a remarkable thing as every Pern heroine seems to be able to do so. It was terrific when Lessa could do it, okay when Brekke could do it, but after that it just got to be a little ridiculous.) Lorana can also send creatures back in time 500 years to when Wind Blossom, the daughter of Kitti Ping, is still alive and is trying to carry on her mother's work even as supplies are dwindling.Back in Lorana's time, there is a plague that is killing dragons. We have the usual stupid, hard-nosed Weyrleader, the usual \\"itch\\" Weyrwoman, and the perfect Lorana (more like a doormat) who is constantly abused by the \\"itch\\" Weyrwoman, even though she is trying to save all the dragons.Spoiler Alert!I guess the main problem I have is that Todd MCaffery was never able to make me believe that Lorana is tortured by the dragons' deaths or to make me believe any of these people feel anything at all. I harken back to the book where Brekke lost her dragon and can still feel Brekke's intense grief, a shadow that never leaves her. Not even when Lorana's own queen is killed (and flung back 500 years in time) do I really feel that Lorana is affected too much by it. Instead she troops off to her microscope every day to find a cure for the plague. I think I grieved more for her dragon than she did.And after Arith dies, I really have to suspend belief-- somehow Wind Blossom and all of her cohorts figure out that there is a plague attacking dragons in the future and they devise a way to tell those in the future how to isolate the plague and devise a cure. There is the usual cryptic song, that is so disharmonious that it is nearly lost to history, that tells Lorana et al what to do if they could only understand what it's trying to tell them. For pete's sake, why do they always have to make these songs so cryptic?Also, wouldn't it have been easier for Wind Blossom to draw the blood from Arith when the dragon fell from the sky into the past instead of burning the body immediately. Then she could have immediately identified the pathogen and left the cure for her descendants to use. But of course, that would have created a time paradox-- it makes my head ache just thnking about it!I also have to marvel at Lorana's stupidity in mixing unknown substances from 4 different vials and injecting them into her dragon, thus causing the dragon's death. Even as she's doing it, she admits she doesn't know what she's doing. Couldn't she have waited just a little bit to figure out what the vials were? (And I'm not quite sure why Wind Blossom left the vials there to begin with.)And, of course, if Lorana hadn't injected her dragon, Arith would never have gone back in time and there's that time paradox again.And after all of Lorana's agonizing about the vector for the spread of the plague, how did she suddenly realize that it was airborne? (Actually, why did it take any of them so long to figure that out would be a better question.)There is constant time travel in this book, including one completely strange time travel bit at the end that is so confusing that I still haven't figured out what happened and why.There's a lot of things I don't understand about this book, and I could go on and on about all the paradoxes and contradictions-- not to mention the extraneous characters-- Todd McCaffery seems to be determined to name every single person living on Pern in both of the time periods. He also has an annoying habit of bringing something up as though it were of supreme importance, only to completely drop it and never bring it up again.All that being said, I will say that it was nice being back on Pern again. If this is the only way we can get new Pern novels, so be it. Hopefully Todd will learn more about the world his mother created and become more adept at writing books set on this planet."},{"Title":"Dragonsblood (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"Well, I don't want to rehash what others have said so I'll just keep it to two points that bothered be throughout the book:1) Why is the author so obsessed with Watchwhers? Both Dragon's Kin & this novel feature watchwhers in vital roles, and he's changed them too much from how the creature was originally described. They weren't featured in Anne's novels for a reason. Is this the path he's going to go down with the rest of his Pern books? Dragons are far more interesting & versatile creatures. There must be something about dragons he can find to write about.2) His writing style is a bit repetitive. How many times does he write that a character \\"pursed their lips\\"? It was a bit distracting. I want to fall into a story, not be reminded that it's a story by lousy writing. Even Tolkein's frequent line, \\"Sam burst into tears\\" wasn't as annoying as this. (But then... no use comparing THOSE two...)Just my two cents. Basically I thought it was an alright read if you have to have your Pern fix, like me, but I'm very sorry that Anne McCaffrey has passed the torch. Even her worst was much better than this."},{"Title":"Dragonsblood (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"I have read several reviews either lauding Todd McCaffrey's novel, or panning it. Having recently finished DRAGONSBLOOD, I can see why this novel has become a \\"love-it-or-leave-it\\" story.Early on in my reading, it seemed to me that there were numerous continuity errors. According to reader-responses on Todd McCaffrey's official webpage, some of these continuity errors go all the way back to mistakes and slip-ups from Anne McCaffrey's original Pern stories. Whether this is a good reason, or a good cop-out for lackluster source reasearch, I'm not certain.For my tastes, there were entirely too many characters and dead-end sub-plots throughout the book. Indeed, the entire section dealing with Lorana's ill-fated sea voyage had no bearing on the rest of the book. I got bored meeting so many characters that were ancillary to the storyline. On the other hand, I think there is promise for Lorana, Kindan, M'tal, Salina, Ketan and B'nik to evolve and fill the pages of future novels.More than anything, I was disappointed that Todd McCaffrey's plot was so redundant. As has been discussed in other reviews the whole \\"Plague...Paradox-Song...Time-Travel...Psionic Heroine\\" storyline has become a too-used McCaffrey safety lever. If there are so many problems for the colonists descendents, why don't the dragonriders go back in time to the pre-Thread colony times and prepare their ancestors for what awaits them? Having been forewarned, the tech-savvy colonists could then have concentrated their not insubstantial resources on building technological and industrial centers to aid their descendents. But I digress.Having finished the book yesterday I thought that if Anne McCaffrey had written this story, her editor would have convieniently lost the manuscript. But Anne didn't write the book, TODD did. Todd McCaffrey is a relative newcomer to the mass-market book game. And while he has several projects under his belt, he has not written for as many years as his mother. I welcome a sequel, or continuation, to DRAGONSBLOOD if only to see how Todd's writing skills will evolve and improve. Case in point, if you compare Anne McCaffrey's decently good DRAGONFLIGHT to the masterpiece that is THE WHITE DRAGON, you will see how she matured as an author and a story teller. While DRAGONSBLOOD is not a good \\"Anne McCaffrey's Dragonriders of Pern\\" story, it is a decent TODD MCCAFFREY story."},{"Title":"Dragonsblood (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"This book was a disaster. Todd McCaffrey should not be allowed to play in his mother's world, because it's really quite sad what he's doing to it. Even putting aside the various canon violations that he gleefully writes into existence (Don't even get me started on the whers...I almost cried), he's just not a very good writer. His characters aren't very empathetic or realistic, and it's difficult to get immersed into the world. He jumps around like crazy between characters and the plot (such as it is) is very stale and stolen from various incarnations of previous books in the series.I am 100% sure that if his mother wasn't the writer who created this wonderful world, he would have never been published. This book and all the other Pern books by Todd are nepotism at its worst. I thoroughly enjoyed all of Anne McCaffrey's Pern books, but as far as I am concerned the series died as soon the moment her son attempted to take it over."},{"Title":"Dragonsblood (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"Question: Why would anyone spend several chapters developing a character, even have a protagonist/antagonist and sympathetic hero sub plot revolve around the main character, and then have them drop from sight for the rest of the book? Answer: Lousy writing. I love the Pern books, and this one is almost good. I understood the plot line, had sympathy for the main characters and it was a new and different plotline about the dragons getting sick. Anne in her intro praises her son's abilities to carry on the Pern saga. I disagree. I will give Todd one thing though. In the nepotistic world of science fiction series, he didn't butcher Pern as badly as Brian Herbert butchered Dune."},{"Title":"Dragonsblood (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"Talented artist and healer Lorana thinks it strange when a dragon begins to cough--dragons simply don't get sick. When her fire-lizards come down with the same symptoms, it goes beyond strange. The dragons are the first line of the planet's defense against the life-destroying threads from the red star. As disease spreads among the dragons just as the thread begins to fall, things look grim for the future of the planet.Fortunately for Lorana and the people of Pern, the biologists and ecologists who first colonized Pern and created the dragons had contemplated the possibility of disease. When one of Lorana's fire-dragons goes back across time to these ancestors, they realize they must find some way to send a message across time to their future--to save the planet.Author Todd McCaffrey follows in his mother's footsteps in writing of the Dragonriders of Pern. In fact, many elements of DRAGONSBLOOD are painfully familiar--the bitchy senior Queen-rider, the use of sudden 'discovery' of timing to increase effective dragon-power at key moments, the notion of a solution encrypted in an ancient Harper song. What are missing from DRAGONSBLOOD are the truly fascinating characters that Anne McCaffrey developed--and that made the original Dragonrider series so powerful.Todd McCaffrey does attempt to address some of the mysteries and open ends of the earlier novels in the series--the origin of the dragonrider who ended up lost in stones after being caught 'between' and possibly the absence of fire-lizards from the early books in the series when they had been known earlier, for example. I do, however, have to question how the use of 'timing' could possibly have been lost if it was so widely known during the time of this story. Surely it was too important an element of the dragonrider arsenal to be simply forgotten. Also, the connection between Lorana and the ancestral scientists seemed to rely too much on coincidence.DRAGONSBLOOD has plenty of action, conflict, and cute fire-lizards. This is far from the strongest book in the series (start with the first six which are all excellent). But fans of the Dragonriders, like myself, will be happy to see that McCaffrey's tradition is being continued across the generations."},{"Title":"Dragonsblood (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"Tod did a great job of carrying on his mother's story line with this book. I'll continue reading every \\"Pern\\" book that comes out."},{"Title":"Dragonsblood (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"If you have more than a basic understanding of biology, this book will drive you crazy! The storyline is decent, if a little redundant compared to other Pern books. But it's obvious that the author doesn't really understand how genetics works. This wouldn't be a bad thing if he would keep it vague in the story, but he tries to explain things in detail and gets them outright WRONG! I can accept some variation from Earth genetics - life would evolve differently on a different planet. However, there are some basic rules as to how genetics works that will be constant - and the author completely ignores them.(SPOILERS) Also, I find it completely unbelievable that a society with no concept of even basic cell biology will be able to learn enough about genetics to engineer a cure to an bacterial infection in just a few days. Not to mention that engineering a cure was considered a more feasible and appropriate solution than antibiotics. I'm not impressed with Todd McCaffrey's first attempt at a solo Pern book."},{"Title":"Dragonsblood (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"I was a bit skeptical about reading a 'continued' author of one of my favorite authors but was pleasantly surprised. The Dragonsblood story fit like a well loved shoe into the rest of the Pern history and lore. I hope Mr. McCaffrey continues on this path, he left characters to develop, story lines to continue and a sense of anticipation. He shows a well honed ear for the general spirit of the series, I know his Mum is very proud of him in many ways. keep up the good work."},{"Title":"Dragonsblood (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"While this is a worthwhile addition to the ever expanding line of Pern canon, it's certainly not on a par with the original trilogy. Or, indeed, with most of the later books. It is, however, the best Pern novel written solely by Todd McCaffrey to date.Unfortunately, other than the setting, there's nothing new in this one. Even the characters are the same ones from the other books he's written. It's as if he's determined to tell us the same story over and over again, each time from someone else's point of view. And it's getting boring.There's always, of course, the theory of an author tying off loose ends. Unfortunately, that doesn't happen in Dragonsblood. In fact, there are more loose ends created during the story than are tied off by the end. Quite a few of them, in fact. I won't list them all here, in case you want to read the book for yourself, but I'm sure you'll spot them.I'm actually hoping for a direct sequel to this one, in the hopes that those loose ends will get resolved, and we'll finally be done with this group of characters and we can move on to something/somewhere/someone/sometime else."},{"Title":"Dragonsblood (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"I was so thrilled that Todd McCaffrey wrote yet again another wonderful story of Pern. I thoroughly enjoyed his previous effort Dragon Harper that continued the story of Kinden. Todd is a worthy torch bearer for his mother's wonderful planet of Pern and it's beloved Dragon's. This particular installment in the Pern story was wonderful. I often wondered what had happened to Wind Blossom after Kitti Ping's death. I know Wing Blossom became vilified as the creator of the stunted watch wheres. This breed was no where near the graceful counterparts of the dragons. I had always wondered how thread was fought at night. It couldn't only fall during the day but, we were never told of any treacherous falls at night. These watch whers became more useful as fighers and not just as the family hold's \\"watch dog\\". This was a wonderful story and well worth the addition to the stories of our beloved series. Keep up the fabulous work Todd. I feel you have become a worthy bearer of your mother's torch in carrying on Pern's story. There are still other stories of this marvelous planet and it's dragons to tell us. I look forward to each and every consequently written book from Todd. Thank you for many hours of absolutely wonderful reads. I have all your mother's Pern novels in print and in electric form and as many in audible form as I can find. They are a favored series in our house. My husband does not like to read but, he read this series with alacrity which was totally unusual and only told of the superb writing of the books. Long may Pern and her dragons reign!"},{"Title":"Dragonsblood (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"Briefly... as other reviewers have covered this in much more detail...I always enjoy checking out a new Pern novel, and I thought this one started out with promise. All too soon, however, the same old plot devices start to take shape. ANOTHER woman who can speak to all the dragons, ANOTHER plague, ANOTHER consuming search through Records. (If people were forced to search through those tedious records so often, you'd think they'd do a better job of keeping them legible... you know, in case someone in the future needs to look something up.) It seemed like this book was geared for young adults. I think Todd McCaffrey shows promise but still needs to work on certain areas, give the characters a little more depth & come up with some ORIGINAL stories. No more plagues, records, 'Question' songs, and no more acting as though 'timing it' was some big secret discovery (when it's been 'discovered' in several novels to date). Here's hoping that Todd does not give up but DOES go back and re-read the first books in the series."},{"Title":"Dragonsblood (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"I very much enjoyed returning to Pern with this new book by \\"the son\\".The story is complex, a lot of jumping thru time (not just for the dragons) for the reader, and some knowledge of Pern is needed to understand and fully appreciate this story.

If this is how Todd is going to carry on in his mothers work then in me he has found a lifetime fan. This is one story that needs telling."},{"Title":"Dragonsblood (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"Though I was at first apprehensive about another author taking over my favorite series, but having read this, I can simply say... Keep them coming Todd!"},{"Title":"Dragonsblood (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"Anne McCaffrey's Pern is revisited with theis new novel by her son, Todd. We get new characters with familiar settings trying to work out lives in the far distant future of the planet Pern. As readers of the series might agree, there was not much left to address on the planet of significance when Mom left it. The son finds little new to write home about. He seems to be just filling holes.

Anne McCaffrey had a way of spinning enchanting tales with well-fleshed out characters and enthralling the reader to the point of not wanting to put the book down. Now, Todd McCaffrey continues that legacy with a fine debue.Dragonsblood starts out innocently enough with fairly captivating characters that the reader can identify with quicky, then launches into a story that takes the reader all across Pern - and even across time itself! Honestly, when I first picked up Dragonsblood, I was skeptical. I had my doubts that Anne McCaffrey's son would be as good a writer as she, simply because he was her son. But I was blown away by the complexity and detail of his writing style, the well-rounded characters, and just the way the story tosses about the reader's emotions!Overall, I couldn't have asked for a better continuity than Dragonsblood. Die-hard fans of Pern and newbies to the world alike will enjoy this book, and I highly recommend it. My only issue was that is can be a bit wordy at times, and the book is far longer that Anne McCaffrey's were (but if you're like me, you'll love that, too!) This is definately a buy."},{"Title":"Dragonsblood (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"Not too bad! Todd does a great job of taking up his mother's torch with this original Dragon Rider's novel!

Their collaboration on \\"Dragon's Kin\\" was Todd's introduction. \\"Dragonsblood\\" was done without his mother. His willingness to continue the legacy of Pern for us is very commendable and appreciated. The distenters are just rabble-rousing and are without empathy. Todd's handling of this new Pern novel was very good - better than I could have ever done! Who is to say mother didn't leave book ideas for his next ten books? The book itself was very good and any good reader should be able to follow it easily, I had no problem. The one who wrote that it was hard to believe - let me remind you that this is a FANTASY WORLD (duh) and there is license to expand or contract based on nothing but whim! Todd did very well keeping things together and presented a very enlightening plot that I had never thought could be included in the Pern series. The fact that nothing in prior Pern novels hinted at this plot - well do you know everything that happened to people in America or Africa or China all along the time line? No! Neither do we about Pern! Give the guy a chance and address your critiques to the Editor!I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a fantasy mixed with science, who is willing to support a new writer and support the legacy of a great friend, Anne McCaffrey."},{"Title":"Dragonsblood (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"awesome book full of mystery and adventure that will keep you hook.

I have, and still do, adore Anne McCaffrey and her writing within the Pern system she created. But I must admit, that her son has surpassed her. This book is not only readable, but breathtaking. It contains both shock and satisfaction. I know that I definitely was not expecting the events that happened in Dragonsblood. For any fan of Pern, I cannot more highly recommend this book. Todd McCaffrey is a superb storyteller. More than that, he's willing to allow the heroes of his stories to be /human/, in a way that has never before been seen in Pern books. This is the sort of novel that rebirths the passion for a particular series, and I can't wait to read his next Pern book."},{"Title":"Dragonsblood (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"After Todd McCaffrey wrote a very spare and disappointing biography of his mother in \\"Dragonholder\\" and co-authored the weak and uninteresting Pern novel \\"Dragon's Kin\\" with his mother and Pern creator Anne McCaffrey, I was skeptical and had very limited expectations when I heard that Todd was going to write a Pern novel without his mother. Anne's last couple of Pern novels were not up to the standards of her earlier work, and Todd's debut was disappointing, so I figured that perhaps this was a series that should be laid to rest when Anne no longer wished to write another story of Pern. Anne's imagination had provided me with countless hours of entertainment reading her various books (not just the Pern novels, but especially Pern). I could accept the end of Pern. When I began \\"Dragonsblood\\" I was pleasantly surprised. This was far better than \\"Dragon's Kin\\" and at times approached some of the better works of Anne McCaffrey.\\"Dragonsblood\\" tells two stories nearly 500 years apart in the history of Pern. Lorana is a young woman who can hear any dragon (a rare talent in Pern's history). With the second Fall ever of Thread on Pern imminent the Weyrs are understrength and there is a mysterious illness is afflicting the dragons. Lorana is also a talented healer, so she is trying to figure out how to save the dragons before it is too late. The other story focuses on a woman named Wind Blossom. Wind Blossom is the daughter (now nearing the end of her life) of the famed Kitty Ping. Kitty was the geneticist who created the dragons of Pern. So, Wind Blossom is one of the original settlers of Pern. Wind Blossom is trying to find a way to protect the dragons in the coming centuries because she fears that they may be susceptible to unknown diseases and she knows that the scientific skills necessary to save them will be lost within two generations. These two stories tie together in a way that is reminiscent of Dragonflight and Lessa's quest to bring the Weyrs forward.Thinking back about this novel, the story is not that remarkable or original in Dragonriders of Pern series. Parts of it have been seen before in \\"Moreta: Dragonlady of Pern\\", \\"Dragonflight\\", and other novels. But Todd McCaffrey's storytelling abilities are quite a bit better than I had originally thought they were. I was completely absorbed in the story. I had always wanted more stories told about the original settlers (\\"Chronicles of Pern: The First Fall\\" is one of my favorite novels in the series) and \\"Dragonsblood\\" helps fill that void. I don't know if Todd McCaffrey is going to continue to write Pern novels, but I hope that he does. It was nice revisiting this world and some of the characters and he did a good enough job that Anne should be proud and honored by his effort.-Joe Sherry"},{"Title":"Dragonsblood (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"When the colonists landed on Pern, they didn't know that the red star would align with the planet every two hundred and fifty years. When that event happens, spores from the red star fall onto Pern destroying anything organic in its path. To combat this problem, geneticists changed fire lizards into telepathic dragons that bond with a human; together they unite to fight spores or thread as it is now called in 507 years after the initial landing of the spaceship.In AL 507, Lorana sends her fire lizards away when she thinks she is dying, but she is saved and brought to Bendon Weyr where she bonds with a hatchling dragonet Arith. A plague infects the dragons killing many including Arith just when thread is coming. Arith and Lorana's two fire lizards go back to 42 AL where geneticist Wind Blossom concludes that the three visitors come from Bendan Weyr in the future. She devises a plan to help her descendents battle the deadly dragon killer plague if the future people can interpret the clues she left behind to save them.This is the first solo Pern story not written by the immortal Anne McCaffrey, but her son who obviously inherited the writing gene as readers will not be able to tell who wrote the novel without reading the cover. Two women living centuries apart work to find a cure to save the dragons and ultimately their world. There is plenty of action scenes especially when dragons and their human rider battle thread, but it is the strong characterizations especially the grieving Lorana who can communicate with any dragon while reminded of the loss of her Arith to the plague that make this a worthy entry in the long running series.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Dragonsblood (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"I am glad i added this book to my collection, however i must say that i spent a lot of time crying over old Pern friends.It was a little depressing, I guess i take my books to much to heart.

Worse, the ecological menace Thread is due to drop from the skies for the first time in two centuries. If the dragons don't rise to char Thread from the skies, Pern's fertile lands will be destroyed, condemning its people to starvation.If humans and dragons are to survive, a cure must be found. It will take the effort of hundreds of people to battle the killer cough, with help coming from the most unexpected source. The question remains: Can the Dragons be saved before Thread destroys Pern?This novel will be hard for a lover of Anne McCaffrey's Pern to put down. The transition to her son's writing is nearly seamless. Pern society, from Holds to Weyrs is depicted true to the established tradition, and the dragons are as magnificent as ever.Readers new to the \\"Dragonriders of Pern\\" series may have difficulty keeping track of the many characters in the book; however, seasoned fans will find it to be consistent with the casts in previous titles. Although the story encompasses many characters, the action does center on a handful of character who are the driving force behind the search for a cure.The plot is well developed, and the writing is up to McCaffrey standards. However, some of the sections pertaining to the genetics and science of the disease can be lengthy and involved. If the reader can get past that, they will find two engaging stories, which are nicely intertwined.Todd McCaffrey promises to be a worthy successor to his mother's writing legacy.-C.W."},{"Title":"Dragonsblood (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"I loved this book.

My only complaint - a bit too many new characters and very similar names, some who seemed to be not essential to the story. I can only hope they were introduced in this book so their stories can be revealed in future works by Mr. McCaffery.I cannot explain how excited and happy I am to see the future (and past) of Pern in the hands of such a creative and skilled storyteller. I CANNOT WAIT for the next one (PLEASE, let there be many, many more!)"},{"Title":"Dragonsblood (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"In his solo writing debut, Todd McCaffrey not only hits a home run, he slams it right out of the park! McCaffrey takes his mother's world of Pern and makes it his own. He brings his own special skills and knowledge to the story, while writing with a style similar enough to Anne McCaffrey's that long-time readers can shout for joy, while new readers can use the book as their seminal portal to Pern.McCaffrey weaves his narrative between two time periods, connected by the death of one fire lizard and the survival of another. Skillful narrative builds tension in both eras. The Dragonriders of the third pass search frantically for a cure for the mysterious illness killing off the dragons. Loss of the genetically-engineered protectors of Pern would leave no way to battle thread, which, left unchecked, would ravage the planet and destroy all life. More than four centuries in the past, Wind Blossom, the last of the original geneticists, uses technology lost to the future Dragonriders to find a cure for the future plague. How can Wind Blossom preserve the cure and the knowledge to administer it so that those who need it will find it? Does a half-remembered song hold the key to the knowledge sought by the third-pass riders?McCaffrey spices the tale with foreshadowing of events and answers to questions raised in other Pern books.

Dragonskin was a disappointing book, in my opinion the weakest in the Pern series. I attributed this to the input of Todd McCaffrey, since he was the new writer in the series. However I was pleasantly surprised by Dragonsblood. There are a few mistakes (or perhaps Todd McCaffrey simply wants to go in some different directions, so had to make a few changes to the history of dragons and watch whers).

I was so excited, I even bought the hardbound edition of Dragonsblood the very minute it hit bookshelves...What a mistake.This book is a slap in the face to longtime readers. I can't even express the heartbreak of how truly, hideously mangled it is. The writing is worse than abominable--especially when compared with the elegance of Anne McCaffrey's refined talent. For all that I'm an avid reader, I couldn't make it through the first chapter. To this day, I still can't bring myself to finish. I've read a few of the other Todd McCaffrey Pern books, and find them barely palatable. I continue to buy them and read them not so much out of any affinity for the quality of the writing, but because I still hold out some child-like hope that things will improve eventually...I know, it's foolish.Other negative reviews have very accurately reported the many errors with major and minor details, character development, plot, continuity, etc. So I won't re-invent the wheel here, but I will encourage everyone to believe them--I didn't, and I wish I had. I thought I could overlook these flaws because I had such a deep and passionate devotion, but I was wrong. That devotion just made this book all the more painful.I feel like a traitor writing a negative review for ANY Pern book, and I don't know if I'm ready yet to take that next step and join my fellow fans who are calling for a conclusion to the whole series...But I'm not sure how much longer I can stand to hold out faith for the future of Pern."},{"Title":"Dragonsblood (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"The plot (???) of this book wanders so far afield from the Pern \\"canon\\" that I almost thought I was reading a different series. Many well-established facts from the world of Pern and dragons were simply ignored; others were given ridiculous uses and explanations. But the real problem is the science of the book. It's clear that Todd McCaffrey doesn't KNOW any. I have no idea what the man does for a living, but I hope he's not a scientist of any sort. Wind Blossom's \\"explanations\\" of genetics are enough to make any real-world geneticists/biologists roll their eyes and shake their heads. The notion of trying to teach genetics to a group of people in a few HOURS goes beyond ridiculous into \\"pathetic.\\" If he's going to write about a science, he needs to get someone as a technical advisor who knows what they're talking about, because he clearly hasnt' got a clue.I'm really glad I bought a used copy; there's no way this is worth the cost of a new paperback, much less the price of a hardcover book!"},{"Title":"Dragonsblood (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"This was the most disappointing piece of fiction and really belittles what Anne McCaffrey created with her original series of books.

Sure, she's no literary giant, and she has inconsistencies in her long series, but this book just becomes more and more confusing as it goes along. There are far too many minor characters to keep track of, the body count just becomes tedious, the science is bogus, the plot is unconvincing and the time travel gets twisted into incomprehensible knots.I think what I missed most, though, is Anne McCaffrey's characterization. One of the things I liked most about her books was that her female characters were strong but feminine, and her male characters gentle but masculine. (Forgetting Killashandra, who was just a bitch.)

The series lost some of its appeal for me when the primary protagonists tended to be 10 to 15 years of age, and the main story line seemed to be how do nice kids deal with bullies while saving the world.Dragonsblood made Pern real again for me. I could smell the dragons and feel the cold stone and warm sands of the Weyr once more. The characters' motivations were real. D'gan's megalomania was well intentioned but caused no end of trouble. Lorana's emphathy was intense but balanced. And Wind Blossom's emotional baggage and relationship with Emorra was spot on.Don't read this book without reading Kindan's previous adventures (Dragon's Kin and Dragon Harper, especially) and keep in mind what these fictional folk have recently gone through. I don't want to give away details, but I think Todd McCaffrey does quite a credible job with Anne McCaffrey's Pern, the construction of complex characters, and a well-executed plot cluster. I look forward to his next."},{"Title":"Dragonsblood (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"It is difficult to listen to an audio book without commenting on the narrator. Dick Hill was wonderful. . . when he was not trying to give accents to the characters. Hill's natural voice is rich and wonderful, at times reminding me of Don Ameche. His accents detracted from the narration and were awful. Characters with Irish or Scottish names had no definable accent and wer definately not Celtic, a person with a French sounding name sounded like he was from Transylvania and Wind Blossom sounded Balkan. At times, Hill even forgot which of his characters previous spoke with an accent. Other time, he went over the top with stage play voices of people and dragons coughing, choking with rage and overcome by emotion. Rather than add to the story, they took away from my interest.This was the biggest flaw of the story. It would have been much more enjoyable if Hill had used his natural voice for all the characters, with maybe just a hint of an inflection or vocal change. Think of George Guidell or Frank Mueller. These are terrific voice talents that use just the barest trace of an accent or a mild vocal change to tell the listener who is speaking. Dick Hill could be that good if he would only trust his voice and forget the corn.I would like to thank Brilliance Audio for making the tracks so short. With 99 tracks per side, it is easy to break off at any point, transfer the disk to another player and pick up almost where you left off. I only wish more audio books were laid out like this. Thank you Brilliance Audio.I've been a fan of Pern and McCaffery's stories for many long turns. This is the first I've heard of her son taking over the tales. Todd McCaffery does a credible job and the story is unique in that it is both a sequel and a prequel. Other than his playing with time lines, there is no development of the world of Pern. I do miss Lessa, Ramoth, F'lar and Mnementh, and sadly the new characters are not up to filling their voids.Lorana is a composite character, drawn from several archetypes from the original Dragonrider Series. While there is nothing intrinsically wrong with that, the new character does not really explore any new territory either. Since this is an audio book, not a written book, I can't recall the other character's names. They are all equally forgettable.The story is mediocre at best. In Pernese terms, it was probably crafted by a Journeyman Harper who had just walked the tables. The lessons of Pern are well represented, but they do not significantly add to the overall lore of Pern. I am intrigued enough that I hope this Journeyman polishes his craft and tries again. I would like to see more new Pern stories. Hopefully in the future they will be written by a Master Harper and performed by a Master Harper as well. Dick Hill also deserves another chance."},{"Title":"Dragonsblood (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"This is one of the good books of the series that helps to fill in the time between landing and Dragons Quest. It gives some interesting insight to the dragons abilities that are confirmed in some of the other books. It is also a sad story but one that gives the people of the story hope for the future."},{"Title":"Dragonsblood (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"Over the years I've read and reread Anne McCaffrey's Pern series. So I was a bit wary of the idea of anybody else taking up the reigns. I didn't have great expectations for this book, but was pleasantly surprised.First of all, it's very readable, good pacing, plenty of suspense etc to keep you interested. And as an added bonus it continues some plot lines from Dragonsdawn which is my favorite book of the series. Many mysteries left from that book are touched on in this one, which I felt was very well done.My one complaint is Lorana and Aryth. Lorana impresses a dragon; anyone who's read any Pern books knows how huge a deal that is. Yet there is hardly anything about their relationship. It is very much glossed over as nothing more than impetus towards finding a cure.While it may seem repetitious to have Lorana hear every dragon, I thought it was intriguing how Todd made a slight shift towards not necessarily hearing every dragon, but feeling every dragon.Some very interesting ideas for Pern are created in Dragonsblood. Whether they are true to the canon, I don't know, but overall an enjoyable continuation to the series.It may not seem a good thing, when speaking of a Dragonriders of Pern book, but in many ways this was light reading. And as others have said it does lean in the direction of fanfiction. But every now and then I like a light read. While there are issues, there are also some nuggets of great information."},{"Title":"Dragonsblood (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"While I find I agree with many of the points raised in other reviews, I must protest this wholesale spindling of Todd's ability to handle the torch of his mother's Pern works. For you fans who have lambasted him for \\"not reading his mother's works\\" and for making gross errors, such as saying Wind Blossom was Kitty Ping's daughter instead of her granddaughter, may I please remind you of the decades in which we have suffered with Anne's penchant for the the same exact flaws?!Let's face it: we love Pern. It's a great concept, a gripping idea, it's peopled with memorable characters and plots that were new the first time around, indulgently tolerated the second time and frankly exasperating the third time. We shamelessly fell in love with Lessa, F'lar and Robinton and the dragons of that \\"first\\" generation. (in publication order). The next generation was at least interesting; with Menolly, Jaxom and the often annoying Mirrim dominating the landscape. But, as the next few books caused us to sigh over yet another \\"Jaxom and Ruth save the world -- again!\\" plotline, we still kept reading, voraciously, and enjoying.But, let us pause in our criticism of Todd's writing and reflect a moment on his literary background, genetically speaking. Anne herself has employed all of the faults for which her son is now castigated. After all, who was it that forgot her own major character's name, when T'ton mysteriously became T'ron...? And Anne has also contradicted herself, in several cases, from book to book (as did Tolkien, to reference the other critiquer who mentioned him). She, too, has repeated plot lines and devices, constructed both deep and cardboard characters, has inserted bizarre techno-speak into a generally medieval society, yet she is often hailed as the \\"Mistress of Science Fiction\\" (sfter Andre Norton), and the DragonLady. We still love her writing and her world and are grateful for the opportunity to share in it, mined with faults of literary style as it is.Therefore, while I found the incorrect refernces and careless writing annoying, it was a familiar annoyance and served mostly to exasperate me that Todd inherited this trait as well as so many others! That said, I say \\"Bravo!\\" to the son for taking up the mantle of his mother's work. Obviously, he enjoys visiting Pern as much as we do. Let's hope he continues to go, and that he betters his mother's somewhat careless attention to detail (or gets a good editor!)."},{"Title":"Dragonsblood (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"I will admit that I approached this book with a lot of trepidation. I've been reading Anne McCaffrey's Pern (and other) books for over 20 years and, like many of her readers, had noted a steady decline in their quality (book after book at 330-333 pages reeks of writing to a formula). Anne's collaboration with Todd on 'Dragon's Kin' didn't leave me too optimistic about the future of the series.So I was very pleasantly surprised at how good 'Dragonsblood' is. The writing is solid and competent but does lack a bit of flair (I suspect this will come as Todd gains confidence). If you're expecting this novel to read exactly like one of Anne's then you will be disappointed. Thankfully, Todd seems to be writing with an adult reader in mind so those annoying, YA flourishes are absent. The mood is darker and the action grittier...the dragons and their riders are rugged and workman-like...there's a stronger sense of \`reality' to this work.It's a promising start for Todd. As his mother hands over the creative reigns he has staked his claim on Pern and given this reader reason to look forward to his next installment."},{"Title":"Dragonsblood (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"Todd McCaffrey, in Dragon's Blood, makes his solo debut into his mother, Anne's, world of Pern. This novel is loosely a sequel to Dragon's Kin, a collaborative effort between mother and son. Todd does an excellent job of keeping to Anne's basic cannon. He keeps the basic tenets that Anne has set down in her numerous Pern novels. Todd's style, while darker than Anne's, is still readable and captivating. It would have been nice to see a stronger connection to Dragon's Kin as were fans received from Anne in her trilogies, but the story line is not adversely affected by this. The story line moves from the third pass to the end of the first pass connecting characters from Anne's Dragon's Dawn to new characters in Dragon's Blood. I rather enjoyed the time shifts and the interweaving of past and present. Todd is adept at delving into the psychological profiles of his many main characters. He reveals to the reader the full range of humanity through even minor characters.This would have been a nearly perfect Pern novel, if not for one glaring error on Todd's part. The casual Pern fan will probably not notice, but for those of us who have read and reread every book Anne every gave us on Pern, this error just may drive you crazy. In Dragon's Dawn, Anne's clear states that Windblossom is Kitty Ping Yung's granddaughter, not her daughter. It was reiterated enough times by Anne to stick in the readers' minds. A large part of Todd's story line centers around Windblossom's relationship with her \\"mother\\" Kitty Ping. It makes a reader wonder if Todd has actually read all of his mother's Pern novels. In the forward to the book, Anne comments that Todd is the only person she would trust with her child-Pern. I think she might want to reevaluate his worthiness. On the other hand, if he can be bothered to take the time to read the books enough times to avoid such gross errors, than he will do really well with Pern and Pern fans all over the world will be thrilled."},{"Title":"Dragonsblood (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"He creates great characters, but has this obsession with killing them off. and now, with his dragon plague, he kills off the whole reason for the books-the dragons. not only that, he kills off a beautiful, sweet queen dragonet!i read the book, then hid it, where i will never see it again. i dont need the additional depression of his killing of characters i come to love. his books are not worth buying, especially if you are depressed, and reading to get away from the pain of that."},{"Title":"Dragonsblood (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"As a long-time Pern fan, I'm going to strongly disagree with some of the reviews posted here. What I love the most about Anne's writing is not the scientific detail of Pern... but the sheer depth and emotions of the story being told. When I read the scene of Masterharper Robintons death in the Dolphins of Pern.... I sob. When I read of the valiant effort of F'nor and Canth in trying to reach the Red Star.... it amazes. The loss of Brekke's dragon. The joy of Menolly singing. The desperate try of Lessa to rid Ruatha of Fax. It goes on and on and on.In this way, Todd shows that he carries the torch well for, truly, we will all now remember the desperate courage of Arith and Lorana as they tried to save the dragons. The mad attempt to call the dragons home. The sob when Tullea returns Arith's now centuries old buckle to her owner. The foolish arrogrance of D'gan. I love it!Yes, yes... for those who focus on Pern arcane details, I'm sure you'll find a few bones to pick over. But the characters... the depth of emotions... the joys.. the heartaches... the loves... the fallacies of humanity... it's all there... and it's all good. I, for one, hope to amass yet another collection of McCaffrey first editions.... these from Todd!Bravo and thank you for giving us yet more great stories to read."},{"Title":"Dragonsblood (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"This is the first Pern book that I have had to force myself to keep reading.

Maybe if he had just stuck with that, instead of having a superwoman weyrywoman, with a super precocious dragong (gag me with a spoon), I could have enjoyed reading this book."},{"Title":"Dragonsblood (Dragonriders of Pern Series)","review":"The plot was very good, but the flow was too complex.

Most of the cases point to its reality as a psychosomaticmanifestation of the individuals identification with the sufferings of Jesus of Nazareth. While this view makes the stigmata less &quot;miraculous,&quot; it makes the event just as fascinating as a demonstration of what the mind can render through the flesh (those who insist that all the cases are fraudulent haven't read any serious work on the subject). Ian Wilson's Stigmata is also a good read as well."},{"Title":"Stigmata: A Medieval Mystery in a Modern Age","review":"A good book, but not a great one. The subject fascinates me so when I see a book at a discount bookstore in Philadelphia w/the title Stigmata I pick it up. The title and the cover intrigued me. However, Harrison does not break any new ground here. He uses modern day examples of people who have been given this gift from God. He explains the migration of the stigmata from Europe to America. There have been several instances of people from the U.S. with the stigmata. He also touches on the recent phenomena of other Christians besides Catholic Christians receiving the stigmata. The book is very easy to read and is neatly broken down into titled chapters so if you don't want to read about \\"cases from the past\\" you can move straight to \\"cases from the present\\" without losing anything. In other words you can read chapter six before you read chapter three and not get confused. He does have an interesting chapter on how the medical profession views these phenomena. He sites papers authored by medical doctors on spontaneous wounds and not just the stigmata type. Doctors do not have an explanation. People under close medical observation have spontaneously received scars or burns for no reason. Very odd. He mentions \\"blushing\\" as a very small example of this where an intense emotion triggers a visible physical response. I gave the book only two stars because it didn't go into any depth on the subject. I enjoyed parts, but for the most part I knew this stuff prior to reading it. I get a little annoyed after I finish a book and realize I didn't learn anything from it."},{"Title":"Stigmata: A Medieval Mystery in a Modern Age","review":"Although stigmata is a fascinating subject, this book is a tad disorganized. While it does break up past & present occurrences of stigmata into different chapters, within a single chapter, it smears one case into the next, sans clear transitions. Additionally, there is no appendix in the back to quickly & easily retrace specified cases.However, regardless of some of the book's drawbacks, the subject is extremely interesting & Mr. Harrison tries to take a neutral stance on it--he's neither overly enthusiastic nor distastefully cynical. He examines the possible psychosomatic, medical or spiritual causes of the wounds & the effects that they have on the afflicted individuals & the communities at large. He also delves into the history of the when, where & why stigmata seemingly started.All in all, if you're new to the study of stigmata, this book is a great start, but it may be too broad for someone already well versed in the subject."},{"Title":"Stigmata: A Medieval Mystery in a Modern Age","review":"This book is a wonderful introduction to the subject and covers a lot of ground. It will pique your interest and may make you want to buy &quot;They bore the wounds of Christ&quot; which is a much more detailed book but comes from a Jesuit and will therefore have a rather less sceptical approach to the matter.Noetheless, the best intro to this world including a good history of the subject and several recent subjects which don't always fit the bill of the traditional white Catholic Europeans.Catch the MGM movie STIGMATA this fall..."},{"Title":"Stigmata: A Medieval Mystery in a Modern Age","review":"Since its apparent first documentation with St. Francis of Assisi, the stigmata has been a source of profound interest in the Christian faith. While this book is very informative on the subject, it left me thirsty for more.While some believe St. Paul may have been the first to experience the stigmata because of a vague reference in Galatians 6:17, St Francis of Assisi is the first known stigmata. While others throughout history seem to have been more deserving of this gift of God, a very diverse group have been the recipients. Catholics and non-Catholics have been the recipients of the stigmata, as well as occuring in differing races and on different continents. The most striking parallel between even the most obscure cases are some of the tell-tale signs of stigmata. These traits include eating little, the location of the wounds and their shape, a very pleasant odor, an intimate relationship with Jesus, and even cases of bilocation. If you believe that all things are possible with the Lord, you should give this phenomenon a look.While cases such as Heather Woods and Padre Pio are discussed at length, I believe the author would have gained more credibility in his argument by discussing the fraudulent cases of stigmata. While these have existed, they are hardly discussed in the book. The false claims would help to authenticate the real cases. Still, I learned a great deal about real cases of stigmata in this book and would recommend it to other readers."},{"Title":"Stigmata: A Medieval Mystery in a Modern Age","review":"All things are possible.

It is an understandable problem because it is hard to put a meaningful label on something that stands apart. We say that he is the poet laureate of light verse, or a humorist, or a writer of joke verse. His detractors call him a bad poet because he is \\"not serious\\". Balderdash. He was a very serious writer. Though many have tried to copy him by going after some of his rhythms and wonderfully forced rhymes, they never pull it off because they are not as serious or as talented has he.Nash said that he looked on his work as essays in verse (pg 245) and noted several times how hard he had to work to create his works. Never mind the fact that at one book signing he wrote a couplet along with his signature and of course everyone else wanted one, too. That evening he had to spontaneously create 100 of these witty little things. It was an incredibly draining evening.What is it about Nash's work that makes it stand apart? Well, it is genuinely funny. Not because it goes in for the cheap giggle or the linguistic pratfall. It is because he has something real to say first and then has the ability to give the meaning energy and lift in fabulous words that are just right and the humor makes the point all the more meaningful and memorable. Even when he does lay the verbal egg it is done with purpose and care in a way that rewards the reader. Nash lets you know that he knows that you know that he knows what the joke is and you are in it together.This biography has a lot to do with his wife and daughters and that is appropriate since his domestic life informed so much of his work. His publishers, for magazines and books, also make many appearances since he was an author who made his living from his earnings through publishing. The New Yorker has a central place with his various editors over the years. It is all very interesting stuff.However interesting the life, it is the work we hold close and Douglas Parker makes good selections and includes a lot of appropriate, relevant, and delightful works by Nash in his text. We owe Mr. Parker a debt of gratitude and we can show that by purchasing this valuable book, reading it, and then digging into Ogden Nash once again. Maybe we can get a revival of Nashomania going!"},{"Title":"Ogden Nash: The Life and Work of America's Laureate of Light Verse","review":"Many of us probably recognize Ogden Nash as the creator of humorous poetry, but he was a man of far greater accomplishments than might be generally known.In this biography, Doug Parker gives a very complete and fascinating overview of Nash and the diversity of his works, which included movie scripts and--much to my surprise--song lyrics. Parker relates his story in manageable sequences, interspersing just enough famous lines from Nash to lure the reader into wanting to read more of the man's work. One would think that Parker knew Nash personally because of the skillful manner in which he discreetly discusses the poet's health problems, his devotion to his family, his dislike of confrontation, and the entire span of his creative life.It took an impressive amount of research to create this interesting account of Nash's life, and Parker made much use of Nash's personal letters. He does not overwhelm the reader with excessive detail, rather, he leaves the reader feeling like one who has enjoyed a great meal but has not overeaten, and who knows he can come back for seconds by reading more of Nash's work. This is an enjoyable and informative book that gives the reader a real appreciation for the talents of Ogden Nash."},{"Title":"Ogden Nash: The Life and Work of America's Laureate of Light Verse","review":"Full disclaimer: this is the biographer's daughter writing in...!This biography of Nash is complex, well-researched and scholarly, but most importantly, like Nash's poetry, it is a joy to read. I grew up hearing bits of Nash's poetry (and many other witticisms) recited throughout my childhood. At some point I probably (and unfortunately) dismissed Nash as being old-fashioned. Having now grown up, however, I see the true timelessness of his work - in fact one of his sayings was on a greeting card that I purchased this week. To embark on a journey through Nash's diverse experiences is pure delight; his life encompasses many eras, and because his unique voice was expressed in such a wide variety of genres he crossed paths with many variously talented, often famous and certainly interesting people. While these personal connections and Nash's struggles and triumphs make good biographical material, it should be noted that this material is handled with just the right touch; the biographer allows Nash's writing to stand on its own, and Nash's place in American literary history - as America's Laureate of Light Verse - becomes clear. The thing about good biographies - of writers - is that they make you want to revisit the writer's original work, and this biography accomplishes that many times over. So, even though there are plenty of poems included, you might want to keep one of Nash's original volumes handy - just for fun!

I become the kid I once was somehow, happy to hear the joke over and over again.I think Ogden Nash brings back memories for many older Americans. When I was reading the new biography Ogden Nash: The Life and Work of America's Laureate of Light Verse by Douglas M. Parker, while eating a sweet roll in Panera last week, an older man noticed. As he passed my table he said, \\"Ah, Ogden Nash, he was a wonderful man.\\" I noticed the older man, who looked like a retired executive, having a look of competence and industry, was cleaning tables. Was he laid off by a corporation, replaced by someone young? Was he working at Panera because he was unable to find a management job in the new economy, which disvalues the older, experienced worker? Is Nash for him a link to a happier time, his time?Nash has often been a bright spot in a dark time. He became popular for his humorous poetry during the Great Depression when his works began to appear regularly in The New Yorker, Saturday Evening Post, and other magazines. Because he was never paid much for his poems, he had to write and sell a lot of them, which he continued to do into the 1960s, when changing tastes made his work harder to sell. By the time of his death in 1971, he had published over a thousand poems.Nash did not only write poetry. He tried his hand as a book editor, magazine editor, screen writer, playwright, lyricist, and game show panelist. He was valued as an editor at Doubleday and other publishers, but the pay was poor and he left the profession to write fulltime. His efforts in Hollywood and on Broadway always started with lots of promise but usually fizzled. Radio and television appearances eventually paid fairly well, but poetry was his steady income.Being a writer, he often worked from home. Unlike many men of his era, he seems to have spent much time with his two daughters. On several occasions, he was the primary parent as his wife took long European vacations. It may not have been difficult to do, as the family always had servants. His wife had her own money inherited from her \\"old family\\" Baltimore ancestors. She and Nash were always able to live the country club and martini life.I think readers will enjoy learning how involved Nash was in the literary scene of the 1920s and 1930s. He knew Dorothy Parker, F. Scott Fitzgerald, E. B. White, and many others. Douglas M. Parker also tells much about mid-twentieth century world of publishing.

Nash's name may no longer be commonplace in many American homes; if so, Parker's book will go a long way in restoring Nash's name among the elite of American poets. Parker carefully presents Nash's life in chronological sequence, highlighting the influences and experiences that shaped his work. Throughout Parker liberally draws Nash's poetry into his story to allow Nash to speak for himself.

This multi-faceted biography covers all aspects of his literary and social life, and is a 'must' for any Nash reader."},{"Title":"Ogden Nash: The Life and Work of America's Laureate of Light Verse","review":"Loved the book. Ogden Nash? Not so much. As a little boy I loved his verses and would browse through THE NEW YORKER slapping the pages from left to right to see if they were carrying a new Nash poem that week. Often as not, they were, then I'd be happy, crawling away toward my treehouse to memorize his goofy sense of humor and his sophisticated attitude towards marriage. I can see how, without Ogden Nash, there might never have been a Stephen Sondheim. Parker is his ideal biographer. Obviously he had a lot of assistance from Nash's two enigmatic daughters, Linell and Isabel, whose photographs make them look like two grave Snow Whites. And yet he is not afraid to call a spade a spade, and we get the picture that the mother of these two girls, Frances, was often a Xanthippe for reasons unknown.It's great that Parker did so much work towards reconstructing Nash's other life as a Broadway lyricist, and I'm sure that his account of Nash's work with Kurt Weill and with Vernon Duke will never be excelled.He doesn't really pay much attention to the Hollywood work, however, and I don't know if he even bothered screening the Jeanette MacDonald starrer THE FIREFLY (co-written with Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett), which is nothing short of excellent.The story gets grim as Nash ages and his career takes a nosedive. You get to despise Roger Angell, Nash's editor at THE NEW YORKER, for being such an obseqious Uriah Heep, even when he's rejecting Nash's latest efforts. It's like he delights in kicking Nash's butt while kissing it at the same time. Nash seems aware of Angell's double nature, but doesn't really know what to do about it. THE NEW YORKER seems like a velvet trap--can't live without it, but it tears you to pieces inside. I also enjoyed reading the parodies or pastiches of Nash's verse that Parker has collected from all different sources, from Dorothy Parker to Scott Fitzgerald, everyone wanted a piece of the man.To top it all off, Dorothy Lamour got upset with Nash and laid into him with both barrels, when he wrote a poem for her to read on the air that contained the word \\"conundrum.\\" She thought it risque, perhaps confusing it with \\"condom,\\" and refused to save her reputation. Furious, she lashed out, \\"If you don't think I know what that word means--and that I'll be fool enough to say it on the air--you're crazy! I wasn't born yesterday!\\" Nash wrote to Frances, \\"she's very pleasant but as dumb as you would imagine.\\" (Not as bad as his opinion of poor Ginger Rogers: \\"coarse, painted, dyed.\\")"},{"Title":"Ogden Nash: The Life and Work of America's Laureate of Light Verse","review":"As I am in the middle of reading two other books, I've only scanned and read a bit of this book but what I've read has been delightful and interesting.

CAT'S CLAW is definitely the cat's meow.When Starshine adopted Cassidy McCabe, she inevitably changed her human's view of felines. The cat imparted the gift of love that her human reciprocated and eventually expanded to include concern for other felines as well. Consequently, when Cassidy's &quot;cat-lady&quot; neighbor is murdered, not only does Cassidy once again undertake to solve the murder, but also finds herself responsible for three housecats and nine feral cats. The reclusive Olivia never raises her blinds nor chats with neighbors. So when Cassidy decided to be neighborly in honor of their common concern for cats, Olivia bordered between suspicion and pleasure.For the first time in twelve years, Cassidy notices that the blinds have been raised across the street. When she investigates, Olivia assures Cassidy that she is fine. But later that evening Cassidy returns to her neighbor's home, to find Olivia dead at the foot of her own stairs with a strange &quot;mountain man,&quot; an ex-con, passed out on the couch. Convinced that the mountain man didn't kill Olivia, Cassidy feels compelled to discover Olivia's secrets and the reason for her death.Meanwhile, Cassidy's husband Zach continues his undercover work as a reporter, disguised as a drug-dealing thug in an effort to prove the dirty dealings of cops. However, the obligatory undercover personality seems to take over, pushing the gentle and loving husband aside, leaving Cassidy with a dangerous, rude imposter. So while Zach's personality disintegrates into that of a hoodlum, Cassidy finds herself busy with Olivia's cats and ex-con friend. Convinced that the man didn't murder Olivia, Cassidy will go to any length to find the real killer while the police accept a bogus confession.Matthews has an awesome talent for not only weaving excellent tales, but also memorable subplots. I want Cassidy's grandma for my own, complete with her array of wigs and saucy attitude, although I can do without her nagging mother. And to tell how much I love Starshine would require confessing that I have an orange and white kitten named just for this literary feline. Indeed, CAT'S CLAW is very highly recommended."},{"Title":"Cat's Claw","review":"I imagine many of us have a strange house in our neighborhood that puzzles us.

In Ms. Matthews' latest whodunit therapist Cassidy McCabe is getting acquainted with her cat loving, hypersensitive, timid neighbor, Olivia, when something goes deadly wrong. Personally speaking, Olivia lucked out in getting Cassidy as one of her neighbors instead of being completely surrounded by superior fuddy duds. Cassidy feels compassion for Olivia and her feral (untamed) cats so when a tragedy occurs it's the ever brave, kind-hearted, levelheaded Cassidy who tries to solve it. Also in the storyline, Zach, Cassidy's husband goes undercover as a different person in his latest reporter assignment. It makes his character a bit unlikable in this mystery. I admired the fact that the author has him apologizing to his wife and son for his moments of being a lousy husband and father. This is something only a real man can do. The characters come across as realistic; they aren't politically correct, perfectionists; they are normal. In fact, Alex Matthews' characters seemed more in touch with reality than most. I like it that Cassidy doesn't waste my time trying to hide behind a tough exterior. She thinks things out and deals with them. As far as solving the mystery, I was pretty sure I knew the murderer, but the false leads gave me doubts till the end.Brenda @ MyShelf.Com"},{"Title":"Cat's Claw","review":"Hotshot investigative reporter Zach Moran currently is working undercover to expose two dirty cops, allegedly selling illegal drugs on the night club circuit. Zach pretends he is a sleazy wannabe dealer seeking a connection to begin his new operation. His performance in this role is so good, his wife Cassidy worries that her husband's undercover persona is taking over their private life. Although she desperately wants to trust her spouse, she cannot believe Zach will resist the temptations now available to him.When someone kills the Moran's next door neighbor Olive, Cassidy decides to start her own investigation because she fears the police have arrested the wrong person. The prime suspect is a former con who Cassidy believes deeply cared for the shy Olivia and who would never harm her. Cassidy soon learns that her deceased neighbor kept files on people she felt mistreated her. As Cassidy searches for the truth that she feels is contained inside the files, the killer remains ready to strike at anyone that comes close to uncovering his identity.In CAT'S CLAW, Alex Matthews demonstrates her ability to cross genre lines by combining an exciting mystery with a terrific relationship drama. The combination will appeal to a mainstream audience. The two protagonists are believable because of their obvious love for one another even when they argue. They have grown from previous tales in this series and thus remain fresh and interesting. Animal lovers will salute Ms. Matthews for her well-written subplot on the plight of feral cats. In the final analysis what makes the McCabe series work is Ms. Matthews ability to allow her characters to evolve without changing their inner essence. Readers will eagerly await the next episode in this exciting and lively mystery seriesHarriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Cat's Claw","review":"In this fifth novel featuring psychotherapist Cassidy McCabe, murder again hits close to home.

This was my first and last read of this disappointing series."},{"Title":"Cat's Claw","review":"This book is seriously flawed in several ways. It aims to be cute, with a lot of stuff about cats. It's a much faster read if you skip over the cat stuff and Cassidy's interior monologue, which rarely adds anything to the storyline. The interior monologue is printed in italics, which makes it a lot easier to skip. The primary flaw is that Cassidy McCabe decides to investigate a murder, even though a man found sleeping on the victim's sofa with the murder weapon beside him has confessed to the killing. (And he's already done time for killing somebody else in a fit of anger.) But Cassidy is convinced &quot;he couldn't have done it.&quot; At the end she has to get herself in the obligatory dangerous situation. In short, nothing in the book works very well."},{"Title":"Cat's Claw","review":"Amateurish, cliche-ridden writing and tedious, predictible plotting ruined this book for me. It didn't help that I found both Cassidy (the sleuth) and her husband (a creepy reporter) obnoxious, self-centered, and overbearing. Way too much time is devoted to the dumb problems of this self-involved, boring couple. Cassidy is supposed to be a psychotherapist but she is so immature and lacking in insight that she is hardly a credit to her profession! She also spends hardly any time working for the first half of the book, which is never explained (or even acknowledged) A more minor complaint: I like cats, but there were too many cats in this book, even for me. But it's the unlikeable characters, predictible, thin story, and weak writing that made me dislike this book so much. I forced myself to finish the book, wondering if it would ever improve or if the author would ever realize her extremely heavy use of italics is annoying and hurts the eyes! I was disappointed on both counts. There are so many great mystery writers out there (some of my favorites are Katy Munger, Marcia Muller, Robert Parker, Sue Grafton, Jonnie Jacobs, and Anne George)...I'm not willing to keep reading authors whose work is so disappointing."},{"Title":"The days of Noah","review":"I've read the book before, this was a gift to my Pastor.

It is so hard to get across how creative, and how progressive, Shulman's humor was. He was a uniquely American voice, writing things that only Americans can appreciate at a deep level. At the same time, he was very progressive and his humor highlighted social changes that were beginning when this book was compiled. Finally, he was a master of the kind of humor that culminated in the one-liner fast-response type comedy that made the MASH series so popular. All that aside, though, Shulman was hilarious. A glance through the web for references to him shows him to have inspired many talented people, including Bob Newhart. An evening reading a Max Shulman book is to sink deep into a world that is an affectionate, yet unsparing, satire of things and attitudes American. You will laugh out loud, I promise. But, as he would say, I digress. I cannot understand why Shulman's talent is so underappreciated, and I would like to see his stuff in print again.

God Created takes readers on a delightful journey through the stages of creation. \\"In the beginning ... Silence. Spirit.\\" What transpires in this book is a feeling of connectedness, between Creator and created, and among all the life forms that inhabit our planet. God created it all. Even \\"tears and laughter, smiles, frowns, winces, hugs and friendships, too,\\" says author Bozzuti-Jones. He makes the case that nothing is a mistake - that all we can \\"hear, taste, touch, see, be, or imagine\\" comes from God. The common refrain is: \\"and so much more.\\" More than we could ever imagine, or see, or touch. And so ours is a world of infinite possibilities. What an invaluable lesson for children! The author's faith is reflected, simply, reverently, and beautifully, throughout the book.Jui Ishida's montage-style illustrations reinforce this message: there's no beginning or end to any of them; the eye is drawn seamlessly from image to image.

Many hours can be spent teaching baby to identify people...young and old, animals...large and small, and the universe...earth and beyond. There is lots of see-and-say potential as well as letter/sight-word recognition when they get to that stage.

I agree with other reviewers that it appeals across many religions. But somehow it left me feeling flat. Perhaps my expectations were unreasonably high. I read the same author's \\"Jesus The Word\\" and found it very powerful (in fact, I was in tears). \\"Jesus The Word\\" is a great book for helping young children develop a more sophisticated understanding of Jesus. \\"God Created\\" just didn't add much to a preschool/early elementary school child's understanding of God's role in creation. I enjoyed the creation story in the Bishop Desmond Tutu story bible more, as it gave more insight into God's experience of doing the creating. So, I would evaluate this one as nice, but not essential for a well rounded bookshelf."},{"Title":"God Created","review":"God Created, written by Mark Francisco Bozzuti-Jones and illustrated by Jui Ishida, isa short poetic text about the things God created - the heavens and the earth, men and women, plants and animals, etc. The book starts like this:In the beginning. . .Silence. Spirit.God created everything.The heavens, the skies, the air, the rain, the water, the earth.All the pages are illustrated with vivid paintings of people, plants and animals. These paintings illuminate the pages of the book. The illustrations have a poetic quality, too, as they match the text of the book. For instance: After a list of animals God created, are the words: \\"God created all these and much more, and much more, so much more.\\" This text is illustrated with swirls of color and light in the background. Then, the illustration flows gracefully into the next page, where there are bright pictures of birds and insects. Except for the first and last pages, all the illustrations are full, two-page spreads.What I Like: I like the simple language of the text and the beautiful illustrations.What I Dislike: Nothing.Overall Rating: Very good. 5 stars.Christine M.

What fascinated me in this book was his treatment of the color wheel. He ditches it in favor of a color triangle, which is more useful for analyzing color. The midpoint between blue and red is purple, and so on... I especially liked how he broke the color triangle into smaller triangles, which he calls \\"limited palletes\\". Each of these limited palettes he assigns a mood, which I find fascinating. For example, you can work with all of the colors in the triangle bounded by the points red-orange-purple (or any other triad that is a subset of the color triangle). Working with limitations brings out your inventiveness. Maybe I haven't done it justice here, but the color triangle is something that I've relied on ever since I've studied Sloan's great book. I found it very useful with mixing up a limited set of watercolor paints for my own book called \\"Israel in Watercolors\\" (look it up!), where I worked with a very limited set of colors (just eight), yet came up with a myriad of mixtures. A little color mixing knowlege goes a long way. Also, Sloan is very avuncular; he's like the art-loving grandfather that I never had. He has some fine anecdotes about Robert Henri (another fave artist), and some opinions that crack me up, such as \\"all nudity in art is pornography\\". There's a charm to a man like that. I love this guy, and I've got to thank him once again for turning me on to the color triangle."},{"Title":"The Rosetta Codex","review":"Richard Paul Russo first wowed me with Ship of Fools, which wowed me with both strong characters, a willingness to examine religion and the idea of god in a dark and hostile universe, and an excellent plot that remained strong throughout the entire book. After I read Ship of Fools, I picked up the Carlucci novels, which, while not as good as Ship of Fools, I found excellent as well. I had high hopes for his latest, but unfortunately they weren't all fulfilled.Russo pens an intriguing tale, but whereas his tendency to leave his worlds fairly flat and sketchy worked excellently in Ship of Fools, where it helped to add to the sense of mystery and abandonment in the work, here it leaves the world feeling undernourished and two-dimensional. Russo inserts intriguing ideas here and there in the novel, but he never fleshes them out. In particular the technology of the world of the Rosetta Codex is left very vague. This is a very tight book, less than 400 pages long, but this is also one book that would have benefited from a longer length.Likewise the characters fell flat for me. The hero, Cale, is frustratingly non-sympathetic for much of the book. The supporting cast seems to be completely defined by broad and simple character traits: Sidonie is scarred from her ordeals across the Divide, but still loyal; Cicero is old and obsessed with the study of the Jaaprana; Blackburn is an antagonist who nonetheless has a soft spot in his heart (or seems to) for Cale; the Sarakheen are Evil.My biggest problem was that the plot seemed to run at the same speed and intensity the entire book; there was no real rising action, no climax, and no resolution. The book, in my opinion, starts on one note and really ends on the same note.Despite my nitpicking, I enjoyed the book. It was far from his best work, but still an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The Rosetta Codex","review":"Personally, I loved the first half of this book. The concepts, characters, world-building, and ideas were a treat to read. I loved Conrad's World.But, unfortunately, the latter half of the book fell apart.

They made the adventure of this book shine.I would have easily given this book a full 5 stars if Richard paul Russo would've made this go in a different direction. Just became too far out...literally."},{"Title":"The Rosetta Codex","review":"The Rosetta Codex is another excellent SF novel fron Richard Paul Russo. I was lucky enough to hear the author read from this new novel last week, and I was immediately interested in the story. As it turns out, I read the Rosetta Codex from cover to cover in one long sitting. He builds a very believable universe which in many ways reminds me of my favorite space opera and 'world builder' science fiction novels from the old school of SF writers. I enjoyed the lead characters and I think the author could easily write another novel set in this universe given the interesting ideas unleashed in this one."},{"Title":"The Rosetta Codex","review":"My fisrt introduction to this author was \\"Ship of Fools\\" which I must say I was more than a little astonished by.

They turn Cale into a slave.A decade passes when Blackburn the trader enables Cale to escape with him to Morningstar where he meets Sidonie, who survived her desert ordeal. She takes him home to his wealthy family. However, Cale believes that Morningstar is built on top of an alien culture and has found an ancient tome with weird metallic pages containing strange writings that he found in the desert. His family and Sidonie want him to stay home and cannot understand why Cale is obsessed with locating and entering the alien gate that his reference mentions unaware that friends are enemies planning to use him.THE ROSETTA CODEX is a very complex science fiction thriller from start to finish. Readers will enjoy journeying with Cale whose captivity along with the book he found shape his existence though that upsets his family. The story line is action-packed and the support cast is established to enhance the plot. However, this fine alien planet thriller belongs to Cale, whose enslavement has made him so different from his family that they cannot comprehend his need to return to the place of horrors and believe he is a fool to want to ship out again.

Yes, it's low-key, less on gadgets and more on world- and character-building, but I could not put it down. One of those books I looked forward to returning to again and again. The first half was more a coming-of-age tale, surreal in places, reminiscent of the early Dark Tower books by King. In the second half, everything comes together in a sort of pre-ordained destiny for the main character. The characters themselves were well-drawn, never stale, always interesting, and the many worlds and settings fascinating. The ending, I felt, was very satsifying. Russo's style is steady, and consistently good, reminding me very much of the writing of Ben Bova, another favorite of mine. As this is my first Richard Paul Russo novel, I'm looking forward to picking up another very soon."},{"Title":"The Rosetta Codex","review":"SHIP OF FOOLS was one of my top Sci-fi reads of all times so I was expecting something grand but was greatly disappointed by this alleged \\"space opera\\". Comparing THE ROSETTA CODEX to the space operas of, say, Alistair Reynolds is like comparing a VW Beatle with a Mercedes. Starting with the obvious. The story makes 0 (zero) sense. It's another case of an age of hyper-technology where Bronze Age folks live placidly side by side with miraculous technology. People travel to the stars, create wondrous materials, build fantastical buildings but ride in canoes!! Also making no sense is the Codex itself. It it's purpose was re-genesis of an alien race then why go to the trouble of writing it in various Earth languages? And why does the race need regenerating in the first place? And why can't the the humans figure out this alien language except through a Rosetta Stone/Codex? In the far future do computers exist and if so, wouldn't they be slightly more powerful than a Dell laptop circa 2008?Not only was the plot awful, it was also boring and tedious and VERY light reading - more operetta than opera. Big writing, large font, short paragraphs AND chapters. The story starts with Cale, age 5, jumps to age 14, then jumps again to age 17 (or 18 - we're not sure). What little action that does exist is quite tame and VERY brief. He has a few close encounters with the opposite sex that end up badly. Fully a fourth of the book is given over to what may be the most boring overland treks in modern literature. Along the way he meets a few people, almost all of which are thoroughly unremarkable. During one stop in a \\"ghost town\\" Cale, our intrepid hero, finds an alien \\"book\\". (Who would have imagined that ultra-advanced aliens read and published books like you and me and stored their data in such a perishable format instead of, for example, a disk or cube? Oh well, ours is not to reason why...) The Rosetta Codex was surrounded by heavy, stones that emitted a blue glow. They show up one more time in the story before disappearing without a trace or an explanation. A stranger stalks and attempts to aid young Cale several times in his life before finally turning against him. The reason for this interest is never explained like so many things. The ending is par for the course, hokey as hogwash, predictable sci-fi fare - pass through a mysterious space gate to another dimension, enter a futuristic large complex, meet a not-so-weird advanced alien who, in order to communicate, crams what appears to be a football helmet on a retarded man (sorry - it's not my tale). This alien is also able to discern between good and evil humans and sticks up for the good guys (our hero, of course). By the way, the alien moves and talks like Klaatu, the fake robotic creature in THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL. At least he did not give us a warning about atomic weapons. My grade - D-"},{"Title":"The Rosetta Codex","review":"While this is far from the best book I have read it is a solid enjoyable read. In the story you follow behind the main character Cale as he goes from infancy to old age, and likewise progresses up the later of technology. This, more so than the specifics of the plot, was what made it interesting to me. In the beginning of the story he and his nanny crash land on a dirt bag of a planet in an attempt to escape from a ship after his aristocratic father. Cale is then captured and raised in a technology deprived penal country split off from the rest of the continent by a gigantic tear in the earth. He escapes his cruel barbarian captors (a few times) and finally heads to the bridge to the more technologically advanced side of the planet. In the process he learns to read and finds an ancient alien shrine with a weird metal book (the codex).Over this coarse of events you see him ages up to young adult hood, and in the city, keeps on aging allowing the reader see him grow. Much of the middle part of the book has very little to do with the codex, you just get to watch him grow older and form relationships, finally reestablishing a connection with his real family, which is now in heavy decline from it's previous standing.Ultimately he (now in old age) uses the codex to plot a course to find the aliens. I do have to admit the ending was a little disappointing. It sets it up to have a big and interesting moral question that ultimately doesn't pan out. However, up until the point right at the end I really enjoyed it, and the book as a whole was good enough to survive the mild let down."},{"Title":"The Rosetta Codex","review":"This here's an OK SciFi adventure.

I mostly agree with the other reviews posted here, both the negative and the positive."},{"Title":"The Rosetta Codex","review":"First let's understand the author. Russo really isn't much of a science fiction author. The Calucci novels were police procedurals that took place in the future. Most of them could have been published by St. Martin's press rather than a science fiction imprint. Now I like science fiction mysteries. I really like space operas and science fiction adventures. Unfortunately this is a slightly interesting novella that wasn't thought through and then was stretched into a novel.Now let's look at the book. Maybe not. Really it's not that captivating. When most of the book is spelled out on the back cover then you're in trouble. The main character is one dimentional, souless, with no real change in his personality or sign of growth in spite of his trials. His trusty side kick is an improbable plot device with no motivation for supporting the main chaaracter and no explanation as to several odd events that occur around her. In point of fact, no character is really that interesting and the book's ending is so brief as to make me wonder if an editor cam along and said:\\"Look Russo, we're under contract to publish this thing but you can at least cut 70 pages out. I mean haven't you bored your readers enough?\\"There are better authors out there: Neal Asher for one. Bill Baldwin if you like space opera. John E.

Unpredictable and rich with detail about wireless communication, flying boats and the mysterious Desolation Islands. Recommended."},{"Title":"The Lost Flying Boat","review":"In 1950, a surplus WWII Short Sunderland flying boat manned by an ex-RAF aircrew departs Johannesburg, South Africa on a secret, wholly-for-profit mission: to collect a ton of gold coins buried on Kerguelen Island by the crew of a German U-Boat in the waning days of the war. This novel is like an Alastair Maclean-style adventure story with a \\"Moby Dick\\" riff.The narrator is Adcock, the radio operator picked up as a late replacement. Like Ishmael, Adcock is a hand on board but a stranger to the crew, all of whom served together during the war under the command of the novel's Ahab, Captain Bennett, the pilot, a man obsessed with the treasure. Bennett trusts no one, suspects all, and sacrifices everything, traits that play heavily on the outcome of the story.Author Alan Sillitoe was himself an RAF wireless operator in Malaysia during WWII and the book is full of tech-speak about radios, Morse code, atmospherics, and general flying jargon. The prose style is short, choppy, and very British; difficult to understand in places for an American reader. Sillitoe was famous for his ability to portray frustrated, disaffected characters but the men in this book are clearly war-damaged goods suffering from what is now called PTSD, in addition to simple greed. Overall, the book doesn't really work very well---it's hard to escape the notion that Sillitoe's target readers are ex-RAF vets---but it's still interesting to read because of its locales and its realistic treatment of experienced men who are in over their heads following an egotistical leader. And oh yes, there is that business of the buried treasure..."},{"Title":"Negotiating Partnerships: Increase Profits and Reduce Risk","review":"I have decided to integrate my interview with Keld (Co-author) and book review together because the book also emphasises the strengths and ideals of Keld's company Market Watch.From the back jacket of the book \\"An international study based on over 20,000 negotiations revealed that a huge amount of time is wasted on producing deals that are often of only marginal merit.

His first book of verse, CUTTLEFISH BONES, was inspired by the Ligurian landscape in which he grew up, and its poetry is mostly marked by experimentation in style and attention to the natural world. Afterwards, Montale moved to Florence, and in THE OCCASIONS his poetry has turned away from not just paeans to the Mediterranean shore to intensely personal and introspective poetry. For Montale had seen in a woman the absolute, and went immortalize her in this stunning work.In 1933 Eugenio Montale became acquainted with Irma Brandeis, a Jewish-American scholar of Italian literature (her work on Dante's Comedy, THE LADDER OF VISION, was acclaimed upon its appearance in the 1960's). He saw he only occasionally, but his few encounters with her captured his heart until his imagination of her ceased to be literal, and she became, like Beatrice to Dante, a redemptrix and mediatrix. The key part of THE OCCASIONS, the sequence of 21 poems called \\"The Motets\\" deals solely with \\"Clizia\\", as Montale called this ideal. The Motets have been called love poems, but there is no syrupy romanticism within them. Instead, they are metaphysical poems, in which Montale adores Clizia because he sees in her the divine. A common theme is departure or distance. In the first motet, \\"You know: I must leave you again...\\", the poet expresses his despair at another departure from his beloved. Montale's transcendental imagination of Clizia is shown its ending lines \\"I look for the lost/ sign, the only pledge I had of your/ grace. / And hell is certain.\\"While the Motets traditionally have received the most attention, the other parts of THE OCCASIONS are also superb. In \\"Dora Markus\\", Montale muses on a Jewish woman he imagined at the seaside. She looks across the ocean at place that is her homeland but where she has never lived. Arrowsmith excellently translates Montale's sly irony in part as \\"Your restlessness reminds me/of those migratory birds that thump against the lighthouse/on stormy nights: /even your sweetness is a stoms/whose raging's unseen/whose lulls are even rarer.\\" In \\"The Coastguard Station\\", one of his more popular poems and taught in many Italian schools, Montale reflects on a building that stands out in his memories of youth, but which his companion cannot remember.Among the several translations in English I prefer William Arrowsmith's. While Jonathan Galassi has published the more recent collection of translations of Montale and thus has received more attention lately, I believe that Arrowsmith's are stronger poetically. Galassi was dedicated towards translating above all else the meaning of Montale's poetry and trying to make his symbolism more penetrable for the reader in English, as a result the sound of his translation do not sound very poetic. Arrowsmith, on the other hand, was a genuine poet and rendered Montale's verse in such a way that its sound was preserved rather well. Of course, no single translator can bring every aspect of this great poet across perfectly, and that's why if one is a great admirer of Montale's works, acquiring his verse translated in English by more than a single translator is a good idea. Even after I was able to read Montale's poetry in the original Italian, I remained fascinated with how various people handled the difficult task of rendering him in a language so different.I was a bit disappointed by the notes included to shed light on a few poems. Nowhere does Arrowsmith mention, like most critics would immediately, the biographical details that led to the creation of Clizia out of Irma Brandeis. While Montale's poetry here is intensely personal and hermetic, knowing something about his life during the 1930's helps immensely. Perhaps it was because Brandeis was still alive and active in letters when this translation came out, but considering that it was publically known that she inspired Clizia for 40 years before, I don't understand why Arrowsmith was reluctant to give the same background details any translator or critic would.The other weakness of the notes is that they are written as if for someone already quite knowledgeable in Montale criticism. However, someone who knows enough to make use of the notes would probably not be reading this layman's edition in English but would follow the criticism published in Italy.If you've never read anything by Montale, I'd suggest getting the paperback SELECTED POEMS published by New Directions. It contains some of the strongest and clearest pieces from his three volumes of poetry up to 1965. If you like the works of this fascinating poet, I'd suggest going on to the individual volumes in these translations of William Arrowsmith."},{"Title":"Mum's The Word","review":"Ellie Haskell is back and pregnant. All she wants to do is stay in bed, eat and be pampered but a warning of danger gives her the push to go to America with her husband Bentley T. Haskell. Bentley wants to become a member of a select group of chefs along with several other unusual candidates. The selection of the one new member of the food society, takes place in a rural area in a strange house on an island. To make matters worse, the house is occupied by a woman who has written a bestseller book about her aging actress mother entitled Monster Mommie. And who shows up? None other than Monster Mommie herself.Ellie is still an interesting character and the book does have some funny parts, but it was not nearly as good a read as the Thin Woman. I felt that the book had a lot of potential but failed to live up to it. I would not recommend Mum's the Word unless you are a die hard Ellie fan."},{"Title":"Mum's The Word","review":"Oh to have Ellie's wit and narrative powers! Dorothy Cannell does a superb job with another Ellie Haskell mystery, this one every bit as fun as the ones before, if not more! It was delicious having Ellie visit the States and reading her reactions to its vastness and people. The clever little plot was devious and interesting, a mystery revolving around the expose of a famous actress in best-seller Monster Mommy. More delightful characters! I don't know how Mrs. Cannell does it, but her creations are an ongoing pleasure! I mean, here's a sample of who you'll meet (they're all contestants for some cookery Mange): Kid Prodigy named Bingo and his fashion-less mother, French countess and magician husband, goodhearted cooking witch who makes love potions, and a nice, warm housewife with a broody and paranoid husband. Then there are noncontestants, such as Valicia X, and the infamous, scandalous Theola Faith, and wretched daughter Mary. Then you've got the setting of a Gothic atrocity used in a movie called Melancholy Mansion (which, yes, had starred Theola Faith) and a narrow-minded town called Mud Creek with more eccentric characters, including a Diethologic reverend. This mystery is cunningly appropriate for a pregnant woman (Ellie) and is a successful farce. Do read it!"},{"Title":"Mum's The Word","review":"I got this one in a Secret Santa exchange a couple of years ago. Apparently, it, or the author, had been recommended, and I'd requested it, but I couldn't remember who or why. Also apparently, this is the fourth book in a mystery series.Ellie Haskell is pregnant and looking forward to taking full advantage of the pampering she's undoubtedly due when her husband Ben is invited to join an exclusive secret society of chefs dedicated to discovering and preserving antique recipes. The invitation includes a Christie-esque stay on an island resort with the other candidates. In America.The other candidates are all oddities--a child prodigy, a French magician, and a kitchen witch, for example, and the resort belongs to an actress whose daughter has just written a scandalous biography of her. The chef society activities are shrouded in secrecy, and when people start disappearing, Ellie takes it on herself to investigate.It's a fun mystery romp, and Ellie is an engaging, if slightly self-absorbed and spoiled character. What was even more fun was seeing Ellie's impressions of and reactions to America, which were amusing and believable... and, now that I think of it, may have been the basis for the recommendation.I'm not sure if I'll look for any more books in this series, but I did enjoy reading this one, and if I run across another, I won't turn it down."},{"Title":"Mum's The Word","review":"I have read most of Dorothy Cannell's books, and have loved most of them, but I have to say, this one could have been written in Greek. I didn't understand it at all. I kept reading hoping it would spring to life for me. But, I have to admit I finally put it down and gave up. I read A LOT of books and put down very few, but this one I just could not follow. Sorry Dorothy."},{"Title":"Mum's The Word","review":"After The Thin Woman, I had expected more from this novel. Rather than the crisp prose that I anticipated, the writing in this one meanders from scene to scene without much advancing the plot. It was just difficult to maintain interest in a work that I found more tedious than engrossing. I didn't find much to recommend it."},{"Title":"Mum's The Word","review":"I loved the Thin Woman, and was excited to read this book, but never bothered finishing. I found Ellie irritating, not someone I liked very much. I read about 50 pages, and hadn't laughed once."},{"Title":"Forth Into Light","review":"I am totally obsessed with this trilogy! I fantasize about it, write more chapters, I even dream about it at night. VERY recommended. When I finished the third book, I almost cried because there wasn't more, and I desperately wanted to know what happened to Peter and Charlie next. Both the love and the fights were so honestly written that I almost believed it all really happened. Read these, they're a complete emotional experience!!"},{"Title":"Forth Into Light","review":"Forth Into Light does was so few books can do: It made me angry and it made me sad. It is so rare that a book can make real emotions erupt in me, so I must say that I think it was well done. I don't have to like what happens to my favorite character, but it does have to be believable and/or justifiable. However, I'll be honest - this was my least favorite of the three books.This book is significantly different than the previous two books in the trilogy. It takes the focus off of Charlie and Peter and puts in on a whole village, with a slightly brighter light shining on a expatriate American writer and his son.I wasn't always nuts about how the story moved along, because it seemed as if Merrick had become bored with his two lead characters and was attempting to &quot;do&quot; something with them beyond that which he'd already done. It often seemed as if there were two books here, neither of which was Merrick terribly committed to.Ultimately I enjoyed the book because it finalized the two characters I'd come to love from the beginning (sometimes I could relate with Charlie and other times I could relate to Peter). In this final book, it is important to remember what was happening in Merrick's world as well as the 1960 world of the characters. The whole free love movement was in full swing for Merrick, but it was just finding its sea legs in 1960. That's all well and good, but it just seemed rather forced at times in the book.Don't get me wrong. I did enjoy the book, but it was a less pleasurable read than the previous two books in the trilogy. But ya' gotta read it!"},{"Title":"Forth Into Light","review":"It began with Peter. Then there was Charlie. Along came Martha. Now in the final chapter of the monumental love story about two men who could pass for Greek gods, steps Jeff, an exquisite young man who brings searing passion -- and intrigue -- to the lush Greek isle on which they all live."},{"Title":"Forth Into Light","review":"This is book three in the series of &#34;Peter & Charlie Trilogy&#34; and for me, getting these books, was like revisiting withold long lost friends. I read these books when I was about 17 or 18 years old.Too long of a story for here, but they were lost to fire.... and to have them back again... well, I read each one in about 4 nights.Gordon Merrick was an amazing author, who was ahead of his time."},{"Title":"Forth Into Light","review":"Forth Into Light is the third book in the exciting trilogy of Charlie Mills and Peter Martin. It is 279 pages of fairly dense script.The story started out being a disappointment to me because even though the contented, highly respected Mills-Martins were intrigued onlookers of the developing plot taking place in the lush Greek Isle where they lived, they did not in the beginning play key roles. I want to make it clear that in spite of that fact, I found the story and colorful characters to be fascinating, and as it progressed Charlie and Peter became drawn into the many intermingling aspects of the tightly woven story. As with most of Gordon Merrick's stories, it is intensely romantic, erotic, angst-ridden and active.The one thing I find extremely off-putting in Merrick's stories is his determination to force his gay men into sexual encounters and relationships with women. I have nothing against the women in the hetrosexual relationships in the stories, but when women are foisted off on Charlie and Peter I deeply resent them. For one thing it feels forced. I despised Martha from the beginning, because I knew that she secretly had every intention of splitting Charlie and Peter up at her first opportunity so she could have Charlie to herself. In this book she finally outed herself and proved that she was the sly, manipulative witch I always knew she was. Of course it backfired in her face.Though I was saddened by the way the story ended for one of the main characters whom I had become very fond of, at least there was a happy ending for Charlie and Peter. I hesitate to call it an ending because it finishes with no real finality to it. Merrick could have picked up with another story where that one left off. I wish he had."},{"Title":"Forth Into Light","review":"I must admit I thought Lord Won't Mind was to be his crowning achievement, but I feel this book outdid the first in the trilogy. And this time around, even though the characters are once again for the most part Harlequin cardboard cutouts,... I think the emotional tie to Jeff is what makes me hold this one dearest to my heart of all three (well, all two... havent read One for the Gods yet). And check out the passage between Jeff and Mike for one of the most erotic \\"first timer\\" encouters written in any manner...gay, straight, and bi authors would have a hard time (no pun intended) topping this one."},{"Title":"Extraordinary Lives: Thirty-Four Priests Tell Their Stories","review":"The text is very honest and encouraging. Was recommended to me by a Roman Catholic priest. The book makes life as a priest sounds exciting. Lots of good advice for discernment and life in general from first hand experience. Shows that obedience and celibacy are blessings to welcome. I most definitly agree with the publisher's review. It offers reasons to become a priest and reasons to stay a priest. As a young man myself, it offers an appealing alternitive lifestyle. Only complaint: there were no &quot;simple&quot; parish priests. All were truly extraordinary, as the title implies, however, I would have liked to read about a priest who is happy with one role in the Church - pastor of a parish without the additional responsibilities of vicar, vocations director, etc. However, it does remind us that priests are called to fill multiple roles in the Church at one time. Truly an uplifiting book and definitly recommended for anyone who wants to understand the Priestly ministry more fully. Example advice from the text: If you are too busy to pray, you are too busy. I know that is advice I need to follow. I hope for similar books in the future."},{"Title":"Extraordinary Lives: Thirty-Four Priests Tell Their Stories","review":"A very inspirational account of men who are happy with their vocation to the Roman Catholic priesthood. It is a welcome breath of fresh air in contrast to so many other books which proclaim priesthood in a negative light (and wrongly so!). In this book you will encounter men who have struggled, men who have had fascinating experiences, men who have rejoiced, both young and old. I would recommend this book for any priest, seminarian, or for anyone considerding a vocation to the priesthood, as well as for those who feel that priesthood is dead! It is not! Read about these extraordinary lives!"},{"Title":"Extraordinary Lives: Thirty-Four Priests Tell Their Stories","review":"If you have come to believe the Catholic Priesthood is about to become part of the dustbin of history, then reading this book may cause you to think again. This is a refreshing and inspiring look at 33 men who are living lives that are personally satisfying and which bring a dimension of service to the world which is diffferent from any other. Particularly interesting are the differing, yet singular threads which run through the stories related. This is well worth reading."},{"Title":"Extraordinary Lives: Thirty-Four Priests Tell Their Stories","review":"In the Preface to this 1997 book, the authors write, \\"No one disputes that the Catholic priesthod is in a state of crisis, but many disagree with gloomy predictions of some that the priesthood as we know it is ending.... The crisis facing the priesthood can lead in either direction (\\"Danger\\" or \\"Opportunity\\"), and judging from the wonderful men whose stories are told in this book, it seems more likely that the shortage of priests presents us with an opportunity for growth, for change, and for a breakthrough in the work of bringing about God's kingdom.\\" \\"We, the authors of this book ... believe that it would be worthwhile to explore in greater detail what happy priests think about their vocation. We believe that such a work will be useful particularly for men who may be thinking about a vocation to the priesthood, as well as for those parents, priests, religious, and others who might be able to support and influence such choices and to reaffirm priests already laboring in the vineyard.\\"Here are some quotations from the book:\\"I have read some of the discussions about approving the concept of temporary priesthood. Actually, we are doing that right now with the laicization of clergy. Still, there is a great value for society in the permanent commitment made by priests and married couples. I do think it is an issue that needs study, discussion, and prayer, if we are to solve the priest shortage problem.\\" (Pg. 19-20)\\"There were times when I thought of packing my bags and leaving. Most of my classmates left. Some of them write and say they are not happy. It is sad to see how they are floundering. One of the problems I see in bringing married priests back into active service is this: so many of those who left are elderly. The youngsters of a parish need a younger priest with whom they can relate.\\" (Pg. 103)\\"I predict that the Church of the future will be lay-oriented, one of shared and collaborative ministry. Communication from the top on down will disappear; that the Church will be far more grounded in baptism and charism rather than in ordination and office.\\" (Pg. 111)\\"The stories in this book lend no credence to the negative comments splashed about in the secular and Catholic media... The interviewed priests are proud of the work that they do... They believe the teachings of the Church. They repeatedly maintain that what they do contributes to the peace and salvation of those whom they touch. And they are quick to recommend their life to others, the ultimate measure of job satisfaction.\\" (Pg. 269)"},{"Title":"Extraordinary Lives: Thirty-Four Priests Tell Their Stories","review":"I have read this before and have obtained more copies to share with men that may want to consider becoming a Catholic Priest."},{"Title":"Tradiciones peruanas (Biblioteca clasica)","review":"These short-stories from the 19th century are often treated as \\"classics that I will get around to reading someday...after I cut my toenails for the 645th time.\\" Treating them this way is a huge mistake.

And beyond the humor value, many of the stories provide clever insights into life in colonial Peru as well as during the early 19th century.

Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia many times in my adult life. And plan to do so again and again. The remarkable thing is that the stories still seem fresh and alive. They never seem to get boring and there are always new insights waiting to be discovered. Even for the adult reader. I would highly recommend the stories to all young readers, even though I myself did not read them as a child. I think I was so bent on trying to read the entire works of Enid Blyton at the time, that I failed to notice anything Narnian about my local library.&quot;New insights&quot; are what the Companion To Narnia is all about. Paul F. Ford has done a wonderful job of assembling all of the myriad of characters, places, themes; all the rich history and lore of Narnia and beyond, into this one encyclopedic book. I really cannot see how it could be improved upon. It is massive in scope. I have read it and &quot;used&quot; it for years now.The book is arranged alphebetically and all topics are meticulously cross-referenced (an asterisk follows any word or phrase which is an entry elsewhere). Even though this is not the type of book that is commonly read from cover to cover, picking it up and starting from any topic will surely tempt you to the reading of the asterisk-linked articles. In Narnian terms, I think of this as the hidden &quot;Turkish-Delight&quot; feature of the book. Let it take you where your curiosity and interest leads.At the end of the articles, Ford has placed in parentheses an abbreviated reference to the specific book and page number that coincides with the topic being discussed. This sends us back to the original source of the material if necessary, and allows Ford's book to be not only a companion, but a sort-of concordance as well. It is a very useful feature.The copious footnotes will definitely appeal to those who are interested in learning more about the creator of Narnia. These notes clearly show that Paul Ford is an expert in his knowledge of the man C.S. Lewis. (A good example is the numerous footnotes to the article entitled &quot;Digory Kurke&quot;).Another great feature of the book is that not only are characters and place-names discussed, but also the IDEAS and THEMES of the Chronicles are examined. For instance there are comprehensive articles on such things as: Dreams, Knowledge, Fear, Privacy, Sounds, Music, Obedience, Birds, Ecology, etc. Of particular worthy mention is the great five page section on Biblical Allusions.The final thing I will mention is that there are wonderful illustrations throughout the book, and these serve to take the imagination even further into the world that is Narnia.The book is appropriately titled. My desk-dictionary has, as one of its definitions for the word companion... &quot;one of a pair of matching things&quot;. In my opinion, any bookshelf that has its Narnia, ought to have its Companion."},{"Title":"Companion to Narnia","review":"I first entered Narnia as a child, simply pushing the fur coats aside and stepping through the wardrobe into the snowy world near the lamp post. I didn't need a guide book. Things just unfolded and I went with the flow of wonders. I came back for an extended visit when I was expecting my first child. There were concepts there that I had not noticed before as &quot;concepts&quot;. I felt inspired and doubly moved by its beauty. Now, I'm at the &quot;grandma&quot; age if not yet in that reality. I've popped back in to visit old friends and this guide book is truly a &quot;companion.&quot; I realize that the word &quot;companion&quot; in the title refers to the fact that this volume is a companion to the Narnia books, but for me the title has a double meaning, in that it is also my companion on the journey to Narnia, my tour guide, so to speak.This book takes you by the hand and encourages you to look closer, gently pointing out the secrets of the locale that only the natives might know. It gives insights and provokes thought and dialogue. It is a neat holistic view that encourages an appreciation for the big picture by illuminating the subtle details. It is also the kind of tribute to the minute of one's heroes that all &quot;fans&quot; love to pour over. If you are a young person just let Lucy help you find your way into Narnia and I assure you that you will have a splendid time, but if you are a bit older I recommend this travelog and the company of this wonderfully helpful and insightful book.This book also contains an insightful foreward by Madeleine L'Engle, author of &quot;A Wrinkle in Time&quot;."},{"Title":"Companion to Narnia","review":"I've adored this series since grade school and I reread it periodically, but until the last few times I never understood the allegory in the book.

The entries are encyclopedia-style, alphabetically listed, with the page numbers the entry appears on in the Chronicles, related entries, and often very extensive footnotes referring the reader to books and articles by Mr. Lewis and other renowned Fanstasy and Religious authors, as well as background into what specific uses could have meant to the author, or his inspirations for them.There are annexes at the end on everything to how old the Pevensie children and others are in the books, Narnia time vs Earth time, the age of Lewis during the writing of the Chronicles, maps of Narnia and more. Wonderful illustrations are distributed throughout the book, just waiting to surprise you when you turn the page.I would HIGHLY recommend this book to any lover of Narnia, whether it's your first time around or your fortieth.

Now that I am much older and able to free-think, I occasioally have epiphanies on what C.S. Lewis was conveying.

Runes are stick like figures used in Northern European countries into the sixteenth or seventeenth century. More than just characters in an alphabet, they were also used for magic and divination. Many of the problems are expressed using runes, which makes them appear more difficult than they are.The core of the book is a series of 100 quotations or expressions encoded via a substitution cipher. While some are challenging, after you do a few, many become rather easy. An unencrypted, explanatory message appears with most of them, and in the case of quotations, the message reveals who the author is. Since that persons name is coded at the bottom, once you know the name and how the attribution appears, the problem is half solved.Nevertheless, the book did keep my interest, although in many cases, I found myself converting the given characters into the English alphabet before attempting to solve the problem. There is also a chapter containing seventeen puzzles that together make up a contest. The first five who solve all seventeen will earn a set of small prizes.If you are a fan of puzzles, you are always on the lookout for new ones. While most are not true stumpers, the use of the unusual characters does make them more difficult and it held my interest throughout. Solving these problems will keep everyone but experts involved for some time. If you find yourself overwhelmed, solutions to all but the contest problems are in the back of the book."},{"Title":"Cryptorunes: Codes and Secret Writing","review":"If you have time to spare and a desire to exercise your mind in an entertaining way, then take a look at this book.It is not *just* a puzzle book, there is plenty of fact and anecdote to interest you as well. The main theme of the book is simple cryptography, as described in the works of Conan Doyle and Edgar Allen Poe. Obviously you cannot decipher relatively modern cryptograms such as those produced by the Germans in the last world war without a lot of time and a computer, but in previous times when the average person was a lot less well educated many simple codes were baffling to most readers and could maintain secrecy.Understanding how these simple cyphers work and may be \\"broken\\" is the first step to understanding modern cryptography."},{"Title":"Cryptorunes: Codes and Secret Writing","review":"I purchased this book after I had first gotten interested in Cryptograms. I found the puzzles to be a lot more fun than the standard Cryptograms just involving english characters because there are a number of twists in the codes which add a unique challenge.For example, some of the cyphers involve symbols that stand for more than one letter. This adds additional challenge to the cyphers because the same symbol may stand for M or D and a different symbol for I or Y. Hence, you have to try to determine in each instance which letter the symbol represents.As someone who is still improving at cryptograms, I have not solved all of the puzzles in this book. Nevertheless, that means that there are challenges that I can come back to solve at later times as I get better. Also, the history of different cryptograms and some of the stories that he shares are fun in satisfying some of my intellectual curiosity about the history of cryptograms."},{"Title":"Cryptorunes: Codes and Secret Writing","review":"Clifford Pickover truly seems to be a Renissance man. His previous forays into conundrums and puzzles have ranged from time travel to hyperspace to infinity.This time, its cryptography. While some of the aspects of these puzzles might be hard for some novices, and I could wish for room and space to more easily work on the puzzles, the puzzles themselves are a joy to play with.If you like cryptographic analysis, enjoyed Neal Stephenson's Cryptonomicon, or want to try a brain teaser of a different sort, then you might want to delve into Cryptorunes."},{"Title":"Cryptorunes: Codes and Secret Writing","review":"Cliff Pickover is making me stay up late with his new book Cryptorunes. This book is a wonderful and remarkable collection of puzzles, stories of cryptography and a history of Runes. This is not an average puzzle book of cryptograms. Cliff goes many steps further and brings the reader an added level of difficulty and an added dimension of enjoyment. The variety of puzzles that the reader can solve range from the simple one symbol equals one letter to much the much tougher where more than one symbol can equal a letter or one symbol can equal more than one letter. Cliff also offers the reader very challenging puzzles with no solution in the back of the book. Be the first to crack those codes!"},{"Title":"See America First: Tourism and National Identity, 1880-1940","review":"I speak as both an academic and general reader when I say that Marguerite S. Shaffer's See America First: Tourism and National Identity, 1880-1940, is a \\"must-read\\" for anyone interested in travel, tourism, history, nature, marketing, and American culture in general. In December, I received Shaffer's book as a gift right before I went home for winter break - a time when most college students like myself would prefer not to even look at anything that resembles a textbook. However, I found that once embarking on the engaging text, I was hard-pressed to stop!See America First opens with a passage straight out of a sentimental movie: it is the spring of 1892, and Methodist minister Stephen Merritt is leaving his home in New York City to venture across the country. He writes of his anticipation that he will \\"see the land (he) fondly call(s) (his) own\\" (1) on the tour to Alaska and California. Each chapter is introduced in an equally engaging manner, and sheds light on general themes. Shaffer's work is well-organized as it chronicles western tourism after the Civil War - as the nation tried to bind itself together after a divisive four-year struggle at the same time that the seemingly boundless west was rapidly finishing its settlement. As a culture, the nation wanted to create for itself a type of heritage that older European countries could proclaim - but remain unique in its identity. By connecting the emerging consumer culture in the United States with the marketing \\"national tourism,\\" Shaffer presents a substantiated argument that the shared national identity of America and its values were actually inspired by popular Western mythology. The actual See America First movement thus serves as the bulk of her exhaustively researched work. We learn of the developments in transportation, technology, and communication that the government endorsed in an effort to reach its goal. However, Shaffer also affirms that this was not a \\"one-sided\\" lecture by commercialism - it was the foundation for a larger dialogue of values and ideals.As a history and American studies major, I can't help but appreciate the fact that I now know how these \\"attractions\\" got their birth - and how the railroad, hotels, and leisure culture worked together to symbolize the ideal America. On an academic note, Shaffer's bibliography is very extensive - which is useful to anyone who would like to independently follow up on a particular aspect of her original research. Of course, there are also numerous visual features including postcards, photos, and advertisements (\\"The Call of the Mountains!...Vacations in Glacier National Park\\" proclaimed one that most readily comes to my mind), all of which served as a way for me to connect with those who enjoyed the national parks and west long before I did. Personally, that is the best part of See America First: it conjured up fond memories of my own trips out west with my family. Even though I was a youth, I remember a powerful sense of beauty, purity, and idealism as we spent time at Glacier, Yellowstone, and other National Parks.On first reading, I flew through See America First too quickly, so I am now re-reading it just for enjoyment and additional nostalgia - and I am also making plans with my family to take another two-week tour this summer. I look forward to future books by Shaffer!"},{"Title":"See America First: Tourism and National Identity, 1880-1940","review":"Gasoline prices falling. The automobile industry urging us to &quot;Keep America Rolling.&quot; Chambers of Commerce and tourist bureaus asking us to do our patriotic duty: travel. The national parks opening their gates for free, offering a glimpse of the sublime in service of communal &quot;healing.&quot; The aftermath of September 11? Yes, but as Marguerite S. Shaffer shows us in See America First: Tourism and National Identity, 1880-1940 (Washington, DC: Smithsonian, 2001), we've been down this road before.Shaffer chronicles the rise of what she calls &quot;national tourism&quot; at the turn of the 20th century, in which touring was characterized as not only a ritual of American citizenship but also a form of &quot;virtuous consumption&quot; (39), the perfect melding of patriotism and commercial progress. In the wake of the Civil War, travel was promoted as a means of witnessing the unfolding of a flourishing, united nation: by &quot;consuming&quot; the national narrative through historical landmarks and the spectacle of nature, tourists were able to participate in a larger dialogue about personal and public memory (e.g., through scrapbooks and journals), individual and national identity. Of course, these patriotic questers required an America worthy of their efforts. Enter the See America First movement, which Shaffer describes as a &quot;Western booster campaign&quot; whose purpose was to establish the West as the geographical, commercial, and political equal of the Northeastern United States while simultaneously promoting the &quot;ideal&quot; West as the &quot;true&quot; America. See America First exploited the existing ideological infrastructure of Manifest Destiny to create a &quot;canon&quot; of American tourist attractions that embodied a distinct national mythology based on such nostalgic images as untamed nature, noble savages, and small-town life. Sustaining this mythology, however, required a massive physical infrastructure of roads, hotels, and tourist attractions--all heavily subsidized by boosters and government officials. Thus the marketing of the American West reified a cultural meaning of tourism that depended as much on an expansive rhetoric of commercialism as an expansive body of land.Like all good histories, See America First not only reveals a vivid past but brings its themes to bear on our own urgent and fraught present. Two examples are particularly worthy of mention. First, Shaffer observes that in the unprecedented prosperity of the post-World War II era, tourism became less a patriotic rite of passage than &quot;the ultimate quest for self-indulgent individual pleasure and hedonistic personal freedom in a culture of mass consumption that revolved around spectacle, fantasy, and desire&quot; (320). These post-September 11 days represent the inverse of that situation: a lengthy period of economic expansion has come to an abrupt and painful end, and travel is being promoted as an antidote to the fear and unease caused by the terrorist attacks and a patriotic defense of &quot;our way of life.&quot; Second, this re-emergence of national tourism as a form of virtuous consumption offers us a cautionary tale. For as Shaffer argues, &quot;mobile citizenship . . . redefined political rights in consumer terms, celebrating seeing over speaking, purchasing over voting, and traveling over participating&quot; (6). Given the recent bailout of the travel and tourism industry, the voluntary forfeiture of civil liberties in the name of the war on terrorism, and the daily exhortations to keep the world free for democracy by spending, spending, spending . . . this argument is as timely as it is original.See America First is an academic book, but general readers should not be deterred. Meticulously researched, engagingly written, and generously illustrated with old photographs, postcards, and travel brochures, it should satisfy anyone with an interest in the period, the industries, or the themes at the heart of Shaffer's study, from tourists to travel literature aficionados, from collectors of tourist memorabilia to historians of the environment and consumer culture."},{"Title":"The Night Before Kindergarten","review":"I bought this for my 2 year old who was starting Preschool and she LOVES it! It has darling illustrations, a cute story and a happy ending.....I recommend this one!"},{"Title":"The Night Before Kindergarten","review":"It's a wonderful book for kids and parents. For those who are concerned about the parents crying in the story, make them cry tears of happiness and the kids will understand, and change the words. The story is right on target here where we live. There is no bus, so we share in carpool. I don't know if I would send my 5-year-old on a big yellow bus the first day or two or not if we did have one. I teach prekindergarten, and use the book for my class too. It's awesome. Also recommended to all of my parents, Mommy-CEO, which also has plenty of tips on family, school and everything in between. Both books have been well accepted by all of my parents and they really enjoy them."},{"Title":"The Night Before Kindergarten","review":"I purchased this book for my daughter and read it to her a few weeks before her first day in kindergarten.

Our granddaughter, who just began kindergarten, loves the book and reads it every night before going to bed."},{"Title":"The Night Before Kindergarten","review":"We've read several other books that are modeled after \\"'Twas The Night Before Christmas\\" and have enjoyed them. The rhyming of this book is enjoyable, but there are several things that I did not like. 1) There is a reference to \\"day care\\", stating that \\"Some kids brought blankets or their favorite stuffed bear, in hopes they could nap like they did in day care.\\" My daughter asked what day care was. 2) Too much was made about parents crying, and it is not appropriate. If parents are crying, a 5-year-old does not need to be burdened with this. In the book, the parents stayed at school, crying and watching, while the kids did about a dozen activities! That is totally not realistic. In fact, the crying parents (and the children setting THEM at ease with a final goodbye and hug and wave) seemed to occupy the bulk of the book, instead of focusing on how the child is getting bigger, and going to like school, etc., etc."},{"Title":"The Night Before Kindergarten","review":"I enjoyed reading this to my child.

So I sent the book to him as a little gift. My daughter read it to him several times.She said it was wonderful and helped to calm his fears."},{"Title":"The Night Before Kindergarten","review":"I like the way the book begins, with children thinking and wondering about kindergarten, the night before school begins. But the book then turns to the mommies and daddies, who stand crying at the door on the first day of kindergarten. I didn't really want to give my daughter any ideas, as she was already a nervous wreck. The teacher assures the parents that everything will be fine, but I really didn't like this part of the book at all."},{"Title":"The Night Before Kindergarten","review":"I have seen many stories about children going off to school for the first time but this one has a surprising difference that really sets it apart from the others.The poem begins on the night before kindergarten with children and parents getting ready for the big day. Then the day arrives and we see children and parents as they prepare, go to, and arrive at school. There is much said about a lack of napping places that does not match my children's experiences. But then we see how the parents are saddened by leaving their kids behind. The resourceful teacher manages to find a quick solution and all ends happily.The first day of school can be hard for children and adults alike. This is the first book I have come across that deals with the excitement and hesitancies on this special day. A very fun book for parent and child."},{"Title":"The Night Before Kindergarten","review":"I bought this book for my granddaughter and for a friend's child who is entering kindergarten. Loved the idea of making children aware that this is a big step for them but somewhat bitter-sweet for their parents. Mentioned leaving their baby things behind as they go into the big school world. Pictures were very up to date--clothes, backpacks, school supplies. Very well done. I would extend the age range for appropriate readership through kindergarten age and not limit it to preschool."},{"Title":"The Night Before Kindergarten","review":"I do not recommend because it essentially presupposes that kindergarten is a scary place and that you only need to overcome your fears when entering this frightening place. That's how it seemed to me, at least.Instead of describing kindergarten as a fun, happy, loving place, it talks about how children are at first afraid, but then learn to like it. Why even suggest that your child should be afraid?Worse, in the book, all the parents stay in the classroom, outside the door watching. That's not how school works. The parents are not there, so why suggest that they are going to be at the door looking in during the day?Not recommended. The other \\"night before\\" books I like, just not this one."},{"Title":"The Night Before Kindergarten","review":"I thought this was an excellent read for children about to enter Kindergarten...not every book has to be realistic, because, let's face it, Kindergarten can be scary to a 5 year old. I also purchased a number of other books for pre-K and read those, along with The Night Before Kindergarten, to my 5 year old. He particularly enjoyed this book, because it's easy to understand, the rhyming makes it fun and it ends with the grown-ups crying, which he thinks is very silly."},{"Title":"The Night Before Kindergarten","review":"We received this book in the mail coming from our new kindergarten teacher.My daughter (5) loved the story - she found the part where the parents cry amusing!This book accurately described our actual experience the first day so for us there were no surprises and my daughter loves the fact that there is a beautiful rhymed story about our experience."},{"Title":"The Night Before Kindergarten","review":"I teach preschool children and I am giving copies of this book to the parents of my graduates.

The story and pictures are very neat and innovative, a spin from twas the night before christmas. We were not bothered by the crying parents because being able to express emotions is very important in life and I would rather explain to my son why those parents are crying than to pretend that it does not happen. It very healthy for children to learn that their and other's emotions and feelings are very important! The world needs more compassionate and caring people! This is a very hard and unfamiliar transition for everyone! Especailly from being mommy and daddy's little boy or girl to wow you are now a big boy or girl and entering the school system.

After reading it, I am not going to give it to anyone. In the book, parents drive their children to school. There is no mention of a \\"bus ride\\" which is how everyone gets to school (where we live, anyway!). The idea that Mommy and Daddy will be dropping them off at school is misleading and confusing. I also agree with one person's comments about the parents crying. Do kids need to worry about this? The purpose of buying this book was to ease children's fears, not add to worry and confuse them.

I have purchased a second copy (the price is great, no need to pirate it) in case the first one gets worn out. I only listen to it on my way to work in my car, and it sure starts my day out right.

The CD contains about 17 tracks which are part info-heavy and part affirmation \\"breaks.\\" Personally, the key to this philosophy is that people run negative thoughts through their brain each day. These negative thoughts corrupt a person's attitude, behavior towards others, and self image. What this CD does is break that pattern, exposing the negative thoughts and replacing them with positive ones (hence the name). Through continued use, this CD does, in my opinion and based on experience, have to potential to create life altering patterns in attitude which will ultimately help one have a better view on their present reality.Their concept is not new or ground breaking. It has been advocated for decades by psychologists and counselors alike. This CD gives you the opportunity to seize a great amount of this knowledge in under an hour.In short: everytime I listen to the CD, I feel better, motivated, and more positive. Give it a chance. It's a really inexpensive opportunity, which, fully utilized, may change your life for the better. Best of luck."},{"Title":"Become Totally Positive Auto-Matically (While-U Drive)","review":"This CD is corny; True!! But aren't the happy and positive people in this world a bit corny. For instance the CD asks the listener to smile often even if there isn't something to smile about. It talks about how smiles are contagious. BUT!! this was not the most corny or unusual thing I've found in the CD.The Griswolds talk about projecting love in the last set of tracks. I believe if you can keep an open mind about projecting love this CD will work for you.p.s. By projecting love they ask you to tell yourself silently (after you've just met someone) that you love them!!!!

BUT -- having tried 2 of the \\"While-U-Drive\\" series... I can only give these 3 stars. Why?The music. It's terrible. It's elevator music. At best, it's smooth jazz, at worst, it's the \\"demo\\" key on a Casio keyboard. His other recordings had classical or new age music, or nature sounds in the background.I should probably also mention that the format is a little different. It's Bob and his wife Deirdre, and there are talking segments mixed in-between affirmations. Nothing bad about that, but if you know his other recordings, this isn't the same thing.While-U-Drive series: the content is good, but the music is so bad that I won't be listening again.

It was painful to listen to this corny and very dated cd. These people are not gurus. I thought this nonsense went out of style in the seventies. I'm sorry, repeating to yourself \\"I feel positive. I am positive.\\" doesn't do a darn thing. That is a conceptual statement and does not register in the right brain. Visual pictures and images do register. This is a waste of time and money. Besides that, the cd skipped and stuttered on both my players.Obviously these reviewers never attended any form of human potential course or they would have already been familiar with this material. I went through this stuff thirty years ago. It didn't work then either. Save your money and buy a bottle of wine, instead.

This enthralling book had me flipping the pages as fast as I could and I couldn't even put it down. I ended up staying up really late so that I could finish it! It breathes words and emotions into history, weaving personality into text-book knowleadge. A concentrated thematical overview: Hannah, the main character, feels as if her life has been torn apart. As she tries to piece it together, she decides to start a quilt in which anyone with whom a trust was formed between them and the Chelmsford family will contribute a square of fabric to represent that person. The metaphorical meaning behind the quilt is most fascinating and cleary intriguing from the first page!

I would mostly recommend it to somone who enjoys historical fiction, like me, but the themes of trust, family, and romance can be enjoyed by all. Teenagers ages 12-16 would especially like it because they could see what life for someone their age would be like in the late 1700's. The plot has many twists and turns and has a surprise ending.

It seems like all my life, I've been trying to make sense of it, to piece it all together.\\"\\"Like the quilt?\\"\\"Yes, like the quilt.\\"Hannah Chelmsford has to hold her family together. That is why she has never been able leave her father's house, to find a separate life for herself. She has become aware of the fact that her family is painfully broken, that there is an undercurrent of secrets and anger in her house, and that she, who has been the one to take care of her brothers and sisters since her mother's death, has to hold all the pieces of her family together, like the many pieces of a quilt.Set in the post revolutionary war era, A Stitch in Time is very opulent story, abundant with human feelings. Hannah's family has long struggled under a heavy secret, a secret that destroyed her parents marriage and even now seems to be tearing apart her family. Hannah and her two sisters, Abby and Thankful, are making a quilt. At first, only pieces for family are going to be put into it, but they decide to add people who have meant something in their life, those whom they trust. When events tear the sisters far apart, their parts of the quilt link them together, and Hannah hopes that some day the quilt will bring them together again.I love how Ann Rinaldi weaves so much into the story, which I couldn't put down until I had turned the last page. Nathan Chelmsford, Hannah's father, is distant, cold, indifferent, overbearing. He refuses to allow Hannah and Abby marry the men they wish. He is cold and indifferent to Lawrence, because he wishes to paint rather than become a merchant. He is cruel and hardhearted to poor Cabot, whom he seems to hate beyond all things. To Thankful, the only child to inherit his one blue and one green eye, he places all his fatherly love, seeing her as his only perfect child.Abby elopes with a young Southerner. Lawrence, Hannah's older brother, goes west with their father and Thankful, where he hopes to paint the Indians. Guilt and anxiety plague Hannah, who fears for Thankful's safety. But what could she do, when spiteful and vindictive Thankful threatened Abby's happiness if she was not allowed to go west with her father?Louis, a young man Hannah was once engaged to, shows up at her door, asking her to take in a half-Indian baby, Louis' child, whose mother was killed by Kentuckians during a raid on a Shawnee village. Can Hannah take the baby for Louis, when there will be danger both to her and the baby in Salem? Many of the townspeople have loved ones in the west, loved ones who are in constant peril from the Shawnee Indians . . . What if they take out their anger and fear on the baby?And Richard Lander. Hannah's good friend since childhood. Already, he has asked her to marry her twice, once when she was four and he was ten. She has such confused feelings for him, especially when rumors spread about the mysterious destination of his ship, which only his investors, his crew, and he himself know. Can she learn to trust him, and to place her heart in his hands?This is the first book by Ann Rinaldi that I have read, but I enjoyed it very much and look forward to reading the two other books in the Quilt Trilogy, Broken Days and The Blue Door. I think anyone who enjoys historical fiction would love this story, which gives a very accurate depiction of the post revolutionary war era in Salem, Massachusetts, and the kind of life the townspeople would live during that time. This is definitely a book better suited to teenagers than younger readers, because it deals with some mature and serious subjects."},{"Title":"A Stitch in Time (Quilt Trilogy, Volume 1)","review":"This book has a strong theme about trust.

The Revolutionary War has ended; the former colonists are moving West--to the wild frontier of Kentucky where the relations between the Shawnee and Americans are becoming strained, resulting in hostilities on both sides. Back in civilized New England the Chelmsford household, ruled by a domineering patriarch, is in turmoil as a result of secret grudges gradually coming to the fore. Since the death of their mother two sons and three daughters have struggled with self-esteem issues, emotional survival and guilt about the past.Despite this it remains Hannah's cherished dream to create a family quilt--thereby reconnecting the broken threads of her parents' and sibling's lives. Her request for fabric scraps from some of her friends sparks resentment from her irascible father. This tyrannical man seems to hate his youngest, 12-year-old Cabot, yet he favors his willful, odd-eyed daughter, Thankful over her sisters. In fact Chelsmford blames Hannah, mistress of this dysfunctional family at a tender age, for conniving with Abby's elopement to her Southern beau, and later for urging that he bring Thankful with him on his journey West.Uneasy whispers about her maligned mother's past creep gradually into the open, as Hannah faces serious challenges: to stitch her own portion of the Quilt, to effect reforms at her father's new textile mill, and to monitor her confused young heart's yearnings between Louis, a lost love now on the frontier, and for Richard, a childhood friend and protector, now a sea captain. This loyal and devoted daughter yearns for peace within her tortured family, secretly dreaming to somehow repair cruel damage done in the painful past. Will she ever achieve freedom from her father's insidious control, whose financial manipulation controls even her fianc&eacute;? The carefully-crafted plot is cleverly layered onto an historical setting which includes details about Yankee shipping, the textile industry, and how the near West was won. Makes readers want to continue with the next book to learn how long Hannah must wait."},{"Title":"A Stitch in Time (Quilt Trilogy, Volume 1)","review":"The story of a rich New England family in the post revolutionary war era.

This situation would change your life forever.Well that's what Hannah has to deal with in the story &quot;A Stitch In Time&quot; by Ann Rinaldi.In this story Hannah is left with all the troubles that her mother has left behind after her death. There are many family problems Hannah can't deal with such as the way Hannah's father, Nathenial has betrayed his youngest son, Cabot; and the way Abigal, the oldest of the kids, ran off to marry Nate Vudeau, who she was forbidden to see. Hannah is making a quilt to try to piece back the lives they once had that were full of joy and happiness but now are full of pain and sorrow. Ann Rinaldi is a very dramatic writer. This came through in one if the scenes where Hannah gets a letter from her sister Abigal, Hannah thought Abigal was missing out at sea. The days and nights went by and Hannah had not gotten a letter from her sister. She had this awful feeling that something terrible had happened. She cried and wondered why Abigal had to go marry some wretched sea captain. Finally on a rainy, gloomy afternoon there was a quiet knock on the door. &quot;I have a letter for you miss.&quot; Hannah's legs grew weak; she carefully took the letter. &quot;Thank you,&quot; she replied. She quickly read the letter. It was from Abigal saying she was on an Island and doing well. Hannah's chest felt like an enormous weight had been lifted off off.

When materials are better understood and better utilized, architects and designers typically produce better projects.Recent innovations in material technology, design and use have come to the forefront of architectural design and have begun to question the very way in which we fabricate our built environments.Blaine Brownell's recent book Transmaterial looks exclusively at recent material innovation in an attempt to \\"redefine our physical environment\\". Based upon Brownell's email digests and website of the same name, Transmaterial is a materials reference book subdivided into sections with material images, descriptions, and contact information for the products. The format is easily accessible, and the content is concise. Due to its ease of use and readability, the palette of materials available to the reader/designer/architect encourages current and future project introspection.For example, why use just basic concrete when you could use translucent concrete instead? How about utilizing a collapsible, reusable textile brick system in lieu of a traditional stud and drywall partition for a project? The possibilities for integrating different, new, and innovative techniques are endless for almost any design project.As evidence of the book's success, Brownell has already begun work on a follow-up to Transmaterial as more materials or innovations become readily available.A resource such as Transmaterial provides more than just innovative materials for our use, but encourages potential for innovation for the environments that architects and designers create. While materials are a component of the overall design, the importance of their appropriate or innovative use is what can make or break a project. Transmaterial is the icebreaker to the typical office discussion of project materials as it proposes an alternate dialogue that is appropriate and desperately needed.As a book, Transmaterial is limited in providing up-to-date material listings. Thus, the original email digests and website remain critical to Transmaterial's success.While initially informative, Transmaterial lacks the necessary research and information in regards to material advantages and disadvantages, installation techniques and issues, and information relative to material costs. All of these factors need to be researched further for a respective project before they can be utilized for a project.While Transmaterial begins a decent discussion for innovative materials that may be used for projects, it is up to architects and designers to take it upon themselves to carry on the discussion."},{"Title":"Transmaterial: A Catalog of Materials That Redefine our Physical Environment","review":"Although some of the items listed seem to be artist's projects that are in no way commercialized or buyable, this book is a treasure of inspiration and a good catalogue of new technologies.It can make your project come true.

Rogues' Reform contains three Stephanie Laurens stories (including An Unwilling Conquest) set during the English Regency. The stories feature the romances of the three Lester siblings, a sister and two brothers. The set is excellent and I would highly recommend them. They are much tamer, however, than Laurens more recent novels dealing with the Cynster family. Note: the hero in A Comfortable Wife, Lord Phillip Ruthven is introduced in Rogues' Reform."},{"Title":"An Unwilling Conquest (A Harlequin Historical Romance)","review":"Stephanie Laurens, noted for her sensual Cynster novels, breaks away from the Cynsters with this traditional Regency Romance. Handsome Harry Lester, horseracer and known rake, meets the beautiful, independent Mrs. Lucinda Babbacombe, widow and businesswoman, as he pulls her out of her overturned carriage on the road to Newmarket. Lucinda needs to remain in town in order to visit the various inns she owns. Harry has Lucinda stay with his Aunt Em in order to keep an eye on her so that the other rakes in town do not take advantage of the beautiful widow. Harry vows to never succumb to marriage like his friends and family and fights the allure of Luccinda. Eventually they come together one passionate afternoon. Harry then proposes to Lucinda, but she declines, feeling he is proposing out of honor rather than love. Harry then decides that he will win Lucinda's love by courting her in the traditional way. If you are a fan of the Regency, you will enjoy this courtship and romp through the ballrooms of the ton. Once again Ms. Laurens delights us with her knowledge of horseracing in the Regency period. If you are a fan of her other sensual romances, you will be a bit frustrated waiting for more of her wonderfully written love scenes, which just aren't here. This is a heartwarming story that will keep you smiling and believing that the traditional Regency is not a dead genre."},{"Title":"An Unwilling Conquest (A Harlequin Historical Romance)","review":"Ok, the writing is very good, but I just didn't like the story line. It felt a little bit cold at times.****warning SPOILERS*******Harry, a wealthy rake and horse breeder, meets Lucinda, a financially astute widower, in Newport. He's there to race his horses and she's there to look over Inns, which she's inherited upon her husbands death. Sparks fly. Harry refuses to allow Lucinda to visit and inspect the questionable establishments without a proper escort -himself and insists she stay at his Aunts nearby. The mutual attraction grows and soon everyone is trying to push the reluctant Harry into leg shackles.They all return to London and one thing leads to another and Lucinda is compromised. Much to Harry's shock -she was a virgin! Apparently her much older husband married her for companionship/teacher for his daughter and to prevent Lucinda from a distasteful marriage. So Harry offers marriage after the comprise, but not for love. Lucinda rejects him of course! Here's where the book takes a down turn.Harry believes he has to prove that her loves Lucinda before he actually says the words -in his mind he thinks she won't believe him otherwise. Lucinda takes on a desperate role here. Every turn she believes that Harry will declare his love -but he doesn't.It gets a bit too much, especially when he takes her to his home and tells her he's getting it ready for a wife and children -making it seem that maybe she won't be the wife. Makes me so sad for Lucinda! She just becomes depressed that he'll never tell her that he loves her. And when he finally does? No big sweeping romantic jesture! You feel like she's just about given up by this point. Makes Harry out to be sort of a meanie to me.It just didn't leave me all warm and fuzzy. Good book, but there are better out there.

Dont get me wrong its an OK book but not what I have come to expect. I can only excuse it by saying it was one of her earlier books and released through Harlequin Mills & Boon London.From the first meeting of Harry and Lucinda they are intrigue by each other. Later after becoming intimate with her, Harry decides that they should marry but Lucinda refuses because she wants Harry to love her first. However Harry has been burned in a relationship before and refuses to risk the same thing happening again. Lucinda soon despairs that he will ever express his love and starts to accept that her love may have to be enough. Eventually Harry explains that the manner in which he acted was to show proof of his devotion and love.I found the hero too restrained for my liking, too impassive. Yes he appoints himself as her protector and thereby shows that he does care but he refused to show any emotions, except for annoyance. He does not romance Lucinda or does anything to show she is his world and that he needs her to make his life meaningful. What he says was proof of his love seems more more like proof of his possessiveness towards Lucinda.Conclusion: Good plot, well written but not enough passion and romance."},{"Title":"An Unwilling Conquest (A Harlequin Historical Romance)","review":"interesting how the writer shows that love can find you anywhere. one cannot run away from love when it is time - it will find you"},{"Title":"An Unwilling Conquest (A Harlequin Historical Romance)","review":"I love the strong minded women that Stephanie creates.

The stories are: \\"No Truce with Kings\\" (_Fantasy and Science Fiction_, 1963), \\"Turning Point\\" (_If_, 1963), \\"Escape from Orbit\\" (_Amazing_, 1962), \\"Epilogue\\" (_Analog_, 1962), \\"The Critique of Impure Reason\\" (_If_, 1962), and \\"Eve Times Four\\" (_Fantastic_, 1960). The first story won the Hugo for best short fiction of 1963. This was at a time when only one award for short fiction was given per year.A quick skim of passages throughout this collection reveals that Anderson was a multisensory writer. That is, in his descriptive or action passages, he would deliberately choose words or phrases that appealed to at least two or three different senses: those of sight, sound, taste, touch, smell, and motion. Here is one sample from \\"No Truce with Kings\\":The whole mess was drunk, and the junior officers at the far end of the table were only somewhat noisier than their seniors near the colonel. Rugs and hangings could not muffle the racket, shouts, stamping boots, thump of fists on oak and clash of cups raised aloft, that rang from wall to stony wall. High up among the shadows that hid the rafters they hung from, the regimental banners stirred in the draft, as if to join the chaos. Below, the light of bracketed lanterns and bellowing fireplace winked on trophies and weapons. (7)And here is one from \\"Escape from Orbit\\":The ringing cut like a buzz saw. For a moment Wister denied it. He was riding a white horse whose mane and tail were flames, the great muscles surged between his legs, wind roared and whipped about him, smelling of summer meadows. _Brrng!_ Bees droned through clover. The wind had a tinge of Julie's hair, a sunny odor, but a sharp clean whiff of rocket fuel strengthened as it thrust against him. (75)This technique (which was also used by Gustave Flaubert) has advantages and dangers. The main advantage is that it anchors a scene firmly in the reader's mind. The main danger is that the reader may sometimes feel that such a scene is overwritten and too poetic. Anderson usually handles such passages fairly well. But he sometimes slips. Yes, he sometimes slips.Two of the stories, \\"Eve Times Four\\" and \\"The Critique of Impure Reason,\\" are amusing but forgettable pieces. The first is about a spacegoing Lothario who is stranded on a planet with three beautiful women. Unfortunately for his plans, one of the women is smarter than he. The second tale concerns a robot who will not work because he is besotted with modern literature and literary criticism.The other four stories represent Anderson in top form. \\"No Truce with Kings\\" is a war story set on a future, semi-primitive Earth with aliens coming into the mix. The title, plot, and theme is a clear nod to Kipling. \\"Turning Point\\" is a poignant first contact story that gives a haunting portrait of the price of giftedness and the loss of innocence. Each time that I have reread this story over the years, I have felt a deeper emotional pang.\\"Escape from Orbit\\" is really two stories. On one level, it is a hard science fiction puzzle: How do you rescue some astronauts stranded in orbit around the moon? On another level, it is a character portrait of the less-than-glamorous family man and ex-astronaut who has the know-how to save the day. The story succeeds on both levels.\\"Epilogue\\" is about a crew of Earthmen who return to Earth after a long absence. They find that it has been taken over by a kind of transistor-based ecology of machines. A lack of understanding between the robots and the humans leads to tragedy. The last line underscores the title.I do not want to claim that any single collection will do justice to Anderson's short fiction. But if you haven't read many of his stories, this would certainly be a good starter volumn. The power in the more serious tales comes from Anderson's knowledge that victories are never complete, and they do not come without a price."},{"Title":"Time and Stars (Macfadden SF, 75-330)","review":"A very solid SF collection from the sixties.

Gertrude, Paul's mother, tries to live her life through her sons' lives. His brothers have their individual problems as well. I enjoyed the book due to its simplicity in plot but its tough reading style. The british text really sets it in its time. On the other hand, I found the book boring at times. Overall, it gets a 3."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"Of all the 20th century books I've read, this is by all means the greatest. It's the wonderful - and at times heart-breaking - story of the Morels, significantly Paul Morel. It tells of his years as a boy and as a man, the women he painfully loves, and his struggle to obtain peace of mind. It's definitely a story worth reading, and one you're sure to like."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"I hated this book. It's not the writing that's in question. Although what Lawrence describes is formidably bleak, nevertheless he describes it well - even the minor warmths that sustain the people. And it's not that he is not perceptive either - there were moments when he could have been writing my story, used exactly the same words I did to describe the same feelings.It was the characters I didn't like at all, especially Paul Morel (moral?). In the first half of the novel we learn a lot about his mother - in fact for a long time I thought the novel was about her. In the second half of the novel the story moves to her third child Paul (the second, Annie, is minor; the last, Arthur, almost trivial) and his 'loves' for Miriam and Clara. Miriam is pure and initially Paul leaves her that way, only activating the relationship later when Clara tells him he had never really tried with her. But once the relationship is sexual Paul retreats. Clara, the alternative woman, is separated from her husband and Paul experiences real passion in winning her over, but she too is unsatisfying to him. Is it his mother's love for him, and his love for her that is to blame? But who are these two women who we have little knowledge of to give us a foundation of understanding of their behaviour as we do of Paul and his mother?What really distressed me was the selfishness of Paul - one of his last acts in the novel - with his sister Annie - is truly appalling (it's not sexual). So what is Lawrence's reason for drafting the novel as he did. Many people experience disturbances to their sexual awakenings, but I would like to think that outcomes do not necessarily have to be as bleak as Lawrence portrays. This is a novel - it doesn't have to faithfully represent people's awful experiences. By doing so for his characters I can't help feel that Lawrence is fatalistic - if things go wrong for you, bad luck, you'll end up a derelict and there is no help for it. I cannot accept this.The most moving parts of the novel both involve Paul's mother - related to the death of her eldest child William and her own death.Other recommendations:Wedekind: Springtime AwakeningTurgenev: Spring Torrents"},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"I just loved this book, what a work of art.

I didn't really like it to much but I recognized the man had talent. He has some of the most elegant prose I have ever read. I heard this is a superior novel and much more profound so I decided to give it a whirl.Basically I couldn't stand it. I admit his writing is great, but I just can't get into this. Maybe it's the subject matter which is kind of strange, or maybe it's just personal taste, I don't know for sure. I am a great fan of literature of all kinds, but the period of writing from 1910-1925 I don't seem to enjoy. Sure Joyce wrote some ingenious things, Hemmingway was a great romantic writer but the stuff just doesn't click with me. Oh well, I gave the book 2 stars because I enjoyed the prose, but that is all I enjoyed."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"This has been the most artless novel I've tried to read this year. It was excruciatingly long and I could barely get to page 200. I could not finish it. I actually ran out and bought the Great Gatsby just to remind myself what a great novel is supposed to be.It was like Lawrence just decided to slap everything together about these dull people, all without consideration for the reader's patience. I don't think in the history of literature have I ever seen so much description of people looking at each other and walking around. And the dialogue was exceedingly hollow. The father could have been extremely interesting but almost all the time, I had no idea what he was saying with Lawrence's annoying use of colloquial country English. Of course, Lawrence is quite literate; he knows a lot about scenery and nature but that's not what makes a book great. It is plotting, lyricism, and resonance that makes a book fun to read, and not to mention selection and editing and the craftmanship of scenes and situations. Worse yet, his prose style is sickeningly robotic. It made me want to puke. So far this year, all the supposedly great Brit writers have been thoroughly disappointing."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"knowing the reputation of this novel, i was curious to find out what the fuss was about. but i found that the best thing about the novel is the description of his family, especially in the first part. his writing is simple and direct, and part one paints a very vivid picture of working-class life in england circa 1900. the other thing that surprised me about the book is the euthanasia at the end. i wasn't prepared for this and quite honestly was shocked to read about paul and his sister annie 'gliggling' and they prepare the morphium od for their mum. paul's love for his mother is also disturbing. his last kiss of the beloved cadaver is completely morbid. frankly, i'm surprised this aspect of the novel didn't cause more controversy. in comparison, the sexual material is pretty tame, granted i am 100 years removed from the book's first appearance.the structure of the book is based naturally on the biography, but still, the story is a little shapeless. there are characters and incidents introduced that are never taken up and resolved. paul's brother arthur, for example, makes short appearances from time to time, but he doesn't figure in the story at all. you can argue this is like real life, and maybe this is what lawrence was trying to achieve, but by the standards of a traditional novel, it is sloppy.i also never really got into the book. usually, i race to the end to find out what happened, but with 'sons and lovers', i coasted. at first, i thought this was because of the book's shapelessness, but there's no reason a biographical work of fiction can't be well structured. i realized the reason is that paul morel is just not your typical 'hero' of a biographical book. in fact, he's no hero at all. he has too many worts and he doesn't try to cover them up - i think this unlikeableness or aloofness of the main character makes the book itself unlikeable and hard to get into.nevertheless, lawrence does write nicely and the novel has some very interesting moments. worth a read.3 1/2 stars"},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"Gertrude Morel thought at first that she was getting into a good marriage. Walter Morel seemed happy and successful and was not a drinker. She thought he would make a good husband and a good father to their children. It was only after they were married for awhile that she found that he spent much of his time drunk and didn't own any of the property he'd told her he owned. A seed of resentment was planted.Once their children, especially two sons, William and Paul, were born, Gertrude stopped caring much about her husband at all and concentrated on her offspring.Paul ends up with his mother's undiluted attention and affection. His decisions are largely based on keeping her happy, and when his thoughts wander to other females, such as those he dates, his mother grows petulant and her pouting convinces her son to come back to her. Although Paul has a good job and a bright future as an artist, he finds himself unwilling to commit to the girls he dates, because nobody can quite match up to his mother in his mind.This is a sad story of a mother ruining her son's life without meaning to. She really only wants to love him, but her love is so overbearing that she doesn't leave room for anyone else in his mind.The characters in this story didn't grab me. They were all incredibly weak, from Walter with his drinking problem drifting farther and farther away from his family; to Paul, unable to break away from his mother; to Gertrude, unable to make a life for herself and clinging to her son instead; to Miriam, allowing herself to be hurt over and over instead of walking away from Paul once and for all. They all needed to have some sense shaken into them."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"I wish I'd lived around the turn of the century. Then I could have gotten any piece of tripe published, judging by this novel. Were standards just lower then? 'Sons and Lovers' is the long winded cause of an uninspired idea. DH Lawrence took the members of his family, attached an 'emotion' to them, then narrated his life (slowly) repeating this emotion (the 'I may be poor but you can't take away my dignity' mother, the 'I'm going to drink to hurt you' father, the sensitive son, whatever). The book's tension is portentous and its prose is artless save an occasional lapse into the countryside (how many ways can you describe green hills and wysteria? someone should have told Lawrence, not many).My theory is that 'Sons and Lovers' falls under the Gatsby effect - since it's taught so much in high school it is often one of the first novels people read. And the first novel you read to learn the way novels work will always feel the quintessential, even when the sad truth is there are probably more skilled manuscripts passing by publishers' desks everyday. Someone just hit that banal note first."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"D.H. Lawerence kinda scares you with this book. It's beginning chapters, while it introduces you to characters, are boring. Let's face it: Classic British Literature is boring, and Lawerence only adds to it worse.

A man, living his life with constant remorse because no other woman can satisfy due to his mother?? How sad and how pathetic. The guy lost his virginity to a girl, then LEAVES her.

The novel is the story of the Morel family. Gertrude and Walter Morel married and went to Bestwood, a mining village in Nottinghamshire. She was a well educated and refined person; he was a warm, vigorous, uneducated man. They had four children- Annie, the daughter, and three sons- William, Paul, and Arthur. As Gertrude Morel's sons grew up, she no longer felt love for her husband, and instead turned all her love and passion towards her sons. The sons grew up hating their father and completely dependent upon their mother, who became the strongest factor in their lives; as a result, when they became men, they were unable to find a satisfactory relationship with any woman. William, the eldest, chose a flignty girl who gave him physical satisfaction, but nothing more, for his soul was his mother's. The struggle of this impasse killed him. Paul the second eldest, chose Miriam, who fought his mother for his soul; torn between the two women he ultimately returned to his mother. Later, he turned for a physical relationship to Clara, an older married woman, but again he found that the ties with his mother were too strong for a succesful relationship. Paul told his mother that as long as she lived he could not live a full life or love any woman. She became ill, and Paul dedicated his life completely to her.

A reader from today will start thinking about how much fun Freud would have with this within the first few chapters.I would have to say that I have not read a lot of D.H. Lawrence, but this book has convinced me to read more. The actions Paul, the main character, takes tell you what is happening, but if you look at the imagery of nature around them, you will have another idea of what is going on. Lawrence is a great writer. Look at the flowers when Paul and Clara have finished walking the slippery path by the river. Look closely at the flowers that are given to Clara when they stop for tea.I would recommend this book to anyone. If you are a student, I might recommend using a journal for your notes or getting a used copy of another edition which has larger margins."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"This book made it to Time's Top 100 List of the best fiction of the 20th century. While the prose has merit, I don't quite see why it placed so high on the list nor is this edition the best. There is no table of contents and the chapter distinctions are poor; so too is the editing as there are many typos. Despite all that, Lawrence's primitively modernist novel is well-constructed and very innovative for its time.

Somehow doing this usually means that most people emerge with a hatred of it but Lawrence's book is of such quality that it is able to survive.It is about a woman who marries a coal miner someone who is below her class. While he is young there is some joy in her life but as she grows older the class differences create a wall between them. She lives for her two male children who she tried to keep out of the mines and to ensure that they can live middle class lives. As she grows older the children become more important to her. The death of the oldest means that she suffocates the younger son with a love that affects his normal development.The story is told through the eyes of the younger son. There is little question that the novel is autobiographical and based on the early life of Lawrence. His life is almost identical to the events portrayed in the novel.Lawrence was a prolific novelist and short story reader but this work is probably his most accessible. His later novels tended to be more about peoples relationships but without the social content.Nowadays the class issues have receded a bit into the background. At the time of its publication the book would have been seen as revealing the divisions that operated in Britain. Most critics tend to focus on the relationship of Lawrence and his mother as the primary focus of the novel. To some extent this is true but the book is much more. It is a portrait of a society thankfully now gone. It is the portrait of a young man being propelled by his mother to escape his fathers destiny. Unlike Lawrence's other books which have tended to date this book is easy to read and still a classic."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"Emotional manipulation and possessiveness are at the core of this most intriguing novel. D.H. Lawrence's SONS AND LOVERS greets the reader with the author's elegant prose while systematically immersing the story in a swirling cloud of tangled dysfunction.Married to a drunken, rowdy coal miner in early 20th Century England, Gertrude Morel has neither a life nor a true love. Her only chance for happiness--as she sees it--is to live vicariously through her sons: first William, then Paul. Her subsequent possessiveness, her relentless interference in their lives, is smothering and destructive. When William dies, Gertrude devotes all of her attention--her manipulation--to Paul. Her son becomes a symbolic soulmate. . .lover. . .and Gertrude is unable to let him go to pursue his own relationships.Torn between his love for his mother and his guilt whenever he harbors feelings of affection for another woman, Paul is anything but a suitable suitor. He falls in love with Miriam, but his emotional dysfunction all but dooms the relationship--a relationship constantly sabotaged by his mother. Needing a physical outlet, he has a brief affair with a married woman, Clara Dawes, but even then, his love for and devotion to his mother prevails. As his mother's health fails, Paul's existence becomes even more problematic, culminating in a transcendent death.SONS AND LOVERS is not a &quot;feel good&quot; read, and Paul's inability to break free from the psychological bondage with his mother is frustrating and sometimes exasperating. Yet the true victim of this Lawrence classic is not Paul, but Miriam, who only wishes to love, and be loved in return. The man she has fallen in love with is incapable of such devotion: the tragic complexity of the story lingers long after this book has been put down.--D. Mikels"},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"The story is brilliant. It is about how a woman (the mother, Gertrude) takes her son (Paul) as her lover instead of choosing her husband. She did not have the will to love the husband, and instead turned that will on a child. The title is not &quot;Fathers and Lovers&quot; or &quot;Husbands and Lovers.&quot; The father is capable of being loved, but in Gertrude's mind, she is too good for the husband. Therefore, she turns her lover's heart towards a child (&quot;Sons and Lovers&quot;). In modern psychobabble, Gertrude doesn't recognize boundaries. The child is defenseless to the emotional power which penetrates him. He is absorbed and becomes one with the mother's heart and goals. It is similar to molestation but instead of a physical penetration, there is an emotional penetration. When the boy starts to grow up and should, rightly, begin to become whole with a woman, he is not free to take that step. His sexuality drives him towards an appropriate lover, and seemingly makes him appear available, but his emotional heart cannot take another woman into himself. There is already a lover who has penetrated his heart (i.e. his mother). For a man to be complete in love, he has to be able to enter a woman physically at the same time he takes her into himself emotionally. Paul can't allow another woman in emotionally because his mother is already there. Hence, even though he is able to enter a woman physically, the whole experience is deeply unsatisfying to both Paul and all the women in his life. The mother is not really satisfied because she can't have her lover completely (i.e. physically and as her life's mate), and the other women in Paul's life (with whom he could have a physical relationship) are left unsatisfied because he wills not to take them into himself emotionally, and thereby deprives these women of the experience of wholeness which accompanies surrender in love. Hence, the women he should be able to complete himself with (i.e. those with whom he can complete the physical act), he eventually wears out. They give up because he is not available. His heart belongs to another. E.g. Claire goes back to her husband even though Claire's husband is less refined, because Claire would rather have all of a working man, than only part of an artist. There are scads of women today who are throwing themselves at this inpenetrable wall of the mother's inappropriate molestation of her son's emotions, not really understanding why and how to work with it. Lawrence sheds insight into that process. The cure is to exchange the will to love the mother for the will to love the lover. Go for it!"},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"This work by D.H. Lawrence was rated number 9 on the top 100 list, and I think it's a fair rating. Sons and Lovers is a beautifully written and intricately drawn story of a young man. This actually serves as a pseudo autobiography as it mirrors DHL's life rather closely. There is a quality to this work that you do not find in contemporary novels. The characters are developed to an incredible depth and with great skill and precision. You find after reading this book that you feel you know some of the characters better than your neighbors. This is not a book about action or drama, it is about life. The focus here is not on the storyline, but on the people involved in it. As opposed to today's authors, Lawrence uses the storyline to define the character and personality of the participants. I think this book is so well written that it can make you look at your own friends and family and understand how little you really know of them. Many scholars talk about the idea of Lawrence introducing the Oedipal complex, but it's not really what this book is all about. While that psychiatrical phenomenon is a component of this work, the defining quality of this work is really about Lawrence's ability to capture the people in his story as eloquently and with such detail as he has. If you can appreciate good literature, this book is a must read for you."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"This story of the Morel family begins with a dramatic portrayal of the effect industrialization has on human lives. Mr. Morel, a coal miner in turn-of-the-century Britain, lives a life of drudgery, anger and desperation. He takes his frustrations out on his wife Gertrude, while the real source of his unhappiness is his own low self-esteem. Gertrude is embittered by his hardness and so looks to her sons to fill all her emotional needs. This constitutes Part One of the novel, which to this reviewer's taste is the more satisfying section. The detailed descriptions of the arguments and even outright fights between the married couple are as powerful as anything in fiction, and bleakly dramatize how poverty can destroy the very hearts and souls of the working classes. Morel is oppressed by his employer, so he in turn oppresses his wife, who emotionally smothers her sons. Fight the power!All of which is what makes Part Two such a disappointment. The entire second half of the book revolves around the second son, Paul, and how his closeness to his mother makes it impossible for him to engage in satisfactory relationships with other women. Miriam, the milquetoast who yearns for a transcendent, spiritual love, cares for Paul so much that she lets him walk all over her. The much tougher and independent Clara introduces Paul to a more physically satisfying relationship, but neither of them has any real attachment to the other. The weakness of this second half is not just that it all seems to take far too long; it's that over time, the characters become very unsympathetic. None of them have the strength of will to break away from their failing relationships, despite the fact that these failures cast dark shadows across their lives. And there's certainly nothing tragic about these young people mooning about, complaining that their relationships aren't what they'd like them to be; most especially in the context of Part One, which reminds us that there are people in this world who are really suffering.Readers who are deeply interested in the internal subtleties of male-female relationships (and this probably includes a majority of young women) will love this book. If the two parts were published separately, this reviewer would unhesitatingly give Part One five stars, while grudgingly giving Part Two three and a half. For Mama's boys (and those who've seriously dated them) this book certainly rates five stars, but others will find these characters so annoying that even four stars may seem generous."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"This is probably the most autobiographical of Lawrence's novels, dealing with the childhood, adolescence and early adulthood of the author. It is a brutally frank portrayal of the relationship betweem a domineering mother and the younger (and surviving) son, a relationship that colors every aspect of the protagonist's life, from his relationship with his father to his romantic relationships with two very different women. Lawrence paints this portrait with very fine brush strokes: an attention to descriptive detail and some of the best characterization in modern English literature. Although the reader might not like the characters in the novel, there is no doubt that these are real people - especially the mother, Mrs. Morel. The setting of the novel is the coal fields of Nottingham and Lawrence carries on the work begun by Thomas Hardy in writing of the English working class with realism and detachment, eschewing the English literary tendency to moralize and to judge.When Lawrence began the novel he had only passing knowledge of the theories of Freud regarding the mother-son relationship that became the backbone of the psychologist's Oedipus Complex. Essentially the author was writing from experience: the psychic bond between Mrs. Morel and her son, Paul, was very similar to the bond shared by Lawrence and his mother. This bond between son and mother amounts almost to a husband and wife sort of love - without the sex - and prevents the son from ever achieving a fully satisfactory relationship with another woman because of the hold the mother has on the son's soul. It is not until the mother is dead that the son is able to begin to free himself from her hold. The novel, then, is the story of that struggle.I have never been a great fan of Lawrence's literary style, finding it a bit too jerky and over edited - a criticism I find with this novel. True, there are passages of poetic beauty (especially some of the descriptions of the Nottinghamshire countryside) but I found the prose a bit too tedious and lacking spontaneity. This is probably Lawrence's best novel (far superior to the more popular Lady Chatterley's Lover) and the one on which his reputation is firmly based; also, a novel that should be read by every mother and every son."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"I read this a long time ago and hated it with a passion. I was chuckling reading the one-star reviews here, because had the Internet been around when I first read this book, I would have given it a scathing, one-star review.The first time around, I was bored to tears, and it took me forever to finish. This time, I was so moved by certain sections my tears were falling on the page, and it took me only a week (or maybe it was six days) to finish. And though I will never call this my favorite classic, I liked it so much that currently I am reading Lawrence's \\"The Rainbow.\\"Make sure you get an edition that helps explain the dialect. After a while, I was able to figure it out myself, and that was kind of fun -- almost like learning a new language."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"D.H. Lawrence is a beautiful writer that goes deep into the human mind and soul to write. He is never satisfied with meer fiction, with mediocre descriptions or with plain verse. Lawrence loves to pick the mind and sexuality of both males and females. His books, though called dirty and shameful, interpret the minds of lustful and questioning young adults in a way that makes love and sex accepting and wonderful.Sons and Lovers can be considered Lawrences autobiography, because of the events and places that were used in the book resemble much of the writer's own life. It gives, therefore, an interpretation of how close Lawrence and his mother really were. D.H. Lawrence has written a woman's thoughts better than many female writers have and spectics have always guessed that he has been able to understand women so well because of his mother's raising. This book will give proof to this idea. Lawrence is very vulnerable here because he not only exposes himself as the son, but also inevitable as the lover.I loved this book not only for it's intuition, but also for it's ability to keep me entertained and excited throughout the events of the lives of the characters. Again, D.H. Lawrence is taking his place as one of my favorite authors of all time!"},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"Sons and Lovers by D. H. Lawrence. Recommended.Sons and Lovers is said to be the most autobiographical of D. H. Lawrence's novels; according to the introduction by Benjamin DeMott, some critics have found it too flatly so. Like the protagonist Paul Morel, Lawrence was born to a coal miner and a woman who has married beneath her class, and his older brother died young, DeMott notes. Many other details coincide as well.Unlike some of Lawrence's other works, such as Women in Love, in which Lawrence explores lofty themes in a philosophical and often grim tone, Sons and Lovers is as down to earth as Paul's rough, violent, yet congenial father Walter. Despite his many apparent and iterated flaws, Walter Morel is shown as a whole person rather than a fictional creation, with a gentle, content, industrious side, at least when he's sober. Perhaps his \\"smallness\\" is a function of where he is and who he is expected to be rather than who he could be. He's so tied to his lot in life, the mining life, that it never occurs to him that his more gifted sons could aspire to more. That they achieve more is a source of both pride and derision for Walter Morel. Although Walter is a background character (to both reader and to the Morel family), it is he, \\"an outsider,\\" who forges the bond between Gertrude Morel and her sons, first William, then Paul.Gertrude Morel is not the first woman to try to live her life through her children, but her hold over her sons dooms their relationships with other women to failure and leaves them deeply unsatisfied and unhappy. Her motivations may be questionable, but she is sometimes right. William's fianc&eacute;e Lily would have cost him dearly, emotionally and financially, had he lived to marry her, and Mrs. Morel sees her own mistake of a marriage in his future. Although she makes her beliefs known, she seems willing to let William make his decision and suffer the consequences.Having learned from the experience with William, Mrs. Morel takes a different approach with Paul, who seems to be her last, best hope for justifying her own life. Her relationship with Paul becomes overtly sexual. When they go out together, they behave like lovers on a date. \\"He stroked his mother's hair, and his mouth was on her throat.\\" When Paul tells his mother that he doesn't love Miriam (how can he?), she \\"kissed him in a long, fervent kiss. 'My boy!' she said, in a voice trembling with passionate love. Without knowing, he gently stroked her face.\\"It would be too easy to attribute all this to an Oedipal complex, but it is more complicated, as life is. Paul serves as Mrs. Morel's alter ego, pseudo-lover, and breadwinner. Everything she did not or cannot have must be Paul's. She is savvy enough to know who is a threat to her hold and who is not. She recognises in Miriam a woman much like herself-intelligent, thwarted, let down by men, hungry for a kindred spirit or soul mate. Paul, too, is aware of this and hates Miriam for it-and for the fact he does, indeed, love her, making him unfaithful to the woman to whom he owes his fidelity. There are spiritual overtones as well, as the religious Miriam tries to sacrifice herself for Paul, whom she sees as a \\"Walter Scott hero.\\" This sacrifice repels Paul ever further.Mrs. Morel rightly perceives that Clara Dawes is not a threat to her-she is fascinating, attractive, enigmatic, and sensual, but she lacks the ability to be more to Paul than a diversion from Miriam, Mom, and himself. Knowing that nothing of importance will come of this affair, Mrs. Morel even encourages it. It cannot divert Paul from her, and it fails as a result.In the end, the only intimacy Paul is capable of is with his mother. She has come between him and his own consciousness-and he has allowed her. Everything is filtered through her. How she has achieved this is not always clear, as she uses more than rhetoric and conscious effort to mold Paul. When he wishes her dead, there is hope that then he would begin to live. \\"Mother!\\" he whimpered. \\"Mother!\\" Then: \\"He would not take that direction, to the darkness, to follow her.\\" With the past buried, there may be a future for him. Only Lawrence knew as he wrote this most human of his novels..."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"In D.H. Lawrence's &quot;Sons and Lovers,&quot; the Morel family lives in a coal mining village in late 19th Century rural England; the father Walter is a coal miner who comes home drunk every night and fights, often physically, with his wife and children. Unable to control her husband's unruliness, Mrs. Morel directs her affection to her three sons, instigating them to turn against their father. Her love for her sons is not merely maternal, but so possessive that she gets jealous when the boys focus their attention on the neighborhood girls, whom she treats with haughty condescension.Paul, the middle son, is Lawrence's alter ego. He aspires to be an artist but works as a clerk in a surgical appliance factory to bring money home to the family. When his older brother William dies of pneumonia, Paul replaces him as the primary object of his mother's affections. At times their mutual endearment is so extreme and smothering that it's downright creepy, such as when she embraces Paul and tells him that she never &quot;really&quot; had a husband, implying that Paul somehow must act as a spousal surrogate.Paul starts a shy relationship with a girl named Miriam, but his mother's guilt trip prevents him from making a full commitment. Eventually he turns his interest to an older woman, Clara Dawes, who works in his factory and is separated from her husband. As opposed to the clingy, sensitive, virginal Miriam, Clara is liberated, proud, aloof, sexually passionate, and generally distrustful of men. Her husband, who also works in the factory, is a loose cannon and tries violently to intimidate Paul.Paul's relationships with Miriam and Clara are full of tension and antagonism. He unleashes on the women the hostilities that he had stored subconsciously against his mother, criticizing them for faults displayed by Mrs. Morel and not their own. It is ironic that his mother dies from cancer, since Paul realizes that his mother's cancerous influence on him lingers even after her death.Lawrence's motive in writing this book may have been to exorcise some childhood and adolescent demons, maybe in an attempt to explain his own personal relationships with women. At any rate, he is an excellent writer; like W. Somerset Maugham, his prose is direct and unpretentious, and he can write romantic scenes and dialogue without being melodramatic or tawdry. The theme of maternal influence is timeless, relevant in any age, and Lawrence captures it perfectly."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"This novel was required reading in one of my college classes. I think it's a good story, well-written, with conflict and drama. Lawrence creates a very real setting, a very real time period, and real characters who are in conflict over their wants and needs. The conflict between working class necessity (putting bread on the table) and middle class values (wanting the bread served on fine china set on lace tablecloths) reverberates throughout the story. I found it sad that the character (and, presumably, D.H. Lawrence himself) chose one parent and one set of values over another, though I do understand that he felt he had to do this in order to live a literary life. The characters in this story aren't exactly likable, though they aren't bad people. For me, this book succeeds because it paints a real portrait of different class values."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"My edition takes pains to make clear that Lawrence had not read Freud before he wrote this book, and was only slightly familiar with psychoanalytic theory when the novel was published. That makes it all the more interesting that Sons and Lovers is basically a case history of an Oedipal Complex. Also, Lawrence's alter-ego Paul comes across as a person who (as Lawrence would later say of himself)'tends to homosexuality' but there too it is unclear whether Lawrence realizes this or is revealing more than he means to. Generally the feeling is that of reading someone's most intimate diary, and wondering if he intended it for publication all along. And while the diarist is a pompous, annoying sort of a person, it's intriguing enough that you're inspired to keep going.As added fun while reading, play a game I'm calling Misogynist Bingo and see how many times in the book a female character 'bends', 'bows', or 'drops' her head, compared with how often a male character does. Emo-chick Miriam's neck, particularly, is liable to snap in two at any minute from sheer overuse."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"This book was rather interesting, possibly because it is about mommas boys and I happen to currently be dating one...lol it is kind of an inside view from the mothers perspective. Great read, would and have recommended it. I think its only 400 pages or so, so its not exceedingly difficult. I am most likely going to read some of D.H. Lawrence's other books now."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"Paul Morel, the protagonist of Sons and Lovers, can only give his heart to one woman. And as long as his mother is alive, she will sabotage any relationship that Paul tries to form. Paul wavers with Miriam and Clara, two love interests, because he is unconditionally bound to his mother. He has seen how she has been mistreated and vows not to make her life harder. Lawrence's Sons and Lovers is a rehashing of Oedipus Rex, with richer, more developed characters whose fate is equally heartbreaking."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"This great and slowly moving novel remains one of the final great works in the English Romantic tradition. D.H. Lawrence's conservative style almost wants to remain in the pre-industrial world. This wonderful novel is both an oedipal portrait of a bourgois mother and her domestic conflicts with her mismatched and drunken husband and her future attempts to conserve her possession over her children. Paul Morel is the central figure, whose life revolves around his struggle with his love of two women and his devotion to his mother. Sons and Lovers is at its core about the dehumanizing effects of the modern world. It is no longer possible to live in peace and harmony with ones environment. Man has now been reduced to his functions. Although this novel does not really get going until the second half, the final passages remain some of the finest of English writing. A great though often dreary classic."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"It was a pleasure to read this book,written in such a simple, crisp style and yet conveys the gravity of emotions between mother and son flawlessly with beautiful prose, subtle expressions, quiet reflections and profound discoveries.

I never found myself becoming bored during the book, in fact, there were many times where I found it hard to put the book down. I have recomended this book to everybody, including to the person reading this review.Maybe the book is good for me because I can somewhat relate to Paul Morel's character at times. Now I am not saying that I am in love with my mother, but his akwardness in the earlier sections of the book really struck me. The scenes are so vivid in the book that a reader almost feels that they are there in England with Paul. I also loved how Lawrence would give the thoughts of the female characters as well as Paul. Again, I must say that the book was excellent and I look forward to reading it again soon."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"Sons and Lovers is a story of how a complicated relationship between Mother and son affect relations with the son's lover. Sons and Lovers is written with more passion that other Lawrence works, probably because Lawrence's own life so closely mirrors that of the characters in this novel.The plot revolves around Paul Morel and his family. The Father is a coal miner whose bruttish behavior makes Paul detest him. Paul's Mother, full of contempt for her husband, pours all of her love toward her children, particularly the two eldest males. As Paul matures his attempts at a relationship with a lover are hindered by these complications. Paul, like his older brother William, finds that his choice of lover can never be accepted by his Mother."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"'Sons And Lovers' is perhaps the most touching classic by D H Lawrence. The story revolves around the Morel family, a lower-middle class family living on the Nottingham coalfield. Initially, Lawrence vividly describes the hardships faced by Mrs. Morel in raising a family of three sons and a daughter while living from hand to mouth, in face of the frequent beatings delivered by an oft-drunk miner husband. For the larger part, he examines in detail the passionate relationship between Mrs. Morel and her second son, Paul. Disillusioned from her drunkard and temperamental husband and devastated by the death of her elder son, Mrs. Morel has high expectations from her second son, Paul. At the same time, Paul is torn between his duty towards his beloved mother, and his passion for the two other women in his life, Clara and Miriam. It is widely believed that through this novel, Lawrence has addressed the dynamics of his own complicated relationship with his mother, and has depicted the dilemma that faced him. D H Lawrence has masterfully handled the fragile subject of intimate relationships between loved ones. In my view, it is a definite must-read. Also recommended: Waiting by Ha Jin, The Losers' Club by Richard Perez"},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"We have, before us, a delicate subject; the male desire to obsessively love his mother coupled with intense hatred of his father. D.H. Lawrence admitted to being troubled by such feelings and expressed them in his third novel, \\"Sons and Lovers.\\" Critics have named it to the top 100 best books of all time. First published in 1913 and originally carrying the title \\"Paul Morel,\\" Lawrence wrote about a dysfunction that Sigmund Freud explored about the same time that became known as the Oedipus complex, so named for the Greek legend of King Oedipus. There's much more to it, of course, but basically \\"Sons and Lovers\\" is a sanitized version of Freud's later lengthy discourse.There's no doubt that Lawrence suffered from such feelings, and his rambling autobiographical novel takes the reader into the deep feelings and troubled musings of Paul Morel, Morel's relationships with his mother and two lovers, hatred for his father, and the subsequent unhappy entry into a lonely life. The feelings are intense, the cogitation never ending, and the entire story is circuitous and based on decisions that sometimes seem poorly implemented.There is no question that Lawrence embodies the classical writer with exceptional language skills and a talent for the portrayal of realistic scenes. One should read this novel, if for nothing else, to revel in the descriptions of the beautiful countryside, the inclement weather, and the community found in rural England's coal country. The passages describing the flora and fauna are mesmerizing in their detail and his descriptions of family life conjure up the simplicity of cooking, eating, and socializing that characterized subsistence during this time in history.The plot is easy to follow but difficult to relate to. A young man is torn between the obsessive love of his mother, the platonic friendship with a neighboring farm girl, and a passionate physical affair with a married woman, all the while harboring extreme hatred for his father. Lawrence captures that simple idea through a multitude of mind-numbing explorations of unfulfilled love, so much so that I found myself becoming impatient with the indecision and shouting, \\"Get on with it.\\"I recommend this book for those with the patience to wade through intense personal relationships, the ability to interpret thick symbolism, and the patience to unravel convoluted streams of consciousness.

Though this book is not considerably too long, I must admit that it took me a lot longer than usual to finish compared to works by other authors. The writing is not difficult to understand, and there are some excellent prose throughout, but the book just seemed to drag at certain points. Even if you haven't read this book, you probably know that this story is primarily about a mind-controlling mother, Mrs Morel, who ruins her 2nd son, Paul, by forcing him to devote all of his love and attention to her. What results with Paul are heartbreaking relationships with two women and a stifled career as an artist. The breadwinner of the Morel family, though not the head of the family by any means is Mr. Morel, simply referred to as Morel throughout the novel. Morel is an illiterate miner who spends whatever extra money he has on booze. Morel is also cruel and abusive, being despised by all the family members. As the novel progresses we see him age, become softer, but really never forgiven by the family. I found myself actually liking and pitying Morel the most by the end of the novel.

Immediately Lawrence sets the mood: \\" ... for three months she was perfectly happy; for six months she was very happy.\\" Soon Walter's drinking takes over their relationship and he begins beating Gertrude, one cold night locking her out of their house. Babies come as a matter of course, and their third child Paul becomes the novel's protagonist, not a gifted writer, like the author himself, but a painter who can hope to support himself with his art. Paul is depicted as having a very strong sex urge, an attribute not frankly discussed in English literature of the previous generation. Even Thomas Hardy (and I detect a very strong influence here) could not depict sexual situations in narratives like \\"Jude the Obscure\\" as Lawrence does in his novels. (In fact, an unexpurgated version of Lawrence's 1928 \\"Lady Chatterley's Lover\\" was not approved until a generation after its original publication, thirty years after the novelist's death.) Paul's intense relationship with his mother has provided critics with all sorts of theories, the most common being that it skirts incest. True, they are very close when Paul is a child and, like his mother, Paul learns to despise his father. He lavishes affection on Gertrude, invents little pet names for her and even admits in one chapter that he won't marry as long as she is alive. But I don't think it's so much attraction on his part as affinity. They both distrust the same people, such as animalistic Walter and tenacious Miriam, the girl Paul comes close to marrying, much to his mother's horror. (Paul also seems to have inherited his mother's basic selfishness along with her devotion, so that his motives in Chapter XIV are apt to raise ambivalent feelings in the reader.) Gertrude is more ready to accept the coolly elegant Clara, probably because Clara is already unhappily separated from her husband Baxter, a man his wife finds difficult but still desirable. Paul's tense relations with these three women form the plot of \\"Sons and Lovers\\" and keep the reader deeply involved in its development. Granted the prose sometimes shades off into purple (\\"The hot blood came up wave upon wave\\"), for the most part the tone is well-controlled. To read this direct book is to understand why Lawrence became one of the most controversial authors of his time."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"Sons and Lovers was good read - format was not great but ok - love the charecter descriptions - very well written"},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"Great story line but almost too descriptive when it comes to countryside.

Predicted the outcome."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"Though the title is obvious, the lesson is less so. I read and enjoyed this book, absent senses of change -- Lawrence for me is either the end of Edwardianism or the beginning of Modernism. I have to tell the truth when I say that I am not sure.What I am sure of is Lawrence's pathetic appeal. When I finished this book, the part of me that mattered was the son, and less so the lover.

Lawrence's &quot;Sons and Lovers&quot; should have been titled &quot;Mother and Sons&quot;, since it is an unflinching, at times harsh, look at a mother's relationship with her two sons, especially with the younger son, Paul Morel, who suffers from an Oedipus complex with his mother. Mrs. Morel is portrayed by Lawrence as someone who tries to steer the lives of her sons, especially Paul, intervening in his choice of lovers and careers. Although her motives may be noble, her actions have unforseen consequences which affect adversely Paul's life. Lawrence's novel is said to be semiautobiographical, since the Morels are seen as fictitious counterparts of his own family. It surely is a literary classic, since it was the first to look at a dysfunctional family's affairs prior to the advent of Freud's psychological writings. It also remains memorable due to Lawrence's splendid, often lyrical, prose."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"I hated most of the characters, but I still loved this novel. It kept me interested the whole three days it took to read. Definitely read this book!"},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"Sons and Lovers tells the story of the Morels, which are the counterpart of the authors own family. It is in this book where D.H. Lawrence explores probably for the first time the circumstances and conditions of his youth in order to set himself free of the shadows of the past. The dominant, omnipresent influence of his mother a tie so strong he is hardly able to bear her death. So strong he almost chooses to follow her into the immense night which engulfed her. And if he walked and walked for ever, there was only that place to come to the place where his dead mother was awaiting him. Yet in the end, facing the seduction of death, he turns around and walks towards the light the faintly humming, glowing town thus deciding to continue the path of his life, alone but free. The story of a mother with an unfulfilled life and a marriage that was failure, too. A mother that substitutes her own life by the lives of her sons, making their success her victory. The victory that will make her triumph over the share of life she didnt get. Mrs Morel takes possession her sons of the lives, especially of Pauls (the counterpart of D.H. Lawrence). And by doing so she casts a shadow on all of Pauls actions, thoughts, and experiences. Everything he will do he will do it, in the end for his mother. This pressure, this shadow makes it impossible for him to see the light which would lead him along the path of his life and therefore his youth becomes a struggle, a fight against himself. He falls in love, but eventually he isnt able to love. The mother, sitting at home, jealous, is his conscience and she wouldnt allow anybody to come close to him. And so we see Paul grow up, a person bursting of life yet unable to live. With passion he falls in love, the passion though turns into pain. Pain, the keyword of the book, penetrates every chapter. A sensitive soul, deeply connected with nature, caught in torture. He felt as if his blood was melting into tears or his vision of a sunset: Gold flamed to scarlet, like pain in its intense brightness make us feel how the world of Paul utterly dissolves into torment and struggle. A book that is the vision of pain, not without any happiness, but always a happiness based on pain. This vision comes to us so real, so profound and sincere that the book seems to me an approach on life itself."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"THE BOOK WAS A SCHOOL BOOK WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE. BUT I MOST ENJOYED IT WHEN I READ AGAIN AFTER SEVEN YEARS. D.H.LAWRANCE IS A FOVORITE FOR ME ALLWAYS. I LEARNED MUCH OF ENGLISH FOR THE SAKE OF READING NOVELS WHICH WERE NEVER TRANSLATED TO TURKISH. D.H.LAWRENCE ALLWAYS EXPRESSES THE EVENTS BY THE EYE OF A MALE. YOU CAN NOTICE THE MANLY OPINIONS AT EVERY LINE AND BEHIND THE LINES. SOME WRITERS TRY TO TELL THE STORY BY THE EYE OF THE OTHER SEX AND THIS GIVES THE TASTE OF LIE TO THE STORY. SO REAL AND SWEET NOVEL. REALITY WAS NEVER SO SWEETLY EXPRESSED LIKE THIS BEFORE D.H.LAWRENCE.(SORRY FOR THE ERRORS IF THERE ARE, BECAUSE ENGLISH IS NOT MY MOTHER LANGUAGE.)"},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"This novel wins the unique distinction of being the smelliest novel i have ever read. I don't mean that in a bad way, it's just that throughout the story the reader's nose is besieged with myriad scents of flowers, flowers that are counterbalanced by the pungent scents of grimy coal miners. This is one of the beauties of this novel.However I am not a Lawrence fan and think this by far his best work. The reason it is his best is because he keeps his utterly irrelavant philosopies out of the story; he doesn't wine and lament about the &quot;plight&quot; of &quot;modern man&quot;. He does however do this in the following novel, the Rainbow, which is a complete disaster. Don't trust anyone who compares Lawrence to Henry Miller; unlike Miller Lawrence actually is capable of writing well."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"D.H Lawrence has obviously, with this book, created some kind of magical formula: rambling, wittering prose with no real direction can suddenly be accepted as an important novel. Why is this book taught in schools? It's style favours that of the long-winded, ill-thought-out mood-building, yet where Lawrence fails is in his descriptions of the characters within the book. They actually have very little depth. It has been said that this book is autobiographical. This suggests to me that Lawrence knows his characters so well, he expects the reader to simply know the characters, beyond the description of them as &quot;happy&quot; or &quot;sad&quot;.It occurs to me that Lawrence simply spewed his thoughts out on to the page when writing this book, and what dull thoughts they were."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"I offered this book at my form 6.Now as a reader and a teacher of sons and lovers, I have discovered where its novelity lies.It is not an exciting book yet it is full of realism and the reality of its themes is what propelles one to read every single page of it.There is however a likely misconcept to develop in the reader, towards Walter Morel's character.He is painted as brutal but if we ask ourselves why a sensous,jolly man Getrude meets at a christmas party grows into a violet husband he is only after a year of marriage,We will honestly attribute his infamous character to his wife.The treatment he suffers at the hands of his own sons is not also encouraging."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"I bought this book because my brother was reading it and kept saying how interesting it was. The story is about a woman who marries someone below her class and then invests everything in her children. The story focuses on her relationship with her son Paul. The story follows the life of Paul from birth through early adulthood. His tightly knit relationship with his mother seems to have a negative impact on his love life. How does it all end?! You'll have to read it to find out!"},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"Despite what one reviewer said, this book cannot have been written from Paul's POV as he talks about people and circumstances that occurred before he was born, and about peoples' inner thoughts of which he could have no knowledge. As I read this 3rd person omniscient novel. I kept thinking \\"Oh, hell, get on with it!\\" Having read Lady Chatterly's Lover, I knew this tome was going to be a slog-fest, and I was right. On the other hand, in 1913, the reading public had lots of time and no TV soap operas, so I suppose they didn't mind tedious passages. For example, Lawrence labors over mom's and Paul's love of flowers (she's thrilled to find blue flowers in winter) and I wanted to scream, \\"Okay, I get it, flowers symbolize fecundity and beauty, and mom and son(s) have a relationship bordering on incestuous, only without the sex. Now what?\\" I started skipping whole passages and lost nothing of the chain of events. Dad is always a no-goodnik, and mom is always a prim saint. It's an okay story, but what was the point again? Oh, yeah, life is nasty, brutish and short. And quite a bore for poor, downtrodden Mom. I guess Lawrence's desire to be on the cutting edge with his self-proclaimed masterpieve didn't include an obvious alternate conclusion: the book could have been titled, Gay Sons and Lovers.That it was written in 1913, when people were still shocked by tasetlessness and for the most part unaware of Freudian psychology, I'm sure it was steamy for its day. But this story could have been written as a twenty page short story and should have been."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"Wow...I don't remember the last time that I've read a novel that would bring out in me such immense sensitivity as this one. With incredible detail Lawrence describes his life and ihs biggest loves. Perhaps I should not be writing this review because I only read 200 pages so far, but it is just too breathtaking."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"A tour de force! Bravo. It is story of Paul Morel who loves his mother more than himself. Mrs. Morel who is married to a ignorant, illiterate coal miner tries to find comfort, solace and love in her sons, first with Walter and when Walter dies unexpectedly, with Paul, the second son. She lives for him, he for her. She is so possessive of him that she objects his involvement with his first love, Miriam. He then goes after, Clara, a married woman. The book revolves around Paul and these three desperate women, who comfort him, torture him andhe scornfully resiprocates. But he is always faithful to his mother , who he adores. I guess we are all like Paul, in someways. Miriam is a haunting character who reverberates in the entire book, so innocent, pure, religious, pious and madly in love with Paul. Clara, on the other hand, very rigid, calculating, demanding and yet very vulnerable. In Paul we see callousness, sacrifice, piety, haughtiness, repentance, a bit of Roskolnikov, a young man whose life is torn between a adoring mother and two lovers. In the end his high spirits and intellegence prevail and he conquers his demons."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"This is a perfect book for anyone who enjoys reading twentieth century British literature. I like the fact that D. H. Lawrence is able to realistically portray the emotions of the many characters in the book. I did not only learn Paul's side of the story, but I also gained insight into Gertrude's, Miriam's, and Clara's thoughts and feelings towards Paul and towards each other. This omniscient narration makes the story a more interesting study into human emotions. Lawrence deals very heavily with psychological motivations for each character's actions, making the characters more human and believable. This is a great story that goes far beneath the surface. Sons and Lovers is a thought-provoking tale of love, death, possession, vulnerability, and heartache. I would recomend it to anyone looking for a good book to read."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"This is not the drum I march to. But it was one of my teacher Ms Worby's favorites. And I can see why. Lawrence does present us with graphic images, dramatic confrontations, an oedipal complex, and a love triangle. The disputes between Clara and Miriam are especially memorable. Clara's vain attitude contrasts sharply with Miriam's genuine love for the protagonist Paul. In all honesty this book is never boring. The reason I could not get overly attached to this is I feel Lawrence lacks the charm that Dickens always throws into his novels. I have respect for this book, and I understand its significance in the world of literature. But I don't feel D.H. Lawrence is another Charles Dickens."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"The plot of the story is simple but the narration is very impressive. Life of the main character ,Paul Morel, will be revolving around his mother. Paul will fail to replace his mother by any other woman. When his mother dies, Paul will lose focus and his life becomes chaotic. But it is not a tragedy and story ends with positive note.Following is my favourite part in the novel. Morel is a drunkard and his wife and kids do not like him. I liked the portrayal of change in environment of Morel's house when Morel is in the house and out of the house. The Miriam's character is very consistent.Finally, if you are used to reading classics, this is a must read."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"I never thought a book could be so enjoyable, but yet I found it confusing to muddle through the ideas that D. H. Lawrence presents and also the places that he talks about. The end of the book is really confusing because I found myself trying to figure out what had just happened at the end. But, overall I thought it was a wonderful read, especially if its a library book and you have to return it soon!"},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"It's been along time since I've read a book that was so pleasant and touching. The story is simple,yet, so full of depth. It's truly beautiful, and I'm sorry others aren't able to see this."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"To those who've criticized the novel, saying that Gertrude Morel was far to harsh on her husband, have obviously never lived in the type of family situation Lawrence depicted so well. Morel's obvious internal struggle with herself and her family were beautifully portrayed. Lawrence delved into the psyche of both individuals astonishingly well...causing me to see the truth in my own family. Great books are meant to inspire thought, and Sons and Lovers does just that."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"--Oh! Pardon me for that rather undignified opening. Although (yawn) when I get to reflecting back on this book it seems somehow an appropriate response. It is a book about selfish and spoiled people, about elitists imagining their ideas as somehow relevent to the larger world around them and about how a little bit of education can lead to a great deal of contempt for the society in which someone is raised.Now, of course, these are valid and even potentially interesting points, but the method Lawrence chose to tell this, what I gather is a deeply personal story, is basically condescention and self-absorbsion. After about 100 pages I started dreading what was to come, which was basically more of the same alongside some predictable, tacked on melodramatic tragedy.The complication comes from Lawrence's genuine ability as a writer. There are lines--sometimes, albiet rarely, pages of pure beauty. These words came from a powerful and passionate writer who was too personally involved with the story he was telling to make it universial. I can appreciate the venting, the often conflicted outrage of the elitist scholar and budding psychoanalyist that Lawrence was later to become, but if this is a modelled story of the man's life it will ultimately take away some of the respect my reading of The Rainbow, Women in Love and a handful of his short stories had previously inspired. I can forgive the late, great author for this childish and selfish book, a mama's boy trying as hard as he can to show off how clever people have always told him he was, but I have trouble comprehending the innumerable critics and casual readers alike who boast and gloat over this story as if the triumph of personal arrogance related within somehow validated their own wavering sense of intellectual accomplishment.Two and a half stars rounded up because of some pretty writing and the apparent lasting relevence of this mostly frivilous work--"},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"DH Lawrence was born in Nottingham, England in 1885. He died at age 44 in Vence, France in 1930. In between those birth and death dates he created great fiction. His first big book and, probably, still his greatest is \\"Sons and Lovers.\\"The novel is highly autobiographical. Walter Morel is a crude, hard drinking miner who has no intellectual interests. He weds the etheral and lovely Gertrude. The couple have four children: William, Annie, Paul and Arthur. William, the eldest, is a good boy engaged to a flighty woman. He dies at an early age. The other children, with the noted exception of Paul, live mundane lives.Paul is the Lawrence figure in the book. He is a momma's boy tied to her tight apron strings. Paul loves books, learning and the beauties of flowering nature. He has long affairs with the beautiful but shy Miriam who lives on a nearby farm and Clara Dawes (resembling Lawrence's wife Frieda Weekly). He marries neither woman leaving his boyhood home for adventures elsewhere. As the novel ends, Paul will continue his artistic work and his spiritual questing.There is little action in this novel. It is, instead, a pyschological probing of such human affairs as familial and erotic love, death, suffering and the process of saying goodbye to childhood. It is a deeply moving book. One cannot refrain from crying at the death of Paul's saintly mother.\\"Sons and Lovers\\" was written before Lawrence was scorned by critics and damaged by life. It is an excellent book which everyone should read if they are interested in life within a family. This book is rich with descriptions of nature and is a joy to read. Excellent!"},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"I know this review is going to sound markedly unintelligent, but I really can't help it in this case. I'm going to say what I need to say about this book, whether it makes a helpful review or not.Let me get one thing straight first: Sons and Lovers does not flow in the way Lawrence's other works flow. Each scene does not seem to bind itself to the next to make a perfect, seamless whole. The book does lag at times, in fact. It is beautifully written but not 'perfectly' written like Lawrence's other works. I am not rating this book on its composition, though. I'm rating it for something else.I'm wondering if anyone else felt the same way I felt when I read this novel. I have never before had to lay down a book in mid-paragraph and put my head in my hands for sheer emotional inability to read any further that day. I've read authors whose works hold up a mirror to an entire society, to a clique, to a cult, or a nation, but NEVER have I seen an author hold up a mirror to common individuals like myself. Quite honestly, I have never felt so horrible and so sickened with MYSELF simply because I read a book.What IS it about this story that makes me feel this way? I can only say that Lawrence must have been an expert at inner self-examination and observance of society. When I say society, I don't mean of 'the English,' or 'the Americans' or 'the-anything.' I mean of 'people.' There must be aspects of all human beings that will never change through time, age, gender, and economic status, because Lawrence captures each and every little thought, feeling, and nuance of human emotion and throws it as us in this book. The effect is a screaming recognition of yourself (at least, of myself.) 'Oh my God, that IS me!' I sympathize with Miriam, I sympathize with Paul, with Lily, with William, with Gertrude, and, God help me, with Walter Morel. I see myself in them.Lawrence may want us to feel negatively toward Miriam at times, but those are the times when I most identify with her. She may be a 'soul sucker,' but I know that I am, too. Mrs. Morel hates Miriam for this overbearing quality, but there's the clincher:I, too, hate the people who try to suck the souls of the people whose 'souls' I want.In less ridiculous language, Lawrence uses the relationship between Miriam and Paul to lay the inevitable facts about human jealousy and possessiveness in front of our eyes. We all have thoughts, desires, and jealousies so 'embarrassing' or so shameful that we won't even voice them in our mind's ear. These are the thoughts that will make us weak or despicable if we acknowledge or accept them. Lawrence makes these hidden thoughts and feelings a part of his writing style. When he describes his characters, you'd better BELIEVE he describes them. He leaves nothing out. They are weak, stupid, good, beautiful, and hopeless. I hate to seeing myself in his characters just as much as I hate being like them.Nearly all of Lawrence's works are like this, it is true, but this was the first of them that really slapped me in the face and made me see myself (and most likely everyone else) for what I really am.It's a good book. Very powerful, sad, embarrassing, and dangerous. Everyone should read it."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"Because this book deals with the timeless feelings of love, obsession, and vulnerablity, it doesn't feel outdated, even though it's set in a time period much different from the current one. Especially interesting is Paul's relationship with Miriam, and how he becomes angry that she is trying to consume his soul--but at the same time, he says that he is looking for a woman who can belong to him. It seems like a double standard, but Paul is so obviously dysfuctional that as a reader, I could easily excuse it. DH Lawrence did a great job of making the content of the book flow well. When I got to the end, I could just feel that he was going to have to work Miriam back into the story somehow--and sure enough he did. And I think that as a reader, when I am able to anticipate what the writer has left to say, that is really a great statement about the ability of the writer to bring his readers to the same line of thought about the characters and the plot that he has. And something that I especially enjoyed about this book is that it is almost entirely dialogue, and it doesn't spend pages describing the scenery and such. So if that's something you like too, then you will probably enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"Sons &amp; Lovers is by far one of the most insightful books I have read, following the story of a working-class family in early 19th century Nottinghamshire. It focuses on the second son of the aptly named Morel family, and his life and relationships within it. It is largely written from a psychological point of view, but it's lengthy description can drag on. An excellent book following the relationship between mother and son, the over-shadowing power of maternal influence, and although the chapters are hard work, the effect is strong and this book is definately a good read.It may be stuck in its time of writing, but a brilliant reflection of pre-World War One lower class life. An excellent read."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"D.H. Lawrence was a guy that came out of the womb knowing how to write. You read his prose and his innate genius quickly becomes self-evident--this is an artist for whom the creative act of literature is akin to a Mozart symphony--airtight, beautiful, logical, NATURAL. Floooooowing.Compare Lawrence with someone like Wallace Stegner--the latter being a writer with a fair amount of talent and a heckuva lot of dedication...but whose works seem...synthetic. Over-written, almost. As if he would look at a sentence and say, \\"This needs another adjective here--and a polysyllabic synonym for this word here.\\"With Lawrence, there is no sense of writerly straaaaaaining for profundity...no sense of sweaty self-consciousness. The sentences seemingly emanate from the ether, with a fundamental soundness and beauty which only a tiny, tiny few lucky people are capable of creating.Stegner could study the craft of writing for thirty years and still produce an inferior book to the twenty-seven-year-old Lawrence's Sons and Lovers. Lawrence had IT. He was the real deal. The genuine article. He WAS Mozart (Stegner was you-know-who).Sons and Lovers is a masterpiece. Not without its flaws, surely, but a masterpiece all the same. Some parts drag; some parts are choppy; some parts are frankly uninteresting. Notwithstanding that, it is just a single rung below Lolita and Under the Volcano in terms of quality.The MLA concluded that Sons and Lovers is the ninth best novel of the 20th century--and it's hard to quibble with that assessment. (Even though it is ranked AHEAD of the supernally brilliant--and better--Under the Volcano.)If you are a serious connoisseur of literature, this is one you have to get under the belt."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"SONS AND LOVERS was first published in 1913. It's the story of Paul Morel, a gifted artist. Paul is one of four children born to Walter and Gertrude Morel. The others are Edward, the oldest, Annie, and Arthur the baby.Walter Morel, a miner by trade was most attracted to Gertrude Coppard because she was a lady. Gertrude in turn thought that Walter was quite handsome and would be a good provider; however, over the years the couple become estranged from each other over Walter's drinking and brutish behavior. In their many arguments, Gertrude insisted on telling her husband off and usually won the verbal disputes, but was often physically abused. The four children all seemed to adore their mother and saw that her life was hard. They rallied around her as much as possible. They feared their father and keep their distance from him.The boys, Edward and Paul were the most protective of their mother. Edward, the elder son, was very bright and acquired an excellent position in London. He initially sent money home, but when he became involved with a woman, he spent every cent on her in trying to win her love. The woman was really undeserving of Edward's love and things went from bad to worse.Paul also tried to look out for his mother as much as possible. He found Miriam, a girl to love, but put off a proposal and marriage for years. He knew his mother did not care for the young woman and at first tried to overlook his mother's dislike of his girlfriend, but was not able to cope with the situation. His second relationship was with Clara, a married woman, but again, Paul could not completely give of himself.I really liked the way that Lawrence drew his literary portrait of what life was like for the family of a miner. It was interesting to observe the dynamics of the children and how they related to each parent. The home life was detailed as were their amusements and community life.Initially, I was not sure that I would like this book, but with each page that I read, I became more and more involved in the story. It was an excellent read and shows how manipulative a mother can be in controlling her children. The psychological hold that she had on her sons was something that they were not able to break. It also shows how influenced we can be by the interaction between our own parents."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"The main character in his many bouts with love, combatted by his intense lust for individualism and desire to be a world unto himself, could not overcome himself and therefore, with a conquistador's view of love, failed miserably at love's aquisition. He could not however create himself as an all emcompassing world, he search for satisfaction, and his realization that he could only love himself consequently chained him to himself.This book made me think more than most, but neglected to make me feel. Dostoevski is a poor writer, but suceeds in making one 'feel' rather intensely, like Hemmingway said. However, Lawrence, though a bit tedious and repetitive at times, makes you almost one with the character in their intellectual battle with themself, but not in their battle with emotions. I felt detached from Paul's emotions. I felt detached from his mother's, even though she was her emotions. Lawrence writes a great deal better than most of his contemporaries, and its a wretched pity that he still could not synthesize thought and emotion like only a few have done."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"Has any literary reputation (maybe Hemingway's) fallen like Lawrence's has? In my parents old set of encyclopedias, c. 1950, his entry was a paragraph long. In the 1970 Ency. Brtit. it was pages long. He was suddenly on par with Joyce... When I went through school I caught the very tail end of this mass admiration for Lawrence. It was a strange admiration too, mostly male critics gone overboard, calling such juvenile drivel as Lady Chatterly great literature and whatnot. I read practically all of Lawrences works, no mean feat, because the man wrote like a banshee. I also read the bios and the Letters... And I've come to the conclusion that Lawrence wrote one beautiful novel and that's it: Sons and Lovers. That Lawrence later disliked the novel is interesting because it evidently ran afoul of his ludicrous philosphy of life (and that so many intelligent British men at that time were taken with such nonsense is a bit disturbing and quite funny; I can't think of any woman infatuated with with his loopy ideas). This novel is written in beautiful prose and it evokes an England that no longer exists; nothing else that Lawrence attempted comes close to the beauty in this novel... Some of his earlier, short stories and novellas do, but they are few and far between.T.S. Eliot once said that Henry James had a mind so fine that no idea could violate it. Lawrence is an example of the absolute opposite: of a writer getting so carried away with his ideas that the art starts to suffer. He's like Tolstoy (but on a vastly smaller scale) in that he had to propagandize his ideas at every little turn... But Sons and Lovers is definitely worth the reputation that it has had all along."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"I have long been interested in the work of D. H. Lawrence. His reputation as one of the greatest novelists of the past one hundred years, as well as the censorship battles at the turn of the last century which led to some of his works being banned in England until the 1960's were all reasons which led me, finally, to read him. I started with Sons and Lovers, which was originally published in 1913.Sons and Lovers takes place in Nottingham near the coalfields. Paul Morel is one of three \\"sons\\" in the story and Miriam, Mrs. Clara Dawes as well as Paul's mother, Mrs. Gertrude Morel are all the \\"lovers\\". Mrs. Morel is married to a husband who pays her no attention, and who would rather go out all night drinking. She is thus devoted to her two oldest boys, William and Paul, and from an early age they are coddled to excess. They develop into mama's boys who cannot make any decision without thinking of the effect it would have on their mother. When William dies after a brief illness, Mrs. Morel becomes almost frightfully attached to Paul, and their exchanges seem incestuous with the terms of endearment they use. Paul's feelings towards his mother seem nothing less than Oedipean. The tender words exchanged between mother and son are far more passionate than the dialogue between either of Paul's lovers, Miriam or Clara. Since I had not read about the plot of Sons and Lovers before I started the novel, I did not know if mother and son would develop a sexual relationship. It certainly seemed plausible by their dialogue. Since Paul confesses to his mother, as well as to his two lovers, that he can never marry them (and they soon figure out why) it is not far-fetched to imagine that possibility.There is much passion in the story and the sex that takes place is subdued and not even written about in euphemism. Quite abruptly the younger characters turn on their lovers and Sons and Lovers suffers, in my opinion, from an overabundance of phrases such as \\"She hated him for it\\" or other such phrases using \\"detest\\" in its place. One minuscule fly in the ointment of sweet caresses might turn Miriam instantly against Paul with a phrase such as that. It grew tiresome to read that once again Paul \\"hates\\" Clara or that Miriam suddenly \\"detested\\" Paul.Clara Dawes is separated from her husband Baxter yet both see other people on the side. One hundred years ago it might have seemed scandalous for a British woman who was still legally married to be seen in public courting other gentlemen. Clara's mother, Mrs. Radford, was my favourite minor character in that she spoke like someone who has seen everything and wasn't afraid to call a spade a spade. She spoke her mind and provided comic relief. She was also likely a target for the censors of one hundred years ago for her degree of openness.I enjoyed Sons and Lovers for its descriptions of working-class England at the start of the 1900's. Lawrence writes some characters' dialogue in Nottingham dialect which fortunately was not difficult to decipher, despite the abundance of apostrophes and briticisms. Lawrence finds new ways to describe the countryside and flowers, coaly skies and hazy mornings. It was a delight to read his inventive descriptions for such dismal and dreary images. I plan to read more of Lawrence this year and thoroughly enjoyed Sons and Lovers."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"The man is an absolute master at relationships. I have not read any other writer that has his patience and skill at building complex, realistic relationships through the accumulation of minute detail. While the characters and plot are only adequate, the relationships between the characters, and the poetic prose, drove the novel and managed to keep me engaged the whole way through. I was surprised that this novel, at least, showed no indication of the smuttiness of which Lawrence has often been accused. Overall, a good introduction to a literary author who will get another look later."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"I read this book for my English class and I found it to be ultimately unsatifying. I think Lawrence's prose is incredible but I just could not empathize with Paul Morel - he''s so childish and weak. Paul is only charming during his love scenes with Clara when he affects the Welsh accent of Walter Morel. I thought Gertrude Morel was a despicable woman who treated her husband with undeserved contempt and emotionally suffocated her sons. In the book, Gertrude's death leaves Paul in a world of darkness, he's a broken man. However, it's interesting to note that as much as D.H.Lawrence (the book is semi-autobiographical) came to view his mother as a negative influence in his mature years. As an adult, it is D.H. Lawrence's father who is personified as Walter Morel, for whom he exhibited admiration."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"I enjoy reading the works of D.H. Lawrence. I believe no other author of his time explored the complexities of human sexuality, behavior, intimacy, and depth as poignantly as him. By far I loved Lady Chatterley's Lover, his most famous and controversial novel. SONS AND LOVERS is the second Lawrence book I've read. I can't really say if I truly liked the book or not. I believe that what this book explores is deeply interesting and even haunting, seeing how controlling and possessive a mother could be on her sons, and how deeply attached sons could be towards their mother. It was also interesting seeing the complexities of the characters grow and develop with each chapter. I can definitely see why SONS AND LOVERS is considered a classic. The only flaw i found with this novel was how annoying Paul Morel is. I just found his behavior to be pathetic and ridiculous. But other than that, this is a great read, but not necessarily Lawrence's BEST work."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"This book renewed my belief in the power of love. D.H. Lawrence seems very romantic, yet tragic at the same time. This was very pleasurable reading. &quot;Sons and Lovers&quot; and &quot;War and Peace&quot; by Leo Tolstoy are my two biggest recommendations for anyone who enjoys classic fiction. I purchased the &quot;Modern Library 100 Best Novels&quot; version of this book, which conveniently lists the rest of Modern Library's 100 Best Novels on the front cover."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"This book is so obviously brilliant, soulful, real, intense and true. If you had to read it for some assignment in school and didn't like it, maybe you should keep your thoughts to yourself instead of disputing it. As Bob Dylan said, &quot;don't criticize what you can't understand&quot;. Sure, everybody has a right to their opinion. But being assigned a book means you have no choice, and therefore are maybe predisposed to not like it. Paul's agonies over Clara and Miriam could be happening to any guy, today. Lawrence cuts right to the bone of relationships, and anyone wanting to understand that immeasurable gulf between men and women would do well to read this book, not because I or anyone else tells you to, but because it's true and real."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"There are several subplots, but the main one the story ends up gravitating around is that when Mrs. Morel becomes pregnant with her son Paul, her marriage has pretty much dissolved thanks to her husband's alcoholic and abusive nature. She seems to have antenatal and postpartum depression; as a result, her infant becomes sensitized to her moods.He grows up and is too attached to her, and her to him. He cannot make heads or tails of his own emotions in relationships, partly because he over intellectualizes everything, and partly because he cannot see how his mother's hold on him is suffocating his ability to grow as an independent person. Worse, he emulates his father's disdainful attitude towards women, rendering him often a less-than-likeable character.His mom, in a matyristic fashion, begins to die of an ailment she never revealed to her main physician. He thus becomes mired in the process of helping and watching her die. He and his mother have a few moments that are more than just enmeshed (incestual in tone); his father seems to pick up on the inappropriateness of the relationship, but given his own alienation from the family can do very little in the way of anything, other than get out of the way.There are moments of poetry, but the constant exposition of internal struggles in philosophical and psychological terms tends to get a bit tiring, and thus diminishes the dramatic tension. It would be a good book for students just getting the hang of applying psychological theory to literature (the Oedipus complex particularly), but it is overdramatic in characterization, overlong, and rather depressing in its misogyny and hopelessness. Three stars from this reviewer."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"This was the first book that I have read of D.H. Lawrence. At times it was a little difficult to follow the old language, but after a few pages I was in sync. The characters came alive with Lawrence's descriptions.I will definitely read more Lawrence."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"paul's character became too complex and annoying, a drama king whose personality concerning his mother ,(mommy's boy), frustrated me alot"},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"Sons and Lovers is the first novel of D. H. Lawrence's that I have ever read and now, after I've finished it, many things begin to make more sense than before.The book is divided in two parts: part one includes six chapters and part two includes nine chapters.In the first part we meet the Morels and the narration revolves around Gertrude Morel. She lives a harsh and unsatisfayingy life because of her husband Walter, who gets drunk and abuses her and their children.In the second part, the main character is Paul, the third child of the family and probably the one who would have had potential to become a remarkable protagonist, due to his capacity to work hard and due to his creativity.However, Lawrence shows us an extreme case of Oedipus complex. Since Paul was a baby, Mrs. Morel treated him in a special way that had led in time to a pretty tight bondage between them. The mother-son love pushes the normal limit of familial affection, becoming almost erotic. The interesting fact is that both of them are jealous of each other's relationships: Paul hates his father - almost wanting to murder him - and Mrs. Morel hates Miriam and Clara, inoculating the idea that her son hadn't found the right woman, whom he ought to marry.As well as Gertrude's marriage with Walter, Paul fails in both his relationships, after swinging for several times (annoyingly for the reader) between Miriam and Clara. In truth, he doesn't want to marry neither of them, because he secretly loves his mother more than the two.The narration is a bit slow because of the descriptions and the characters' thoughts towards the others.Paul Morel is not a protagonist that I might like, because he is very confused, his thoughts are often contradictory and he doesn't know what he really wants from life. His love for his mother has devastating consequences for both of them in the end.I think that Lawrence exaggerates when he pictures Paul as a spiritually and mentally mutilated man. If the protagonist had had a strong personality, he would have avoided the deplorable situation in which the reader finds him in the last pages of the novel."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"This is my favorite d h lawrence novel a little rambling at parts but I still love this book and have read it many times"},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"Reading this book makes me want to have sex with my mother. The son is in love with his lonely mother. He wants her but he can't have her due to morality issue. What a torture! Avoid it if the idea of mother-son incest turns you off. If incest turns you on, watch the porn movies, Taboo and its sequels, is more satisfying."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"Sons and Lovers is D.H. Lawrence's highly autobiographical novel of the early years of a young man's life in mid-nineteenth century England. As such, the book is very intense emotionally, as Lawrence seems to convey his own strong feelings about his family into his characters. One result of this exaggerated level of emotions is a constant state of tension and unreality. A simple scene becomes a moment of high drama and the constant repetition of such scenes eventually dulls the reader to those moments of genuine crisis.The book begins with the marriage of Mr. and Mrs. Morel. Gertrude is an educated, sensitive woman who marries Walter because of his physical appearance and charming personality. She also believes, falsely as it turns out, that he does not drink and is the owner of this own house. Mr. Morel is a miner and the family lives in \\"The Bottoms,\\" a hardscrabble mining community. It soon becomes clear that he cannot cope with the responsibility of raising a family that grows to four children. In response he turns to drink and abusive language (although no real violence) toward his family, and especially toward his wife. Throughout the book Walter is portrayed, not as an evil man, but as one defeated by life. His family comes to despise him and at the same time love him, depending on his moods and behavior.William, the first child, is athletic and intelligent. He grows to manhood early in the book and leaves to go to London to seek his fortune, but comes to a tragic end. The second child, Annie, has only a modest role in the novel as benefits a book with this title. Paul, the third child, is the main character and Lawrence's alter ego. Unlike his siblings, Paul is sickly and unathletic, and he and Mrs. Morel develop a strong attachment for each other that carries throughout the book. The final child, Arthur, also plays a minor role in the plot.The book is divided into two parts; the first largely concerned with the early years of the Morel family and the second with Paul and his love affairs. As a teenager he meets Miriam, a young girl on a nearby farm. Paul develops a fondness for the whole family and he and Miriam become entangled romantically and the understanding is that they will marry some day. But neither Paul nor Miriam can make a sufficient commitment to this idea and even when Miriam finally does so Paul is incapable of a similar response. At this point an older woman, Clara Dawes, comes into Paul's life. She is married to Baxter Dawes, a brutish man from whom she is separated. Paul is attracted to her physically and they begin an adulterous relationship. But again Paul has difficulty sustaining a mature relationship and is constantly torn between his love for (and even dependence on) his mother and his wish for a mature and stable relationship with a woman.The novel is also infused with a heavy dose of religion. Miriam in particular, is described as highly religious and even derogatively referred to as a nun. The religion view that sex is something dirty is also evident.It would help, given the nature of the book, to read a biography of Lawrence before tackling this novel. Many of the characters in the novel act in dysfunctional ways and the reader wonders how much of their behavior is a reflection of Lawrence's own life experiences.It is difficult for me to rate this book much above three stars because of the depressing tone and unrealistic behaviors of the characters. One wants to say to Lawrence, \\"get some psychological help before writing about your life!\\" On the other hand it is a fascinating story written by one of the outstanding English writers of the nineteenth century. It is not his best work, but still quite good in many respects."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"I attempted to read this book twice years ago. I failed to finish each time, finding the novel laborious. Now, married and with children, I have read through this book eagerly. It is perhaps a half-lifetime of experience that has allowed me to see this story in a different light. The examination of Paul Morel's emotionally incestuous relationship with his mother and the way it cripples his love for other women is insightful. My Barnes and Nobles version of this book (I put this review under this version since it is the most popular) has a contemporaneous review (Lascelles Abercrombie, Manchester Guardian, July 2, 1913) that assesses this book much better than I can:\\"Indeed, you do not realize how astonishingly interesting the whole book is until you find yourself protesting that this thing or that bores you, and eagerly reading on in spite of your protestations...You think you are reading through an unimportant scene; and then find that it has burnt itself on your mind.\\"This book has truly burnt itself on my mind, and I am glad that I came back to it."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"While \\"Sons and Lovers\\" would not be a best seller if it was written by a current day author, it was, for its times, quite controversial and forward-leaning and should always be considered one of fiction's classics. On its published date, 1914, the world was enamored with Freud's Oedipal fixation and found itself newly-awoken to the sexual side of humanity. Before this era, sexuality was either repressed or made a separate entity away from emotional caring. D.H. Lawrence relit the 'Oedipal candle' and the mother/son controversy went on. While neither Freud nor Lawrence ever fully understood their own sexuality, let alone that of others, this piece of autobiographical fiction allowed society to continue in its personal understanding of its physical self.While I fully agree with other critics that the main thrust of this novel is the interaction of mother and son, I also feel there is much more that can be psychosocially understood from its reading. The mother, in today's terminology was a narcissist. All of her actions throughout this tale are directed back towards herself and her own happiness. She married a very handsome and well-built man because she mistakenly thought that he owned the house in which he was living and that he could provide for her in the manner in which she felt she deserved. When this proved false and her plans became futile, she turned her selfish need for personal fulfillment towards her sons. She felt that it was their duty, and not their choice, to make her happy. Throughout the novel Paul, the younger of the two, is left with this onerous and suffacating burden. In very short order he, too, changes his need structure to rely on her for his recognition and fulfillment. But, his mother being a narcissist, she can never provide this in a mature and caring manner. Instead, she does so in a self-devised and incomplete manner making Paul to always wanting more and more and never feeling complete. He, in turn, was never able to fulfill her insatiable needs of attention and personal fulfillment. Neither person took any responsibility for their own actions or their own psyche and, because of that, eventually developed a love/hate relationship with each other. This is dramatically shown in the fact that Paul, while continuing to profess his love and caring for her, actually murders his mother while she lie on her death bed.In social situations the damage that Paul suffered at the hands of his mother, were generalized into the rest of his life. His work was never fulfilling, his love/hate relationship with his mother translated into an approach/avoidance behavior with women and his ultimate goals in life continued to focus on what would make his mother happy with little or no concern for himself. Because his mother had never equated her sexual life with any type of caring or emotion, Paul, too, made a divide between sex and love and often mistakenly confused one with the other. He never allowed himself to feel both together or, for that matter, had the capability to do so. The women in Paul's life had their own irrational agendas. One sacrificed her life while waiting for Paul to eventually admit his love for her and the other lived her life based solely on her own selfish and ego driven emotions while leaving rational thought unheeded. The author, if this truly is his autobiographical sketch, certainly lived and most probably died a very lonely and disturbed life. He never made the effort nor probably never had the emotional strength to understand himself as an independent being apart from the maternal demands that were continually laid at his feet.While the subject of this book does merit 5 stars, I only gave it 4 stars because of the rambling and diffuse writing that occurs in the first half of the book. Yes, I understand that the author himself viewed life as a rambling and purposeless process but we, as readers. do not need to re-experience his self-confusion in order to fully understand it. We, too, have our own life experiences from which we can draw and do not need our hands held while we come to understand the author's internal insecurities. Nor do we need to have the various derivatives of the work 'hate' be used in nearly every paragraph in order to understand the love/hate relationship that the author had with everything around him. We, too, have a degree of intelligence that can comprehend intense negative feelings directed towards the world."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"In what is considered to be D. H. Lawrence's most autobiographical novel, Lawrence's main character, Paul Morel, is a frail, artistic boy, having more in common with his mother than with his coal miner father. His mother had had some education before she married the once-attractive Walter Morel, but he eventually succumbed to alcohol and his bleak life in the pits. When Paul's older brother, who became the mainstay of the family, left for London and later died, his mother transferred her dependence from him to Paul.Written in 1913, the novel was shocking at the time, dealing as it does with an unhealthy relationship between mother and son, leading to the son's subsequent inability to love women his own age. Having only scorn for her wayward and irresponsible husband, his mother needs Paul for emotional support. When Paul begins to develop a love for Miriam Lievers, a neighbor with whom he has been close friends since childhood, his mother becomes even more possessive. A \\"spiritual\\" girl, Paul comes to believe that even though Miriam has \\"given\\" herself to him, she does not love from an inner need, that at heart she is \\"a nun,\\" and that her passion is more dutiful than real. Since he himself is still tied to his mother, emotionally, his own ability to love fully is also compromised.His next relationship, with Clara Dawes, a married woman separated from her husband, is far more passionate, but Clara is also far more liberated than Miriam, and she demands an emotional commitment from him in return. It is not until his mother's death, however, that Paul realizes the extent to which his mother has truly controlled his heart and soul, leaving him far more bereft than is normal for loving sons.A novel which probes the inner psyche of Paul Morel, Sons and Lovers is a novel which speaks directly to the modern reader, eliciting both sympathy and empathy as Paul tries to become his own man. Lawrence's ability to tap into universal feelings and needs elevates this novel into a sensitive study of love in all its forms, not just in the case of Paul Morel, but on a deeper, grander scale. Though the novel is almost a hundred years old, it is as fresh and rewarding to read today as a contemporary novel, even when one considers the mores and prohibitions of that time period. Lawrence, ahead of his time, has created one of the enduring classics of English literature, one which supersedes time and place. n Mary WhippleWomen in Love: Cambridge Lawrence EditionLady Chatterley's Lover (Bantam Classics)The Widowing of Mrs. Holroyd (Broadway Theatre Archive)"},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"i approached this book reluctantly as i felt that it was far to detached from my current surroundings to have a note of relevance. I was pleasantly shocked and rewarded for my efforts at broadening my range of classics, this novel is an amazing tale of love and the complexities of family in relation to it. If you haven't read it do so!"},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"This novel created considerable controversy, along with Freudian accusations of an Oedipal relationship between Paul the son and his mother Gertrude.D. H. Lawrence depicted the physical attraction between Paul and Clara in a very frank direct manner that was quite radical for the time. The tormenting uncertainty betweenPaul and Miriam, along with his strong attraction to Clara as compared to the mutual emotional dependency between him and his mother were understandably overwhelming to the public.It was very instructive to see how the absence of love in the mother's life led her to have an emotional dependency on one of her kids, only to switch to another son when she loses the first one. Portraying human narcissism through motherly love is a very shocking way of examining human nature. It was very interesting, as well, to see how the son was always torn between loving a woman and loving his mom, which are very different and incompatible emotions.Lawrence's honesty is very admirable considering the period in which the novel was written, and the unique way he described the son's decision while the mom is in pain on her death bed might raise some deep insight regarding this Author's vision. I, though, reject the possibility of a deep emotional thinker, and go with a merely honest portrayal of a pleasure worshipping male, who did not understand typical male desires as compared to typical human feelings.Lawrence had many admirers, including some smart/confused feminists, who thought of him as a great writer who portrayed quite accurately women's feelings. I, on the other hand, agree with the good writer part but sense in him shallowness and pure blind desire with a great dearth of complex analysis."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"This is really a book of psychological analysis. It's not exactly an autobiography but Lawrence makes a good deal self-eveluation of his childhood.When you read the novel you feel in an instant that someone who can describe human conditions that successfully,must have lived it all himself.Paul's excessive attachment to his mother and how his life became unbearable after her death shows the human helplessness.He tries over and over to LOVE someone other than his mother but each time he finds some missing part which is fullfilled by his mother. He really loves Miriam but somehow love also falls short to live happily-ever-after. When I first started the book I felt that the main character was Mrs.Morel. I was mistaken. Lawrence used all of the characters with nearly equal emphasis.Of course the leading one is Paul. On the other hand you take lots of things from other characters by his clear depiction. Paul,thus Lawrence, is a good psychologist.If you like to find your own thougts and feelings told by an author you should read Sons And Lovers.I finished it in a week."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"I suggested Sons and Lovers for our book club because it was on three respected \\"Top 100\\" book lists. We often read classics, so the club eagerly voted to include Sons and Lovers on our reading list.We all finished the book; but much to our surprise, we were unanimously disappointed. On a scale of 1 to 10, one person gave it a negative four. Ouch!The first 150 pages of the book are about Paul Morrell's youth and family life in a small coalmining town. This section is lively, interesting, vivid, and enjoyable. The second section of the book (the remaining 400 pages) is a study of Paul's obsession, frustration, and indecision about the women in his life. Reading it is like watching someone at a restaurant become very angry and emotional because he cannot make up his mind what to order; it is both boring and frustrating. Paul's constant vacillation between loving Miriam and then hating her (often both in the same sentence) eventually becomes laughable to the point of inviting parody.My book club agreed the book had potential, but the second section really lacked momentum. Paul's obsessions and indecision simply became boring.To his credit, Lawrence's prose is smooth, direct, and immediate. He is very much of the Modern tradition. The first section of the book was superb. I am certain I would have enjoyed the book much more if the second section were perhaps 100 pages shorter. I liked parts of Sons and Lovers enough that I'll try Lawrence again someday. But I can't really say I recommend this one."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"\\"Whatever else is unsure in this stinking dunghill of a world a mother's love is not.\\" James Joyce\\"Mama's gonna check out all your girl friends for you... Mama won't let anyone dirty get through... Mama's gonna wait up till you get in... Mama will always find out where you've been... Mamma's gonna keep baby healthy and clean...\\" Lyrics from the song \\"Mother\\" by Roger Waters of \\"Pink Floyd\\"This rather abstract, deeply affecting autobiographical novel by D.H. Lawrence is sure to unearth a myriad of emotions and conceptions for most readers as it did for me. In fact, one could easily scribe a terse, ten page thesis on this one. Talk about a complex story filled with a group of complicated, and yet captivating characters, especially the two main characters - Paul Morel (based on D.H. Lawrence himself) and his possessive, yet extremely endearing mother Mrs. Gertrude Morel. Yes, as you have probably read in the other reviews, Freud would have loved this one, for it's a prime example of his Oedipus complex theory. However, to focus solely on that aspect of this story would be doing this masterpiece a grave injustice, for it is so much more than that. The abnormal and imperfect relationships of Lawrence's \\"Sons and Lovers\\" are among the most widely discussed and analyzed in English Literature. This is one of those novels that will keep you completely absorbed from the first chapter on to the very last page.The story takes place right around the turn-of-the-century in the small, rather poor, mining village of Bestwood, England (Bestwood actually based on Eastwood where Lawrence was born). All of the main characters (with the exception of Clara Dawes, who was a composite) are based on real people in Lawrence's early life. Essentially, Paul Morel's early life story is the story of D.H. Lawrence. Paul is one of four children of Mr. and Mrs. Morel, two people who are complete opposites of one another, with the former being an uneducated, uncouth, and extremely unsophisticated mineworker. Estranged from her husband early on in their marriage, Mrs. Morel decides to take comfort in her four children, particularly (after a family catastrophe that I will refrain from disclosing) her middle son Paul: \\"Wherever he went she felt her soul went with him. Whatever he did she felt her soul stood by him...\\" And to young Paul, completely alienated from his ogre father, his mother is his whole existence, by far and away \\"the strongest tie in his life\\". However, trouble soon awaits the pair as Paul begins his slow ascent into manhood.As Paul enters into his teens, and those hormones start kicking in, he soon falls deeply in love with the austere, esoteric, loner Miriam who lives on a farm not too far from Paul's home. For many years the two of them carry on an extremely intimate, but yet purely platonic relationship. An intimacy that leaves Paul confused and totally unfulfilled. His feelings for this all-consuming girl seesaw back and forth from love to hate. And of course, his mother far from approves, \\"she's not like an ordinary woman... she wants to absorb him... til there is nothing left of him, even for himself... she will suck him up\\" (the very definition of transference!) Of course, his mother's adverse opinion of Miriam proves to be one of the main reasons he chooses not to marry the girl.Paul's second love affair is with Mrs. Clara Dawes, a suffragette, who is currently separated from her troubled husband. She is introduced to Paul through Miriam, and at first the two become close friends (it is her sage advice which soon helps him end his frustrating, platonic relationship with Miriam). However, despite her being married and Paul's heart belonging to someone else, the two of them begin a passionate love affair. Of course this affair also leaves his mother very despondent and discouraged to say the least. And in the end, of course... well... I'll refrain from disclosing anything more.I know this is a rather long review, however I still think I could write for days about this one and even then not quite do it justice. D.H. writes with such detailed, flowery, and poignant prose. This novel is a unique, in-depth look inside of the artist himself. He very bravely sketches for us his true character, warts and all, and about all the events that made him what he was.Lastly, I've read several reviews bashing Mrs. Morel, but all in all, with what she had to work with, she seemed to do a relatively good job in raising her children. The majority of 'mama boys' I have known in my life usually are self-centered, egotistical, under-achieving, pompous jackasses. They are the type of guys who think that it's their planet, and the rest of us here are just visiting. Thankfully so, D.H. Lawrence did not turn out that way! Ergo, his mother had to do something right.In closing, all I have to say is - WHAT A MASTERPIECE!"},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"This Kindle version is not the unexpurgated test first published by Cambridge University Press in 1992, It is the version extensively edited by Edward Garnett and first published in 1913, and omits approximately 100 pages of Lawrence's original manuscript. Garnett also made several editorial changes to make the text less controversial for the times. This was the only version available to readers for almost 80 years after it was written.&#34;Sons and Lovers&#34; is a semi-autobiographical novel in which the story's main protagonist, Paul Morel, struggles to maintain relationships with two female characters (Miriam and Clara) despite an almost Oedipian relationship with his mother, whose own disastrous marriage drives her to focus an abnormal amount of affection on her sons. Paradoxically he ends up killing his mother (out of kindness) rather than his father. Paul is a frustratingly complex individual and, for me, less than authentic. If this were not so evidently autobiographical I would be more skeptical. Lawrence himself, while the son of an essentially illiterate coal miner and a school teacher, attended Nottingham Grammar School and the University of Nottingham before becoming a teacher himself. His alter ego in the novel, Paul Morel, leaves school at the age of thirteen and becomes employed one year later, taking night school lessons and studying art. Despite his father and presumably his boyhood friends speaking in a thick East Midlands accent (although his mother does not) he seems to develop an almost unbelievably artiiculate manner of speech. Where does something like &#8220;Oh. You make me knit the brows of my very soul and cogitate&#8221; come from? It doesn&#8217;t ring true to me, although Lawrence himself was obviously very intelligent. Paul Morel lacks his education however.The seeming oversuse of the word &#34;hate&#34; throughout the text also puzzles me. As an example: &#34;And why did he hate Miriam, and feel so cruel towards her, at the thought of his mother. If Miriam caused his mother suffering then he hated her - and he easily hated her.&#34; And this is the girl he is supposedly falling in love with. Perhaps &#34;hate&#34; implied something different almost 100 years ago. Is this an example of semantic drift? I found it disturbing.Despite these minor irritations I did enjoy reading &#34;Sons and Lovers&#34; and immediately went on to read the unexpurgated version of &#34;Lady Chatterley's Lover&#34; which Lawrence wrote towards the end of his relatively short life while living in Italy. I found that to be a much more enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"Well, I'm one of Amazon's cheaper customers: They'll never get rich off of me which is why I've been spending the last couple years reading Lawrence, Fitzgerald and Horatio Alger for free on my Kindle.I'm almost done with Sons and Lovers and have been enjoying every second of it. Unlike Fitzgerald, DH Lawrence writes about poor people masterfully: Every detail, from the texture and smell of the flowers to the wide spectrum of human emotions are masterfully spelled out. The characters are not obsessed with money, they are more concerned with getting on with life and immersing themselves in their social encounters. And they don't, for the most part, drink themselves into oblivion, although alcohol definitely can open the door to some interesting drama.I particularly enjoy how the characters will love each other in one moment and despise each other in the next, which is really the way it works in the real world. Lawrence, unlike many writers these days, gives the reader plenty of foreplay in his romantic encounters but, perhaps because of the mores of the day, barely lingers on the details of the actual sex act. He leaves much up to the imagination and if you happen to blink, you might miss out on something juicy, which is a refreshing change of pace from the soft porn that is littering the marketplace.I don't read romance novels so I'm not qualified to say whether this would fall into the category of romance, however. The writing reads so effortlessly and the details are sketched like a masterpiece in an art museum. I really don't know what to call this book except great and I can't wait to sink my teeth into more of Lawrence's writing."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"This book follows the life of the Morel family, and takes a close look at the close mother-son relationship. D. H. Lawrence, although too detailed in his writing at times, is very perceptive when it comes to human relationships and his characters are very believable. The story is rather serious though, there is little humour.However it takes unexpected twists and turns, which makes this very long novel worth finishing."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"This is my first exposure to D.H. Lawrence, and what a powerful book to open with! Sons and Lovers tells the story of Paul Morley, the second son of a well-educated mother and crass collier of a father. Paul lives a fairly regular, if a little sickly, childhood and goes to work at the early age of 14. As he grows older, he finds the intense love he feels for his mother drawn away from her, first by the timid and Romantic (with a capital R) Miriam, and later by a suffragette named Clara Dawes. Throughout the entire novel, Paul and his mother share an intense, sometimes to the point of discomfort, relationship that plays heavily into the very dramatic conclusion of the novel. Beautifully crafted and wonderfully descriptive, Sons and Lovers is a wonderful novel and is sure to appeal to a broad audience."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"This is one of Lawrence's more famous works and it is about a young man who grows up in a poor English family, just as Lawrence did himself.One can start by quoting another writer: \\"Sons and Lovers was the first modern portrayal of a phenomenon that later, thanks to Freud, became easily recognizable as the Oedipus complex. Never was a son more indentured to his mother's love and full of hatred for his father than Paul Morel.\\"The novel is semi-autobiographical and it is the story of how one son struggles to break free of his mother\`s emotional grasps. The mother is in an unhappy marriage to a coal miner in western England around 1900. She has three sons but she has the strongest attachment to her middle son, and she tries to transfer her hopes and expectations to him.Without giving away the plot, it is the story of the middle son trying to find his way in life. The story seems very realistic and believable and has many twists and turns as the middle son, Paul, moves away from home. In the novel he attempts to reconcile his various relationships with different women, one from his youth, and another with an attractive married woman.When the book came out, it was considered to be on the edge of the censors boundaries, especially in America. Bellow and other writers in the 20th century considered the work of Lawrence to be somewhat groundbreaking in the develoment of realism and in the descriptions of passionate love scenes and human desires.It is an excellent novel and well worth the read.As side note, I read this at about the same time that I read James's \\"Portrait of a Lady\\" and I thought they were both outstanding reads."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"The words beautiful, slightly twisted and tragic embody Paul's inability to love other women as he loves his mother in Sons and Lovers. Freud would have had a field day with this novel. In spite the sexual overtones or perhaps in part due to them this book has a wonderful &quot;feel&quot; to it. Lawrence weaves a wonderful tale which everyone who enjoys a good book should read."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"A brilliant, brilliant work depicting the low lifes of a woman in a loveless marriage who tries to keep a bond with the only son she can now connect to. She can't let her boy grow up! And that's the fault which makes this a witty, clever, work of fiction."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"The story of a woman's life beginning from her horrid marriage to a drunk, her children's lives, and to her struggle to keep at least one son of hers to stay by her side. With the death of her smart and handsomely sucessful eldest son, her life suddenly turns cold, shrugging off the suitors of her other sons. A beautiful and emotional family story, that will leave you pondering."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"Sons and Lovers is intense, exciting, intriguing: cleverly sculpted scenes with double entenders indicate the sexual tensions that exist between Paul and his mother and with Miriam. This book is also a study in the shifting narrative technique; he is a pioneer and the bridge between the conventional pre-20th century omniscient narrative and authors such as Joyce and Woolf, where the very storyline consists of jumps between the personal emotions and opinions of the various characters of a novel. DH Lawrence is proof that quality literature with a distinct sexual edge CAN be produced. Bravo!"},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"Few novels by any author have ever been examined under the microscope of autobiography more thoroughly than SONS AND LOVERS. Nearly every character represents someone from the life of its author D. H. Lawrence, who clearly has used himself as a model for the protagonist, Paul Morel. To complicate matters there is a well-documented undercurrent of the Oedipal Complex between Paul and his mother Gertrude (also the name of Hamlet's mother who was linked to Hamlet in the same potentially incestuous way). Lawrence was later to deny ever having read Freud but his much older wife Frieda (a dead ringer for Gertrude) has written in her memoirs that she had several discussions with Lawrence about just that theory.Gertrude, a pretty woman of twenty-three marries a handsome, virile, but loutish man named Walter. Their marriage is unhappy since he drinks, is abusive, and has nothing in common with his wife. They have four children of whom Paul is the focus of dramatic interest. He is artistic, sensitive, and hates how his father treats Gertrude. She in turn lavishes on him all the love that might otherwise have gone to Walter. As Paul matures, he meets two women of consequence: the virginal and puritanical Miriam and the earthy and sexually aggressive Clara. Gertrude approves of Clara but disapproves of Miriam. From an Oedipal perspective, Miriam is a threat to Gertrude's primacy over Paul while Miriam as a floozy is not. Paul has an extended affair with Clara that she breaks off when her husband re-enters the picture and beats the crap out of Paul. Paul has a single sexual contact with Miriam, knowing that she would find it most distasteful, so he breaks off this relationship. Gertrude dies of cancer with a push from Paul. Walter becomes a cripple and drifts out of Paul's life. Paul devotes his life to his art as the book ends. All of these characters relate to Paul in ways that are at best weird and at worst ugly to contemplate. As Gertrude smothers Paul with a misplaced affection, she makes sure, perhaps unknowingly--we are not sure, that he will have difficulty relating his own burgeoning sexuality with any other woman. Miriam, in her sexlessness, is a Gertrude surrogate that Paul can feel comfortable with so long as they do not achieve intimacy. Clara is the chippie that Paul can show physical affection toward only so long as he does not show emotional intimacy. It is no surprise that both relationships turn out badly. Walter, who starts out as the Bad Guy, slowly accrues the sympathy of the reader as he has a positive side that even the confused Paul can see.SONS AND LOVERS may be full of a constant undercurrent of sexual energies running at cross purposes, but it is not necessary to see the book only or even mostly in terms of seeing a twisted Oedipus to enjoy reading it. There are other non-sexual themes at work that engage the reader. Lawrence was upset over the slow disintegration of English society caused by an encroaching industrialism that he saw as crushing the human spirit. Whether one chooses to see SONS AND LOVERS under a sociological or a sexual lens is a matter of personal taste. Lawrence, who was an advocate of freedom of choice, would certainly agree."},{"Title":"Sons and Lovers","review":"Not even close to Lady Chatterley's Lover. I was expecting more from this novel. Paul Morel loves his mother. He is the ultimate oedipal mama's boy. So much so that he can't marry his true love Miriam. So instead he hates her for creating a conflict that takes him away from mom. Then he has a purely sexual relationship with Clara... At the end of the novel, Paul's coming of age comes to its climax. What will he do as a man??? (move forward or die-- I won't give it away) He makes up his mind in one sentence, and it's a little too Hollywood-ish to believe. But then this is not 1913.This novel is supremely dated. Read it if you want to check off classics, but don't expect transcendant brilliant ideas to come across from the early 20th C. If you haven't read Lady C, do so first."},{"Title":"Huge Harold","review":"Even at 21, Bill Peet is my favorite author. I truely wish he was more popular so that his books would be more available.

Although the youthful rabit is able to find a male \\"mentor\\" to help him come out of hiding and face his true self, the chessy, sentimental ending makes me wonder about all the other \\"rabits\\" who never quite found themselves, but rather were extinguished by ignorance and prejudice.

It is obvious to this reader that this writer was obviously writing this book through his drug addled brain.Also, before someone writes an autobiographical book they should make sure that they get their facts straight when writing about others and using their full names. They should also let those people know that they are being written about. I'm sure that many of the people noted in this book will be very surprised to find out that they are even mentioned."},{"Title":"Learning Greek With Plato (Bristol Phoenix Press - Classical Handbooks)","review":"Beetham is brilliant! He really knows how to get you to read Greek. Ordinarily, I'd say that Plato is a bit ambitious for the beginning student, but Beetham makes it more than manageable. Every step along the way (really, every step) he stops to give you practice. The learning vocabulary (and Platonic idioms) are used over and over again in the exercises, and the the readings from Plato themselves are accompanied by very fulsome notes. Critical for the student learning on his or her own, there is a *complete* answer key. Also, for someone who's learned Greek once upon a time and is looking for a means to recover it, there couldn't possibly be a better book.The typesetting is not the best (a very small complaint given just how good this textbook is!), though it is worlds better than hisBeginning Greek With Homer(also a very good book, BTW!). Since the paradigms in the back of the book are quite spread out, you might also want to getGreek Paradigm Handbook, for handy reference. An English translation of Plato's Meno will come in handy about a third of the way through the book, as well. The author suggests either Sharples'sPlato: Meno (Aris & Phillips Classical Texts)or W.

And, although it has some germs of Dennett's thought, \\"Brainstorms\\" can also be bypassed.)Does one have to have a philosophy course touching on intentionality before reading this book? No, not if one is well-enough read in philosophy, psychology or sociology in general to grasp the background of Dennett's ideas.I rate this a star higher than most of Dennett's later work primarily because it is more introductory, and so we see less of Dennett tripping himself up or avoiding some of the logical conclusions of his speculations.That said, Dennett is never dull or boring; agree or disagree, he will stimulate your thought."},{"Title":"The Intentional Stance (Bradford Books)","review":"I believe this work should be considered a classic given the enormous influence the articles in it have had on philosophy of mind, among other areas in philosophy. Much in here is stated more clearly about the Intentional Stance than it is in later works, such as Brain Children. That isn't a criticism. I think that around the time this work was published Dennett was more into legitimizing and explaining the Intentional Stance than into polishing up his account of mind. Indeed in later works, such as \\"Consciousness Explained\\" and \\"Kinds of Minds\\", he builds off the foundation he laid here to develop his account of mind more fully.In IS, Dennett comments on just which philosophical schools he aligns himself with, for instance, interpretivism, methodological behaviorism, and functionalism. Part of the message to take home about exactly where he aligns himself is that it isn't really important to him. He lays his arguments down and lets others worry about whether that makes him an interpretivist or methodological behaviorist. A clearer statement of his position regarding categorization of his views can be found in the \\"Back to the Drawing Board\\" chapter in \\"Dennett and His Critics\\".In later works, Dennett further clarifies in what sense the entities the Intentional Stance makes use of are real, entities such as beliefs and desires. The most important of these later works is probably \\"Real Patterns\\", which appears in \\"Brain Children\\". In short, beliefs are part of compression algorithms of behavior that has been subjected to radical interpretation (See Davidson) from the Intentional Stance. A compression algorithm is (you guessed it) something that compresses some series of data. For instance, imagine you wanted to print 1000 1's and you had a computer that understood a programming language that would allow you to do so. One way to output the 1000 1's would be to specify that the computer print 1 and to repeat this command a thousand times. This doesn't compress anything however. Instead, you might tell the computer to \\"print 1 x 1000\\". This program has far fewer bits than does 1000 1's. 1000 1's has 1000 bits; the program has around log (base 2) 1000 bits. Hence, because it has fewer bits than what itd output does, that program is a compression algorithm of what it outputs. I recommend reading Gregory Chaitin for further info on Algorithmic Information Theory. In \\"Real Patterns\\" (in Brain Children), Dennett makes nice use of the mathematical definition of randomness to define compression algorithms and to set a plausible standard for what makes something a useful abstract object and thus, in a sense, just as real as are all the other useful scientific objects. Much more can be said about this, but this is enough for now.This book is an excellent starting point for future study. Dennett's writing is as always engaging, insightful, and fairly straightforward."},{"Title":"The Intentional Stance (Bradford Books)","review":"I've been trying to read every Dennett book since 1996 when I got to read the \\"elbow room\\" that really impressed my way of thinking, specially being a psychologist.

I read this book with a basic background in Philosophy of Mind but without having read all of the main articles in the field.First, the title... &quot;The intentional stance.&quot; The uninitiated will not know that this refers to a subfield of the philosophy of mind called &quot;intentionality.&quot; Does Dennett bother giving an overview of the field for those who are unfamiliar with it? No. He makes cute references to the main scholars in this field all over the place, and their main articles and results, etc., leaving all the readers who are not already familiar with his work in the dark. To a reader like me, this book is basically a conversation between Dennett and his friends. It's kind of hilarious to read actually.Second, the book is completely unstructured. His second chapter presents his theory (again only understandable to those who have closely followed the intentionality debate before reading it), and beyond that, it's &quot;All of Dennett's Thoughts in No Particular Order with No Conclusion.&quot;So basically, this is academic literature at its worst. Only to be read by those who are obligated to because they are scholars in the field. I would have given it a 3 but I took a point off for nauseating arrogance and another point off for an equally arrogant lack of structure (&quot;I am so important that they will read my book and SEARCH for the main points, because they have to!&quot;). I guess there are a few new ideas in it, but Dennett's high falutin', extremely arrogant prose seems to be designed for his own pleasure and for the pleasure of his old boy's club of philosopher friends.Personally I keep it next to my bed and read it before going to sleep. It's better than sleeping pills. Definitely recommended for the insomniacs.My real recommendation is to take a serious course in intentionality before reading this book.Ps - those who have read &quot;Consciousness Explained&quot; will find this book much worse.

That the author openly scorns the majority of solid evidence is favor of anecdotes, rumors and small studies of dubious quality is certainly a problem.So your dog seems to have some sort of \\"sixth sense\\" that your partner is about to come home. Interesting. Let's study that. Our dog \\"knew\\" when I was coming home... until we got a new car, we think she might have heard our older car's transmission working on the hill at the bottom of our street. Sheldrake would embrace the first half as \\"data\\" and dismiss the later finding as \\"blind skepticism\\". That a perfectly reasonable explanation might exist should certainly be the first recourse, but our author prefers the \\"world changing\\" hypothesis that Rover had ESP.Whether or not there is any real-world basis for psi is the topic and our author generally WANTS to believe it. My approach would involve:- examining known phenomena (such as our dog's better-than-human hearing)- finding them wanting (as would have been the case if she reacted to me coming home in the new car)- examining other possible theories (did I get home around the same time each day? did my partner remember the apparent successes and forget the times Rover missed the boat?)- then speculate- then test the speculation...The author STARTS with the speculation:- assumes all apparently related phenomina will have ONE cause (Rover's behavior has the same source as Fifi and Fido's behavior)- takes anecdotes as tests of the speculation- finds individual cases that seem to challenge more conventional explanations (maybe finding Fido is deaf and therefore could not have heard a car's transmission and Fifi's owner came home at different times each day)- assumes this destroys the conventional explanations (despite the possibility that Fido had a good sense of time AND Fifi had good hearing...)- assumes the unsupported theory MUST be right.Heck, we have as much evidence for my dog having ESP as we do for the CIA beaming information from sattelites into my dog's brain. Maybe fairies live in the bushes at the bottom of the hill and wisper the information to the Gnomes who send runners to tell Rover... Or the ghost of Rover's dead mother is telling her...

Unfortunately, I discovered on reading it that the author combines a deep antagonism for the scientific &quot;establishment&quot; with credulity for numerous fringe ideas. The first experiment that he suggests tests the hypothesis that your pet uses psychic powers to tell when you'll be home for dinner! Sheldrake frequently presents anecdotes as &quot;evidence&quot;. The &quot;do it yourself&quot; promise of the title is broken for the reader who doesn't intend to begin raising homing pidgeons or doesn't happen to work in a laboratory capable of measuring the physical constants (such as the speed of light) to nine significant figures. Far too few cautions about the pitfalls of psychic research are given (in chapters about the feeling of being stared at, or &quot;feeling&quot; the touch of a severed limb).

Why Rupert thinks that clearcut experimental results in these areas of anecdotal, imaginative tall tales would support his morphic field theory, I haven't a clue. What is more likely is that these animals and insects have the hidden ability to detect Gaia's gravitational curved space (much like air and ship LORAN navigators read lines of position).The author was forever hinting that chaos theory, Jung's collective unconscious or other ideas would someday reveal the whole story without telling what that would gain us (for instance, if we accepted that the fundamental constants were slightly variable).

He would be better advised to tell you to go to some supermarket and buy some healthy meal to heat up in the hotel microwave or a bag of prewashed salad with dressing rather than having you try to find something healthy at any fast food place.The book itself has some very poor photography, very grainy-looking--no excuse for that in this day and age.I'm glad I borrowed this from the library and did not buy it.Travel Fitness, by Rebecca Johnson and Bill Tulin is a much better book, and cheaper, too."},{"Title":"Health & Fitness for the Road Warrior: Consistent Fitness by Staying Consistently Healthy","review":"How many times have you hit the road on business with good intentions of working out and eating right? If you read this book, you will have no more excuses. The author combines a smooth writing style with great information about fitness, sleep, diet, and lifestyle changes that will keep you fit for life. The book is a permanent part of my travel kit. Thanks Kurt!"},{"Title":"Health & Fitness for the Road Warrior: Consistent Fitness by Staying Consistently Healthy","review":"For years I have struggled with trying to balance my family, my career, and my health. With this book I have finally learned how to get in an excellent workout in a short period of time without having to invest the time in going to the gym. The author provides some great discipline ideas to get into shape and STAY IN SHAPE. I would recommend this book to anyone who has all of the loads of family and work who realizes the necessity for good health and fitness. I haven't read anything that synthesizes the mental and physical path better."},{"Title":"Health & Fitness for the Road Warrior: Consistent Fitness by Staying Consistently Healthy","review":"Ah, now here's a travel fitness book by a guy who thinks like I do.Kurt Gutierrez believes you can apply the same planning, discipline, and anticipated outcomes to saying healthy on the road as you do in the rest of your professional and personal life. 'Just get it out there on an Excel spreadsheet', I can almost hear the author say.I like that.My own ongoing struggle to get fit again and then stay fit at a half-time travel pace owes a lot to the subjectivity of it all. Self-disclosure: I'm twenty pounds overweight at a time in life where that kind of thing has to stop, 'cuz the slopes get more slippery from here on out. Gutierrez wants me to get the situation and the plan down on paper and stick to it like I do with the rest of my life. He's talking my language.Eight short chapters and an appendix make the case: 'You're off!', 'Finding your personal why--your fitness mission and goals', 'Sleep', 'Jet lag', 'Stress', 'Eating and drinking', 'Exercise while traveling', 'Returning to the home front: putting it all together' and the appendix: 'Discussion on Heart Rate'.In the vocabulary of time and life management, the former military man Gutierrez' approach is top-down. That is, he actually wants his reader to sit down (chapter two) and write out his or her mission and goals. For guys like me who need to know why we do the things we do, this is what the doctor ordered. I have the discipline to implement the idea. I just need the idea. Mr. Gutierrez shows me how to get it out of my head--where it doesn't have the authority it requires--and on to paper, where I'm prone to obey.Parts of this book will be old hat to any seasoned traveler. What the potential buyer has before him is the choice to by the book for the helpful portions that I have attempted to sketch above, knowing that other sections will deal with matters (a trip checklist, staying hydrated on a plane, etc.) for which he needs little additional instruction. On the other hand, the book is slim and lightweight and--calorie charts and all--could prove handy as a one-volume tagalong reference while you get our travel ducks in a row.The author provides concrete exercises you can use today, with a healthy emphasis on ramping up to a sustainable exercise habit rather than binging on well-intentioned but short-lived get-fit rampages. I especially appreciate his final pages on 'common misconceptions' and 'returning to the home front'.Numerous misspellings mar the book but won't keep you from making good use of the contents."},{"Title":"Health & Fitness for the Road Warrior: Consistent Fitness by Staying Consistently Healthy","review":"Hey you with the laptop, cellphone, blackberry and pager.

After purchasing several books from Amazon and having purused several more at the book store, I can honestly say that this one book is the best written, most complete and scientifically accurate book I have seen for lay people on the subject. It covers everything from how to modify your home environment, to what drugs are available, to what are desensatization shots and what are the results if you take them. It has enabled me to discuss things more intelligently with my doctor. Also I want to warn you there is lot of pseudo-science out there. This book sets things straight about what is the science in allergy diagnosis and treatment and what is just plain nonsense. Read this book before you read anything else. It is quite concise and I found you can jump around and the read the chapters of your choice without being lost."},{"Title":"Allergies: The Complete Guide to Diagnosis, Treatment, and Daily Management","review":"When I was diagosed with several allergies my doctor suggested this book.

He appears to have been a prolific poet, but many of his works have been lost. He officially held the position of Rector of Diss in Norfolk, but from what we know of his character does not appear to have been suited to priestly office, and spent much of his time at Court, where he held the position of tutor to Prince Henry (afterwards Henry VIII).Skelton has the rare distinction among English poets of having a verse-form named after him, the \\"Skeltonic\\", consisting of short lines normally of six syllables each, although they can vary in length. They are normally arranged into rhyming couplets, but Skelton sometimes rhymes three or four consecutive lines together. Of the three complete long poems contained in this volume, two, \\"Philip Sparrow\\" and \\"The Tunning of Elinour Rumming\\", are written in Skeltonics, a form which Skelton used primarily for satirical or bawdy verse.For most of its length \\"Philip Sparrow\\" is a mock-serious lament for a dead pet bird, supposedly spoken by a girl named Jane Scrope, and then towards the end turns into a declaration of the poet's own desire for the young woman, even though as a pre-Reformation priest Skelton would have been bound to celibacy. The theme may have been suggested by the Roman poet Catullus, who also wrote an account of his girlfriend grieving over a dead sparrow, but Skelton's poem is far longer, running to some 1,250 lines. He finds room for numerous digressions, including Jane's supposed opinions- probably Skelton's own- on literature, especially Chaucer, Gower and Lydgate. It is a measure of how quickly the English language was changing during the Early Modern period when we read his verdict that:-\\"Gower's English is oldAnd of no value told\\",especially when we consider that Gower had only died about fifty years before Skelton's birth.\\"The Tunning of Elinour Rumming\\" is a scurrilous description of a female innkeeper from Leatherhead in Surrey and her customers, of whom Skelton clearly had a low opinion, describing them as not only drunken but also dirty and promiscuous. He also had an equally low opinion of Elinour's home-brewed ale, which he describes as \\"pig's piss\\", but her clientele will do anything to obtain it, even though it is brewed in the most insanitary conditions. Elinour attributes its fine flavour to her chickens, which roost above her fermentation tank and drop their excrement into it. Skelton's satire here has something in common with that of Chaucer, although it is much coarser and more vituperative.The third long poem published here in its entirety is \\"Speak, Parrot\\". It is mostly written in the seven-line \\"rhyme royal\\" stanzas favoured by Chaucer, although Skelton sometimes varies his rhyme scheme. It is supposedly the sayings of a pet parrot at Court who simply repeats what he has heard- not only in English but in a variety of other languages, including Latin, French, Greek, Spanish, Dutch and Welsh. The poem has been described as a satire on Skelton's bte noire Cardinal Wolsey, although many passages are obscure in meaning. Only in the last few stanzas, when Parrot speaks out loudly against the condition of contemporary England, does Skelton's satire become effective, painting a picture of a land ruined by the excesses and misrule of a corrupt, vainglorious, paranoid and tyrannical royal favourite. Skelton also took the opportunity to attack the growth of Protestantism in England, something to which he was firmly opposed.Excerpts from two other long poems, \\"The Bouge of Court\\" and \\"The Garland of Laurel\\" are also included here. (There are also four short poems, but nothing from the satires \\"Colin Clout\\" and \\"Why Come Ye Nat to Court?\\"). The first is Skelton's version of the common mediaeval idea of the \\"ship of fools\\", influenced by the German poet Sebastian Brant's \\"Das Narrenschiff\\". Skelton's ship is crewed by characters personifying various virtues and vices; his hero is named \\"Dread\\", a word here signifying \\"modesty\\" or \\"carefulness\\" rather than \\"fear\\" or \\"terror\\", and there are also characters named \\"Suspicion\\", \\"Riot\\", \\"Deceit\\", \\"Disdain\\", and so on. \\"The Garland of Laurel\\" is essentially Skelton's own proud summary of his own literary career, although it also contains verses in praise of several women who had taken his fancy, including Lady Elizabeth Howard, mother of Anne Boleyn. (Skelton's praise is sometimes double-edged; he compares Lady Elizabeth to Chaucer's beautiful but faithless heroine Cressida). The title derives from the laurel wreath with which poets were traditionally crowned; Skelton frequently referred to himself as Poet Laureate, although this was not an official position in his day.My main complaint about this volume is that the editor, Gerald Hammond, although he modernises Skelton's orthography, does not do enough to assist the modern reader. Both the editorial notes and the glossary are inadequate. This is particularly true of a notoriously obscure poem like \\"Speak, Parrot\\", which contains not only many recondite references to the Bible and Classical mythology but also what are presumably allusions to topical events, most of which are left unexplained. Although the poem contains words such as \\"gramatolls\\", \\"nodipolls\\", \\"pendugum\\" and \\"waterlag\\", none of these appear in the glossary; presumably Mr Hammond thought that their meaning was too obvious to require a translation.Many of the leading fifteenth-century poets writing in English were from Scotland, and in my view Skelton's verse does not compare with that of his great Scottish contemporary William Dunbar. Both men, certainly were capable of writing bitterly satirical invective, but Dunbar was also able to write in a much greater range of styles and could pen more elegant verse; Skelton's although sometimes effective, often descends into doggerel.Skelton's reputation declined in the decades after his death; by the end of the sixteenth century he was regarded as something of a buffoon, and for about three centuries thereafter he was largely neglected. His stock began to rise again in the twentieth century, possibly because of perceived similarities between his poetry and that of the Modernists. (Hammond compares him to T.S. Eliot). There is, however, little in this selection to contradict my suspicion that Skelton has been elevated to the status of major poet principally in order to help fill that rather embarrassing gap in the history of English poetry between the age of Chaucer and Gower in the late fourteenth century and that of Wyatt and Surrey in the 1530s and 1540s."},{"Title":"Alaska's Evergreen Lodge on Beautiful Lake Louise","review":"In 1969, Barney Sabo decided to resign from his position as a secondary school principal and move to a remote part of Alaska with his wife and reside in a wilderness hunting/fishing lodge almost 200 miles outside of Anchorage. Alaska's Evergreen Lodge On Beautiful Lake Louise is the biographical story of how the move was made, the life style changes that ensued, the challenges and adventures experienced so deep into nature's wilderness and far from the comforts and stresses of &quot;civilization&quot;. Alaska's Evergreen Lodge is highly recommended reading for anyone who has ever dreamed of chucking it all and going &quot;back to nature&quot; to enjoy a simpler life."},{"Title":"Doctor of Darkness","review":"It is a great novel that focuses on Nazi madness. Unlike other thought-provoking novels, DOCTOR OF DARKNESS has both action and meaning. By delving deeply into the young Nazi's mind, I had the opportunity to understand things better. It was like...entering a new dimension where everything was fresh and creative. No cliche, no dullness. The work simply revolutionized my way of thought."},{"Title":"Doctor of Darkness","review":"I loved the premise of this novel, with its strong characterization of Jan; but the miserable translation is very distracting and downright careless. The Nazi party has always, and rightfully so, been vilified; however, this book describes the attraction it had for the German middle class. Very thoughtful examination, but I sure would have liked a better translation; it is halting, and does not choose the English words very well."},{"Title":"Doctor of Darkness","review":"No other novel influenced my &quot;thinking pattern&quot; as much as Doctor of Darkness. Right from the start, this suspense thriller had me on the edge of my seat. It is supposed to be a typical crime novel, but somehow I felt there was something...more to it. The novel had substance; it wasn't some superficial mystery novel but an insightful one.

I couldn't even weed through all of the needless information in order for this book to make an impact on me. I was reading, and kept drifting off, because I simply didn't care about most of what he was saying. I wanted to become a 'Great Communicator'. Instead, I found my patience was being tested!

It is a fabulous and informative book!"},{"Title":"How to Be a Great Communicator: In Person, on Paper, and on the Podium","review":"The book is constantly on the edge of being all fluff. It lacks depth. This book takes the few important things Qubein chooses to share and ever so gently goes over the details. The author talks directly and softly without being chatty. This would be a very good book for a very young reader that wants to learn about public speaking. For adults, looking for a book to practice speed reading and skimming, the book is a truly outstanding. While it is well written and well organized, there is hardly ever a challenging thought. You should be able to read this book at the speed of light. Speed reading and skimming are valuable skills. Personally, I like books that have content density but are well written. Reading this book slowly would be a waste of time. Nearly all books that are made easy to read had an author that is careful not to say to much. This is one of those books manufactured for money. There was no passion to write it. See some of my two dozen reviews on public speaking for a better selection. How did all the excitement and pretense about Nido Qubein develop, certainly not this book. I am anxious to see him speak. I would like to see what makes him famous.My biggest new lesson from this book was as follows. So many authors on public speaking try to tell us an audience has one mind or a personality, Qubein says: Everybody in the audience is different, an individual. Audience evaluation is not dividing people into bunches.No offense intended but Qubein expresses a lot of opinions about the business world that are more pie in the sky than based on experience. American business is not well managed, it is just a whale of a lot better than other businesses around the globe. The media and Qubein want to make chief executive officers out to be Stars. Most CEOs bring a lot of limiting baggage to the job. Qubein is on the right track as to were management style should be headed. Corporate loyalty has been destroyed by shortsighted CEOs and boards of directors. It is going to take a lot more cash in the monthly pay check to hold a good middle management together in the future. Start ups and self employment are sucking the best out of big corporations, because the insensitive Huns are still in control. My opinions are based upon interviewing and tracking top management of hundreds of companies over decades for leading investment firms."},{"Title":"How to Be a Great Communicator: In Person, on Paper, and on the Podium","review":"If you need to be a great communicator to succeed in your profession (that includes everybody!), read this book.

The author makes a mistake, however, of treating the core 20% of RAC like rest of the 80%. For example, the book's details on Oracle RAC installation was about the same as its explanation of OCFS 1.0.I think 3 things about ORACLE RAC are essential and perhaps the most important part of RAC knowledge. They are the architecture, the installation (not that simple), and the administration. Approximately 20% of the book is dedicated to the 3 core topics.To his credit, the author does provide some fine examples and detailed knowledge on many esotoric aspects of RAC.

This book will guide you through the basic steps of:setting up public network cards,private networks cards,creating VIP addresses,bonding two or more network cards,testing them,verify with cluvfy if there is anything else to be done and just then, actually install clusterware software.In other books, all these steps i just mentioned are simply skipped. They just mention what you have to do. This book shows you step by step.These basic steps i just mentioned are linux steps, not oracle for the sake of oracle software. That's why this book is great. You don't have to have the linux bible handy because he tells you step by step what to do.The steps related to oracle are very detailed. He uses very rich pictures to better understand the concepts as well.There are some grammar errors in the text but it's nothing compared to how clear and simple this authors teaches the concepts of RAC. Step by step is very detailed.If you really want something simple, easy, with rich concepts and with step by step for beginner or intermediate skills with Oracle RAC stick with Oracle 10g RAC from Murali Vallath.I think it's important to read more than one book about the same subject so you can compare them.I read another book as well 'Oracle Database 10g Real Application Clusters Handbook' by K GOPALAKRISHNAN. I had the impression that this book would be very good specially because it's from Oracle Press. It's a waste of time and money. Just deep concepts.

At first, Nan Lilley opposes his intervention to confront Hathaway's moonshine operation because Hathaway has a lien on Lilley property and might foreclose, but she finally concludes that it had to happen--that things had to get worse before they could get better for the family.

Lone Star Baby).Caroline has an adorable daughter named Maggie, whose paternity has been a well-guarded secret over the 5 years since her birth. Instead of petty gossip or outcasting as one might expect, this warm-hearted community has embraced Caroline and Maggie, becoming quite protective of them. Grady, a rough around the edges rancher, realizes that his feelings for them has moved swiftly from platonic friendship to love. However, he must win the heart of the child, who prefers his fun-loving but highly irresponsible brother, in order for the relationship between him and Caroline to succeed.Debbie Macomber is a master at making a community come alive.

Debbie Macomber has been one of my favorite writers for a long time. Her sense of humor is well evident in this book and the other books in the series.

I came across one of his short stories in an issue of McSweeney's and have been trying to get my hands on as much of his stuff as I can (sometimes tough as all but this book have been out of print for quite some time). There is a tenderness and subtlety to Seager's writing that recalls the best writers of the last century. He has been compared to Hemmingway and Sherwood Anderson. A Frieze of Girls is memoir as fiction. \\"Time makes fiction out of our memories,\\" Seager says in his preface. A beautiful and sad thought in its own right. \\"The feel of truth is very like the feel of fiction.\\" This is a collection of stories about a young man's coming of age. It is Seager finding himself, finding the author, intellectual, and smartass that he would become. The stories are reminiscent of other authors who write of life as a well-off scholarly boy among other well-off scholarly boys. James Joyce, John Irving. Chronologically, A Frieze of Girls fits between the two. The history is different, but the themes of crossing the brink from boyhood to manhood never change. And Seager paints it as beautifully as any of the other masters who have written on the subject."},{"Title":"A frieze of girls;: Memoirs as fiction","review":"I was attracted to this book unconsciously and randomly one day, and it's stayed on my mind-the beautiful, understated writing with sharp observations both humorous and heartbreaking, testimony to the human experience, if I can make so preposterous a claim."},{"Title":"A frieze of girls;: Memoirs as fiction","review":"I've read that Seager was compared to or listed with other writers of his time, like Hemingway and Sherwood Anderson. Well those guys never made me laugh like Seager did in this beautifully crafted set of autobiographical pieces. This man knew enough about writing not to take himself too seriously, in spite of his bout with tuberculosis. People have called some of these essays heartbreaking, but I found them mostly hilarious. Being a Michigander/Midwesterner myself, I found much with which to identify while reading Seager. I've walked the U of M campus and recognize small-town Michigan in his descriptions of Adrian (his birthplace) and the stoic mannerisms of his family and friends. The style and the humor are so easy and conversational - so contemporary - that I often had to remind myself that these stories all happened in the 1920s! The only thing really heartbreaking here is that Allan Seager died so young. When I was a kid, if I heard about someone dying at 62, I just figured it was probably \\"old age.\\" Now I'm 65, and I know better. Here was a life full of promise cut short. This book, A Frieze of Girls, deserves a wide readership, but, sadly, it probably will sink into obscurity again before long. I plan to tell as many people as possible about it. If I had to compare him to someone, it might be Ring Lardner or Andy Rooney. This guy was funny! And he could write like nobody's business. - Tim Bazzett, author of PINHEAD: A LOVE STORY"},{"Title":"Cat Alphabet","review":"A beautiful book that weaves together art featuring felines, typography and puns.

This simple ghost/love story, written in 1939, was what A Certain Slant of Light should have been, as it tells the story of a dead man and a live woman who try to bridge the gap between life and death. Their love story is dream-like, poignant, bittersweet and very touching, and if I have one complaint (and I do), it is that writer Elswyth Thane brought this story to a completely unnecessary abrupt end, and left me feeling like a baby whose pacifier had been taken. Three more pages would have been reading perfection.If you enjoy clean, cozy, totally romantic, 2-hanky love stories, find this hard-to-find novel at your library, used book store or granny's bookcase and give yourself a treat.You can thank me later :)"},{"Title":"Tryst","review":"Elswyth Thane's TRYST made an indellible impression on me when I frist read it as a teenager.

I love it! I taught middle school English for 27 years, and every year I would try to get several of my students to read it. My brother got me a leather bound reprinted copy for my birthday and I reread it at least once a year. It is a perfect book for a cold, rainy day snuggled up with a hot cup of tea and a warm afgan. In fact, after looking at this site I think I'll reread it again tomorrow."},{"Title":"Tryst","review":"TrystI really was being to think that I was the only one who had read and been haunted by this book. I, like many of the other reviewers, read Tryst in my teens and it has remained in my memory for over 40 years. One of the only other books to stay with me in this way is Precious Bane by Mary Webb; which was also written in the 1st half of the 20th century.

The lock had turned. She knelt there, staring at the door, wide-eyed and shaken. The door moved two inches inward. The crack went on widening before her fascinated gaze until, still kneeling, she beheld the forbidden room. She cast a helpless look around the four walls, as if seeking him. Where could one look? Woudl he mind very much if--?\\"If I could find his name,\\" she said wistfully, just above a whisper, \\" I think I could talk to him--sometimes.\\"\\"My name is Hilary,\\" he told her, with a sudden, aching desire that she should know it.\\"From fly:Ghost story, love story, and modern comedy, Tryst is a novel which defies categories, a romance of two worlds.When 17 year old Sabrina moves to the gaunt stone house in the English countryside, it is a homecoming at last, for here is sanctuary from the confusing, frightening London world. And when she climbs the stairs to the locked, forbidden room, impelled by something stronger than curiosity, she enters into enchantment. When Hilary Shenstone, British secret agent, takes on one more dangerous mission on the Indian frontier, he is dogged by unreasoning homesickness. Even his death wound does not release him from the growing necessity to return to his home in the hills. Sabrina and Hilary were born to meet, and they do meet in that quiet book-lined room--perhaps not quite as they were meant to. But who can say?Tryst is a delicate and charming fantasy, a haunting love story of two worlds.

And, how many of us still LOVED it. It's timeless. Of the thousands of books I've read through the years I really only remembered this one with such a desire to READ IT AGAIN. The first read was from the library. I couldn't remember the title or author. I've watched used books for years without success. Thanks to amazon and their search category!!

Mrs. Thane wrote a beautiful, gentle love story that transcends time. &quot;Tryst&quot; warms the heart and soul, and makes one believe in love all over again.

Everytime I have loaned it to family or friends it never comes back. They love it also. It is such a good story. Sabrina is very believeable although many young people today might find it hard to believe that young girls were like that at one time. Hilary has always been my ideal of a romantic man. How they fall in love and how things are \\"set straight\\" for them is a great story.

I remembered how this story had touched my heart, and although I had subsequently read hundreds of books, it still remained one of my favorites.

It is a love story which explains the inevitability of union when two souls are aligned. Brought to a quiet English country house by her professor father and maided aunt, our shy, bookish heroine is quite content to be tucked away in the hinterlands. She has no suspicion that her life will be forever changed, or rational explaination for why she is so irresistibly drawn to the locked room at the top of the stairs. On the other hand, our hero only knows that he must follow his unreasoning desire to get home, and is all the more determined to do so after the drama and strain in the Asian desert, his most recent completion of what the high commissioner always called the &quot;almost impossible.&quot; Death, someone explained, only ends a life; it does not end a relationship.

It's a simple, lovely story in charming language and one of Ms. Thane's classics."},{"Title":"Tryst","review":"I first read this book in l946 and have never forgotten it. I recently purchased it from Amazon books and will always treasure it. It is a love story on two planes. In 1946 the after-life was not widely written about, but is just as mysterious today as it was then. A beautiful story."},{"Title":"Tryst","review":"This book represents what an American author thought was the &quot;ideal&quot; of English country living in the graceful period of butterfly collections, duty to country, and &quot;public&quot; schools. It's the melding of the Edwardian age with its &quot;God and country&quot; patriotism with the modern hustle bustle of life--and the Edwardian age definitely comes out ahead. I still have my very yellowed paperback copy published by Tempo Books in 1962 and purchased by me for 50 cents. I can't wait to receive my new hardcopy which I shall retain (along with my old friend). I read this book as a teenager and think I'll go read it again this afternoon. My images of England are inextricably painted by the language Miss Thane used--tea and crumpets always sounded so &quot;civilized&quot; to me. I highly recommend this as a counter to the cynicism of modern times."},{"Title":"Tryst","review":"What is it about this book? I too read Tryst as a teenager and could not forget the book. It has taken me 20+ years but I've managed to acquire all of Elswyth Thane's novels. I have a large library but Tryst and the Williamsburg books remain solid favorites (although one does have to ignore some pretty dated language on the subject of race in the Williamsburg books). If you loved this book and haven't read any other Thane titles, give them a try -- The Williamsburg books are a singularly lovely way to learn American history!"},{"Title":"Tryst","review":"This is one of my personal favorties of Ms. Thane's fictional works. Her writing style is simple, but elegant, and I really felt like I could identify with her heroine, Sabrina. This is a truly classic love story and ghost story interwoven into one delightful book you'll want to read over and over again."},{"Title":"Tryst","review":"I first read this book when I was around thirteen, and loved it so much that I have read it at least once a year since then, guarding my paperback copy carefully ( which I must, since I'm 56 now, and that makes both the book--and I!!--practically antiques!!)If it found it's way onto the bestseller lists today, this story would be an instant classic. But unfortunately, it was published way back in 1939, long before the world coined the term \\"YA (young adult) novel\\". Unfortunate indeed, since this lyrical supernatural romance has a simplicity of writing and a depth of emotion that puts the 'Twilight' characters to shame.So:1) why has this beautiful book been out of print for so long?2) why hasn't anyone discovered it, written a screenplay for it, tracked down the required small but elegant British cast, and turned it into the next big thing in YA films?It is so truly unfortunate that a quiet little masterpiece like this is allowed to fade into obscurity. What steps can be taken to bring these overlooked, forgotten books back into the public consciousness where they belong?Since that probably won't happen, heed this review, find a copy if you can, and cherish it for the subtle, understated gem that it is."},{"Title":"Tryst","review":"Like so many of the other reviewers, I first read this book in high school, over 50 years ago.

I had read all of Elswyth Thanes Williamsburg novels and loved them, and decided to read one of her other books. I chose Tryst. It is a very different story from her other books, not a historical novel, but a romantic ghost story. It is a lovely story for a girls first romance novel, and I looked for it all over to give to my 14 year old granddaughter, who loves Twilight. I think she will like this book too. It was hard to find, only on Amazon was I able to find it at a reasonable price."},{"Title":"Tryst","review":"I read this book as a young adult and fell in love with the story. I managed to get a copy of the book but unfortunately it was stolen some seventeen years later. Since then we've emigrated to New Zealand and for the past 30 odd years have been keeping an eye out for a copy - finally, I got lucky on Amazon! It's a lovely story of young love and how, by a twist of fate, two young lives do not turn out the way they were supposed to. It is set during the beginning of WWII - some may say it's predictable however, there is an unexpected twist at the end. A great read for a cold, wet afternoon by the fire."},{"Title":"Tryst","review":"The Romance Collection (The Lake House / The Phantom of the Opera / You've Got Mail)I first read \\"Tryst\\" after reading Elswyth Thane's Williamsburg Series while in high school in the 1950s. Over the years I have collected the Williamsburg Series and reread the seven books many times. This weekend I watched The Lake House on television, and although it isn't clear that the plot is a ghost story, it reminded me so much of \\"Tryst\\". Today I ordered \\"Tryst\\" to add to my collection so that I might own a copy to reread and added a DVD of The Lake House to be able to watch the film often. I was an English and history teacher for many years, recently retired, and recommended the book to a number of my students.

It'sabout a ghost named Hilary who falls in love with agirl who moves into his house. I'd give it ten stars if Icould."},{"Title":"Tryst","review":"If movies like the &quot;The Ghost and Mrs Muir&quot; send a sentimental chill up your spine, prepare yourself for a treat---&quot;Tryst&quot;, originally published in 1939, contains the same thrill of the supernatural bound by romantic love.Lovely 17-year old Sabrina lives in the rented country estate, Nuns Farthing, with the rest of her dysfunctional family---her bitter father, Alan, and her fusty spinster aunt, Effie. From the moment the door of the room at the top of the stairs is opened for her by sympathetic and sensitive housekeeper, Mrs Pilton, imaginative and lonely Sabrina conjurs up an entire history revolving around the room's previous inhabitant, Hilary Shenstone. The Shenstones own Nuns Farthing and the youngest son, Hilary is off in India carrying on in his father's dangerous tradition of intrepid Englishman working for the Home Office. As Sabrina thumbs through Hilary's library at home, we glimpse a bit of the adventure of Hilary's life as his plane goes down miles away from Nuns Farthing. Instantaneously, thoughts of his childhood mysteriously and irrationally capture his mind, and Hilary finds this inexplicable longing compells him to make the long journey home. After much soul-seeking and understanding, Hilary reconciles with his old life and moves towards his new one back at the home of his childhood. When he arrives, Mrs. Pilton recognizes him on sight and sends him with her blessings up to his old room where she knows Sabrina innocently awaits. And as Hilary first lays eyes on the lovely fresh-faced girl, he realizes why he was driven to make this homecoming---this is the girl he is destined for, the ONE he has been waiting for up until now to make his wife. Sabrina already half in love with him from her own imaginings, cannot help but fall for him, head over heels. Magical halycon days lie ahead for a couple star crossed in their love for one another . . .except for one slight detail . . . Hilary died in the plane in India.Sound intriguing? It is. Written in a sweet yet unsentimental way that is perfect for all age groups, the story moves along swiftly, keeping the reader wondering 'what is to become of the two lovers?' living on different planes. The likeable characters epitomize the era between the World Wars; the politeness and sensibilities portrayed enhance Sabina's wistful frustrations and emphasize Hilary's desperate need to make this one last connection work.This bittersweet love story is recommended to all who love spending a rainy afternoon watching romantic black&amp;white films while fantasizing about that perfect lover."},{"Title":"Tryst","review":"Agreeing with all the other reviewers, this is one of the best romantic stories I have ever read, as well as a stunning and beautifully handled novel on the afterlife. Along with the film The Ghost and Mrs. Muir, Tryst is one of the wonderful stories about love that truly meant something, not like what we read about or see in films lately. The book is emotionally moving, but also intelligent, being a contrast to a lot of the nonsense being written these days. This is a hopeful story as well as a tragic one, and it has haunted me for nearly 30 years. I was ecstatic to discover it was in print!"},{"Title":"Tryst","review":"I read this book when I was in high school, remembered it deeply, clearly, and have hunted for a copy of it for nearly two decades. It's a very sweet love story, with all the undercurrents and tensions of complex human lives. I agree with the reviewer that said that the situation of the out-of-sync lovers is both memorable and so deftly resolved.I loved this book enough to search it out after decades of remembering it."},{"Title":"Tryst","review":"This book is one of the memorable ones from my adolescence. I was a freshman in high school at Ursuline Academy in Wilmington Dealware, when my school had a book fair with a bookmobile full of new books for sale. I picked out Tryst, read it, fell in love with it, and read it over and over again through my high school years. It was the perfect read for an introverted, bookish teenage girl who, like Sabrina, had a much more romantic idea of love than what passed for romance with the silly boys wanting to make out in the back seats of cars.Hilary and Sabrina - a love story, a ghost story, a romance of adventure even though Sabrina never leaves the staid English countryside.I have a used book business now, and I listed my battered old copy of Tryst for sale, for $26. I couldn't resist, most mass market paperbacks have far less resale value. Obviously, there are others who appreciate this book and love it as I do.Yesterday somebody bought my copy. So I had to give it one last read. i stayed up all night, carefully turning pages so as not to make a well-worn book even more so. I just finished it again, and will ship it tomorrow. Sigh.

Sabrina and Hilary transcend time, and their love will widen the range of your heart."},{"Title":"Tryst","review":"Simply put, TRYST is the single most romantic book I've ever read. Sweet without being soppy, romantic without being cheaply sentimental, TRYST is the wistful, delightful love story of Sabrina and Hilary, two of the most truly lovable characters in all of fiction. Forget the box of Kleenex -- grab yourself a lace-edged linen handkerchief and a sunny window seat and revel in a pure true love that death can't end and time can't cheat."},{"Title":"Tryst","review":"\\"You will find yourself reading this one over and over.

The characters and situations delight the reader. The romance touches my feelings with each rereading."},{"Title":"Tryst","review":"I was introduced to TRYST in 1967 when I was a high school senior. I have read TRYST again every year and still love it dearly. What is it about this extraordinary book, written in the 1930s that still holds so many of us enthralled? The idea of eternal love, that death is no barrier to? Young Sabrina, sheltered by her aloof father and somewhat dingy aunt, comes to a home called Nuns Farthing and falls in love with an absent son of the family -- away on a mission in India. She loves him sight unseen and waits for his return. But the Fates have thrown them a curve ball. Nonetheless, Hilary and Sabrina find one another. The philosophies in this book come out the more you read -- the thing you're reaching for won't be there until it's time for you to have it. Hilary and Sabrina may be star-crossed lovers, but their story is one that continues to touch the hearts of all who read it. It is timeless -- in every sense of the word."},{"Title":"Tryst","review":"I was first introduced to this book by Miss Florence Naudain, the high school librarian at Corinth Central School in upstate New York.

I went to her and asked for a \\"ghost story,\\" and she suggested Tryst.Miss Naudain knew best, and this romantic tale has stayed in my mind all this time. I finally bought a copy from Amazon and finished reading it last night--I thought about reading only a few pages a day to draw it out and keep the story from ending but I couldn't stop reading it. It was as wonderful as I had remembered, and the tears were flowing down my face by the last page. Wonderful!"},{"Title":"Tryst","review":"No other book compares!

The book was a funny, tear jerker. Life's lessons are all taught through the eyes of a young boy in small town USA. I am a mom of young boys and I loved looking into the heart and soul of a very active, very interesting boy. It helped me to understand how they tick. It also taught me just how much these little guys are paying attention to all we do and say. Son's of Ditches is packed with fun and adventure. It is a great read for all ages, but is written for adults to look back on childhood."},{"Title":"Spelling Rules","review":"Its okay but geared more toward a college student who needs a spelling review rather than a younger elementary student who needs tips on spelling.

For those of you who don't know about Nevis, it is part of the twin island state of St. Kitts - Nevis located in the Leeward island chain in the Caribbean. Nevis has a long history starting with the Carib and Arawak Indians, and ending up with a fusion of races from England, France, Africa, South America, etc.What I found so great about this book was the fact that the author, Vincent K. Hubbard, who is an American living on Nevis, takes a 3,000 years of history and crams into just over 100 pages. Don't be fooled by the size of the book though, the wealth of history in this book is amazing. Mr. Hubbard guides you on a tour of the islands history in a manner that seems more like you're reading a novel, not a history book. His style of writing is colorful, light, and yet informative.The history of the battles fought between France, England, and Spain over Nevis are documented in such a way that you would think you were at the battles yourself. The interesting facts on Admiral Horatio Nelson (who was married on Nevis), Alexander Hamilton on the American statesman (Born on Nevis)and other rascally character through the ages are abundant. Incidentally Americas first naval battle and victory took place off the coast of Nevis. All in all if you like history, or if you are just planning a holiday in this &quot;Queen of the Carribbes&quot; island of Nevis you can't go wrong in reading this book. Humor and history is a hard combination to beat. The only drawback in my opinion were the less than detailed photo descriptions. Enjoy the book!"},{"Title":"Swords Ships and Sugar: A History of Nevis to 1900","review":"This is a thoroughly researched history of Nevis, one of the pivotal islands in the Caribbean. It includes battles on the high seas, pirates, slave revolts, the origin of rum and the drama of a sugar empire built and destroyed. The amazing thing about this book is that it never gets boring or dry. I stayed up to finish it like I normally do with a Dick Francis mystery novel. If high school and college History had been this interesting there'd be a lot better attention paid in class."},{"Title":"Swords Ships and Sugar: A History of Nevis to 1900","review":"I just finished this book last night and I was surprised that I could hardly put this book down. A very interesting read for anyone that's interested in history in the Caribbean. My only complaint is that there wasn't much time spent on the nineteenth century and that's what I was really interested in reading about. There's plenty about the 1600's and the 1700's, but very little about the 1800's. I hadn't realized how volitale life was living on one of the Caribbean islands in that time period and the book contained some interesting stories. All in all, an entertaining read."},{"Title":"Using the Power of Humor to Improve Your Life","review":"The author gives a number of helpful practical methods for the development of humor in every day life.

The book is also good for student learning because the subject matter appeals to them.I found the approach of the book to be refreshing. It had you build your first game in a straight forward but not OOP manner. In my opinion it would be how most novice programmers would build the game. Nothing was resuable.

It would be better if it had some exercises for you to try on your own, rather than just copying the book programs, thats the only way to learn something is to do it yourself. On the positive side, if you are an experienced programmer, this book does a good job of teaching VB.NET and introducing games.If you want to learn VB.NET from scratch this book is not for you. It doesn't teach you how to get started with Visual Studio, let alone VB. If you don't already know some programming, you won't be able to follow it. Also, it has many typos and errors that break the code examples. If you are an experienced programmer, they are easy to spot. If not, you can use the downloaded code to fix them, but save yourself the aggravation, get a book that is really geared toward beginners."},{"Title":"Learn VB .NET Through Game Programming","review":"I've studied from tons of books over the years and this is my least favourite ever. The subject matter is presented in what I feel is mostly a haphazard way. The author uses games to illustrate concepts about vb.net. However, if you wanted to search the book for a particular subject for reference, it would be hard to do. It does sort of build on topics, but not like a book should. The worst problem is that the first program, a cheesy dice rolling program is packed with coding errors. The errors weren't bad, but they were numerous. I did find the coding example interesting, but it did seem more like random mixture of stuff than an organized explanation. I guess my biggest complaint is that I shouldn't have to debug the code examples in the book this much. Overall, I am unhappy with the book and I'll not buy another APress book again. It seems to me that this book suffered from bad editing and rushed production."},{"Title":"Learn VB .NET Through Game Programming","review":"The reason I'm giving this book a low score is because I don't think it does what it promises. First of all, it's very hard to learn ANY programming language(including Basic) through game programming. If you know VB.NET well, go ahead and give it a try. I, however, am a newbie to game programming, and after reading through the first few chapters and finding the text confusing and having to frequently read lines over and over because it doesn't explain itself in a fasion it should to it's target audience, still don't know how to program a game."},{"Title":"Learn VB .NET Through Game Programming","review":"I bought this book on a few reviews and the price of the book. What it offers is sadly not able to run. I mean, I downloaded the source from the publishers' site, and that ran fine. However, I compared it to my hand-typed version (following the books' examples) and my program is a mirror image (it seems to me, anyway) of the authors' code. However, it continues to give me an error on something that already has a value, and it reports it as having a 'null' value.And this is just the first program in the first chapter of the book. I'm sorry, but if you are going to put code in a book, please make it ALL consistent with every other part, there were a few places where the compiler warned me about some names not being defined because the author got lazy and put an abbriviated name in for another variable or procedure.I will continue to read this book and try to code it, but I will be wary of other programming books that come from this publisher."},{"Title":"Learn VB .NET Through Game Programming","review":"I had previously added a negative review base on my inability to run the code samples.

I think that's what got me into graphic design. Over the years I collected numerous flag books of all shapes and sizes. Flags of the World was my very first flag book, waaaaaay back in 1972! As a matter of fact, I found it at one of the very first Target stores and I begged my dad to buy it for me. A lot has happened over the last 40 years, and the reference material in this book seems archaic by today's standards. But what I love about this book is the flag illustrations by Jack and Enid Hayes! Most flag books of today show computer generated flag illustrations that are mainly flat rectangles. Flags of the World is full of good old-fashioned hand-made painted illustrations with incredible detail and dimension! When I found my original copy of this book in my mother's attic, I noticed the cover and several pages were missing. Most pages were severely dog-eared, taped together, and extremely yellowed from age. I wanted to search online for a \\"new\\" copy to rekindle the excitement that I experienced when I was a kid. I searched on Amazon, and there it was!

Growing up in the 1940s with a family who used two (Flex-Seal) pressure cookers at many meals, I am comfortable with what pressure cookers can do. This book's strength is its description of what you can do and why. Example, I now \\"Quick-soak\\" all dried legumes for five minutes instead of soaking them overnight. This is an enormous time-saver.If one finds the recipes bland, it is easy to add spices to enliven them. But the core recipes work well.An excellent book."},{"Title":"Pressure Cooking the Easy Way: Healthy One-Pot Meals Everyone Will Love","review":"I tried the \\"Refried Beans\\" (page 134). In total, it took about an hour of a half, including the quick-soaking procedure described in the book and the mashing at the end. (Most of the time is spent waiting, so it was easy.)

Its good to get you started."},{"Title":"Pressure Cooking the Easy Way: Healthy One-Pot Meals Everyone Will Love","review":"I've cooked from the Pressure Cooking the Easy Way cookbook for many years and with several different brands of pressure cookers. No matter what recipe or what pressure cooker I use, the recipes turn out every time.What I like best about this cookbook is the simplicity of the recipes. A lot of cookbooks jazz up recipes with all kinds of ingredients or complicate the cooking steps. That's fine when you want to fiddle around in the kitchen. For the days when you don't want to fiddle, but get supper on the table, the Pressure Cooking the Easy Way Cookbook is your trusted friend in the kitchen.Also, I love how there a numerous key recipes followed up with variations in this cookbook. A good example of this type of recipe is the Quick Beef Stew recipe found on page 88. There is the basic beef stew recipe followed by numerous variations including Beef and Bean Stew or Chicken Stew.This is a very simple cookbook filled with plenty of tasty pressure cooker recipes.Highly recommend."},{"Title":"Pressure Cooking the Easy Way: Healthy One-Pot Meals Everyone Will Love","review":"I am not experienced with pressure cookers, so you may chose to ignore my review.

I was hoping for a book with some detailed suggestions supported by research. To my disappointment, the book consists of short quotes that may or may not be relevant, contradictory statistics, and references that reminded me of my childhood Sunday School classes. While this book may be helpful to parents just beginning to have an interest in raising respectful, self-sufficient children, it didn't contain any new ideas for me.

The book was a quick read and I didn't learn anything new."},{"Title":"Raising Respectful Children in a Disrespectful World (Motherhood Club)","review":"Parts of this book appealed in that the writer seems to be a kindred spirit to strict-ish, traditional, loving, family-centered parents. I didn't find anything really new--if you're in your 40s, some of this will probably sound a lot like your childhood.However, my overall opinion of the book is negative based on two things:1. The author seems to be writing for Christians only. This wasn't clear from the newspaper review I read, or from the public library catalog entry. I absolutely do NOT have anything against Christianity, or to an author having strong religious beliefs. But, I think it's a shame that the author would choose to limit her message--which could appeal to people of all religions and ethnicities--by using a single religion as the basis of truth. The implication is that the \\"disrespectful world\\" is comprised of non-Christians.2. The author further inserts a very personal view on certain books, music, television shows, using inflammatory language that also has the effect of narrowing the book's audience. It's one thing to caution parents about general themes that may be inappropriate; it's another thing entirely to say that something is \\"disgraceful,\\" without citing any specific reasons or considering varying viewpoints.To illustrate how an author might expand his/her audience without betraying his/her own beliefs, read Movie Mom's reviews online. Movie Mom seems to offer more general and objective descriptions, outlining very specifically which issues are raised that may require discussion with sensitive and/or young viewers. By comparing one's own likes/feelings/tolerance levels to those of Movie Mom, one can gauge pretty well whether a movie will be right for one's family, without feeling judged or badgered.The main (and excellent) messages of the book (which have been covered in many other books) are to be the parent (establish guidelines, have consequences, etc.) and to spend lots of time with your kids to establish/maintain a close relationship."},{"Title":"Raising Respectful Children in a Disrespectful World (Motherhood Club)","review":"If you have children you must have this Book!"},{"Title":"Raising Respectful Children in a Disrespectful World (Motherhood Club)","review":"You will be challenged by this book.

It is written from a Christian perspective, but it doesn't bludgeon the reader with Bible verses. Author Jill Rigby offers seasoned, practical advice on parenting that looks to the long term: What do we want our children to be like in their inner selves? One of the key ideas in this book is how important it is to help our children develop self respect rather than self esteem. If every parent could grasp even that one message, it could change the world."},{"Title":"Raising Respectful Children in a Disrespectful World (Motherhood Club)","review":"I agree with the ideas presented by Jill Rigby. However, her presentation lost impact with me because so much of her advice was based on what should happen in a \\"God loving Christian home\\". Being of mixed faith myself, and working to teach my child to love all people regardless of belief (or non-belief) I would like to have had the ideas presented on more of a non-theist basis. You can teach respect without invoking God to do it...my child is considered very respectful, tolerant and loving and he's never set foot in a church."},{"Title":"Raising Respectful Children in a Disrespectful World (Motherhood Club)","review":"This is the best parenting book I've read, and I've read a lot!

I imagine many in our world, Christians and non-Christians alike, would probably say that Jill's perspective on raising children is pretty conservative (no R movies in the home, no TV before two, no PG-13 movies until 13, etc.), but personally I became encouraged as I read.If I were to sum up her book in a single sentence I would have to say, \\"Do what you want them to do and be what you want them to be. They learn more from your actions than your words every day.\\" By the end of the book I had a list of several actions to begin incorporating into my life to do just that--be the positive example for my children to follow."},{"Title":"Raising Respectful Children in a Disrespectful World (Motherhood Club)","review":"In a world of pop culture and reality shows with extreme behavior for the sake of ratings this a breath of fresh air.

I agree with the reviewer who said that Rigby's chapter about self-esteem versus self-respect was worth the price of the book. It's something I never thought of before. In fact, the entire book made me think, pray, and reconsider some of the ways I'd been parenting (or non-parenting). The author is a Christian, and she's not afraid to let her faith inform her message. So, yes, she might offend people. But I admire her for her strong faith and her practical, personal and politically incorrect(!) advice."},{"Title":"Raising Respectful Children in a Disrespectful World (Motherhood Club)","review":"I've read a lot of parenting books, and this one stands out.Yes, it is written from a Christian perspective, and if you are not of the Christian faith you might not like the tone of the book, however I do think that if one was not anti-Christian, but does agree that children today are too disrespectful, that you would find beneficial information.The difference between self-esteem and self-respect (as long with the dangers of false praise) was an eye-opening section and worth the price of the book in itself.The Reality Check questions at the end of each chapter help you assess your strengths and weaknesses in each area and offers more of a challenge to correct some things that you might have let slip. What I liked about this book is that the author challenges parents to decide what is important to you. I think that it was done without judgment. If you think certain behaviors are desirable or undesirable, Ms. Rigby helps you address them.There is a great reference list of suggested reading for parents at the end of the book as well."},{"Title":"Raising Respectful Children in a Disrespectful World (Motherhood Club)","review":"This book hits the nail right on the head.

Ms. Rigby understands how hard it can be for parents to say \\"no\\" to toxic pop culture, permissiveness, selfishness, greed, false praise, perfectionism, etc. She reminds us of the damage these things can inflict on our children and provides helpful suggestions for countering them.Ms. Rigby does include a lot of references to God and the Bible, but most of them were not Christian-specific. The majority of the quotes came from the Old Testament and the ones from the New Testament dealt with Jesus' teachings rather than his role as Savior. So I could see why a Jew like Dr. Laura would not have a big problem with this book."},{"Title":"Raising Respectful Children in a Disrespectful World (Motherhood Club)","review":"Some of the reviewers you will see here appear to be more concerned with telling the author how she should have written the book than rating its content. These reviewers typify the kinds of people who make up this selfish, self centered, and disrespectful world in which we live.Over 70% of the people who viewed this web page describing the book purchased it. It gets an overwhelmingly positive rating by those who have read it for its content. My belief is that Ms. Rigby has helped me understand how our children are unhappy in this world, it's very apparent too. Just go to the \\"mall\\" some weekend; you will see the rotting demoralization of our youth. She clearly points out the reasons and suggests methods to help our children.Since I have read this book and put into practice her suggestions - I have a happy and respectful child. It did not happen overnight, nor does she claim the methods will instantly change your child; it takes work, love, and patience.What this book has taught me is how we should all treat each other; the golden rule - to treat others as you want to be treated. Disrespect at any level should not be tolerated and it all starts with you, yes you.I'm buying copies for my friends with whom I've discussed this book. By the way, some are Jewish and one is Buddhist. They can't wait to get their hands on it and start practicing the methods that have been successful no matter the religion.Love and tolerance should be our code. It should be our children's code. With God's help it will. Great Book."},{"Title":"Raising Respectful Children in a Disrespectful World (Motherhood Club)","review":"I just started reading the book.

They will do anything to be with each other, even if it means killing themselves. There comes a moment in the play where the only way out is committing suicide. And that was what Romeo and Juliet did. When Juliet found out the real identity of Romeo, she couldn't believe it: &quot;My only love sprung from my only hate&quot;. The families really hate each other: &quot;I hate hell, Montagues and thee&quot; so Romeo and Juliet decide to keep their love in secret, the only ones who know are Friar Laurence and the Nurse. As everyone knows, the end, is extremely tragic. Juliet has no way out so she decides to pretend her death, but if it doesn't work, she is willing to kill herself: &quot;If all else fail, myself have the power to die&quot;. As Romeo can't stand her &quot;death&quot;, he also commits suicide. Juliet wakes up, sees him dead, and kills herself also. So both can finally be together.That's why we think parents shouldn't interfere in their children's love life. Because if they do, their children might end as Romeo and Juliet. It's better to have them married with someone that you dislike rather than to have them dead. Love is always stronger so people do anything to be with the one they love."},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet (Shakespeare, Signet Classic)","review":"We like and sometimes didn't like this book. \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" is based in an \\"impossible \\" love. We recommend you not reading this book if you don't like romantic stories.Also this book didn't like us because it was boring and very difficult to read. I understand that was Shakespeare language but for these new generations is very difficult. In the other way, we like it because the characters did everything for completing their dreams.

This edition is different from the other versions available of the same text, because this edition looks at Shakespeare's source, discrepancies in the text, meanings and significance of the imagery, etc. The multitude of footnotes (often taking up more than half the page) makes it ideal for scholars of Shakespeare who need more than just superficial notes. This edition is grossly inadequate for stage use due to the multitude of notes and small text. Buy this edition of the book for a sturdy, reliable and in-depth study of Romeo and Juliet. Look elsewhere for a simple copy of the text.NOTE: THIS IS A REVIEW FOR THE OXFORD SHAKESPEARE EDITION OF THE PLAY NOT THE RADIO BROADCAST!!!"},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet (Shakespeare, Signet Classic)","review":"This radio adaptation is interesting in some ways, but it remains rather short on its objective. The sound universe created behind the voices is rather diminutive. Some voices are not that very accurate : Juliet is rather old-sounding and Romeo is quite late in his twenties at least. Lord Capulet speaks as if he were plain drunk all the time. But what's more some interpretations are defective. The famous sonnet during the dance is just badly done. The tone is wrong. The wit is flattened, etc. The balcony scene is slightly better, luckily. Romeo, by the way, is too much of a hooligan, of an agressive character, not at all in keeping with the world we can vaguely hear behind. Finally there are some cuts and some changes in the text that are not at all justified, such as pacing for passing .

Every word fascinates the reader into truly feeling the passion and tragedy of these two lovers. Even a character such as Tybalt Capulet won me over as far as description goes. Shakespearean writing is very much complex and confusing but it has a touch romance and anger which adds to the emotion of the story.Is an excellent story for teenagers, read this classic book of love, hate and tragedy!"},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet (Shakespeare, Signet Classic)","review":"Romeo and Juliet is an amazing book, about two starcross lovers have never read a book like this one. What attracted me about the story was that they both killed themselves because of the strong love they had.Kids from the age of 10 to 13 will understand it without any difficulty. The adult's will like this book but not as kids will do. This book has a lot of emotions from the beginning to the end. I think that Shakespeare was inspired when he wrote this book. He would have been inspired with one of his loves or in England's daily life. I think he is the most important English author of time.I think it's a great book and I recommend it to anyone that likes tragedy books and like's Shakespeare books."},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet (Shakespeare, Signet Classic)","review":"Two teenagers from rival families fall in love, marry secretly, and take their own lives rather than live without each other. Despite the teenage melodrama, \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" remains one of Shakespeare's most enduring and popular plays, even if it wasn't his best -- lots of death, teen lovers and enchanting dialogue.In the city of Verona, the Montagues and Capulets are locked in a deadly feud. Then a Montague teen named Romeo, infatuated with a Capulet girl named Rosaline, sneaks into a party to see her.... but instead encounters another Capulet girl named Juliet, and the two immediately fall in love. Since their families hate each other, their love must be expressed in secret.Hoping to unite the two families, the kindly priest Friar Lawrence assists the two in marrying in secret. But then Juliet's cousin Tybalt challenges Romeo to a duel, leading to the death of two men -- and Romeo's exile from Verona. Even worse, the Capulets have decided to marry Juliet to Count Paris -- leading to a desperate plan that goes horribly awry.\\"Romeo and Juliet\\" is a play that is hard to pin down -- some see it as the poetry-laden embodiment of romantic love, while others view it as Shakespeare's witty jabs at fickle teenage infatuation and how melodramatic the kids are (Juliet is only thirteen!). But whatever you think it is, it's undeniable that it's a beautifully written, often-wrenching story.Despite the simplicity of the story, Shakespeare spins it in a silken web of lush poetry (\\"O swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon/That monthly changes in her circled orb\\") and the famous speeches where Romeo and Juliet speak at night on a balcony. The mostly romantic play takes a dark turn towards the end, when only a few minutes might have changed the fates of \\"Juliet and her Romeo.\\"And Shakespeare seems rather fond of his characters here, depicting Romeo as a passionate young boy and Juliet as rather sweetly insecure young girl; there's also a fairly good cast of young men whose spirits are more elevated than their brains, and the kindly friar who rather naively hopes to use the kids to create peace.But Shakespeare was also clearly aware that passionate teenage love is not necessarily the truest love (\\"Young men's love then lies/Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes\\"), and leaves you wondering what might have happened if Romeo and Juliet had lived.Whether a gentle mockery of young love or a passionate, idealized romance, \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" is a timeless and lovely little play. Not the best of the Bard, but still quite good."},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet (Shakespeare, Signet Classic)","review":"The book's content is incredible. It has all elements an excellent drama piece should have. Suspense, love, romance, action, everything is included in this book. The only feedbacks are the ancient english it is written in. Anyway, I would say like it wouldn't 'stick' with modern english.The plot is somewhat boring at first. The action begins when Romeo falls in love with Juliet, and Tybalt discovers it. In the climax, there is intense, non-stop action, when Romeo's Friar gives a sleeping potion to Juliet so she can escape from marrying, but Romeo has not heard about it. This great tragedy ends with the suicide of these two. It is a great book and I really recommend it for young and adults."},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet (Shakespeare, Signet Classic)","review":"Romeo &amp; Juliet takes place in Verona in Feudal times. In that times women weren't given any rights. They couldn't hold property or discuss with their husband. This is shown during the whole book. Another thing different from nowadays was the language. Shakespeare uses a language, which I can't understand. So, in some parts were I don't know what a word means, the book becomes boring. Shakespeare, in a way, wrote female characters more intelligent and reflective than male, which in those times, women were objects. The story has different little stories in it. For example; the quarrel between the Capulet's gang and the Montague's; the impossible love between Romeo and Juliet; the trouble that Romeo has in Verona after killing Tybalt; Juliet has to marry Paris but she doesn't want and discusses bravely against her father; these make the story more interesting and it attracts the reader until the end."},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet (Shakespeare, Signet Classic)","review":"This book is one of the most interesting books I've ever read. Why do i say this? Because it has everything like: the romance, the passion, the hate and the death, which is a good way to inspirit the reader. Shakespeare knows how to fit several feelings in the same play.Romeo &amp; Juliet fall in love at first sight,but they could not stay together for a long time because their families were enemies from centuries ago, who were the Capulets and the Montagues. After few days, the were married secretly by a monk called Friar Lawrence. But WAIT! there was a problem...Juliet was gonig to marry a guy called Paris. As Juliet was also married with Romeo, she could not marry Paris. Because of this, Friar Lawrence offers Juliet to take a poison that will make her sleep very deeply, and by this was she was going to seem death, unfortunately, Romeo did not recieved this message. As a result, he thought tha Juliet was dead, and he commited suicide. When Juliet woke up, she realized that her lover was dead and she also commited suicide. Finally, both families realized that they should stay in peace.From our point of view, we think that this book was marvellous, but it should not ended up in this way."},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet (Shakespeare, Signet Classic)","review":"We think this is a very good book. It has a lot of elements that different people would like. It shows how the hate of some persons, can hurt others, and, in this case, kill each other.It helps people to accept the reality, and to see things how they really are.Although the book is very interesting, it may confuse younger lectors. Very young children may not understand it easily. And the vocabulary is, sometimes, very difficult to understand.There are quite a lot of details that may bore some readers, and a lot of characters, which may be confusing.So, in conclusion we recommend that just older people should read it."},{"Title":"Romeo and Juliet (Shakespeare, Signet Classic)","review":"Romeo and Juliet is a great book. It's an interesting book to read. It is about tragic love during Shakespeare's time. Their love was impossible because their families, Montagues and Capulets, hated each other. The book shows how a couple fights against everything for their love. It has a tragic end in which both, Romeo and Juliet die, because nobody accepted their love.You must have a very good English, to understand it. Because it is written in old English, what, in some parts may confuse the reader.Though for some moments it may be boring, because it gives too many details, we enjoyed the story, and we recommend it.It's definitely one of the best books written by Shakespeare."},{"Title":"Kinetic Art: Theory and Practice","review":"This is an older book now, but does seem to be the best source of information on early light and optical artworks.

For those who want help to rig another nation's vessel, like the Soliel Royal by Heller, or other models, this book will not be as accurate a guide.The book is more than about rigging, it also goes in depth on the contruction of masts and spars. This includes the ratios and dimensions based on the target ship's length. So this book is also good for scratch builders, or those who want to build hybrid plastic/wood models, but don't trust the original plastic pieces (e.g., the Soleil Royal's plastic masts are said to be too long).The book shows the variations of rigging as they evolved over different time periods. Also, it shows how the actual rigging compares with the proposed model rigging.I have not read the book all the way through, but the way it is organized leads it to be used more as a reference for specific rigging topics and ship areas. I found sometimes that the book was more about the actual rigging than helping the model builder. I have not found a description yet on how to sequence the rigging and other modeling construction. So this, and its focus on only English ships, prevents me from giving it 5 stars. Still, it is a great reference."},{"Title":"The Planet on the Table","review":"As a great fan of KSR's later work, especially the Mars trilogy, it was enjoyable to go back to this early collection of stories. They are variable - Mercurial grates a little as a whodunit and Coming Back to Dixieland may be more of a hit with jazz aficionados. But Ridge Running is where KSR shows the harmony that outdoor recreation can create between people and nature, and the historical themed stories showed the empathy with time and place that KSR showcased in Galileo's Dream. The book gets five stars simply because the empathy, credibility and symbolism of The Lucky Strike set a benchmark for alternative history stories."},{"Title":"Murder in Mimicry","review":"After a successful theatre run in London the comedy \\"Host of Pleasures\\" is moved to New York. Tessa Chrichton, a young actress who is married to an inspector of Scotland Yard, gets the opportunity of a lifetime when she is offered to fill in for the actress who played one of the bigger parts of the play in London. When the first repetitions start the company is victim to a bad case of misfortune: not only is Gilbert Mann, their new lead actor, a major pain in the arse, also the other members are reacting in very strange ways. A few weeks before the premiere one of the actors is stabbed to death in the street. Is it a robbery? Or is it murder? Tessa is convinced that the perpetrator is a member of the company and she is determined to prove it.Although it takes some time to read about the first murder, Anne Morice succeeds in keeping the suspense alive even without any mention of a crime. She even lets the main characters speculate about possible murder scenarios before the murder has occurred. This clearly sets the light-hearted atmosphere that is maintained throughout the whole story.Sadly enough the promise of a very complex and interesting denouement shatters to pieces on the last few pages. Anne Morice certainly fails to deliver a satisfying ending because she tries too hard to make sure nobody is going to foresee the conclusion and comes up with an ending that is quite unconvincing."},{"Title":"Is My Baby Alright","review":"Actually I had given my preview of this book just minutes earlier!

I was actually going to put it on my shelf for another time to read, but decided to open it to the first page. What a nice surprise. I was hooked from the first paragraph! It was difficult to put down. I do enjoy true crime, but I'm picky about my choices. I really enjoy books that are written with genuine honesty through the ups and downs of life. It gives a sense realism that rings true with straightforward writing. Great adventures and true stories are never easy when you live through them, and Speziale's story is truly exceptional.Speziale puts his life on the line to pursue Columbian drug cartels away from his family for extended lengths of time. This story puts you there with him, that's why it's so captivating and even frightening at times. I'm glad that he wrote this book because so many times the general public doesn't understand the sacrifices and heroism that members of law enforcement make to fight crime.If you enjoy true crime, this book will definitely be one of your favorites.-Jennifer Chase, author of thriller \\"Compulsion\\""},{"Title":"Without A Badge: Undercover in the World's Deadliest Criminal Organization","review":"I have to say this is the best book written in a while. I admire Jerry Speziale. The author in this book details the sacrifice officers make when going undercover. People seem to forget what the officers give up to make a difference and the risks they take. The sacrifice the families go through when there loved ones are taking a risk with their lives. I admire Jerry and the officers who took the time to make a difference. I definitely recommend this book. It is realistic and it isn't exaggerated."},{"Title":"Without A Badge: Undercover in the World's Deadliest Criminal Organization","review":"i dont like reading that much and it usually takes me a couple weeks to read this size book but i read it 3 days because once i started reading it i couldnt put it down.

It describes in depth the cali drug organization and how they brought it down. I recommend this book to anyone, i guarantee you will absolutely love it."},{"Title":"Without A Badge: Undercover in the World's Deadliest Criminal Organization","review":"From what seems like real danger in the begining while acting like a low life junkie ends up later looking like childs play. Later Mr. Bartone goes deep undercover and goes on to con and collect several thousand dollars in cash and drugs from key members of the Cali Cartel. Even though the situations that Speziale gets himself into are very dangerous you often find yourself laughing because he always finds a way to pin the drug bust on someone other than himself and even having the nerve to ask for retribution for his losses. Along the way he meets up with and learns from an interesting character named Paul Lir Alaxander who is as mysterious as he is savy when it comes to understanding the drug business. The book reads like a novel but the story is anything but fiction. If anyone takes the time to read this book it will be one of thier best reads ever."},{"Title":"Without A Badge: Undercover in the World's Deadliest Criminal Organization","review":"This is a very compelling book. It is the true story of NYPD undercover officer on \\"loan\\" to the DEA. This cop turned author, literally wrote the book on wiretaps. He risked his life to make major drug busts. However, by pursuing the Columbia drug cartels so aggressively, he also risked the lives of many innocent (and some not so innocent)others. He does not hide this fact in his book and he should be applauded for his honesty.If you, read a \\"true crime\\" book only now and again -- buy this book. If you read \\"true crime\\" regularly this will be one of your all-time favorites."},{"Title":"Without A Badge: Undercover in the World's Deadliest Criminal Organization","review":"Watching THE WIRE changed me and made me more sympathetic in general. I read this book as a result of THE WIRE even though I am not that interested in true crime or drugs. I am still not that interested but I feel that I should know. It's very straightforward and nondepressing despite the overwhelming odds. It's one man's story simply told although the details are sensational. Sheriff Speziale of Passaic, New Jersey was groomed by a real drug dealer from Brazil who also groomed a Brazilian entertainer known as Xuxa - this detail is not mentioned in Without a Badge but this book is written in a very pedestrian manner despite the extraordinary events and people involved. He spent many hours, days, months away from his family life. He was at the forefront of modern surveillance tactics. He is a friend to Bernard Kerik. And he is still making a contribution to fighting crime. Sometimes the antidote to the hopelessness of the fight is as simple as doing your own part and cleaning up your work environment and infecting others with a work ethic."},{"Title":"Without A Badge: Undercover in the World's Deadliest Criminal Organization","review":"This by far is one of the best books I have read in a while. I read it cover to cover in one day and I am a fairly slow and detailed reader. I could not put it down.

However, in the book he was certainly not shy about taking the lion's share of the credit for all that was accomplished.It appeared to me that in his recounting of the \\"facts\\", few others existed in other than a passing manner and in some cases, not at all. One noteable example of his failure to credit others involved is when he states that he lead the Vancouver, BC, Canada, DEA agents on the raid outside of Vancouver. Not without the involvement of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police he didn't.If there was arresting to be done, Jerry didn't do it as the DEA does not have jurisdiction in British Columbia, nor anywhere else in Canada for that matter. Getting a warrent or a phone tap is a tougher job in Canada than in the USA and Jerry would not even be able to approach the courts to obtain one, let alone serve it or put a tap in place.Good info, lots of credit to Jerry for his efforts, but way too much \\"me\\" and \\"I\\"."},{"Title":"Without A Badge: Undercover in the World's Deadliest Criminal Organization","review":"Jerry Speziale is a talented operative and his accomplishments in busting big-time drug smugglers can't be doubted. But the book put me off because of the tone. Speziale is really full of himself and has a massive ego. He seems more interested in trying to flash his bravado than in protecting the public. He did make great strides in worming his way into the workings of the Colombian drug cartels, but I wonder what it was worth. When you bust a major drug smuggling ring, another one will take its place. As long as there's a market for drugs, there will be people interested in smuggling them. As long as a country (like Colombia) is poor and has a high birthrate, there will be no shortage of criminals who will kill for pennies."},{"Title":"Without A Badge: Undercover in the World's Deadliest Criminal Organization","review":"The book is a great book to read plus I went to school with mr Jerry Speziale it was Exciting too read about him"},{"Title":"Without A Badge: Undercover in the World's Deadliest Criminal Organization","review":"I ENJOYED THIS BOOK VERY MUCH ESPECIALLY BEING A TRUE STORY OF A COP'S CAREER IN THE NYPD.

Some may already know that Ernest Thompson Seton and Baden Powell were associates who founded the Boy Scouts of America, with Seton being in charge of the American side and Powell in charge of the British side. Their eventual split was much about their different philosophies where Powell's was more about developing a good citizen and Seton was more about developing virtuous character. A problem Aristotle wrestled with as well, and is expressed in the aphorism, \\"What's popular isn't always right, and what's right isn't always popular.\\" Seton lays out his basic philosophy in this book whose main purpose is to develop individual autonomy and character in practical matters of outdoor life and empower the individual with knowledge and skills that will not only make him/her self-sufficient but also valuable to his/her community as a leader and example of individual virtues and skills. One of the ironies is that Powell's \\"Boy Scouts\\" was more popular in Seton's America, while Seton's \\"Woodcraft\\" movement was more successful in Britain than America."},{"Title":"The book of woodcraft,: With 500 drawings,","review":"A great book .Written 80+ years ago, still quite valid today.It made my grandson very happy.

Seldom has that stereotype been more fully fulfilled than in the three complementary RAND studies about a Palestinian state.Most striking is how the study treats Palestinians as subjects to be studied rather than as actors to participate in the creation of their own state. Blissfully divorced from any discussion about Palestinian social history or the kinds of communities its people have created, the authors happily catalogue advantages and disadvantages of different approaches to developing Palestinian cities. The education chapter, to be fair, does provide a decent account of the existing system, how it evolved, and what Palestinians want, but it is the exception that proves the rule.The analysis also has a head-in-the-clouds character. Chapter after chapter run through the authors' thoughts to create their model society for Palestinians without betraying the slightest hint of awareness that fifty years' experience with international aid has shown the disastrous effect of such an approach. The report makes only a slight passing references to the extraordinary amounts of aid pumped into the Palestinian territories after the 1993 Oslo accords-aid that led to corruption and social distortions which undermined the Palestinian Authority's ability to function effectively. The RAND authors would exacerbate the central problem of Palestinian society-a refusal to take responsibility for itself but instead blaming outsiders for all problems and expecting foreigners to rescue them. Also, a-Cadillac-rather-than-Chevy-approach pervades the study. The authors' point of reference seems to be the infrastructure and facilities characteristic of Europe and North America, not those of low-income, developing countries.Finally, the three volumes (Building a Successful Palestinian State, The Arc: A Formal Structure for a Palestinian State, Helping a Palestinian State Succeed: Key Findings)share the central organizing image of an \\"arc\\" formed by a high-speed railroad linking the major population areas of Gaza and the West Bank. There is the minor problem, as the authors note in passing, that roads rather than rail would be used for most freight shipments, for emergency services, and for those who can afford cars (including tourists, dignitaries, and the growing middle class the study envisages). A good road would connect the Palestinian urban areas at a much more modest cost than the billions the authors propose to pour into a railroad, which could quickly turn into a money-losing inefficient public enterprise of the kind which plagues many developing countries.Patrick Clawson"},{"Title":"Building a Successful Palestinian State","review":"It is wonderful to be idealists as the Rand people are. But their prescriptions for a viable Palestinian state fail to take into account the character of the Palestinian polity, the fundamental ideology which moves the society as a whole. That ideology whether it is advocated by Hamas or by Fatah( And its El Aksa Brigades) is an ideology of hatred and denial. The Palestinians have historically refused five major offers for a state of their own.They have responded time and time again to offers of peace by Israel, and concrete steps of concession by violence.As I write this it is close to two months after Israel withdrew its forces from Gaza. The Palestinian Authority has still not made any real effort to impose the rule of law on Gaza. The Palestinian media are filled with violent propaganda against Israel.What the people of the Rand Commission do not understand is that the Palestinians are interested in a state not alongside Israel but only in place of it. Whatever withdrawals Israel makes from territory this will not be enough for the Palestinians. And any Palestinian Arab state will not only be a tremendous danger to Israel but a source for increased Terror throughout the Middle East."},{"Title":"Queen Salote of Tonga: The Story of an Era 1900-1965","review":"Tonga is a unique place in being the only Polynesian kingdom to maintain its culture and government through the colonial period that brought down similar cultures in Hawaii and throughout the Pacific. Queen Salote adds to this uniqueness by being the ruling queen of Tonga in the first half of the Twentieth Century, an era dominated by male chauvenism. This story of her life and reign provides a wonderful view into the culture and history of this island kingdom. For papalangi (the Tongan word for people of Western society) this is not an easy book because there is a lot of Tongan names, geneology, and customs necessarily involved in the biography of their queen. Yet the very things that make it difficult also make it a rewarding book to read. What makes the book most enjoyable is the portrayal of this marvelous woman who ruled Tonga for almost 50 years. She ruled without use of force during a time of dissent from rival nobles and emerged one of the most revered leaders in Tongan history. She convinced her British advisors of her ability to rule and her island adversaries that their independence depended on her rule. I can recommend this book without reservation to anyone interested in women's studies, international biography, Polynesian history, or British colonial history."},{"Title":"Queen Salote of Tonga: The Story of an Era 1900-1965","review":"I sincerely recommend this book for all Tongans out there as well as those who are interested in discovering one of the most beloved Monarchs of our time. Queen Salote was not only a charismatic leader but also a progressive woman who brought Tonga to the forefront of the modern era by re-establishing its past. She restored the cultural pride of her people at a time when native cultures were suffering the ill-effects of Westernization.This book will be a sweet recollection for those who were fortunate to witness her reign, and it will be a source of inspiration for younger generations who are seeking to learn about their themselves.Truly, a remarkable book for a most remarkable person!"},{"Title":"Queen Salote of Tonga: The Story of an Era 1900-1965","review":"This book is greatly recommended for anyone who has some any remote interest in the personage of Queen Salote or who has any spark of interest in the region that she ruled.The author, Elizabeth Wood- Ellem, takes an intricate look into the life of one of the world's last remaining monarchies.

Not all the short pieces work (he seems to have a trouble composing endings that satisfy) but the title story is one of the most remarkable tales I've read since Richard Ford's near perfect \\"Rock Springs\\". Flight is a theme that recurs frequently--sometimes literally (planes and airships), sometimes more obliquely and metaphorically, people on the run, even it's from themselves. The book is blurbed by Stephen King and I note that in his \\"Acknowledgments\\" the author offers thanks to King's son, Owen (another young up-and-comer). There's a hint of nepotism there that makes me cross. Nonetheless, VOODOO HEART could mark the beginning of a distinguished career in letters. Mr. Snyder has all the makings of a author with a bright future...including, it seems, friends in high places."},{"Title":"Voodoo Heart","review":"The stories in Voodoo Heart are deranged, original, and totally mesmerizing.

However when I personally read a short story collection I rarely expect the stories to equal one another. That is, there are always stand-outs amongst the bunch. I guage the value of the collection often on only a couple of really terriffic stories.That said, the title story ('Voodoo Heart') is worth the price of admission, as they say.The analogies, imagery and lives of the individuals existing withing this story show great thought and nuanced observations. Even if some of the stories fall flat (not saying they do, just saying \\"what if\\"), the characters are interesting and well drawn.I can only hope Mr. Snyder will deliver a novel one of these days."},{"Title":"Voodoo Heart","review":"I first read Scott Snyder in 2002. The story was \\"Blue Yodel\\" in Zoetrope:All Story. Much like the man in that story, I started following the blimp of Scott's writing, eagerly picking up anything he'd written. In reading fiction, there are certain stories that stand out in my mind. And then there are some stories that make me stop and say, \\"Wow, this is why I read fiction in the first place.\\" Scott's stories are like that. His characters have been described as dark, but they are also normal in a lot of ways. They are the kinds of people we have known or the kinds of people we could have easily become had things not gone a different way. When the narrator in \\"Voodoo Heart\\" says:\\"Some kind of mistake has been made; you shouldn't be here with them. But they're keeping you here, keeping you from your real life, which is happening somewhere else, with someone more attractive, someone wilder; not in this car, not here, in this line of people waiting for a traffic light, listening to the tick, tick, tick of your own turning signal. And so you hate this person all of a sudden. You want to smash them. Because their face is a trap. Their face is a cage.But then someone behind you hits their horn and breaks the spell.\\"When the narrator says that, we can feel it, too. We have been there. The difference with Scott is that he can articulate it, that he isn't afraid to tell the truth about it. You will find truth in these stories. You will find intelligence. This book will make you take a second look at the world around you. You will know these dark, frustrated people because each of us has some of them on the inside. You will walk away from this book glad that you have had the chance to read it. It will remind you of the power of fiction and why stories will always be important. Scott has The Gift, folks. And VOODOO HEART is the real thing."},{"Title":"Voodoo Heart","review":"\\"Voodoo Heart\\" is aptly named. Voodoo, i.e., black magic of the soul, and while Scott Snyder's seven finely-told, diverse stories, are not black magic, they are of the soul and they are magic. No other writer I know could have parlayed these stories, seven hodgepodge tales of varied character-driven plots into a work of more readable pleasure as did Snyder. As one illustrious writer has already said, \\"Scott Snyder's \\"Voodoo Heart\\" just blew me away.\\" It will the next reader also. This is Americana, by Scott Snyder, and it is wonderful reading for the lucky person who finds themselves in possession of this small book, which is so big of heart.Mr. Snyder delves into the depths of his characters with a pickaxe. He reveals the inner, hidden fears and hope and beliefs of these make-believe people, and after reading it, you might wonder how it was that he could write with so much understanding . . . about you! This, then, is the key to Snyder's success and storytelling. He doesn't just tell a story. No, indeed, he takes removes normal reasoning, puts his speculative reasoning hat on, sets his sights on sometimes darker thoughts of the normal man and woman and writes about it.\\"Voodoo Heart,\\" debut fiction by Scott Snyder, is a must read."},{"Title":"Voodoo Heart","review":"Scott Snyder's Voodoo Heart is the most consistently excellent story collection I've read in years. There's enough invention, narrative complexity, and stylistic nuance in each of these stories to carry a novel. An ambitious novel. But as far-ranging and joyously strange as the collection is, barreling us (once almost literally) from the nostalgia of a lookout post over World War I-era Niagara Falls to the grit of back lot security at a present-day Florida pawn shop, these stories are all of a kind. With each, Scott Snyder succeeds in mooring us to the familiar, and only somewhere along the way do we make the exhilarating discovery that what he has anchored us to is itself floating freely in the sky.This is a book to give to anyone who has all but given up on the short story, which has too often left readers to choose between the gallingly precious and the maddeningly safe. Here's to hoping Mr. Snyder's collection rejuvenates a stagnating form as much as it did at least one long-suffering reader."},{"Title":"Voodoo Heart","review":"I picked up Voodoo Heart because I admire Snyder's work on American Vampire. I was interested to see Snyder's prose stand alone without a team of artists' aid. For the most part, I found myself quite pleased.Each and every one of Snyder's stories in this collection is original and very well written. They all utilize well-rounded characters that instantly attach to the psyche and schema. My only complaint, however, is that nearly half of them ended with no real sense of resolution. I don't necessarily mind vague endings, but several of the works - specifically \\"Blue Yodel,\\" \\"Happy Fish, Plus Coin,\\" and \\"About Face\\" - simply stopped. I got no real sense of finality and I certainly felt no satisfaction, especially because each of those stories in particular was amazingly engaging. I wanted so much more because I cared about those characters' plights in these tales, and I felt cheated without a stronger sense of culmination.With that being said, as much dissatisfaction as I suffered from the previous stories mentioned, other stories like \\"Wreck\\" and \\"Dumpster Tuesday\\" left me almost giddy they were so well constructed and resolved. And, for me, \\"The Star Attraction of 1919\\" was undoubtedly one of the most entertaining stories I've read in quite some time. These specific three stories truly blew me away they were so good. In fact, I keep thinking about them even though I finished the collection several days ago.I realize that others' opinions about these stories may vary distinctly from mine. That's the wonderful thing about literature, isn't it? Rest assured, if you read this short story collection, you will experience prose written at its finest and plots that will rivet you.~Scott William Foley, author of Andropia"},{"Title":"Voodoo Heart","review":"I read somewhere what John Lennon said about Elvis, that \\"before Elvis, there was nothing,\\" and it's a quote that popped into my head after I read Scott Snyder's amazing story collection Voodoo Heart, and in the back of the book discovered his acknowledgment to the spirit of the King. What's great about this collection is, oddly enough, the same thing that was great about Elvis: the way that Snyder takes disparate elements and mixes them together to come up with a brand new kind of story. Elvis did it by putting Hank Williams together with gospel and blues. Snyder does it by concocting a melange of wild fantasy, wonderfully-timed comedy, and a cast of profoundly self-destructive, but ultimately sympathetic narrators.In the brilliant title story, when Jake and his long-time girlfriend move into their dream home, a kind of creeping darkness begins to intrude on the protagonist's heart, and he finds himself inexorably pulled toward a senseless betrayal. The subtext of the narrative speaks to the inner traveling salesman in all of us, the voice that masks our fear of commitment by always promising that just up the road there's an even better deal to be had. The pieces of Jake's life - the wrecking yard where he works, the prison he obsessively monitors from his bedroom window, the empty rooms in his house - echo his ruinous compulsion, and the resulting tragedy is a work of fiction that is as compelling as anything you're likely to read this year.And that's just one story. The book never lets up, and taken as a whole, it's nothing short of revelation. After I finished, I went right ahead and read it again. Maybe this is how all those folks in Memphis felt when they first heard \\"That's All Right Mama\\" on their radios and kept calling in to hear it again and again. That's how I feel about Scott Snyder's Voodoo Heart - more please!"},{"Title":"Voodoo Heart","review":"When you get right down to it, a story should deliver on this very basic level: do we want to know what happens next? Scott Snyder delivers on that fundamental level in a very deft, almost disarming way--and on many other levels, too.Snyder's style is refreshingly crisp, as is his pacing. There's a lot to like in his vivid similies and descriptions, but what really deepened my appreciation was his thoughtful development of uniquely American themes. In the story \\"Wreck,\\" he weaves an archtypical romance of a Hollywood star for a likeable loner Everyman into a critique of America's star-struck obsession with physical attractiveness and the difficulty we have in truly connecting with other people.In \\"Dumpster Tuesday,\\" Snyder takes an absurdist ride through America's underbelly of ersatz \\"authenticity\\" via a New York hotshot's obsession with a low-end country-western star who stole his sophisticated fiancee's heart. Is this plausible? By the end of the story, I was thinking, hey, this is America; this kind of over-the-top, media-fueled stuff happens all the time. To capture the excesses of our culture--and the sadness buried beneath the zaniness--so entertainingly is no small feat.This collection will reward anyone seeking an entertaining read, and offer further rewards to those who delve into its explorations of deeply American themes."},{"Title":"Voodoo Heart","review":"I came to Scott Snyder via his fabulous work on comic books (Severed, American Vampire, Batman, Swamp Thing...). When I learned that his career had actually begun with a very successful short story collection, I picked it up. And I was blown away. The range and scope of topics that Scott imagines, the characters he creates, and the sentence by sentence beauty of the writing make this collection a sure bet."},{"Title":"Voodoo Heart","review":"Scott Snyder's first published work hits. The stories are full of real and memorable characters. The common theme among all, as Snyder has stated, is the fear of commitment. Snyder infuses the stories with this in different ways throughout. \\"Voodoo Heart,\\" the title story is the strongest in terms of getting its message across. If you've ever been afraid to commit to something, no matter how good it was to you, you'll relate to this tale strongly.All characters have unique motivations and desires and Snyder stays true throughout. The dialog is entirely believable. The endings are all ambiguous, but I think that's the point. He's writing short fiction and probably doesn't have the answers to the questions he's explored."},{"Title":"Voodoo Heart","review":"My only knock on Scott Snyder's short story collection, Voodoo Heart, is in the order of the stories. I enjoyed each one more than the preceding one, and I fear that some may give up on this charmingly disturbing book before they reap the rewards of spending more time with Snyder's fascinating, damaged characters.Snyder displays two strengths here. One is making his characters dear to the reader, especially so that once they display the fault that somehow limits or harms them it is all the more heartbreaking. The other is writing exceedingly well about oddities and asides. It marks his work as unique and vital; there are elements that add texture, are 'stranger than fiction' and yet fit perfectly into the lives with which they intersect. These strengths create stories that speak to human weakness and resiliency in unique and entertaining ways.I'd also mention that the missus (a better writer and reader than me) thought that Snyder struggled with the endings to these tales - a common fault in short stories. I didn't have a problem with it, and in fact found it to work really well with Snyder's themes...we drop into and out of these characters' stories, sometimes with but sometimes without a tidy resolution."},{"Title":"Voodoo Heart","review":"Scott Snyder's new story collection, VOODOO HEART, is in most places beautifully written. The male protagonists are always finding love in weird, unorthodox situations. In one story, a recluse young man courts a maimed female celebrity. He's the only one, it seems, who doesn't know her celebrity status under the facade of her scars. The story unfolds from there. In another story, a successful yuppie gives his life away to move to Florida and find a new love. The way Snyder deals with this protagonist's inner consciousness, is gratifying, and it makes the reader feel sympathy in the end.These stories aren't fancy, but the prose is well-worked out. Snyder knows his metaphors; he knows his style. I recmmend this book to anybody interested in reading the stories of a new, young talent: Scott Snyder."},{"Title":"Madelon","review":"Synopsis from back of book:Love for such a man could lead only to disaster! Beauty and innocence were rare qualities in a woman in the turbulent times of eleventh-century Spain, but Madelon del Rivas y Montevides possessed both. Although desired by many men, she had fallen in love with the dashing Valentin Maratin, the man who had saved her from being sold into slavery but who was a mortal enemy of her beloved brother. Loyalty to her family struggled in her heart with passion, but there was room for only one. And soon she found herself plunged into a world of lies, intrigue . . . and murder.Personal commentary:I found the backdrop of eleventh-century Spain somehow more interesting than the characters. The heroine was ok, I guess --- even her rather blind loyalty to her brother was rather workable --- however, neither she nor any of the other characters really caught my attention. Pass on this one."},{"Title":"Treasures of the Louvre: 30 Postcards","review":"I am an art instructor who works primarily to introduce pre-school and elementary age children to fine art. There are many fabulous reproductions found in this postcard book, such as Rembrandt's &quot;Self-Portrait in Front of an Easel&quot;, Raphael's &quot;The Holy Family&quot;, and Poussin's &quot;Rape of the Sabines&quot;. Any person would be delighted to receive almost all of these postcards as a means to hear from friends and family. As a teaching tool, however, the 30 reproductions as a whole did not contain the breadth of art forms or artists I was hoping to find.The introduction to the book led me to believe it would include samples from all over the world, however it's focus was European painters (particularly heavy on the late 16th and 17th centuries) and consequently no female artists were included. The majority of reproductions had similar dark color schemes (reds, yellows, and browns, and all of the 30 reproductions were paintings, no other forms of any kind.The selection is a fine selection of postcards for the sake of postcards. It is also a fine tool for teaching European art, but as a sample of world art it does not contain the variety I was looking for."},{"Title":"Treasures of the Louvre: 30 Postcards","review":"These cards feature images of pieces from the Louvre collection.

It puts together many pieces of the puzzle of life by examining ancient codices and unraveling mysteries in a way that helps us to better understand ourselves. More importantly, it offers a wealth of timely advice and answers many questions on how to save the human race from the falsehoods that have been perpetrated on us. Every word, sentence and paragraph seem to have been written with a sense of purpose and exactness in revealing their messages to the reader. As a result, it is one the most imortant books I have ever read, and I highly recommend it to all who are interested in what has brought the human race to this point and where can we go from here.Ray Garzone 11-02-05Author, inventor and artist, from NJ and SC"},{"Title":"The Golden Fleece Found","review":"After reading hundreds of books on speculative conspiracy theories, it is refreshing to find a non-fiction book with more action, more mysteries and more interesting turns than all of them combined. The uniqueness of this work lies in the fact that The Golden Fleece Found releases concealed library texts and ancient prophecies, which (thousands of years ago)recorded the answers we are yearning for. The question is: are there more fragments from the Library of Alexandra that survived? I must ask that question loudly because Muslim holy men are quoting ancient prophecies that speak of a not-too-distant time when the seals of religious codes will be broken. That time would be a season of testing and truth searching. In essence, God will issue a season of purging and truth. I believe this book is the beginning of that season of revelation. I also believe this book will bring Muslim, Christian and Jewish spiritual leaders together because it handles the main doctrinal sticking points with wisdom and clarity. It has to happen. \\"This book brings timely spiritual healing and much wisdom.\\"F. Fields. Mount Vernon, N.Y."},{"Title":"The Golden Fleece Found","review":"According to Professor Hillel, many Jews and Africans have the same DNA. This books shows prophetic scriptures, breaks codes in the Hebrew texts of the Torah and uses Solomon's Temple to give an interesting parent river of Abraham's seed. From the author's prophetic sketch, the Hebrew, African and Arabic branches of Abraham can compare their historic and religious soujorns to new spiritual maps that previewed their religious expressions and ancestral homelands thousands of years in advance.This books makes very strong arguments that the roots to military conflicts and ideological differences between all Abraham's seed are spiritual and not of God. The author supports his arguments with prior prophecies. Very very interesting book. The disclosure of the types of sinister organizations that engineered the Trans Atlantic Slave Trade and the Holocaust are very revealing indeed. \\"Fantastic Source of Missing Hebrew, African and Arabic Pre-History\\""},{"Title":"The Golden Fleece Found","review":"The Golden Fleece Found! is one of the most informative and clever books written in years. The book is written in a type of compound harmony. The author reveals some very interesting codices concealed in the Temple of Solomon and in the Hebrew Tanakh. By reconstructing the tributaries of different nations, he retraces ancestral courses to common source tributaries. By planting all seed of Abraham, including the Twelve Tribes of Israel and plotting their ancient battles over time, the seed of the victors and the vanquished can be painted over two mosaics: one of obedience and one of disobedience to specific documented decrees of Jehovah of Abraham, Isaac, Esau, Jacob, Jeshua, and Prophet Mohammed. For the first time, in one book, one can get a deeper understanding of today's conflicts and social ills. This book, with hard evidence, tempts readers to conclude that people and nations have three chords: a true cast or prophetic mould, an errant one, and a transitory one in between.

The research undertaken by the author in preparation for the book is extensive. The insights into the main religions of the world and detailed references to their spiritual teachings, helped me to discover the real reasons for the ills and wrongdoings in the world.Based on the the large amount of spirtual upliftment that the book gives to readers, there is no doubt that the author was spiritually guided to produce this work. For those seeking answers to their personal challenges and those faced by this civilization, those who are unsure of their own religious beliefs and spirituality, the Golden Fleece Found provides many clues and is highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Golden Fleece Found","review":"Since I read the \\"Celestine Prophecy\\" and \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark,\\" I felt that someone, somewhere has fragments from The Library of Alexandria.

It is not just 'another' book; the author's life is an authentic portrayal of the conclusions in the book, which is a stark constrast to the 'money driven' ambitions of most authors in this genre.

However the topic of how iron age people (especially the Celts) used artwork is no revelation to those of us who have kept current in modern Celt studies. That art objects for the Celts had multiple uses and lived multiple lives (the main thesis to this text) is nothing particularly new. Some of us are in touch with archeologists of active Celtic sites and when archeologists discover almost all of the bronze votive horses found have one broken leg and it is broken in a similar way you get the idea that this was a manipulation done with a purpose.Many people who study the ancient Celts may find much in this book redundant. All the same a good book."},{"Title":"Randolph Scott: A Film Biography","review":"Jefferson Brim Crow is an unadulterated fan of Randolph Scott, and his adoration of the great Western star is evident. Unfortunately, Crow is no film history scholar, and his book is really not much more than an impressively printed fan's scrapbook. Real biographical information is sparse, there are no substantial interviews of Scott's colleagues (of the four \\"interviews\\" in the book, two are one-sentence remarks and the other two are almost remarkably uninformative Q&A;'s of this sort: \\"Q: 'Do you know his birthplace?' A: 'I don't know.'\\").The vast majority of the book is a collection of photographs, many quite interesting, but scattered randomly without connection to the adjacent text, i.e., photos of Scott's late 1950s Westerns in a chapter dealing with his early romantic juvenile period. There is a filmography with minimal detail, and a long section consisting of photocopied newspaper articles about Scott, many of which are no more than publicity blurbs. There is virtually no criticism of any kind; even the worst Scott films are beloved of the author and no critical evaluation of Scott's acting skills is attempted. And whether or not one believes or cares one way or the other about the rumors and innuendo regarding Scott's relationship with Cary Grant, it is astounding to find the one purportedly objective book to focus specifically on Scott's career completely ignoring the fact that such rumor and innuendo had significant effect on Scott's career and personal life. Crow never mentions it. It would be perplexing were it not evident that this is a fan book, written by a fan who has no interest in anything beyond promoting adoration for his idol. It's quite a nice book to look at, barring the abundant misspellings and middle-school syntax. But a real Randolph Scott biography or filmography, one that is useful to serious students of American film, has yet to be published."},{"Title":"Randolph Scott: A Film Biography","review":"Since I was a kid, Randolph Scott has always been my cowboy-hero.

The Arctic episode. The Mexican episode.After the Arctic portion of it, the author follows the protagonist Roland Kruger into Mexico, and to further adventures so epic in scope that, as I say, it is almost like reading a second novel. Yet all remains so intertwined [woven], so intricately connected to the themes of displacement and alienation, peril and rescue. Love and loss.Kruger emerges a hero, but not a super-hero.There is not one aspect of this novel that is flippant. Nothing is under or over cooked. And let's face it, both things can give one indigestion.It is a thriller, a page-turner, a stay-awaker, but not a potboiler. Because it is based on actual events, it could be considered historical fiction, yet does not have the feel, in any typical sense, of the genre.The perfect blend of wild invention and bone-numbing reality.The white bird, an albino vulture, slouches in a niche in the canyon wall, like statuary in a satanic chapel. Its bald gory head is half turned away, as if feigning disinvolvement or anonymity. [p.320]Come on now!That is gorgeous, perfect, writing. And the whole entire book is that good.

The characters are all richly developed and they stay with you after you finish, like the story itself."},{"Title":"Afterlands: A Novel","review":"Three memorable historical figures are at the centre of this admirable historical adventure story, set in the last decades of the nineteenth century: Roland Kruger, German second mate hired for the 1871-72 Polaris expedition, his superior and increasingly his nemesis, Lt. George Tyson, and Hannah (Tukulito) Ebierbing, the first professional translator of the Inuit (then called Esquimau) language. During a heavy winter storm part of the Polaris crew is adrift in the passage between Greenland and Baffin Island. Canadian novelist Steven Heighton takes the historical accounts, Tyson's published book on the astounding six-months survival in the Arctic as the starting point for this extraordinary novel.Superbly framed by an insightful introduction to the primary characters, and an extensive concluding section consisting of the three \\"after-stories\\", Heighton re-imagines the endurance and survival of a motley crew of different nationalities and two Inuit families, nineteen in total, caught with few supplies on an ice floe of constantly decreasing size, and shifting directions. Not surprisingly, the desperate conditions of the group, confined to a small space and struggling under extreme circumstances deteriorate to infighting, violence and unreasonable and even dangerous behaviour. The situation is exacerbated by the growing personality clashes between Tyson and the German crew on the one hand and between Tyson and Kruger on the other. By stark contrast, Tukulito, who plays a special role in the hearts of both, Tyson and Kruger, and her husband Ebierbing exude calm, patience and diligence. With previous experience as guide, hunter, cook they are the overall survival experts without whom the crew would perish.With his outstanding aptitude for character development and for creating believable scenarios, the author juxtaposes selected excerpts from Tyson's book account (tweaked to suit the story line) with his own version of what might have happened during the six months on the ice. Inserting in addition several of Tyson's original field notes, thereby illustrating discrepancies in fact and tone to the book version, Heighton leads the reader to question Tyson's honesty and even his sanity. In fact, he presents the reader with two alternative realities, one increasingly diverging from the other. By contrasting Tyson's notes and book excerpts with his own version, the author gives a voice to different players, in particular Kruger, the only German with a inquiring mind and without strong allegiances. His behaviour, though, is seen with growing suspicion by the other crewmembers, including his and Tukulito's subtly courteous interactions.The central section - the survival in the Arctic - may appear somewhat drawn out and long. However, careful reading opens the reader's eyes not only to the extraordinary dangers of the venture and shifting behaviour patterns among the crew, but also to subtle personality changes in the central characters. Tyson's admission that \\"it is never too late to become the man you might have been\\" does not only apply to him. Kruger's search for the other person in him is an ongoing struggle.In fact, Kruger emerges as the most interesting and appealing character. He can be seen as a kind of moral compass for human behaviour in extreme crisis situations. His inner conflicts - between obeying authority and becoming a \\"patriot only to the truth\\", between duty and emotion - weave like a leitmotiv through his life and through the novel. Kruger has no longer country to believe in; he is \\"his own country\\". Still, the need to belong to a group cannot be easily suppressed. Committed to be understood as \\"a pacifist objector\\", his resolve is nevertheless fundamentally challenged by circumstances.In the novel's major \\"Afterlands\\" section that compellingly closes the frame around the Arctic events, Heighton follows each of his three central characters as they continue their lives. Each has to live through more periods of external or internal tests before inner peace can even be seen as a possibility. Where historical records existed the author weaves them into his novel, as he does for Tyson and Tukulito. In the case of Kruger, where nothing much was known about his life, except that he left for the south, Heighton creates a most captivating and believable \\"after-story\\". Kruger, deeply disillusioned, ends up in the Sierra Madre region of Mexico, hoping for peace and a quiet life. Nobody, however, can easily jump out of his skin. Neither can Kruger escape more conflict, misunderstanding and abuse. At this stage, Heighton introduces new characters into the novel to complement Kruger's portrait. Among these, he introduces Kruger's new nemesis: the mysterious, highly intelligent and multilingual \\"Padre\\". Despite his high ideals, fed by French philosophers and admiring the German example, the Padre is, in effect, not a church representative, but a colonel and \\"an army onto himself\\". His function is to suppress the indigenous peoples in the region, to \\"pacify\\" the region and eliminate all who resist. Kruger's encounters with the Padre are memorable. He is forced to engage with his counterpart's game of power, control and his interpretation of progress. It forces Kruger to question his long-held belief of himself as a person, committed \\"to do no harm\\". How will he respond?Heighton's exquisitely written novel is so very rich in narrative, characters and philosophical and moral questions raised that a review can only touch on selected essential points. In his most recent novel,Every Lost Country, the author further expands on some of these fundamental issues, yet set in a contemporary context. While at one level a captivating adventure story, Heighton's novel is also an invitation to the reader to reflect on the deeper questions that are so well woven into the story. [Friederike Knabe]"},{"Title":"Afterlands: A Novel","review":"The book opens with a simple image of surprising potency: a piano recital in Connecticut in 1876 at which a ten-year-old girl plays some pieces by Mendelssohn. The girl, known as Punnie, is the daughter of an Inuit couple (here called Esquimaux, in nineteenth-century fashion) who have been taken to England as curiosities, presented to Queen Victoria, and most recently brought back to the Arctic as members of a near-fatal expedition in which a group of nineteen starving people marooned on an ice-floe drifted for six and a half months before being rescued. The de facto leader of that group, Lt. George Tyson, has written a book about their ordeal and is popular as a lecturer. Punnie is thus a local celebrity, but the skills which the audience applauds are not those of her native culture. The theme of displacement sounds throughout Steven Heighton's magnificent book as a powerful undertow.Much of the novel is based on fact. In the central section, a 200-page description of the ordeal on the ice, Heighton quotes long excerpts from Tyson's actual book. But his main focus is on another character, a German immigrant named Roland Kruger, who served as second mate on the expedition. Once a minor celebrity also, Kruger becomes a pariah after the publication of Tyson's book, which portrays him as the villain of the piece, stealing from their precious stores, fomenting the men to near mutiny, and having inappropriate relations with Tukulito, Punnie's mother. But by skillfully contrasting excerpts from Tyson's journals with his published account, and setting both against his own storytelling, Heighton creates a shifting texture of overlapping narratives in which sympathies will change and change again.Though led by an American, the expedition is peopled by expatriates: four Germans, a German-Russian, an Englishman, a Swede, a Dane, a Negro cook, four adult Esquimaux, and several children. It is chilling to see how, once the normal lines of authority break down, the men revert to their former nationalism, dominated by the German contingent (though not including Kruger), and rehearsing the history of the next seventy years in miniature. But eventually conditions on the rapidly-shrinking ice-floe take precedence over everything, and the moral lines shift again in the light of several striking acts of individual heroism.Despite Heighton's excellent powers of description, this middle part can be tough going. But the most original part of the book is its extended final section, \\"Afterlands,\\" which traces the later story of Tyson, Tukulito, and especially Kruger, who moves as far away from the Arctic as possible, to live among the Sina Indians in the Western Sierra Madre of Mexico. Here, the theme of displacement takes on a different meaning as he (himself an emigrant from two countries in succession) encounters a kind of ethnic cleansing, as forces loyal to the central government or commercial interests attempt to exterminate the indigenous people from their lands. Kruger will find reserves of moral heroism that he did not know he had, and reach a kind of personal redemption. The ending of the book is as satisfying as it is sad.Though written earlier, AFTERLANDS has many similarities to Richard Flanagan'sWANTING, which also links a story about arctic exploration to another about an aboriginal girl (in this case Tasmanian) brought to London as a curiosity. I have long recognized the theme of displacement as a major concern in Australian literature -- both the displacement of the emigrants making a start in a new land, and the tragedy of the native inhabitants whom they displaced -- so it is not surprising to see it in Canadian writing as well. It gives the literature of both countries a profound moral sensibility. I am also in awe of the many Canadian novelists who are also poets -- Michael Ondaatje, Anne Michaels, and Jane Urquhart also come to mind -- and who not only write beautiful prose, but find in poetic structures new ways to organize a novel. This book by Steven Heighton is as allusive and thought-provoking as they come."},{"Title":"Afterlands: A Novel","review":"Heighton did a great job of vigorously researching a real historical event, and giving his own interpretation of it.

Riverside edition)","review":"English Traits does not equal Ralph Waldo Emerson's essays but has much that is worthwhile for Emersonians and several things that may attract others. Emerson trains his mesmerizing prose and piercing insight on England and the English from nearly every angle - not his most interesting or original subject but nonetheless intriguing. This is highly recommended for anyone interested in the subject, and Emersonians should come here after the more famous works.Emerson's thoroughness is impressive; his examination is so detailed that it is near-ethnographic. However, the book begins on a personal note, detailing his first trip to England just after he resigned his pulpit when he was unknown, had published nothing, and was unsure what to do. He recounts eminently absorbing visits with luminaries like Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Carlyle that anyone interested in them or the era will relish. These first-hand accounts have significant historical value, letting us see a side of these major figures that is rarely mentioned - not least because Emerson is as honest as ever and does not spare them. This section is so worthy that its brevity is regrettable; Emerson declines to describe visits to landmarks or his initial impressions of England and the English, perhaps because he had changed so much.Next comes a fairly detailed history and description of the English \\"race\\" that is notable mainly for historical context. Much of it has been disproved or highly questioned, and it is far from politically correct by today's standards, but this makes it all the more interesting. Anyone wondering how a representative mid-nineteenth century Anglo-American saw the land of his ancestors need look no further.Some may find this trying, but I encourage them to persevere, because the bulk of the book is far more interesting; Emerson examines his subject much as he had done with abstract ones like self-reliance, experience, and love. He begins with a basic rundown of England itself: historical, geographical, economic, etc. Emerson also looks at English institutions like the church, colleges, etc.; his most interesting observations here are about the class system, particularly the upper class, and the political system. He describes them on their own terms and in contrast to other countries, including of course America. This has merit, but several seemingly obligatory topics are unfortunately missing. Emerson says almost nothing about royalty and, a fascinating Stonehenge section excepted, neglects to treat landmarks. He also mentions in passing meeting many notables - Dickens, Tennyson, Thackeray, etc. - out of which notable anecdotes could surely have been made. In any case, though, the real meat is his analysis of the English people, including topics like manners, character, speech, and habits. Emerson was a keen observer, and his foreign status gave a perspective the English could not have had, yielding many noteworthy insights.Perhaps surprisingly, given that Emerson was arguably the first truly American writer, vigorously urged cultural independence, and otherwise preached self-reliance and originality, he reveals himself to be a pretty thorough Anglophile. Maybe this should not surprise; he was after all a New Englander of English stock, and England was the world's most powerful nation. It is indeed generally hard to deny the basic truth of even his most rhapsodic compliments, but current readers - especially Americans - may grow frustrated and impatient with his constant glowing descriptions. He has also been recently taken to task for what some see as a sort of unintentional racism. However, those willing to continue will see that he eventually gives substantial criticism, particularly in regard to religion and literature; he also lambastes England's general conservatism, zeroing in on several specific abuses. All told, his honesty and willingness to criticize were quite remarkable and in many ways as instructive as ever.Such a book would generally be of little more than historical interest, but Emerson's ever-strong writing raises it; anyone alive to his style will find much to love. Perhaps more importantly, it now has considerable value for a reason probably no one could have foreseen - mid-nineteenth century England was in essentially the same position as present-day America. It was the world's most powerful nation, the military and economic superpower whose culture and language had global influence. Emerson was clearly in awe as few could help being but also deft in noticing that England was near its apex or had already passed it; great as it was, the future did not belong to it. He vividly describes how many centuries-old institutions were rapidly crumbling and prophetically notes that England would become more and more like America, to whom the future belonged. This came to pass, perhaps letting blue blood Americans annoyed by the Anglophile aspect breathe a proverbial sigh of relief - or even have a laugh at England's expanse. In truth, though, they should be more cautious, because the book has much to teach them. Many traits then dominant in England - arrogance, insularity, disregard for outside opinion - are now preeminent in America, and America may fall from the top just as England did if not careful. A close reading of this may go a long way toward preventing that, and Emersonians will want the book in any case. Like all geniuses, Emerson both epitomized and was ahead of his time; full of subtleties beneath an already appealing surface, this is an overlooked exemplar of that Emersonian paradox."},{"Title":"English traits (Works of Ralph Waldo Emerson.

The style iscasual and relaxed, which is a pleasant deviationfrom typical pedantic grammar reference materials.Though extensive and in-depth (22 chaptersand 8 appendices totaling over 550 pages), the text isnot intended to be exhaustive. Topics were restrictedto include only high frequency areas typically mosttroublesome to teachers and L2 learners alike.Eighteen of the chapters focus on grammar-exclusivethemes that include such topics as adjectives, articles,modal auxiliaries, passives, prepositions,subjunctives, verb tenses, and word order. Threechapters are primarily discourse related.Autosegmentals are analyzed in chapters 15 and 18;the former chapter covers word and phrase stresswhile the latter focuses on sentence-level intonation.Chapter 21 is entitled &quot;ELT 'Waifs'&quot; and deals withrelaxed pronunciation, intensifiers, and commonphrases seldom included in instructional texts.Phrases that add so much to the flow of conversationalEnglish such as &quot;a great deal of&quot; or the frequent useof the suffix &quot;-ish&quot; (childish, pinkish, late-ish, aroundeight-ish) can assist the L2 student in understandingcommon discourse. In the final chapter, the authornotes the changing nature of the English languageand predicts upcoming transformations that are likelyto occur.Each of the 21 instructional chaptersconcludes with &quot;Teaching Tips,&quot; which supplyinstructors with resources that allow students toflesh out the content material through numerousactivities designed for pairwork and/or small groups.These activities alone make the text a valuableresource. Scattered throughout many of the chaptersis an aside called &quot;Troubleshooter.&quot; Thisinformational box interrupts instructional sectionswith pertinent explanations in anticipation ofstudents' questions. Another strength of the text isthe salient feature of the inductive method ofinstruction. For example, situations are oftenpresented in the form of dialogs so that readers canobserve the grammar point contextually. Byhighlighting selected portions of the dialog andthrough provocative questioning, the writer modelsa lesson requiring the reader to elicit a rule or tofigure out why a certain construction is used.Employing this critical thinking strategy leads todiscovery, and ideally, to student ownership of thatspecific grammar point. At a minimum, adding thismethod to one's teaching repertoire will supplydiversity to classroom instruction.Finally, the eight appendices cover a rangeof subject matter that includes strategies, games,pronunciation, spelling, and further elaboration onpreviously covered material. For instance, the authorhas provided an excellent outline in the secondappendix that uses the mechanical, meaningful/manipulative, and communication approach inrelaying content material. Examples abound usingcloze procedures, slot substitutions, and incompletedialogs.Many ESL professionals rely upon collegecomposition reference manuals for consultation.Often these tools provide ESL-specific material onlyin the form of an appendix or sub-section. Thedetailed instruction found in The ELT Grammar Book,however, is designed exclusively with the L2 learnerin mind. Its primary limitation is found in theauthors' intentionally selective subject matter whichmay leave instructors searching elsewhere forparticular topics not addressed. Regardless, whetheran instructor's method of infusing grammar iscomprised primarily of explicit discrete-pointinstruction or incidentally through a morecommunicative approach, the information, activities,and strategies offered in this text will provide ahandy reference tool for teachers of L2 students invarious levels and contexts.Tom Bellomo taught EFL in Spain for five years,ESOL in New York for five years, and has beenteaching EAP coursework in Florida since 1997.

This is not a traditional, dry grammar book, filled with every rule of correct English usage. Those of you who know Richard Firsten's publications, such as &quot;Troublesome English&quot; and the &quot;Real Life Grammar&quot; series, will not be surprised that &quot;The ELT Grammar Book&quot; is really a teacher's guide to the most common, and most difficult to explain, points of English grammar.The book devotes a chapter to 20 of the most common areas of grammatical difficulty, such as word order, articles, subjunctives, and direct object companions. Each area is dealt with in the following three ways:The Socratic Approach - whereby readers are encouraged to observe, think about, and make conclusions about the point. This technique enables exploration of the grammar in a way which is much more meaningful in the long run. Instead of committing rules to memory without really understanding why they exist, this method helps you understand the point so that you can more easily explain it to your students.&quot;Troubleshooters&quot; - These are helpful insights that occur in most chapters, which focus on the points which are likely to cause problems for students because of language interference or other reasons.&quot;Teaching Tips&quot; - These are activities, exercises, and games designed to help teachers make the teaching of grammar more enjoyable.Towards the end of the book there are a couple of interesting chapters which you would not expect to find in a grammar book. The first of these deals with &quot;ELT Waifs,&quot; words or phrases or phenomena which occur in casual language usage, but are not usually explained or codified, such as the use of words like &quot;over,&quot; &quot;that,&quot; and &quot;quite.&quot; Even more surprising is the final chapter, which attempts to predict how we might expect English grammar to develop in the future based on its past development. I may not happen to agree with some of the predictions, but their inclusion displays the Mr. Firsten's obvious interest in the life of languages.In addition to the chapters, there are very useful appendices that explain points in more depth and even cover helpful rules for spelling and pronunciation.Although I have been teaching English for over 15 years, I discovered a new way of understanding complex grammatical points in nearly every chapter, and more importantly, I found ways of explaining these points in simple terms without having to resort to academic language.

That has double meaning for this book. It is a short compact look at a specific period in two women's lives and an exploration about how they learn to value the basic things in life.Diana Forrester is the flight attendant on a commuter plane that crashes off-course in the wilderness of Wisconsin. Only two passengers have survived and one of those shortly wanders off convinced that he can find help. Diana finds herself in a blizzard trying to take care of herself and the other passenger Casey Morgan. Casey is a complete city girl from Chicago and can only focus on the fact that she is missing out on closing the biggest deal in her career. It quickly becomes clear to both women that, if they are to survive, they are going to have to find a way to live in the wilderness until help can arrive. The book alternates between showing the two women coping with their predicament and scenes of Diana's father who keeps trying to rally a rescue team long after everyone else gives up hope of the women being alive. Some of the truly interesting passages are about what can be used to survive in the wild. For instance, how many of us know that a very nourishing tea can be made from pine needles?This book is a little gem; the type of book that might be overlooked because it is not being produced by one of the better known publishing companies. That is unfortunate because it is an excellent read. The book is almost more of a vignette than a novel. Very little is revealed about the lives of the women before this incident, but what is shown is just enough. The words are very spare, but each one is packed with meaning. Each scene is condensed down to the bare minimum that is necessary to move the story forward; yet, the reader feels like she knows both women completely. Normally, a book this short leaves gaps, unanswered questions, about the characters. That is not the case here. When you reach the end you get a very satisfied feeling that you have experienced something special.This is Constance Irvin's first book. If it is any indication of future work from her, she is a writer you are going to want to get to know."},{"Title":"The Seasons of a Heart","review":"There were things I liked about this book. I was looking forward to the details of survival in the wilderness, having grown up reading books like \\"Hatchet\\", etc. And I have to admit that my favorite parts of this book were the details of flying a plane, search and rescue, and some of the specific tasks Diana undertook in order to assure that she survived...oh, and I guess Casey could live as well.But as far as this being a quality novel, it just wasn't. The characterizations were awkward and not strong and the women came across as a collection of ideas and contrivances about how people should be, and not very sympathetic people at that. For someone who professed love very early on, Diana didn't seem to care very much about Casey. And she would often bust out these completely random whole phrases, dropping words of wisdom, and talking like people just don't. It was jarring.There was very little inner life or emotion expressed or considered by either character. For instance, Diana thinks about how she's strangely drawn to Casey initially, and that one observation basically has to carry the emotional journey for the foreseeable future. The reader was left to fill in almost all of the character motivations and try to figure out what they were feeling based on their actions, or some random declarations and thoughts. Most of the supporting cast was one charicature or another.The basis for this book was a good, interesting idea, but the execution was unpolished and showed enormous inexperience on the part of the author."},{"Title":"The Seasons of a Heart","review":"A disappointing read for someone who enjoys serious romance. Explicit details on how to catch a fish or build a fire in the wilderness, but the romance consisted of just telling the reader they made love.

The contrasts of these two characters work really well together. Unfortunately for me that was about it. The attraction these two start to feel for each other does not translate to the pages at all. It springs out of nowhere and I just don't see it. There is no inner monologue that leads into the attraction, and nothing in their interaction that really supports it. The writing really left me on the outside of things, looking in through a window covered with tarp. Or something like that.There is a subplot of the search for them that includes deceit etc., but that didn't really grasp my attention either.One thing that really bugged me was the ending. The back cover blurb ends with the dramatic question whether a love found under such extreme circumstances can continue in reality. The book doesn't answer this question. Unfortunately that part would have been the one I was really looking forward to. I really would have liked to have read about the possible conflicts that were alluded to towards the end of their wilderness life, so I feel a bit cheated.I'm torn whether I think the story would have been better had some sections been expanded... I couldn't get a grasp on the characters, or lost whatever grasp I had in the beginning once the story progressed. It's a really short book, 145 pages, quick read on the commute, but really nothing to write home about."},{"Title":"The Seasons of a Heart","review":"A solid book overall, SEASONS OF A HEART is a good attempt by first-time author Constance Irvin. The book shows some promise, but this reader was less than amazed at the final product.The story centers around a plane crash in southwest Wisconsin in the middle of winter. Only three survive the crash, and ultimately only two survive the experience. Diana, an airline attendant, shows remarkable skill as an outdoorswoman. Casey, one of the passengers, is the typical helpless female. There is also a family of wolves that seem to protect the women.Diana and Casey are generally likable, but show very little depth of personality. It's hard to imagine either of them outside of the situation they're forced to endure. In fact, the most well-developed character is Diana's father, Martin, a man full of passion as he searches for his daughter and brings the man responsible to justice.The timeline is a little unbelievable, as they are alone in the wilderness for several months. I live near this area. There is no way imaginable, even in the winter, that living people who make fires and smoke would remain lost in this area for months. The story seems to fast forward in places (sometimes by weeks) and is stagnant in others. The wolves don't make a lot of sense to the story, but are a similar to the squirrels in Blayne Cooper's ROAD TO GLORY as a literary device. Top this off with an erratic transition between the women in the wilderness and the rescue team in civilization, and you have a less-than-stellar book.If Irvin had made the timeline more fluid and realistic, had given the characters more dimensionality, had given Casey more of a backbone, and done a few other minor things, this would have been a really good story. As published, it is okay, but could have been much better."},{"Title":"The Seasons of a Heart","review":"The story is good as well as the plot. I love adventure,it was a little thin on survival tech skills to be believable. You can feel the desperation and the love grow. Overall a very good read."},{"Title":"The Seasons of a Heart","review":"The Seasons of a Heart is about two women, and a man who set out in a small plane and crash. One of the women, Casey, and the man, Urbano, set out to find help, leaving Diana alone. Diana is a survival expert and knows she can survive despite the encroaching weather and the abandonment of her companions. During their trek to find help, Urbano disappears and Casey finds him dead from hypothermia. Casey makes her way back to the wreckage of the plane and Diana. Together they try to brave the winter and survive. Eventually they find an abandoned cabin and Diana has become quite the huntress, making sure they have something to eat. Casey has learned to eat things that she isn't used to and amidst trying to survive, they find they are attracted to one another and a romance develops. Meanwhile, Diana's father has been trying to find the downed plane and his daughter, whom he assumes is dead, but deep in his heart, he feels she may be alive given her survival training. By the time he finds them, Diana and Casey are living fairly well, making do with what they have and enjoying their romance and isolation. Casey makes the decision to leave with the rescue team, but not for long, as she can't seem to get over Diana. The book ends with Casey coming back to the cabin where Diana has made a home, and they get back together. All in all, a good book. The survival aspect was very well written and informative. The romance was sweet. Irvin does a good job."},{"Title":"The Seasons of a Heart","review":"A supurb book of caring and love. Tastfully written.

Watching two mature women fall in love while suffering hardships few of us could imagine was endearing.

Beautifully written. There are several sub-plots also relating to the nature of enduring family relationships.Great read!"},{"Title":"The Seasons of a Heart","review":"The premise of this novella explores the concept that the heterosexual world may know in \\"Swept Away\\": does romance between two people removed and isolated from society survive that society when they rejoin it?The book is bascially solid writing and, though not commpletely seamless, it carries the story along with little distraction into a plausible scenario that becomes an arena for deep human feeling and conflict. In that department, the writer has done the work and paid the dues of genuine work that results in uncontrived fiction worth reading. The writer also resists getting into the easy-button contrived effect of graphic descriptions, ultimately making for a more genuine exploration of the characters and their inner conflict.Of note is the way this novella takes a reader into the minds of the very human aspect of love, sexuality and vulnerability, transcending moral and judgemental reactions that hamper understanding. If sweet, it is realistically so.The Season of a Heart stands as an illustrative example of authentic literature available to the public through POD."},{"Title":"The Seasons of a Heart","review":"A sweet survivalist lesbian romance. A lovely light read with some deeper \\"coming-to-terms-with-gayness\\" themes mixed in. Survivalist and airplane lore also adds extra flavor. Quite enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Seasons of a Heart","review":"I agree with the review of too innocent. Didn't really get the connection between characters. Being born & bred Wisconsinite - I really wanted to like the book, however I found it unrealistic, for instance in one paragraph the character is getting a bad gash sewn together, then then next text is that it is healed in a few weeks. Also, the 'wild' area is not that remote maybe 50 yrs ago, or maybe the UP just maybe but not the area she talked about. Theres people there all the time now. Romance it was not. Survivalist but not the raw emotion romance that can come from surviving."},{"Title":"Understanding Fiber Optics","review":"The Book arrived quickly.

The fact is that this is what happens in the US because when the Bell system first installed those packet switching nodes for the packet switched networks around the US. They adopted 56 Kbps clear channels for interconnections, prior to the standard protocol being set up by the international standards bodies.When the international standard called SS7 was finally completed, AT&amp;T adopted it; however, the legacy of 56 Kbps clear channels remains in the US.So this is what happened in the US, while the rest of the world is using 64 Kbps clear channels.FYI."},{"Title":"Understanding Fiber Optics","review":"As someone who works in the financial field that had to get up to speed on fiber optics, I purchased this book, &quot;Introduction to Fiber Optics&quot; by Crisp, and &quot;Fiber Optic Reference Guide&quot; by Goff.

Skip buying this from Amazon directly and try one of the private sellers."},{"Title":"Understanding Fiber Optics","review":"C.H.L.'s attempt to justify Hecht's misinformation is a bit weak1. The G.711 recommendation is probably 30+ years old and the US telephone companies have adhered to it since ratification. In fact, G.711 simply confirmed what the US and European companies were already doing so the US telephone companies were using 64Kbps for voice even before G.711.2. Packet switching has nothing (or very little) to do with voice. Voice is carried via circuit switched channels.3. When voice is carried via a digital channel in the US (at 64Kbps, I might add), one form of signaling \\"steals\\" the low order bit of an 8 bit voice sample of each sixth sample of the 24 channels on a DS-1 (AKA T-1) circuit. Because of this, a data channel carried over one of these 64Kbps channels is only able to provide 56Kbps. Maybe this is where Hecht went wrong.But don't buy or not buy Hecht's book based on this one error (in the big scheme of things it's fairly small). The real problem with the book is that it just doesn't do a jood job of explaining optical communications. A better defense of Hecht's book might be that Hecht was attempting to write about all of the uses of optical fiber and not just communications."},{"Title":"Understanding Fiber Optics","review":"The fourth edition of this book is a product of many years of practical experience and trials of previous editions. I always wondered if more information than just reader's level as beginner, intermediate and advanced should be printed on the technical books. What you are looking for in a book and level of satisfaction depends on your involvement in that area of expertise. Please stay with me while I try my thinking on this book. If you are already an expert working in Optical Engineering field this book is not a research paper. Probably you need Warren J. Smith's book Modern Optical Engineering. If you are a student learning about Fiber Optics this book has enough information and practice questions to be qualified as a good text book, but may not be enough for your Graduate School research thesis. If you are like me, a practicing Network Engineer or technician, this book provides everything you need to know and more than enough information. It is written in an easy to understand style, and chapters are in a perfect sequence and length. That's why I am rating it 5 Stars."},{"Title":"Understanding Fiber Optics","review":"This is an excellent introduction to the technology of fiber optics for the non-technical person.

Transport Phenomena by Bird Stewart & Lightfoot was the standard then. Chemical engineering students had a heck of a time relating to the material. As a subject, transport phenomena is a lot of math applied to practical problems. Fledgling chemical engineers have tended to need a primer that is more grounded in practical matters.Introduction to Transport Phenomena provides a matter of fact, grounded (as grounded, I suppose, as theoretical chemical engineering can be) approach that the student and the old fud looking for a refresher alike can use. A word of caution for the person looking for the one book to answer all Transport Phenomena woes: This subject is taught throughout academia, regardless of the specific text, by providing several examples that are intended to show the reader the correct approach and 'tricks' for a particular set of problems. Although Introduction to Transport Phenomena by Dr. Thomson is a great primer, and Transport Phenomena by Bird Stewart & Lightfoot is the \\"Bible,\\" I suggest that one maintains a 'living library' of reference material that helps understanding in this subject area. I'm currently saving for Transport Phenomena: Equations and Numerical Solutions by Esteban Saatdjiian, to round out my reference materials on the subject.In conclusion, Introduction to Transport Phenomena by William Thomson is a very well written, easy to follow primer that provides the reader with excellent guidance and understandable reasoning for the approach to solving most transport phenomena problems. This book will readily show the correct approach in solving the vast majority of transport phenomena problems the chemical engineer tends to need solved in industry.Side note: All books have typos and a few missed errors. Dr. Thomson is a professor at Washington State University. I found the errata for Introduction to Transport Phenomena there."},{"Title":"Introduction to Transport Phenomena","review":"As a student chemical engineer I found the book somewhat helpful, but not really.

I now need the book and amazon apparently takes 1 to 3 months to ship this book...aka I'll get the book at the end of the semester."},{"Title":"Introduction to Transport Phenomena","review":"I have had Dr. Thomson as an instructor and have used his book for three separate classes. I find the book difficult to follow at times. The end of chapter problems are confusing and seldom can be completed by following the material covered in the text.

Something unique about this book is that it is written from the perspective of a non-Korean who has struggled to learn Korean himself. This is an advantageous perspective because he understands the hurdles we English-speakers have in approaching the language's structures and deviations. The author really did an excellent and thorough job. He even included the Chinese characters for those of us who would one day like to read Korean like an intelligent adult and not just a 1st grader. I would recommend this for self-study and for instructors trying to teach Korean to those of us who just don't seem to get it with other publications."},{"Title":"Roadmap to Korean","review":"Roadmap to Korean is a great book explaining the languistic structure, culture, and history of Korea(n). Richard Harris has done a great job explaining the most important parts of the language that no other book has bothered to cover. Harris explains the troubles that English speaks will have with the language and specific differences are explained in an English speaker's point of view. I have read over this book many times since I have been studying Korean and each time I get something else out of it. It is a definite buy for anyone wishing to learn the language or just want to simply learn what it's about. It makes an excellent reference for verb conjugations, phrases, numbers, and much more. If you want to learn Korean, this is the book to start with. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Roadmap to Korean","review":"New to Korean language and culture and not really sure where I should start from, a friend recommended Harris' &quot;Roadmap to Korean&quot; last month and I haven't looked back since. As I prepare to work in Seoul this coming fall, I feel so much more ready and educated to work and live in Korea after reading through my &quot;Roadmap&quot;. Moving from Confucianism to the Chinese Zodiac all the while infusing easy-to-understand explanations of the workings of Korean, this book is my bible as I prepare for my Korean experience. Thanks, Mr. Harris!!"},{"Title":"Roadmap to Korean","review":"This is an absolutely ESSENTIAL item for ANY student of the Korean language, especially those whose native language is English. Why? 1) It bridges a gap no Korean educator has ever thought (or perhaps known how) to address or even acknowledge. 2) It does the job superlatively well.While Korea has no shortage of well-meaning and skilled teachers of their language (including several I've had) they invariably fall short in one key area: understanding exactly what obstacles a foreigner faces in learning Korean, and how to help us past them. (In fairness, Korea is still relatively new to the game of exporting their language and culture on a major scale - compared to, say, America or Japan.) Richard Harris turns out to be just the guy for the job; a long-suffering yet enthusiastic student of the language, and a straightforwardly engaging writer to boot.Aside from drastically different grammar, most of the roadblocks turn out to be conceptual - areas of culture and living where Koreans and non-Koreans simply think differently, in ways that defy literal translation. (this is a language in which one might ask \\"How are you?\\" by saying \\"Have you eaten?\\" or \\"Where are you going?\\") It's in the illustration of these tricky areas that Harris truly excels; anyone who's spent much time in Korea, such as yours truly, has stumbled into more than one of these minefields!Bottom line: if you're learning Korean, BUY THIS BOOK. It'll save you an incalculable amount of time and frustration, and enlighten you about a lot more than just the language in the bargain."},{"Title":"Roadmap to Korean","review":"This book has a lot of good information that will probably be helpful in learning Korean, but if you are looking for in depth explanations of grammar systematically, this is not the book for you. I suggest you find a book used in a classroom. The author gives lots of insight into the culture and history of the language and points out a few of the barriers that he had to overcome, but all in all, this book did not help me actually work with the language. He explains the problems that you will have, but he does not actually introduce the grammatical conundrums that bring about those problems. If you have a grammar book to go along this one, that might be a winning couple, but I do want people to know the limitations of this book. It is not a systematic and comprehensive Korean Grammar. You'll have to find that somewhere else."},{"Title":"Roadmap to Korean","review":"Roadmap to Korean by Richard Harris takes a look at learning Korean from a historical, cultural, and pop linguistic point of view. There are twenty-two chapters, five sections and an extensive appendices that combined make this a book that the Korean language student will find invaluable. The value doesn't come from teaching you Korean as that is not what Harris is trying to do, but rather from providing a new perspective and insight into learning Korean and finding avenues to overcome obstacles and difficulties...(...)"},{"Title":"Roadmap to Korean","review":"As a beginner in Korean, I was looking for something more than a dictionary, but with the understanding of an Englishspeaking person who has learned Korean. This is it! Richard Harris explains the joys and pitfalls of learningKorean in an entertaining way. It's just shy of having a conversation with the author. Very enjoyable learningexperience!"},{"Title":"Roadmap to Korean","review":"I bought this book along with 3-4 others in order to start learning Korean on my own. Although it does have an extensive list of \\"useful phrases,\\" conjugations, and vocab, it is NOT (in my view) a workbook or a step-by-step instructional guide to learning to read/write/speak Korean. I saw this more as a very successful attempt to explain the language/cultural pitfalls that a non-Korean can and will face, while also teaching the basics of Hanguel, grammar, culture (current and background), and conjugation.Listed are two, of the many, \\"simple\\" things he pointed out in the book that my Korean friends never realized (because it was natural to them) until I asked them to verify, which they did, surprised that it never occurred to them. 1) With time, hours are counted using Korean and minutes/seconds with Chinese Derivatives; 2) there are 23 ways to say \\"Do you know?\\" IN THE SECOND PERSON, IN THE PRESENT TENSE, depending on who you are speaking to. This, along with the countless examples of insightful personal experience, made it both humorous and extremely practical.Although I have already read through it once, I am going through it a second time (now that I have a basic understanding of Korean) and continuing to learn and pick-up tips that I didn't understand the first time though. I foresee multiple readings through this book in the months/years to come."},{"Title":"Roadmap to Korean","review":"This book gives tons of great advice on how to learn Korean. If it were up to me, it would be standard issue for students studying Korean at the Defense Language Institute in Monterey, CA."},{"Title":"Roadmap to Korean","review":"There's a lot of resources out there for students of Korean. Some are written by Koreans for he benefit of foreigners. Most of said resources are laughably bad while few and far between are quite good. On the other hand, some are written by foreigners for the benefit of other foreigners. Most of said resources are either for learning slang or are simply MIA. An exceptional resource is Richard Harris's Roadmap to Korean. Interestingly enough, his previous effort (Faces of Korea) is also hard to find and also very valuable.Don't let the textbook-like cover fool you because this is a resourceful heart-to-heart conversational with you and the author. Harris has compiled his personal notes, stories, charts, tips and tricks all into this neatly presented package. Imagine a super-awesome blog written on paper. It's a very light read and written casually; almost spoken-like. The author has lots of advice to give whether you've never studied the language before or have been for years. There's some history and culture as well as some grammar pitfalls and speaking taboos that are enough to learn from as well as laugh at. His perspective is golden and there's a lot to learn from his book, make no mistake.I don't have much to say about this book that hasn't already been said. It's a great guide. The only thing I want to criticize is the author's plea to learn hanja. Although I also strongly encourage learning hanja because of its usefulness, he does little in terms of pointing one in the right direction of how to actually study hanja. A minor gripe for such a fabulous study guide. Yes, this book is enough to warrant me saying the word \\"fabulous\\".I would also like to point out that this book is the book I should have written. If I ever had aspirations to publish a \\"Guide to Study Korean\\" book, this would have been it.

I am the type of person that needs to know the WHYs and not just the HOWs of learning something. This can very, very hard with languages sometimes...Think about it, as a native english speaker, do you know everything about the english language? Can you recite every rule of the english language, spell every word correctly, etc? NO. Neither can I, but I can speak english fluently...SO, when I ask my Korean friends for help, it is the same with them. They don't always understand WHY something is the way it is, they just know it has to be that way. The author of this book did the research for us and provided answers to many questions that I personally had.This is where \\"ROADMAP to Korean\\" comes in. This book will not TEACH you Korean. What it will do is add the extra SPICE and answer many WHYs that you might be searching for. It will explain things that my Korean friends don't fully understand and it is all done from the perspective of a native english speaker who struggled to learn the language.My close Korean friend is studying to be a teacher and she was really impressed with this book...If you are looking for a TEXT book, go somewhere else...if you are looking for a companion to your text book, BUY THIS BOOK!!!"},{"Title":"Roadmap to Korean","review":"The book arrived quickly and was well wraped.

I had high expectations when I picked it up because his other books I have read are wonderful, but I just didn't get much out of this one. The three chairs concept of spiritual maturity in an individual seems undermining to me as well. God is big and does big things and maybe, just maybe you don't sit in one of those three chairs.

I've read many books by this author and recommend any of his books. This book in particular talks about the Principle of the Three Chairs. It causes you to consider where you are at in your own spiritual walk. It also has sections that discuss marriage and parenting from these chairs. I have to say that the section on marriage really provided great insight into the roles of husband and wife, and the roles of parents. So many people in my class had a different view of Ephesians 5 after we read through this book. Like I said, it is very challenging to you on a personal, spiritual level. It also helps you to recognize where others are at to help you to minister better. I would recommend this book to any Christian because it will challenge you. I would also recommend it for Bible study, for those in ministry, and especially to any Christian who is planning to get married or who is married. The section on marriage was my favorite part of the book. Every couple needs to read that section."},{"Title":"Experiencing Spiritual Breakthroughs : The Powerful Principle of the Three Chairs","review":"Experiencing Spiritual Breakthrough by Dr. Bruce WilkinsonThis book is divided into four sections: Experiencing Spiritual Breakthroughs, Experiencing Spiritual Breakthroughs with God, Experiencing Spiritual Breakthrough in your Marriage, Experiencing Spiritual Breakthroughs in your Parenting.The illustration of the Three Chairs is key to understanding the purpose and principles in this book. Each chair represents a level of commitment to God. The First Chair believer has a personal relationship with Christ exemplifying the word Commitment. Their life is rooted in obedience to God's Word and willingly submits to His authority. The Second Chair knows about Christ and may attend church. They are lukewarm Christians and vacillate between a Christian lifestyle and the lure of the World. The descriptive word is Compromise for this group. The Third Chair represents the person who has no responded to a person God. They may have been brought to church but rejected the faith of their parents. There description is Conflict. Wilkinson uses generations in the Old Testament to show the progression of a First Chair parent with a Second Chair child.I started the book but it did not hold my attention. My pride placed me in the First Chair and I really didn't grasp the charts with the Snapshot of Three Generations. Section Two was easier to understand and relate to my life. It helped me see ways that I need to rededicate to the LORD. Self and Pride are always the area of weakness for me. This book gave some real-life illustrations which hit home with me and showed my need for growth.Skipping the Chapter on Marriage, I thought that Section Four on Parenting had some merit. Indeed the section is filled with illustrations of parenting styles and list Seven Steps to Raising Godly Children. It will be a good resource book for Godly Living.This ebook was supplied by WaterBrook press for my review."},{"Title":"Experiencing Spiritual Breakthroughs : The Powerful Principle of the Three Chairs","review":"I was excited to read this book as I have heard Dr. Wilkinson speak in person and know him to be a powerful teacher.The book begins with an explanation the Three Chairs. The illustration of the Three chairs helps us analyze our relationship with Christ and our level of faith. First Chair believers are completely sold out to God. Not only are they saved, but they have placed themselves willingly under the authority of Christ and is on a lifelong journey toward spiritual maturity.Second Chair believers represent those who have made a profession of faith at some point in time but aren't sure how committed they want to be. They look good on the outside, their heart is not always right. Paul would call Second Chair believers carnal Christians.Third Chair folks have not responded personally to Christ. They may have decided that God doesn't exist at all or just may be confused about who God is.Dr. Wilkinson explains that in order for anyone to experience a spiritual breakthrough, they must become First Chair believers. He gives several examples of all three types of people and the spiritual joys and/or frustrations they experience.I found the book relatively easy to read and understand but felt that it became extremely repetitious. I put the book down about halfway through and have not been able to make myself pick it up again.I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review."},{"Title":"Experiencing Spiritual Breakthroughs : The Powerful Principle of the Three Chairs","review":"I have to admit I was initially turned off reading this book due to the very casual writing style early in the book. If I recall correctly, much of the early section of the book was adapted from presentations Wilkinson has given to large groups. In that setting, the familiar style probably worked better. But I really got tired of sentences being punctuated by \\"friend\\" so frequently. However, I'm glad I kept reading because Wilkinson offers up some great advice in this book.The book is divided into three main sections. The first (and largest) section of the book talks about individual faith. The second talks about marriage and the third explores relationships between parents and their children.Wilkinson says there are three types of faith: the First Chair, Second Chair, and Third Chair. As you might imagine, the First Chair believer is the one who is all in. As Wilkinson describes it, \\"First Chair living is anchored in a person's whole intellect, will, and heart.\\" The Second Chair believer sounds like an accurate description for many of us; this person has committed to belief in Christ but is inconsistent and often compromises with the world around him or her. As Wilkinson says, \\"The Second Chair person has God on the tip of his tongue but self on the throne of his heart.\\" Meanwhile, a Third Chair person has not personally committed to faith in Christ, although they may be immersed in something Wilkinson calls \\"churchianity\\" - surrounding oneself with the trappings of faith (such as church attendance) but not having a personal relationship with Christ.Wilkinson's goal in this book is to help the reader move into First Chair faith. He uses Biblical examples of men from these different chairs to illustrate the impact our position has on our relationship with God and those around us. He also then gives an example of each chair from modern life. He has a good discussion about how goals differ from these different chairs and does a nice job of showing the slippery slope of compromise.Most of Wilkinson's target audience would likely identify themselves as Second Chair Christians, under the rubric he proposes. It is of some note, then, when Wilkinson says, \\"From personal experience I can tell you the most unhappy, frustrated, stressed, and disillusioned people in the world are not non-Christians as you might expect, but Second Chair people who know Christ yet who fight Him and His leadership for years and even decades.\\"Wilkinson spends significant time explaining the effects of being a Second Chair Christian and then begins to work toward a solution by proposing a series of questions to work through in order to gain a better understanding of lordship in our lives. The primary tool he recommends is confronting personal sin, and he devotes significant time to discussing how to confront these sins in our lives. He also offers practical tips for recognizing recurring sin and developing a strategy to avoid remaining ensnared by it.He says there are two primary motives at the root of sin:We seek the pleasure that comes from that sin, andWe seek the absence of pain that is the immediate source of our temptation to commit that sin.He then begins to turn the book toward personal relationships, noting that 70% of \\"our inner conflict\\" results from unforgiveness. This leads him to a discussion of marriage that at first felt a bit out of place in the book, but seemed appropriate once I got a little further in. Of course, he talks about having a First Chair marriage, too, and he spends some energy discussing how a marriage should look. He addresses the roles of husbands and wives. Although he generally espouses traditional headship and helper roles (with a good bit of clarification since there is such misunderstanding in public discussion), he also cites Scriptural authority for the wife to rule her household. He also discusses what he calls the \\"The Seven Stages of Marital Slide\\" and calls on men and women to find joy in their marriages. He had a great personal example from his life of taking a year away from ministry to focus on his marriage and his wife because his wife confronted him on the fact he had prioritized his ministry over her. This section led to a very nice discussion on restoring marital oneness.He then moved on to discussing being a First Chair parent. By now, I was looking forward to the advice he would offer in this section. He exhorts parents to raise godly kids, not just good kids, and he makes good use of a sports metaphor to explain how critical it is that we pass along true faith to our children:\\"A relay event has always struck me as a powerful illustration of parenting. Success for us as mom and dad isn't just about how well we run as individuals, but about how well we pass the baton. And only when the story of the generations who follow us is told will our 'win' at raising godly kids be known.\\"Wilkinson goes on to discuss different parenting styles and the effects these styles can have on our children, and he proposes seven steps to raising godly children. He spends the last chapter explaining that pain in a child's heart can haunt them as adults, so he suggests an approach in order to deal with this sort of \\"heart wound.\\"Overall, the guidance in the book is good, and I certainly felt much better about the book when I finished it than earlier when I was frustrated so many statements ended with a causal address. On the whole, I recommend the book, and there are some sections that are particularly strong.Disclosure - I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review."},{"Title":"Experiencing Spiritual Breakthroughs : The Powerful Principle of the Three Chairs","review":"A book I will definitely read again.

I am one of the people that feel frustrated because it just doesn't work for me most of the time. Well, Bruce Wilkerson has written a book that will help people like us see that God wants to accomplish something great in our lives, and his promises are for everyone, not just some people. The author will show readers that God is inviting us to make a change in our lives, and the most important thing is, He will help us make that change.This book is well written, simple and easy to understand and it is full of encouragement and help if we apply the principles the author talks about to our lives. He covers every area of our lives in this book, giving principles and promises that will help each of us as we read this wonderful book. This has helped me so much with some issues I've been struggling with. I appreciate the author and highly recommend this book to all Christians to read. I used it as a devotional, but it can be used in a Sunday school class or small group study.A copy of this book was provided by Blogging for Books through their book review program. I was not required or expected to write a positive review. The opinions in this review are mind only."},{"Title":"Experiencing Spiritual Breakthroughs : The Powerful Principle of the Three Chairs","review":"As a mom, there's an absolutely terrifying trend in Scripture that sends me to my knees all the time. Absolutely sold-out, on-fire, world-changing God-followers have kids that grow up to be half-hearted believers at best. And by the third generation, they were most certainly evil idolaters, so very far from the faith their grandfathers cherished.So what's the deal? And how can I escape certain doom? I don't just want to love and serve God myself. I want that for my kids and my grandkids and more. I want this to be a heritage of faith, not just passing down what I believe, but hopefully seeing the faith become personal and real to each of my daughters and the children they'll have some day.Bruce Wilkinson picks up this theme in his book Experiencing Spiritual Breakthroughs by illustrating levels of Christian commitment with three chairs. First Chair Christians are sold-out for Jesus. Second-Chair Christians are nominally Christian, fitting their lives into the Christian framework, but never really handing over the reigns to God. And Third Chair folks don't believe at all.It's a handy tool for explaining basic Spiritual concepts like what it means to be lukewarm or what the lordship of Jesus Christ in our lives should look like.He then moves this illustration into a discussion of what it means to let Jesus be Lord in our marriages and in our relationships with our children. I felt like this was an awkward transition. It seemed to be a book about being a committed follower to Christ and then it was a book on male leadership and female submission in marriage, without referring back to the \\"three chairs\\" for several chapters. And then it was a parenting manual.The section of the book on parenting held powerful reminders of how we need to actually live out the Spiritual lessons we teach our kids. We can't just assume Sunday morning church is going to \\"save\\" our kids, especially if they see us living hypocritical lives as soon as we get home and change out of the suit and tie. He also discussed forgiveness and the influence parents have over adult children that could be particularly helpful for those praying for children who have rejected their parents' faith.All in all, the principle of the three chairs could be a great object lesson when evaluating where we are in our Christian walk and what we need to change in order to grow closer to God. Still, I'm not sure that all of the connections in the book were as clear or as powerful as they should be. To discuss hugely complicated topics on marriage in all of two or three chapters left me asking lots of questions and not finding quite enough in-depth answers. I suppose I was expecting more \\"breakthrough\\" in this book.I received this book free from the publisher.

The author, Bruce Wilkinson, talked about having three kinds of spiritual breakthroughs - spiritual breakthroughs with God, spiritual breakthroughs in your marriage and spiritual breakthroughs in parents. What I found extremely interesting and relevant was how he wrote about 3 kinds of christians - essentially hot christians, lukewarm christians and non-christians - this topic was also very thought-provoking.Bruce also talked about marriage and parenting and this is not applicable to me, but I still found it interesting and have filed more than a few things away in my brain for when I am married or a parent.I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to hit a deeper level with God or experience a spiritual breakthrough in their lives."},{"Title":"Experiencing Spiritual Breakthroughs : The Powerful Principle of the Three Chairs","review":"In exchange for an unbiased review, the publisher has provided me with an e-copy of \\"Experiencing Spiritual Breakthroughs\\" (Multnomah Books, 1999) by Bruce Wilkinson.Dr Wilkinson asks us to look at where we are on our spiritual journey, where we are in our relationships with God, our spouse, our children, and most importantly to ask ourselves if we are where we want to be. You probably already realize that most people are looking for something more than what they have, or this book wouldn't have needed to be written. In this book, Wilkinson lays out several principles that help us get to the next step. He uses \`Three Chairs' as a metaphor for three types of \\"spiritual status before God\\". The statuses range from 1) no personal; relationship, to 2) nominal Christianity, to 3) a full acceptance of Jesus as Savior AND Lord. The goal of this book is to help us get to the point of full acceptance, and using Biblical examples, the author lays out a plan.Like several other books by this author that I've read, I found \\"Experiencing Spiritual Breakthroughs\\" to be a fairly easy read. The principles that he lays out are biblical, practical, and simple. You don't need to be a theologian to understand what he is saying. Many books in the popular press claim to have the answers but the reader has to spend so much energy trying to figure out how any of it applies to his life, that he has nothing left when it comes to putting things into practice. IN this book Wilkinson doesn't try to cover every possibility, rather he limits himself to how to breakthrough to that next level in the context of God, spouse and children. My hunch is that other areas of our lives will be affected to.I have noticed a tendency for people in general to give up when things get tough. Wilkinson's analogy of the second chair - the nominal Christian- probably fits most of these people. The Apostle Paul never writes to the churches that they should quit in the middle of the race: he encourages them to fight the good fight, to keep the faith, to finish the race, and to go into training and run as if you want to win. The people that are willing to do all of that are probably in the first chair, fully accepting of Jesus' Lordship. And what do we do with the third chair people? We remember that the harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few.We're all looking for something, and this book may have the ideas, the suggestions, the steps to take that will help us to find it. Great resource for an Adult Sunday School class, small group study or perhaps as part of a class on evangelism. 4.5/5"},{"Title":"Experiencing Spiritual Breakthroughs : The Powerful Principle of the Three Chairs","review":"Experiencing Spiritual Breakthrough by Dr. Bruce WilkinsonAccording to Dr. Wilkinson, there are 3 stages of faith-committed, compromise, & conflict. In his newest book, he discusses how whichever level an individual is on, impacts that person's family.Although he does explore both the Old & New, more time is spent in the Old Testament. Joshua is used to show the committed level. Then, we travel through to Judges as the levels decrease. There's also discussion on how knowing, relating to, & serving God shape us.I teetered back & forth with this book. I wholeheartedly agree that our loyalty show lie with God & not man. If the elders in the Old Testament fell spiritually because they followed Joshua more than God, it makes perfect sense because then their spiritual balance is off. I agree that just repeating the same prayer word for word results in a poor prayer life. I also agree that spiritual growth is attainable & that there are many Undercover Christians (those whom no one else would know were Christians).My misgivings in the author's thoughts arise in lumping ALL mankind into 3 states-periods. The author allows no wiggle room. You are either a 1,2 or 3. Isn't that a little too cut & dry? Perhaps there are millions of people who do fit the mold. I find, though, that I am somewhere between 1 & 2 & wonder how many others would feel that too. I am dedicated to Jesus & devout in my faith. I am also human & flawed. But, Dr. Wilkinson believes you can't be in between. There are too many unique circumstances & extenuating circumstances in life. Furthermore, confusion mounted when Dr. Wilkinson states the impact that God-fearing parents have on their children then promptly dismisses how David produced a child such as Solomon who backslid. If we follow his concise guidelines, then Stage 1 parents produce Stage 1 children. But, David didn't. What went wrong? How can we not replicate King David's parental boo boos? I would have appreciated a chapter on that. I just don't see how certain Christians I know could be considered compromisers or Stage 2's by these standards. They've just had a really rough go in life. It strikes me as simply unfair.I'm not sure what \`it' was that I was looking for from this book. But \`it' wasn't there. If I'm to learn & incorporate principles from a book, then I need tools I can understand & work with. Ultimately, I came out confused & baffled at his numbers game.When it's all said & done, \`Experiencing Spiritual Breakthroughs' equals 3 of 5 stars for having our Christian interests at heart, but teaching us little.I received 1 eBook to facilitate the review.

I would recommend this book for anyone wanting to grow spiritually."},{"Title":"Experiencing Spiritual Breakthroughs : The Powerful Principle of the Three Chairs","review":"Wilkinson used a simple but effective teaching aid - 3 chairs which are used to represent 3 portraits or spiritual states in which everyone in the world can be divided into as illustrated in the diagram below:CHAIR ONE - commitment, saved, spiritualCHAIR TWO - compromise, saved, carnalCHAIR THREE - conflict, unsaved, naturalHis thesis that by identifying which chair we are sitting on at present, we can make a \`spiritual breakthoughs' by making a decision to move from one chair to another.Firstly, in an effort to make the concept relevant, Wilkinson have oversimplified the process of spiritual growth without reference to grace, spiritual formation, character development and development of new worldview. He seems to give the impression that spiritual breakthroughs is easy and achievable by human effort alone.Secondly, there is weak theological support for his thesis except using Paul's terms (spiritual, carnal and natural man). In his Biblical example, he used Joshua, elders and children of elders. While he made his point of generational slide, the children of elders were disobedient rather than non believers. But it is true that there is a generational slide if each generation do not develop personal faith in Jesus.Thirdly, Wilkinson meant the three chairs for Christians, backslidden Christians and non-Christian but there is no reference to the work of Jesus Christ on the cross and of the Holy Spirit in spiritual transformation. Wilkinson seems to imply that spiritual growth can take place by decision making alone. There cannot be movements between the chairs without adequate appropriation of the theology of the cross and inner transformation without the work of the Holy Spirit especially in his examples of Julia, Ernie and Kate.Finally, while marriage and parenting is important, one wonders whether the three-chairs model is the right approach. Section 3 & 4 sounds like promotions for Walk-Thru-the Bible Ministries programs. Wilkinson's book promises spiritual breakthroughs but one wonders whether it can delivers except for a short time haze of spiritual high."},{"Title":"History and Theory in Anthropology","review":"This bood represents a clear and concise treatment of anthropological theory.

The glamour of the era is revived in all its splendour.Most of the costumes worn by Louis XIV in portraits are faithfully recreated by Mr Tierney.My reason for not giving this work 5 stars is that some details of this work were \\"not quite right\\". For example, one of the dolls is the Duchesse de Ventadour, when other figures played far greater roles in the Sun King's court but have not been included (eg the King's brother, Philippe, Duc d'Orleans and his second wife, Elisabeth von der Pfalz). Another reason is that some costumes don't seem to have been based on actual portraits, but were invented by Tom Tierney (eg the green and yellow dress of the Duchesse de Fontanges).Finally, in the text the ladies of the court are referred to by their titles not their full names. I think that names are essential when including short biographies of the people included in the book.Visually, this book is splendid, but it would not please historians who expect complete accuracy."},{"Title":"Louis XIV and His Court Paper Dolls","review":"Beautiful costumes, lush in colour, many different female characters at the court of King Louis XIV.

The King James and the Revised versions are nearly identical, where the Revised is a little more clearly stated to the modern ear than is the KJV. Interlinear text comes in where the two versions diverge. The text becomes smaller so that two lines will fit where there is normally one. The KJV then appears above the RV. My first impression was that this would make the book difficult to read, but after reading several pages I saw that the eye really does adjust to the task quite handily. Plus the payoff is nice - two texts in one that can be read truely simulteneously - not like in a parallel bible."},{"Title":"King James Version and the Revised Version (Black Goatskin Leather)","review":"This Interlinear is outstanding for the serious student of God's Word. Something not mentioned in the other reviews is the fact that one can see the differences between the original language texts used by the translators of these respective translations. Especially in the New Testament, one can read the King James and see the &quot;textus receptus&quot; used by its translators in comparison to the &quot;critical text&quot; used by the RV translators (the text upon which virtually ALL modern translations are based--except for the NKJV). It's great to be able to see the sometimes extensive, as well as the subtle differences, between these two texts. And to be able to &quot;see&quot; these diffences by simply reading the text is very enlightening (not to mention time-saving). That's a big plus. Also the combining of the marginal notations of BOTH the KJV and the RV is extremely enlightening. It provides much fodder for thought as alternative translations or literal renderings of the Hebrew or Greek are so succinctly provided. The cross references in the center column are a bit of a strain on the eyes...but as other reviers have noted--they are excellent.In terms of quality of product: Definitely 5 stars! The goatskin leather is an absolute aesthetic delight (both to the eyes as well as the hand). Very lush and high-quality! The paper is high-quality and very thin. But one thing that surprised me was that even using colored markers, the bleed-through is virtually non-existent. There is also room in the margins for personal notes (but I've not, as yet, taken my pen there (it's almost too beautiful to mar with my poor penmanship).The quality of the printing is also excellent--dark and very clean and clear (although some of the &quot;parallel&quot; aspects are a little smaller than I would like. Blame it on age and dwindling eye-sight.As a study Bible, this is a &quot;superior&quot; study Bible. There is so much wealth of information contained within this interlinear. The RV is probably the most &quot;literal&quot; translation that has ever been produced. For those who don't know Hebrew or Greek, this Bible is the next best thing for being able to read Hebrew and Greek. The 1881 translators set out to produce a translation that was absolutely meticulous--and they succeded! In sum, I would highly recommend the KJV/RV Interlinear for the meticulous student of God's Word. And given reasonable care, this Bible is defintely a treasured &quot;heirloom&quot; built to last a life-time (and perhaps then-some). As far as I'm concerned, NO ONE produces a higher quality Bible than Cambridge! &quot;Take up and read.&quot;"},{"Title":"King James Version and the Revised Version (Black Goatskin Leather)","review":"Hats off again to Cambridge Publisher.

I bought it as much for the incomparable Cambridge goatskin binding as for the text. It feels and smells and MOVES so beautifully that I enjoy just holding it. It's well worth every penny.

Most people today who know the story, know it from the Greer Garson classic movie. But books have always been special in my family, and I was delighted to discover it was still in print."},{"Title":"Mrs. Miniver (Isis Series)","review":"I was raised working class with immigrant parents and don't normally like characters like Mrs. Miniver, an upper middle class British housewife with a country home and servants. Yet I was enchanted by these 37 essays that originally appeared in the London Times between 1937 and 1939.We don't even learn the first name of the lead character until the very end of the book. She is always Mrs. Miniver, and her husband is always Clem. The Minivers are close, but they don't ever act intimate.Even though the essays are in the third person (except for the letter at the end where we learn her first name), this is one of the most intimate looks into a woman's mind I have ever read. The author's love of language and the details of daily life are revealed through the thoughts of this delightful character.The essays were published in the Times every two weeks for the two years leading up to the British entry into World War II. Although the preparations for war are discussed in later essays, they mostly deal with the everyday lives of this typical middle class family. The essays became a symbol of the essence of British life and were published in book form as the war began. The US edition includes an additional essay where Mrs. Miniver prepares her first Christmas shopping list of the war.The American cinema made an Oscar-winning movie with the same title starring Greer Garson, but the plot of the movie has nothing to do with the subject of these brief disconnected short stories. This is a wonderful book that I will cherish for a long time. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Mrs. Miniver (Isis Series)","review":"This fragile piece of literature should be included in a course of feminist literature called Woman's World. The setting happens to be pre WW2 Britain (London, the country and Scotland), but Struther's sentiments and gentle insights into a woman's heart are truly timeless and universal in appeal. All mothers can relate to Mrs. Miniver's private thoughts, triumphs and fears re her children, who grow up by three years in these short pages. All wives can empathize with her rarely successful attempts to communicate meaningfully with her predictable husband. Lastly, women the world over will appreciate her mental meanderings, which are sporadically stimulated by banal objects, chance meetings and the shifting of the seasons.At this point I wish to inject a gentle warning to those readers who expect a clearly-deliniated plot, high drama or profound character development. Our Mrs. Miniver remains delightfully stable in her own way, as she views the vagaries and fluctuations of her private world. Rather, we are expected to enter into a tacit collaboration with this modest heroine. Truly one wonders just how much the author has infused of herself into this soft-spoken Everywoman. We understand that a woman's domain--in any age--signifies the preparation of the maternal, spousal and societal hearths, in order to keep man from reverting to a more primitive state.We applaud as this unassuming English lady musters internal strength when required to leave her personal comfort zone, in order to meet her social obligations. With warmth and compassion Mrs. Miniver handles most challenges in her relaxed existence, as she shares her uniquely feminine eye-view of life, especially in a world on the brink of global war. Consisting of dozens of short vignettes with little seeming relevance to each other, this literary gem will prove a delicate treasure of the female pscyhe, for those who read with their heart."},{"Title":"Mrs. Miniver (Isis Series)","review":"Like so many other readers, I picked this book up expecting the written version of the Greer Garson film. As soon as I read the author's thanks to the Times for allowing her to republish a series of articles carried by that newspaper in the pre-war years, though, I realized that wasn't what I was about to read. So I adjusted my expectations, settled back, and thoroughly enjoyed Mrs. Miniver in her original incarnation. The war doesn't begin until the book's final vignette, although its looming threat is hinted at many times in the earlier ones.Jan Struther's articles share with us the life of Mrs. Miniver, a happily married Londoner who has a second home in Kent and three perfectly normal children. Like other women of her time and class, she has no need to be employed at anything but living the proper social life, and directing the activities of her servants so that husband Clem will have a haven to come to every night and a competent hostess to entertain their friends and business contacts. Clem appears to be a building contractor, which makes such contacts especially important.So far, so boring. Except that Mrs. Miniver has a keen mind, and an equally keen awareness of her own emotions and the triggers that rouse them. Each article's vividly written descriptions of routine events in an average woman's life not only involve the reader's senses; they also offer, subtly and therefore effectively, philosophical comments that any thinking person can't help responding to with recognition. We've lived what Mrs. Miniver has lived, all of us, despite being separated from her world by gulfs of time and space. Between those moments (at least one, but usually several, per article) and Struther's beautiful use of everyday language, this book turns out to be a quiet delight."},{"Title":"Mrs. Miniver (Isis Series)","review":"This book feels like a stream of kindly and observant words into a forgotten age.It chronicles London life for an upper Middle class family immediately prior to WW2, as seen by the woman of the family unit. It captures an essential and sedate sense of Britishness long since lost and it is written with sad eye on the changes to come almost as if it anticipates them. This seems to be why the author takes such intense pleasure in the ordinary and brings such events to life, vividly, with huge empathy and comfort. There are elements of it's purpose and philosophy in the film version, but the film is much more dramatic and by and large bares no resemblence to the novel.Being British, and having had family who survived the Blitz and the horrors of WW2, this book brought me to tears often for it must have captures the price paid for war, so eloquently.The books emotive power lies in it's solid sense of it's time and in the sense of all that is to change. It's pleasent sense of ordinary, comfortable and uneventful plodding is strangely powerful."},{"Title":"Mrs. Miniver (Isis Series)","review":"This book shows the characterization of the woman in the film, but Hollywood definitely took some huge liberties with the plot line. As this is always the case, I expected some minor differences, but this is completely different. The novel was published before the Battle of Britain, and the author obviously didn't know the future. Hollywood at the time wanted to use headlines for film fodder, so it's only a matter of course that they should change the plot of the novel to suit the times. Both the movie and the novel are worthwhile."},{"Title":"Mrs. Miniver (Isis Series)","review":"While I was reading this book, I was constantly amazed by Struthers' ability to put into words the most abstract concepts and ideas, like assigning colors to days of the week and describing fireworks. . . While the story didn't really hold my interest, because it seems to be hidden inside a gauzy layer of images and hidden meanings, the images and hidden meanings themselves were fascinating and I found that I couldn't wait to read what would be said next. Worth reading, if only to be for a few hours in awe of a truly gifted and insightful writer, one whose grasp of the seemingly undefinable is much stronger than her ability to construct a dynamic plot (which, in the book's defense, is not its goal at all)."},{"Title":"Mrs. Miniver (Isis Series)","review":"Having loved the classic Greer Garson film of the same name, I was very much looking forward to reading the book upon which it was based. Imagine my surprise when I opened the first page to discover that the book is a series of articles based on Mrs. Miniver's largely peacetime life. I hasten to add that this isn't a criticism. What is found in this slim volume is a deeply-layered exploration of Mrs. Miniver's personal beliefs, quiet integrity and dry sense of humor.Language is something to be treasured and savored here. Struther plays with words in a way that is, for lack of a better term, delicious. I found myself reading and re-reading segments because of the beautiful way in which they were phrased. The life that the Minivers lead consists of trips to their country home in Kent, dinners with friends, and holiday celebrations, all archly and candidly observed by Mrs. Miniver. The War, while looming on the horizon, does not take over until the very end of the book.I got this book with the expectation that I'd read about the things I'd seen in the film. What I ended up with was something much different. It takes nothing away from my love of Greer Garson to say that I loved Jan Struther's original stories just as much as the movie that grew out of them."},{"Title":"Mrs. Miniver (Isis Series)","review":"Yes, curiosity kills the cat... Don't try to read that book if you want to learn more or compare with the 1942 movie with AA winner actress Greer Garson! BUT, as another reviewer wrote (Burbank, CA), it is worth reading for the author's keen observation of everyday life and it's said in very pleasing words and manner. And that is the key of this book: there is no specific intention in it, just a calm stream of good words, typically English (?). You read this curious series of short novellas (very short!) with a sense of duty to see how she will describe her next subject and turn it around. And it is a delicious exploration... Not bad, but how was Hollywood able to find something in this to make a movie is truly a mystery to me!!"},{"Title":"Mrs. Miniver (Isis Series)","review":"Snippets of every day life in the years preceding World War II are captured in the most charming way in this little book. A collection of short stories and essays written by the fictional Miss Miniver, the book has neither plot nor fully developed characters (except for Mrs. Miniver herself) and yet it fulfills that one basic requirement of great literature: it leaves an impression on the mind that lasts long after the final page has been turned. Mrs. Miniver's musings on life, family, love, happiness and society all serve to underscore some basic truth that is often taken for granted, expressing them in a way that touches the reader's heart and reminds her ever so gently of how very fragile the treasures of this life can be. Poignant and insightful, Mrs. Miniver's observations are couched in thoroughly beautiful prose that elicits a deep feeling of connection and understanding, even today. I can't do the book justice and trust my favorite quotes to highlight just how very touching the book, at its best, can be.\\"Clem caught her eye across the table. It seemed to her sometimes that the most important thing about marriage was not a home or children or a remedy against sin, but simply there being always an eye to catch.\\"\\"Outside the air was delicious. She could feel it stroking her face...but there was no sensation of either warmth or chill....on certain days, and this was one of them, the barriers were down. She felt as though she and the outside world could mingle...as though she was not entirely contained in her own body but was part also of every other person in the street; and, for that matter, of the thrush singing on a tree...the cat stepping delicately across Buckingham Palace Road. This was the real meaning of peace...an active consciousness of unity...\\"\\"She was every relationship as a pair of intersecting circles. The more they intersected, it would seem at first glance, the better the relationship; but this is not so. Beyond a certain point, the law of diminishing returns sets in, and there aren't enough private resources left on either side to enrich the life that is shared. Probably perfection is reached when the area of the two outer crescents, added together, is exactly equal to that of the leaf-shaped piece in the middle.\\"\\"...you cannot successfully navigate the future unless you keep always framed beside it a small clear image of the past.\\"\\"This was the cream of marriage, this nightly turning out of the day's pocketful of memories, this deft habitual sharing of two pairs of eyes, two pairs of ears.\\""},{"Title":"Mrs. Miniver (Isis Series)","review":"I re-read this book every year at the start of the holiday season.

He then later went through it and made notes in preparation for his history of the war.So it includes what he was thinking at that time rather than just how he remembered things. This is what makes this a good book.On the flip side, as the intro says, a lot was held back because it would be upsetting to others. It's also, while not boring, repetitious in places. That probably is a reflection of what he went through, the same arguments with the same people - primarily Churchill and Admiral King.But it mostly suffers from the fact that it does not dive in to the real interesting questions and I think that is due to the parts he held out."},{"Title":"Bureaucracy","review":"Bureaucracy is the clearest and most concise version of the calculation critique of socialism. This books is vastly easier to read that the original 1920 article on socialist calculation. It is far shorter and more focused than Human Action. It is also much shorter than Socialism, an Economic and Sociological Analysis. Mises managed to achieve brevity without sacrificing much important content. Bureaucracy is probably his best written book.There are many subtleties to this book, but the main points are straightforward. Mises contrasts profit management with bureaucratic management. To Mises Bureaucratic management is necessary as far as a few basic public services are concerned. However, the adoption of socialism would mean the extension of bureaucratic management to all areas of the economy. The problem with this is that bureaucracies are inflexible. Changing economic conditions require the adaptation of production. Entrepreneurs implement changes in production because they seek profit. Mises explains why bureaucrats would act irresponsibly- they are not checked by profit and loss accounting. Since public services lack a cash value as generated by markets the costs of increasing public services are unknown. Bureacratic managers would thus over expand their operations without realizing it. Such bureaucratic excesses must be limited by restrictive rules. Hence bureaucracies lack the flexibility of entrepreneurial capitalism.Mises also considers psychological and political issues, but these points are not as well developed as his economic arguments. One could see this as a weakness, but those who want a more complete version of the von Mises critique of socialism can read his 1922 book- Socialism.Bureaucracy is the shortest and surest path to understanding the merits of free markets and the dangers of socialism. I can think of no other book that contains so many important insights in so few pages. The closest contenders for this honor would be Menger's Principles, Buchanan's Cost and Choice, and Hayek's Road to Serfdom. Fortunately one can find accessibility and genius in some books, and Bureaucracy excels in both of these attributes."},{"Title":"Bureaucracy","review":"Written by professor former Vienna Chamber of Commerce economist Ludwig von Mises (1881-1973), Bureaucracy is a classic economic treatise, first published in 1944, about how the efficient aspects of private ownership and control of public good production ultimately produces superior results compared to the mishmash of publically administrated plans laced with codes of \\"officialdom\\", government incompetence, unforeseen legal wranglings, graft, and other ills. \\"Bureaucracy in itself is neither good nor bad,\\" Mises states; rather, bureaucracy is a valuable resource for managing certain spheres of human activity, such as policing and courts of law, yet ultimately a failure or even harmful when applied to private enterprise, simply because forced obedience to strict rules hobbles entrepreneurial managers' room to maneuver amid fluctuating market situations, and stifles their innovation in response to evolving consumer wants. \\"Under socialism... the beginner must please the already settled. They do not like too efficient newcomers. (Neither do old-established entrepreneurs like such men; but, under the supremacy of the consumers, they cannot prevent their competition.) In the bureaucratic machine of socialism the way toward promotion is not achievement but the favor of the superiors... The rising generation is at the mercy of the aged.\\" As timely and insightful now as it was over half a century ago, Bureaucracy is highly recommended especially for college library and economic studies shelves."},{"Title":"Bureaucracy","review":"This is a short economic tract from the acclaimed Austrian economist known for his stern defense of free-markets. Mises' sharp verbal logic and analysis of the adverse affect that bureaucracy, socialism, and a bloated public sector has on the economy. This book is a classic. I recommend reading in tandem with his other classics like Human Action, Liberalism in the Classical Tradition, Socialism."},{"Title":"Bureaucracy","review":"Length:: 7:21 MinsLudwig von Mises' stuff is worth reading twice and this book remains highly pertinent today."},{"Title":"Bureaucracy","review":"This is an excellent book and a devastating critique against bureaucracy. Even though this book was written in 1944 many of the problems, irritations and false hopes of bureaucracy as outlined in this book are still relevant, if not more so, today. Times may change but bureaucracy does not."},{"Title":"Bureaucracy","review":"Ludwig Heinrich Edler von Mises (1881-1973) was one of the major figures in the Austrian School of economics; Friedrich Hayek was a pupil of his. Mises' major works areHuman Action: A Treatise on Economics, Third Revised EditionandSocialism: An Economic and Sociological Analysis.Mises wrote in the Preface to the original (1944) edition of this book, \\"The main issue in present-day social and political conflicts is whether or not man should give away freedom, private initiative, and individual responsibility and surrender to the guardianship of a gigantic apparatus of compulsion and coercion, the Socialist State... it seems as if an investigation of the expansion of bureaucratic agencies is the most expedient avenue of approach. An analysis of bureaucratism offers an excellent opportunity to recognize the fundamental problems of the controversy.\\"He admits in the Preface to the 1962 edition that there are some activities where \\"profit management\\" can't prevail; for example, \\"A police department cannot be operated according to the methods resorted to in the conduct of a gainful enterprise.\\" He later added, \\"There is no yardstick available that could establish whether the expenses incurred by one of (the FBI's) regional or local branches were not excessive.\\" (Pg. 50) You cannot \\"measure\\" a judge according to how much time he needs to adjudicate a case (Pg. 56). This leads to his conclusion that \\"a successful handling of public affairs... cannot be expressed in terms of money,\\" and \\"Bureaucratic management is management of affairs which cannot be checked by economic calculation.\\" (Pg. 52)He refuses to attribute the failures of European bureaucracies to \\"intellectual and moral deficiencies of the personnel,\\" since many of the \\"most gifted and lofty members of the intelligentsia\\" served in government bureaus. Many civil servants published \\"excellent treatises\\" dealing with administration and statistics. (Pg. 61)But he also notes that many civil service clerks act as if compliance with \\"formalities\\" is the most important part of their job. (Pg. 60) He also charges that most people joined the staff of government offices because the salary and the pension offered were higher than what they could expect to earn in other occupations. \\"They did not renounce anything in serving the government.\\" (Pg. 86)He asserts that \\"The outstanding fact of the intellectual history of the last hundred years is the struggle against economics.\\" \\"They called the economists names... and called down curses upon them.\\" (Pg. 89)He rejects the justification of a bureaucracy by comparison with the Roman Catholic Church. He states that the methods of the Church are very efficient for the government of a body \\"clinging to an undisputed, unchangeable set of rules and regulations. They are perfect in the choice of the guardians of an eternal treasure of doctrine. But the case of human government and civil government is different.\\" (Pg. 111)This is one of Mises' most interesting books, and will definitely be of value to students of Austrian economics."},{"Title":"Bureaucracy","review":"Brilliant, concise, extraordinarily objective and analytical, while delving into the exposition of bureaucracy so thoroughly this reader at least, found the case quite damning."},{"Title":"Bureaucracy","review":"GREAT BOOK BUT UNFORTUNATELY NOT APPLICABLE TO THE CURRENT DISMAL STATE OF THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT.

Excellent read."},{"Title":"While The Rivers Run","review":"Although the book jacket goes a little overboard by calling it &quot;in the sweeping tradition of . . . LONESOME DOVE and . . . TEXAS,&quot; Ms. McGowan has a very fast-paced, enjoyable story, full of action, with a very nicely done love-story to boot. Her writing is often humorous, and always a unique and enjoyable mixture of narration and reaction/thoughts of the main character, Nessa Cutter Fane. The characters are well-drawn and believable, the action non-stop, the chemistry between the two main characters so strong you can taste it. I'd recommend this book to anyone who enjoys historical fiction set in the Old West, to anyone who enjoys a well-written story about strong-willed women and men of grit, or to anyone who loves reading stories about people who are meant to be together, and the sparks that fly (both good and bad) when they are. The back of the book touts a sequel to the book, BEYOND THE RIVER, which is supposed to come out in July, 1997. I can't wait"},{"Title":"While The Rivers Run","review":"This is one of my absolute favorite books. The entire story is woven with danger, adventure, love, hunor and those unexpected little twists.

And specifically on how to make a simple Web Service using the .NET platform. But the thrust of the book is in showing how to incorporate cryptographic methods into the WS communications. The authors claim that perhaps the most important reason that WS have not taken off is security. Without a secure authentication and authorisation of messages, companies are leery about exposing their data via WS.So the book devotes most of its space to the various cryptographic issues involved in .NET and WS. Some of this is not restricted to WS. For example, you may want to encrypt a channel, over which you will send sensitive data. That data might be a WS message, or something else. Hence, we get explanations of Active Directory, which handles a lot of these grubby details.Later, they discuss public key cryptography. Which they term asynchronous encryption; not a widely used term. They contrast this to synchronous encryption, which most others call symmetric encryption.But having said this, the book does offer a reasonable guide to using C# and .NET for WS. What is left for the reader is the much harder problem. That of designing a useful."},{"Title":"Expert Web Services Security in the .NET Platform","review":"Please do not waste your money.I bought this book looking at the ratings.No coverate of WS-Security.It talks about IIS and other setup things, not really about.Net code.It looks rehash of one chapter of \\"Building Secure Microsoft ASP.Net applications\\".The book had no code examples. It says it is expert level,but it is not."},{"Title":"Expert Web Services Security in the .NET Platform","review":"I was excited by the prospect of this book. Many books on web services or ASP.Net offer only a short chapter on security that goes over the different authentication methods and not much more. I was looking forward to a broader end-to-end treatment of security.Although this book did discuss a wide range of topics, it failed to tie them together. It describes a bunch of technologies but doesn't teach you how to choose between them or use them together. Some case studies or end-to-end diagrams would have really helped.I also felt that there was not enough depth. Although the book is advertised as \\"advanced\\", it's really only an introduction to a bunch of topics. You need to go elsewhere to learn enough to really apply them. The book is quite thin.I'm not sure who a good target audience for this book is. If you are trying to understand an overview web service security, it falls short because it doesn't do enough to help you understand the big picture. If you understand the big picture and are looking for an advanced treatment of how to implement security techniques, this book will only give you an introduction."},{"Title":"Expert Web Services Security in the .NET Platform","review":"If you are responsible for coding applications using Microsoft's .NET platform, and you want to be sure that you're taking security seriously, you should check out this book pronto. Expert Web Services Security in the .NET Platform, written by Brian Nantz and Laurence Moroney and published by Apress, covers the ins and outs of writing secure code with the .NET platform.On the back cover, the user level is marked as Advanced. They're right. The first chapter alone, Web Services and XML Standards, will drop you immediately into the building of a simple web service and its consumer, with descriptions of XML Encryptions and signatures, PKI cryptography, and the various pieces of WS-Security (Web Services Security).The most secure application won't do much good if it's run on an insecure platform. Chapter 2, Windows Security, describes in detail how to lock down IIS 6.0 (and Windows itself) to the most secure it can be. The following chapter on ASP.NET Architecture provides an overview of the security features in ASP.NET 1.1 with respect to web services.I really enjoyed going through the chapter on Security Tools and Tips. Not only do you learn how to mask your identity and how to securely update your files, but you learn about the most popular tools available (most of them free) to test your security.Arguably, the most important security tool is cryptography. The chapter on .NET Cryptography gives a basic overview of the terminology and techniques for encrypting your traffic. This sets the stage for the next few chapters, which go into detail about securing the web services with Integrated Windows Security, SSL, and the Web Services Enhancements (WSE).Of course, any major site is going to have a lot of data to store that needs to be available to the web server. With so many exploits against SQL servers, Brian and Laurence put in a chapter devoted to securing SQL with ASP.NET, containing information on how to authenticate, how to impersonate, and how to obviate common attacks.The last bit of protection needed is for the code itself. Open Source is very desirable these days, but many companies maintain their profit levels by protecting their intellectual property. .NET adds protection for the code itself by IL Obfuscation. Proper obfuscation renders reverse engineering techniques practically useless. Chapter 10 explains in detail everything you need to know to protect your code from inspection.Expert Web Services Security in the .NET Platform provides a lot of valuable information for programmers using the Microsoft .NET platform. My only concern is that it didn't go as deep as it should have. At only 280 pages, it's rather slim to be covering such a deep topic as security throughout .NET. I hope that the second edition is bulked up to cover what was only skimmed over this time. I had to rank this an 4 out of 5, mostly due to the lack of depth in areas. Overall, a very useful book for .NET programmers."},{"Title":"Expert Web Services Security in the .NET Platform","review":"In this smallish 250 page book you would expect a significant proportion of the pages to be spent on WSE. Particularly when the book is for experts. Unfortunately the WSE coverage is only 18 pages.That's not a fatal flaw though. There are excellent chapters on general security and cryptography. And chapter 10 on code obfuscation will probably be the only book on IL obfuscation until the rumored Decompiling C# arrives.The book is well written. The style is terse and to the point. One chapter is very screenshot heavy, but the rest use graphics sparingly and to best effect.I'd like to see a more focused book on WSE, but in the meantime this is a good book on security topics for Windows in general, and for web services in particular."},{"Title":"Master Techniques in Podiatric Surgery: The Foot and Ankle","review":"This is my favorite book.

The most interesting characters are not the romantic leads but a middle-aged housekeeper and a 4 year old girl. We know all these facts about the main characters but it never really builds a 3 dimensional picture of them. It's still a fun, romantic read even without the depth and with the predictability.My greatest criticism is for the portrayal of the male romantic lead. I understand that guilt was his driving force but it was an illogical, self-indulgent type that made him seem very self centred. It's a trait in male romantic leads that bothers me and is used too frequently by Romance authors. It's almost narcissistic which is a personality trait that very rarely seems to go away in real life.The audio copy I listened to was narrated by Daisy Wheeler who was a very good choice.

The concept and format are promising, but the content does not measure up to the potential.Some of the decisions made concerning what material to present and where is baffling. If the Find utility is &quot;one of its [Pocket PC's] most powerful and useful functions&quot;, why is it described at the very end of the book (page 138)? Why is there a page on video players when there is no information on making video available on the Pocket PC (page 131)? The section on wireless connections gives no real information about wireless connections, it tells you how to set up DNS which is not specific to wireless (pages 63-65).The book was poorly edited. For example, the topic of page 26 is the Notes application but the graphic shows Pocket Word. Similarly, on page 103 the topic is the Inbox but the graphic is again Pocket Word (the same as on page 26). The instructions for converting text omits an important step (clicking on the pen button) (page 29).There is some useful information, for example, setting up the New menu (page 14) and how to cheat in Solitaire (start Solitaire, bring up the software keyboard, tap Ctl (not Ctrl, another typo!), tap Shift, tap New) (page 140).

How to Live With Food Allergies - A Practical Guide to Selecting Foods and Creating a Rotation Diet.","review":"This book covers the author's struggle with food allergies and presents her years of experience in creating a rotation diet that allowed her to function in a world filled with artificial foods. Before I read this book, I knew that fast food hamburgers had too much fat or that my tapwater had flouride. But this book really opened my eyes to how pervasive food additives really are and how difficult it is to create a diet that eliminates these.The presentation of ingredients was helpful, since they are the foundation of proper menu building. I also wasn't familiar with the concept of rotation diets until I read this book.The principles and ideas presented are sound and helpful."},{"Title":"What Do We Eat Tonight? How to Live With Food Allergies - A Practical Guide to Selecting Foods and Creating a Rotation Diet.","review":"Good news first: The most valuable section of the book is a list of all foods, organized according to biological classification. This can help identify which foods are risky, based on a person's known food sensitivities. This is a more informative list of this type than I have seen anywhere else.The bad news is that the main text of the book is lightweight and preachy--going on about macrobiotic principles and avoidance of saturated fats, etc. While these things are worth learning about, they are not what the book advertises to teach. The book is supposed to be a practical guide to creating a rotation diet. All it provides on this topic is a bunch of worksheets to help you visualize your rotation of ingredients, not meals. I was hoping for much more--such as recipe advice, menu planning, and kitchen management under the rigorous and complex rules I must follow to become healthier.The thing that really got my goat, is that the author states four times that you can hide your dietary problems at social events, by drinking water and expecting other people not to be concerned. This is simply not true. People will notice, and they will ask you, and try to be helpful. Most commonly, people think I'm dieting to lose weight, and start an aggravating conversation about how I'm already thin enough.Living with food allergies is time-consuming and stressful, and this book just does not help.

By reading Halls other works, one will gather he has a solid understanding of human psychology. But this book does not venture too far into the psychological world, and for the most part remains an astrology book more than a psychology book. The book is laid out typically, with each sign getting its own chapter, and in groups according to their class (i.e. cardinal, fixed, common). I feel that the descriptions for each zodiac is not too far from what you would find in other well written (and understood) astrology books. This book is concise and to the point and makes no claims of right/wrong, better/worse. The use of this book is more for those who are practicing nativities and the like and who are, perhaps, looking for an alternate means of assimilating information. The zodiacal descriptions are all based on the Sun sign which must be considered when making an accurate reading of a horoscope. While the information in the book is probably just as accurate as most other authorities, I would not say this book is a neccessity."},{"Title":"Celebrating Good Liturgy","review":"Do you go to Church?

Robert was a perfect hero and Clarice is just the match for him. I found the characters to be multi-dimensional and the author weaves a mystery into the story without slowing it down or interrupting the romantic flow. I loved that were too lost souls who found each other. They healed each others wounds. Robert is handsome, sexy, intelligent, but embittered by life. I am always a sucker for stories with \\"heartless\\" heroes who find their souls through the love of a good woman. I really loved Robert's sister Millicent. Millicent MacKenzie, the spinster sister of Robert MacKenzie, Earl of Hepburn. Seeing her blossom was a joy to watch. But the ending of the book was not well thought out at all. I agree the other view about how Robert seemed upset before Clarice left, but afterward he was okay because she'd told him to \\"be happy\\". It seemed like he'd gotten over her pretty quick. But when she came back, he had all this powerful emotion again.That just didn't set well with me. If it weren't for the wonderful epilogue. I would have been quite upset. I do hope there are more stories about Clarice's sisters and hopefully Millicent.A sexy hero, a feisty heroine, a mystery, and a passionate romance...put them all together and you get \\"Some Enchanted Evening\\", a historical romance you don't want to miss. Dodd developed Clarice and Robert's personalities and motivations very convincingly, to the point where you feel as though you know them well enough to be friends by the time you finish the book. The two meet and the sparks fly from page one. Ms. Dodd writes some of the wittiest dialogue around -- I was laughing out loud at times. One of the things I liked best about this book is the way the author wove the emotional storyline with such a light touch -- I was engrossed with the relationship between the hero and heroine and truly felt as if I knew them both. Some Enchanted Evening was an emotional roller coaster, and I felt all the pain and joy they did. I was so engrossed, I read it in a day. The love scenes are ample & steamy, and the plot is a good one. A fast paced book with an intricate plot that I cannot help but enjoy. Some Enchanted Evening has a strong (but not obnoxious) heroine who is in no way ordinary, a back story which is compelling but doesn't get in the way of the love story, and of course a wonderful hero."},{"Title":"Some Enchanted Evening (Lost Princesses)","review":"There's no denying it: I love this book. I am anxiously awaiting the next in the series. And this book affirmed my undying love for Christina Dodd.First of all, I have a thing about names. Some romance authors use the most absurd names. Dodd (so far as I know) has done no such thing. Clarice is a splendid name, and there's just something manly about the name Robert.With that said, SOME ENCHANTED EVENING was one of the greatest historical romances I have read, period. At first I was miffed by Clarice's entrance in the novel, and thought I would have written it a different way, but as I went along I realized that I was laboring under a misconception about the princess; I would just have written her entire character a different way. And I am pleased as punch with the way Dodd wrote her.My favorite character in the novel is Millicent MacKenzie, the spinster sister of Robert MacKenzie, Earl of Hepburn. I dearly hope that there will be a spin-off novel about Millicent's belated love story. The way that Clarice nurtures Millicent's timid nature and turns her from a wallflower into a diamond of the first water merely by giving her confidence stole my heart.I am also a big fan of truly obnoxious characters getting their comeuppance. Not only does it require an author to make a genuinely obnoxious character that the reader wants to throttle every step of the way, but then the author has to appropriately and efficiently take that character down a notch. Leaving the reader hurrah-ing loudly and getting odd looks from passersby.I won't ruin the ending, but while it ties everything up nicely (what romance novel doesn't?), it also leaves the reader checking Amazon.com and ChristinaDodd.com obsessively to find out when Princess Amy's story is coming out."},{"Title":"Some Enchanted Evening (Lost Princesses)","review":"And you thought the princess and the pea had problems! . They were as nothing compared to challenges faced by the three young royals in Christina Dodd's period romance, the first in a planned trilogy.Listeners learn quite quickly that being to the manor born is no guarantee of a cushy life as three sisters, princesses, are forced to leave their home country when revolution breaks out. However, they do not live in peace as they're chased by those who want to kill them. It's the 1700s, not a time for princesses to be alone. Nonetheless, Clarice attempts to take care of her sisters by starting a cosmetic business, selling face creams to women in the villages they pass through.There's little hope for any other females who have designs on handsome hunk Robert MacKenzie when he sees the beautiful Clarice ride into town. He is smitten, and invites her to visit him at his manor house......need we say more? If you know Christina Dodd, you know that romance and intrigue ensue.Elizabeth Sastre gives a sweetly regal performance as the story of Clarice and Robert unfolds. She has a breathy innocence in her voice that brings the young princess to life.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"Some Enchanted Evening (Lost Princesses)","review":"Christina Dodd has written a number of sexy, witty, emotional, memorable reads over the last decade or so; but unfortunately, Some Enchanted Evening is not one of them. I had high expectations regarding this novel; not only because of the author, but because the premise was so neat, and it sounded a bit like Sleeping Beauty--my favorite fairy tale.Clarice and Robert were very underdeveloped, the pacing was very slow, the villain/Robert's goal was very, very weak, and the love scenes between the two were way too early and way too unbelievable. They'd only met two-three days ago, as I recall, Clarice wishes to go home, she's forever spouting about being a princess, yet she sleeps with a man she barely even knows.Robert's character was irratic--I never knew who he was enough to feel any emotion for him, and his hazily described past. His immediate plan to use Clarice for his own personal vendetta became tiresome after a while, and then, the vendetta he wished upon his enemy was a big let-down;it wasn't even that dramatic, after all of the build-up about it.Plus; this series has remarkable similarities to Connie Brockway's Rose Hunters Trilogy: in the fact that they both features three impoverished sisters, are set within the early years of the nineteenth century. This book in particular was similar to My Seduction: heroine wanting to gain back her heritage through patronage of someone, a battle-weary hero who was betrayed by a comrade, and it's set in Scotland.If you're a die-hard Dodd fan, you'll probably read this book regardless of reviews, but if you've never read her, this isn't a book to start with.

My first problem was that I really couldn't see why the characters liked each other, much less why they would fall in love.And I really didn't like Clarice. She kept talking about how it was her duty to return to her kingdom and make a dynastic marriage, but she gave up her viriginity the first time Robert touched her.Robert semmed upset before Clarice left, but afterward he was okay because she'd told him to \\"be happy\\".

But Clarice gets more than she bargains for when they ride into Freya Crags. The Earl of Hepburn is as handsome as he is tortured. Yeah, they're totally going to fall in love.The main plot, as well as a couple of subplots involving a Colonel who tortured Hepburn while in his regiment and a magistrate Clarice is on run from, are compelling and suspenseful. The sexual tension between to two crackles, but when they actually get down to it, the descriptions are laughable. Seriously, I had to skip those parts as I would chuckle aloud, then my husband would ask what was funny and I'd read it to him, and neither of us could go back to reading soon because we were laughing too hard.

Disappointing."},{"Title":"Some Enchanted Evening (Lost Princesses)","review":"I really enjoy this author, and I enjoyed the story. Unfortunately, the grammatical issues and spelling errors in some cases make some parts of the reading annoying. The story did keep me guessing, and I did enjoy the suspense of it all."},{"Title":"Some Enchanted Evening (Lost Princesses)","review":"I docked the book for these reasons: Godfrey's character remains too uncertain throughout the book; it's hard to understand why Clarice wants to return so much after reading all about her grandmother; Robert worries about being like his father, but the reasons for that fear are not clear enough; it's not entirely believeable that a royal princess like Clarice would stoop to essentially being a peddler; and the resolution could be longer, more detailed.By ignoring those minor problems and maintaining the suspension of disbelief, Some Enchanted Evening is a very pleasant way to spend a few hours. Despite some believeability concerns, Clarice is a strong and likeable heroine who steels herself to put duty before love. Robert is a powerful and compelling hero who does not believe she's a princess until halfway through the book. Their love scenes ignite the page, and their sorrow at being parted echoes in the heart.There are some wonderful secondary characters, especially the old men--they're delightful! I'm looking forward to the next book. This one ends with a cliff-hanger -- humorous and exciting, just the thing to generate interest in the Amy's story....it's the wait that gonna be tough."},{"Title":"Some Enchanted Evening (Lost Princesses)","review":"Christina's characters have a natural feel to them and the dialog is realistic. The old men of the village are priceless! Her heriones are strong women that refrain from doing stupid things. How refreshing! This is a wonderful story. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Some Enchanted Evening (Lost Princesses)","review":"This is the second novel by Christina Dodd that I have read in the past year. I also read, \\"My Fair Enchantress\\". I gave that book four plus stars - it was an excellent read and I really enjoyed the story line and characters. In this next book, \\"Some Enchanted Evening\\", I found the characters interesting as well as the story line but, I would not rate it as great of a read as the first book I had chosen.Although I liked the story line of this book quite a bit - three princesses (Sorcha, Clarice & Amy) are taken from their respective countries and are sent off in hiding as killers are after them and their ruling families...a fellow prince (Rainger) of a neighboring country is also taken away and once released from his captivity makes an agreement with the princesses grandmother to get them back. If the prince finds the three girls, he can chose one to marry. So...it's off to the races. This story focused on the middle princess - Clarice. She also had an older sister Sorcha and a little sister Amy. Sorcha was gone elsewhere whereas Clarice and Amy were able to stay together.Clarice and Amy managed to outwit the bad guys by traveling town to town, peddling their family cosmetic secrets to local gals for their money and lodging. They would move on to new places to keep up the game and stay out of reach of the bad guys. They managed to do this for many years. Their grandmother was due to put notices in local papers when they could return to their own country safely - that had not happened yet.So...they find their way to a local town where a high ranking earl - Hepburn - Robert Mackenzie is running the show and the locals pay honor to him as an old war hero. They peddle their goods in his town and charm both men and women alike with their winsome ways. They state clearly they are princesses on the run and have stopped to give women happiness via their face and body creams. Everyone buys into the show. The girls stay on in town and thus...an attraction and relationship develop between Robert and Clarice as she stays at his castle to help with a large ball that is being thrown in honor of another great war hero- Ogley.Robert finds out Clarice stole her horse and is on the run from that too. He uses this information to bribe her to help him outwit the nasty war hero Ogley. She is to use her cosmetics and winsome ways to pretend to be an ex-mistress of Ogley so, that Robert and his friend Waldemar can corner the ex-war hero and get him to provide proper discharge and honorary release in the military to Waldemar that was taken away by by Ogley. Thus...a charade begins to help Robert fulfill this need help his friend. In turn, Clarice is trying to stay outside the bad guys trying to find her and Amy and the local magistrate who knows she stole his horse.I won't give the ending away suffice to say, the story course works itself out in the end (a wee bit too perfectly if you ask me) and everyone is happy, happy, happy. The story also alludes at the end that a new book will follow regarding Princess Amy and where her future travels will take her as she does not want to be a princess any longer. Not surprising there.I did find some inconsistencies in the story that prevented me from liking the story better. For instance...you would think lots of time elapsed between Clarice first coming to town, meeting the villagers, staying with Robert and his sister Millicent at the castle, the ball occurring and help being done for Waldemar and she outwitting the magistrate who arrests her. But...in reality, only a handful of days go by for all this to occur. During this time, Clarice and Robert manage to be highly attracted to one another, have many sexual outings and manage to fall head over heals in love and want to marry. This time frame didn't work for me at all - not realistic. A lifetime of events occur in about a two week time span (if not less) and I couldn't get into the emotions of these characters and find it real with so little time devoted to developing their relationship.Also...Clarice is supposedly on the run from not only bad guys trying to kill her and Amy for the crown but, also after her for horse theft. So...what would a girl do to stay hidden in obscurity...well for starters, ride into town after town, manage to make everyone notice her due to her beauty and outspokenness and proclaim loudly each time that she is a princess adrift from her country but, she is there to help everyone nonetheless. I would say that's keeping a low profile, don't you? I kept thinking if any of the bad guys or magistrate had half a brain and network of spies, she could have been found and nabbed very easily. Plus...she is supposedly a top beauty on a rare and priceless horse yet...no word of this goes from town to town after she leaves? And is it safe to be out riding alone like that - wouldn't someone try to rob or steal from her or worse? No...not our heroine. Apparently, she has a special protective safety bubble the rest of us don't have. These things didn't work for me.Also...Robert was in this emotionless bubble since coming back from war yet, in a matter of days he is suddenly a new man because of Clarice and their sexual and emotional encounters? Or that Clarice wants to return to her kindom and have a top marriage to continue the line yet..she will have sex with Robert at a moment's notice and not worry anymore about her thrown? Or that Millicent was this dull, dry and aged spinster with no back bone to show for herself and in a matter of days suddenly transforms into this lovely beauty with wit, spunk and courage? Once again...too many inconsistencies for me.Even though Clarice was a princess and Robert's sister Millicent running an Earl's estate...I didn't care for the way they treated their servants. For some reason, it was not appealing that the two main female leads would snap their fingers for something to happen, talk down to their staff and act as if they were less than average people. Yet...both Clarice and Millicent would be kind and warm to nearly everyone else. I felt they were demeaning to those in their work staff and that was not appealing to me. This was a small thing but, I noticed it anyway. You can be firm and have directive without being snotty and snooty.Last...I am not sure why this book is titled, \\"Some Enchanted Evening\\" (just because she's a princess in exile doesn't support \\"enchanting\\"). I do not remember any special night outing that would support such a title. I think they could have come up with a better title to support the story line. I say this because I like to have title's support the book as well as the cover designs and photos. For me, it helps for some reason.Rainger, the forgotten prince, actually seemed like an interesting character but, we only got to see snippets of him as a child at court and then once or twice as an adult as he searched for and found Clarice at the end. I think a story with him might be interesting and expect it will follow one day if it has not yet. My guess is that Amy will end up with her own knight in shining amour such as Clarice found and that oldest Princess Sorcha will end up with Prince Rainger as her own? Just my guess but, I would like to see that happen. We'll see.There were times during the reading of this book that I started to feel myself drift off and get bored - that's never a good sign in a love story. I gave three stars more for the author herself than the book. I like how she writes and feel she is very talented. This story just didn't seem well developed for me. Even though I would not consider this one of the best or better books I have read, it still had enough going on to be over-all pleasing. I would consider more of her books and hope you do too. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Some Enchanted Evening (Lost Princesses)","review":"I'm writing this review after reading the first and second book. This book was a great read. I only give it a four because I felt the ending was a little slow."},{"Title":"Some Enchanted Evening (Lost Princesses)","review":"Plot Summary: In the tiny kingdom of Beaumontagne, three young princesses are sent to England when rebels overthrow the monarchy. The girls are cut off from their home, country, and family, and they must learn how to survive on their own during the early 1800s. As the girls grow into women, and become separated even from each other. They were warned by their formidable grandmother to trust no emissary, because the rebels have dispatched assassins to kill the princesses, and thereby secure their hold over the country. Each book in the trilogy traces the story of one sister.I could easily envision Disney remaking these fairy-tale stories into movies, minus the hot sex of course, so if you like historical romances involving royalty, I can recommend this trilogy. These books are fluffy pieces of confection for the mind, and while they lack the intensity to truly shock and startle the reader, they will please that craving for a well-done fantasy where the outcome is already known. Dodd does an excellent job setting up truly unique plots for each princess, so I never felt like I was reading a carbon copy of a previous story. I also commend this trilogy for having a harmonious blend of romance, action, danger, and surprisingly gratifying sex, which kept me happily entertained on every page.The first story, \\"Some Enchanted Evening,\\" follows the middle sister, Claire, who peddles \`royal' cosmetic secrets from town to town. It would be an innocent occupation if Claire were simply a precursor to a Mary Kay saleslady, but Claire works each town as a con artist, rather than an honest businesswoman. These shenanigans get her into trouble with the law, so when the local aristocrat, Robert MacKenzie, Earl of Hepburn, gives her an invitation to stay in his home and plan his upcoming party, she cannot refuse despite her gut instincts. Robert is not fooled by Claire's miracle beauty treatments, but he spies a chance to use her in a revenge plot he's hatching. Robert and Claire's relationship blooms just when someone from her past tracks her down, but at this point Robert has changed from being suspicious of Claire, to becoming her ally and protector."},{"Title":"Some Enchanted Evening (Lost Princesses)","review":"now I can see what all the fuss is about.

He's a \\"brooding wounded soldier\\" but so much more.I am surprised that I enjoyed this romance as I don't normally enjoy \\"royalty\\" romances, as the heroines tend to be \\"too stupid too live\\"-but this series is different as the 3 Princesses must fend for themselves-and the years in exile have made them savvy and street smart.The bedroom scenes are VERY well written and highly sensual. Don't read a Dodd if explicit scenes offend you as they are pretty predominant here.Interesting story and characters, romance, adventure and hot, hot, hot. What more could you want in a romance.4 stars."},{"Title":"Some Enchanted Evening (Lost Princesses)","review":"It's not \\"AMAZING\\" romance by any means. But it was definetly a good read. I'd recommend it if your favorite writers -- much like mine -- are busy writing something new and you need something to tide you over :)"},{"Title":"Some Enchanted Evening (Lost Princesses)","review":"This is the first novel of the Lost Princess series. This book has a great mystery, danger and amazing love story. The novel is based around three princess who leave their country due to war. They left their home as children and now young women trying to survive. This story is Clarice story (the middle daughter) who find love with Earl MacKenize. I can not wait until the next novel coming in Feb. 2006."},{"Title":"Some Enchanted Evening (Lost Princesses)","review":"I've read RUNAWAY PRINCESS and SOMEDAY MY PRINCE, and her princesses always face incredible problems resourcefully and bravely (sometimes not so bravely inside) and they get the best guys in romance. It's Christina Dodd's heroes who really work, this strong alpha guys who start out being overbearing and by the end of the book the heroine has brought him to his knees. That's why I want to be a princess in Christna Dodd's books. I want one of those guys."},{"Title":"Some Enchanted Evening (Lost Princesses)","review":"Lately, I've had difficulty reading past the first chapters of the books I bring home from the store or library -- I've become \\"disenchanted\\" with the offerings. In contrast, this newest book by Dodd held my attention, is fast-paced, and of course has a fairy-tale ending. I especially liked the hero and heroine. Clarice is strong, but not cold; Robert is strong, cold, but then thaws -- nicely. I disagree with the review which states that Robert seems to force Clarice into love-making. She clearly wants and enjoys each of their sensual encounters, and is even the aggressor at times. I think the whole story is wonderfully written, flows beautifully, and definitely has the reader (me) waiting for Amy's story, which will hopefully arrive soon!"},{"Title":"Some Enchanted Evening (Lost Princesses)","review":"This book was another good one from Christina Dodd. The story is about one of three lost princesses from a country called Beaumontage. Clarice is the middle daughter of the King of Beaumontage the kingdom is over thrown causing Clarice and her sister Amy to flee for their lives with only a small amount of money and some royal beauty products that they must sell to support themselves. For five years Clarice and Amy have had to go town to town &quot;selling beauty&quot; to unsuspecting town folk. After fleeing England for their lives they go to Scotland where Clairce is forced to go stay in the home of Robert MacKenize, the earl of Hepburn. He is an emotionally wounded war hero that needs Clairce to help get something that was lost to him and since he knows she's up to no good he knows that he can get her to help him with his plan.I found Clairce to be a very strong women who did what she had to do to support herself and her younger sister. I found myself feeling for Clairce because she was taken from a world of wanting for nothing, to one where she had nothing. She knew nothing of the world, she only knew how to be a princess and that her place in life was to make a good marriage. The only thing that I can say I did not like about Clairce was that for all her belief in duty she sure did give into Robert fast.Robert was a good hero. He wanted Clairce from the moment he met her and made no real effort to hide it. He was a little rough around the edges, but what else can you expect from a war hero? I enjoyed the fact that after he realized that he was treating his sister badly he changed his was and was a great brother to her. Robert was the true knight in shinning armour guy that all women dream about. I thougt over all that this was another great book by Christina Dodd and I can not wait until the next book, Amy's story comes out."},{"Title":"Some Enchanted Evening (Lost Princesses)","review":"SOME ENCHANTED EVENING is the first book in another series by Dodd, three princess/sisters who go into exile in England and lose each other and their contact with their kingdom. Clarice has to support her younger sister Amy so she sells cosmetics at parties (Mary Kay, anyone?) and gets tangled up with Robert, an earl who wants to use her and her skills at make-up in a scheme of revenge. It was a great story set in Scotland with a lot of excitement, adventure and of course great sex, but how long do I have to wait for the next story? I want to know what happens to the sisters, their grandmother the queen, and the prince. I really enjoy reading Dodd's books, but I wish she'd hold them until the whole seris can come out at once."},{"Title":"Some Enchanted Evening (Lost Princesses)","review":"When revolution overtook their small kingdom of Beaumontagne, the king sent his three daughters to England for safety. Despite the success of the counter-revolution, the three sisters are now lost, surviving on their wits in a foreign land. Middle sister, Clarice, is trying to stay ahead of the English law and make a living selling cosmetics when she travels to Scotland, to the fiefdom of Robert MacKenzie, Earl of Hepburn. Robert doesn't believe Clarice is a real princess, but he does suspect she's a great actor--and he needs an actor for a revenge plan.Robert invites Clarice to help his sister plan a ball to honor an English war hero and lets his desire urge him to a forceful seduction. Eventually he persuades Clarice to go along with his plan--but revenge has a way of backfiring and Clarice finds herself in danger. Can Robert admit the depths of his feeling to himself and admit the love he feels? Can Clarice give up her duty to her country and settle for love?Fans of highly sensual regency-era romance are likely to enjoy the Scottish setting, the dark and driven hero, and the duty-bound princess. I found the love scenes to be too similar to rape to appreciate the sensuality of the writing and am still confused as to how Robert could knife an English guard and not fear legal consequences.Author Christina Dodd will please her fans with this book but I couldn't help thinking that it could have been a bit more clever."},{"Title":"Some Enchanted Evening (Lost Princesses)","review":"Dark heroes are hard to write. Really. They usually come across as brooding and temper-tantrum-y. That said, I really liked Christina Dodd's brooding hero in this book, mostly because he wasn't a brooder by the end.

Ms. Dodd, if you read these reviews, hurry up with book two."},{"Title":"Some Enchanted Evening (Lost Princesses)","review":"I did like the story but it didn't flow very well. I noticed that Ms. Dodd makes a lot of little errors that prevents her books from being perfect. For this book it didn't make sense that Clarice would announce to the village that she is a princess if she is suppose to be in hiding from assasins. I mean really, if you are in hiding and afraid of being assasinated would you really let complete strangers know that you were a princess in exile? Also, Clarice doesn't want to go to the ball because she doesn't want the wrong people to recognize her; but then she announces to everyone in town and to the house guests that she is a princess. Realistically, word would reach all across that there was a lady around claiming to be a princess. I mean come on, let's make this flow a little better by making it a more realistic. I do understand that this book is a work of fiction but it is focusing on an era (circa 1808) that did exist and individuals just does not go around and annoucing that they are a princess in exile, especially if they are trying to hide from assasins. Wouldn't you agree fellow readers?"},{"Title":"Some Enchanted Evening (Lost Princesses)","review":"I was a bit disappointed in this book. I liked it for the most part, but I have enjoyed other Christina Dodd books much more, so I expected more; this one just didn't measure up to many of the others. Overall I enjoyed the book, but one thing annoyed me: The overly lengthy description (20 pages!) of the two main characters' special evening together. Some sex is certainly romantic and captivating, but I really don't need 20 pages of minute detail; I do have a decent imagination - I don't need absolutely every touch spelled out; it got to be boring and I no longer cared quite as much about their emotional ties (at least at that part of the book) - \\"come on already... get back to the story\\". As you see, it annoyed me enough to actually look back to see how many pages were spent on the one evening's exploits. Besides that, it was pretty good. I liked the main characters well enough and especially liked some of the secondary characters: the old men and Millicent in particular. Pretty good book, but not Ms. Dodd's best in my opinion; I'm not sure whether or not I'll read the rest of the princess series. This one just didn't grab me like many of her other books have."},{"Title":"Some Enchanted Evening (Lost Princesses)","review":"Christina Dodd is in top form with this one! I always love \\"royalty romances\\" anyway and this is one of the best plus a promising beginning to a new series. I thought Princess Clarice was a wonderful heroine because she was smart and funny and her \\"make-up\\" lessons for the other women are priceless (and timeless! I picked up a few tips myself.) I thought Robert was one of the most winning heroes ever, so real and so sexy. I couldn't blame Clarice for falling for him because I fell for him too. I can't wait to read more about the \\"Lost Princesses\\". Here's to hoping they all find the love they deserve!"},{"Title":"Some Enchanted Evening (Lost Princesses)","review":"I thought this was a perfect book to read on a summer evening -- sexy, fun and a great read.

It was worth the money!"},{"Title":"Some Enchanted Evening (Lost Princesses)","review":"I've read nearly every Dodd book. While I would not call this her &quot;best,&quot; it was an enjoyable read. The hero, Robert, is a little colder than most, but he warms up. The old men were priceless. All of the reasoning was not perfect -- but I can suspend my belief and enjoy a good passionate novel like this. I look forward to the other books in the series."},{"Title":"Some Enchanted Evening (Lost Princesses)","review":"Congrats to C. Dodd! This is a fun book, although I did hesitate with how at ease everyone is at the end when the &lt;ahem> decides to strike out on her own.

It not only details song selection, writing songs, working with the band and their job descriptions, but puts emphasis on your relationship with God. It also emphasises the communication between WL and pastor which is key. I've gone to this book when in a dilemma and thought, \\"Oh I know what chapter I need!\\" I've given away several and have just purchased another copy for myself. I've read it backwards and fowards three (3) times so far."},{"Title":"Mad Dogs: The New Rabies Plague (Louise Lindsey Merrick Natural Environment Series)","review":"The back cover of this book states, &quot;His (i.e., the author's) rare inside look into politics and the science within public bureaucracies will engross those interested in science, public health issues, pet owners and wildlife enthusiasts, and those fascinated by infectious disease threats&quot;. This statement is true. Actually it is a 'good read' for anyone and falls into the same ilk (though not necessarily so good) as Watson and Crick's &quot;Double Helix&quot;. For those interested in pure entertainment, the book makes good bedtime reading for the general public and scientist alike. In fact, this true story has enough human interest, petty personal politics, good guys and not so good guys, and institutional politics to have the makings of a politics/science soap opera. For those wanting to be informed or educated the book gives a good view as to how public health officials, both competent and incompetent, approach the control of a disease outbreak, whether it be real or potential. It is also instructive in general terms because it illustrates how political influence can interfere with proper public health measures. This should provide the general public with some insight into how disease control processes can be blocked by becoming political footballs (ala AIDS) which is, in itself, a significant contribution to having an informed public. Finally, for those interested in wildlife disease, especially beginning wildlife epidemiologists and managers, there is a concise history of wildlife rabies in North America and the means that have been used to control it. The book could be used as an introduction to wildlife disease courses because it touches or raises indirectly all of the problems that one encounters in the control and study of disease in wildlife, e.g., proper sampling, population estimates, and the effects of home range and animal transport on these, to name a few. However, the efficacy of the book as a source of scientific information would have been enhanced if the passages referring to epidemiological and scientific issues had been more expansive. In some instances, these issues were merely mentioned in passing. However this is not a major deficiency since it was not the intention of the author to produce a textbook. As a reader, the major negative of the book was that there were areas of repetition (intentional or poor editing?) and sometimes the author seemed to use chronology as an organizing principle and at others he used topics. The latter has resulted in some confusion, but perhaps this approach was necessary because of the difficult task of drawing a number of disparate events and personalities together into a common plot theme, not unlike an Inspector Frost, or P. D. James mystery."},{"Title":"Mad Dogs: The New Rabies Plague (Louise Lindsey Merrick Natural Environment Series)","review":"CHAPTER EIGHT &quot;Face on a Plague&quot; starts of with an inaccurate statement, and it was very disappointing!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Renaissance of wonder: The fantasy worlds of C.

A childhood friend's younger brother has died, apparently of a heart attack. The pacemaker he wore because of a congenital heart defect seems incidental, and yet, his sister questions natural causes as the reason for his death. Claudia agrees to investigate and soon finds herself immersed in a shadier side of Sydney--that of crime boss, Harry Lavender.Plotting for the book is fairly complex, with a couple of twists and turns; most come to mind, however, before they are carried to their end, with few real surprises. The story requires from the reader several leaps of faith in following Valentine from clues to their interpretations.More engaging than plot are the characters in the book. Claudia has several sources of information, from the computer expert to a reporter friend, and Detective Carol Rawlings, a school pal now with the police department. On the other side of the coin are associates of Harry Lavender: lowlife small-time crook, Ronny O'Toole; the big Maori with the bigger knife; and Johnny the Jumper, so-named for his method of exacting punishment.Most enjoyable of all in this book are the descriptions of the Australian city. What Fusilli does for New York City, Day does equally as well for Sydney. I look forward to reading the other three books in this series."},{"Title":"The Life and Crimes of Harry Lavender","review":"This book is a quick and enjoyable introduction to Sydney private investigator Claudia Valentine. Claudia's usual area of expertise is insurance investigation, but when an ex-school friend calls on her about her dead brother she feels compelled to help determine whether his death was the accidental heart failure it was ruled, or something more sinister.Not long into her investigation she gets the distinct impression that she is being followed, an impression that is confirmed telling her she must be onto something. Helped by friends and nosy neighbours alike, Claudia learns enough to get herself into more than one dangerous tight spot, mixing it up with the feared Harry Lavender.THE LIFE AND CRIMES OF HARRY LAVENDER is the first book in the Claudia Valentine series and Valentine proves to be a no-nonsense, tough woman who views the world through a jaundiced eye, ready with a quip to lighten the moment. It's a fast-paced book that is tightly plotted moving logically from clue to clue. On the down side, coincidence seems to play a big part in the story with unlikely interconnections between characters popping up throughout the book.This is an enjoyable though uncomplicated series introduction."},{"Title":"The Life and Crimes of Harry Lavender","review":"I studyed this novel in class and it was quite a rereshing change from the bland books usually read. From the very first page Marele Day challenges the stereotypes and ideas set in the responders head in relation to gender issues. Her character, Claudia Valentine, uses karate as a weapon rather then typical violence such as knifes or guns. She is the intellectual equal of any male, completing her job sucessfully and out witting any in her path. She is also the intellectual equal of Harry Lavender, the \\"evil\\" character in the story. Not only fighting to seek truth over a murder mystery but also to gain revenge.Definatly a worhtwhile read, with great twists, it will have you attemtping to solve the mystery right from the first clue."},{"Title":"The Life and Crimes of Harry Lavender","review":"Marele Day seems extremely apt at definitions. I have heard the word 'wit' said about her books, however, this word is only appropriate if you add 'half' in front of it.

Next time Day is looking up a definition, it may be appropriate for her to look up the meaning of farce."},{"Title":"The Life and Crimes of Harry Lavender","review":"This book is just great.

THIS BOOK PROVIDES AN INTERESTING AND MORE BALANCED ACCOUNT OF THE RISE AND FALL OF THE AZTEC EMPIRE. MR.KOCH TAKES THE READER ON A JOURNEY THAT PROVIDES BETTER INSIGHT INTO THE MOTIVATIONS OF BOTH THE AZTECS AND THE SPANIARDS TO DOMINATE THE LANDS OF MEXICO."},{"Title":"Aztecs, the Conquistadors, and the Making of Mexican Culture","review":"There is no denying that Peter O. Koch is a great storyteller. His newest historical novel is easy to read and offers interesting theories of the motives and actions of the main character of the tragic events in Mexico in the early 16th century. Despite the list of notes and consulted literature, it is certainly not a historical study. The author is shockingly inconsist in the spelling of names, not only Aztec names but Spanish ones as well (has the editor been asleep or what?) and his use of sources is dubious. He used William Prescott's more than 150 years old account of the conquest of Mexico as his most trusted source - as if historians have been in limbo for all these years. The second part of the title of his book is simply wrong, because it is not what the book is about. However, all these faults would be acceptable had the author gone through the trouble of studying the story more in depth. In particular his account of the amount of human sacrifices made by the Aztec is not based on facts and a repetition of a lie started by Cortes and his soldiers. If he would have read Peter Hassler's excellent study 'Menschenopfer bei den Azteken', he would probably have developed more sensitivity to the Aztec side of the story. What we are left with is a book that is entertaining but a mere repetition of many of the falsities that have been told in the last five centuries about the Aztecs as a bunch of murderers who seemed to have enjoyed ripping people's hearts out. The enormous atrocities of the Spaniards perpetrated during and after the conquest and the infectious diseases introduced to the continent have produced a number of casualties many thousandfolds higher. Maybe that is what Koch's next book should be about - just to restore the balance a bit."},{"Title":"Engels Extension","review":"Based on my 50 years of professional experience in strategic warfare, Ross is to be congratu- lated for the technical accuracy of this book. In addition, the literary style is excellent. The style is so exciting and compelling that it is difficult to put the book down. It is reminiscent of Tom Clancy's novels. While the &quot;cold war&quot; is often portrayed as finished, in much of the current media presentations, this novel illlustrates the many threatening scenarios that can arise out of a world that is supposedly at peace. Again, an excellent historic and real presen- tation."},{"Title":"Engels Extension","review":"Engels Extension grabbed my attention right from the start.

A lot of people say that about a lot of books. But this book has an unbelievable ability to grab you and keep you. I was sweating from the first few minutes! The climax was totally unexpected. It left me literally out of breath. I've read thousands of books. Not many have this effect. While this is a technothriller, one thing I, as a woman, really liked was that it had good character development and a lot of humor. It made me care about the people, and about our country's future. It's patriotic, without being sappy or ridiculously macho. I've recommended it to dozens of people. I'm eager to see how the author will top this one with the rumored sequel!

Complacency is unacceptable when it comes to protecting the U.S.A. You will have a very different outlook on defense strategy after reading this book. You will be astonished, overwhelmed, and highly entertained! Hats off to the new &quot;Clancy&quot;!!!"},{"Title":"Engels Extension","review":"Many thrillers - no, make that many -books-, lose a lot of credibility by making errors in the details. Ross sets forth a scenario that is original as far as my (active) reading in the thriller genre can see. He maintains credibility for the scenario by not dropping the detail ball. No magazine changes in revolvers here...when someone makes that kind of error and then expects me to believe they know what they're writing about, it falls flat. Ross' work stands tall. Another thing I really liked about the book were the 'everyday heroes' in it. Heroic folk and actions portrayed realistically - neither the 'loser turns over a new leaf' fantasy or cardboard superheroes. A very impressive first effort. One of the great things about reading a great first novel is looking forward to following the writer's career. More, Mr. Ross, more!"},{"Title":"Engels Extension","review":"The action-techno genre is fast becoming a publishing staple.

EGRoss, was not only an amazing author, but an amazing painter (Which, if his artwork were to be sold as prints, would out sell VanGough prints), a columnist, a husband, a uncle, a son, a friend, a cribbage master, a Star Trek fan, and in my opinion..., to put it one word, a genius. His passing came too early in life, when he was at his peak of intellectual capabilities (if not still on the rise.) I'm grateful that I had him in my first 18 years of life on earth, because he made me think during conversations. His books are more complex then Tom Clancy's and more imaginative (Plus, E.G. Ross doesn't pay other people to write his books). Although his books never saw commercial success, they deserve a place in my top 5 favorite books and the rest of the book reading community.

However, the book had three failings that caused me to rate it lower. 1) Is it a techno-thriller, or a fantasy? One of the characters has the ability to slow time, somewhat like a superhero in a comic book. This is inappropriate and unnecessary, and detracted from the believability of the story.2) The author develops some interesting characters, and does it quite well, but doesn't take them far enough. Is there someone like Jack Ryan in Tom Clancy's thrillers that is the main character in this book? No. Instead, there are several minor, but interesting people, but I have no idea who might be included in a sequel.3) The novel concerns a conflict between the West and a resurrected Soviet Union. The Russians have two surprises for the West; one is a bio-warfare virus, while the other is a new weapons technology. One, it seems, is merely a feint to distract the West's attention from the real attack. But why? There's no reason why one surprise alone wouldn't be sufficient to destroy the West, so why is there unexplained redundance?Perhaps I'm too picky. The book is well written, and contains more than it's share of surprises for the reader. I would've liked for some of the characters to be developed a bit more, and it seemed very discordant to me when supposedly normal people had comic book hero superpowers. I don't like this mixing of genres.Even so, the author's next book may be much better, with just a little more discipline in his story telling. If he writes another, I'll probably read it."},{"Title":"Engels Extension","review":"Tom Clancy, move over! E. G. Ross' ENGELS EXTENSION is as fast moving and exciting a techno-thriller as it is thoughtful and disturbingly prophetic in its political commentary. Hidden among the antimatter weapons, lasers and cloaking devices of the next century, a refreshing commentary on the dangers of today's politically-correct &quot;feelgood&quot; philosophy runs throughout the book. The danger of losing our freedom is ever-present; and it is the power of the independent mind and the unlimited abilities of man, unfettered by guilt-ridden rhetoric, that ultimately saves America from total destruction. There are lessons on many levels, and Engles Extension is an exciting and action-filled way to learn them.

His chapters on Socialism, Anarchism, & Communism are especially cogent though it seems pretty obvious to me. \\"True believers\\" will probably not respond to his rational approach, others will find them a bit banal, I think. The bottom line though is his apologetic for his own organization which published this (and other of his works), \\"The Great School of Natural Science\\" of which I have no other knowledge. Despite his many references to natural science, there isn't much of it in this book at all (I'm a retired physicist & systems engineer). The book was published in 1955, still, it's not a scientific work at all IMHO.

It is especially exciting to me that this book is not the type of writing that seemingly only other scientists can understand.-From someone who has never studied physics nor astronomy in a classroom yet wants to know the &quot;real&quot; science behind humanity's &quot;big&quot; questions."},{"Title":"The Prophet and the Astronomer","review":"I just finished reading this book, and I must say that it took much longer than usual to get through it. I tended to read it a bit at a time because, although interesting, it was quite hard to get through. The main reason for this, I think, is that it's filled to the brim with physics-related information - and I have little to no physics background with which to understand these concepts. It's because I believe that many others would be stumped by this information as well, that I have rated \\"The Prophet & the Astronomer\\" a 3.Beyond the complicated physics theories, I found this book to provide quite an interesting look at cosmology through the ages. The author discusses how several hundred years ago, most people believed that such things as comets & shooting stars were actually meant to warn them of bad things to come - famine, war, death, etc... This is how cosmology began to influence, and be influenced by, theology/religion.He then goes on to show how many cults of past & present still use this type of information to scare their followers into continued cult association, and how they also use such things as comets & shooting stars to then explain away why their predictions didn't come about as they said it would - for ex., they might say that they just saw a shooting star, and this means that God has changed his timing...It's also shown how each culture tends to believe that the end of the world will occur in their lifetime - people have been preparing for this for thousands of years...One can see through the progression of this book how some people today still believe much the same things as those in times past re: cosmology & the end. However, now more than ever, science has been at the forefront of this exciting field, as opposed to religion. However, the author believes that science & religion don't have to be on opposite sides of the fence on this issue - as both are essentially trying to answer the same questions.Overall, I would recommend this book to those who have an interest & background in physics in general, and cosmology in particular. I think you will find it an interesting read."},{"Title":"The Prophet and the Astronomer","review":"I read this book primarily on the basis of the recommendation by Freeman Dyson who wrote that this book gives a clear picture of &quot;science evolving within the culture of religion that gave it birth&quot; At the risk of disagreeing with one of my favoritie science authors I would have to say that this book fails. I cannot think of a single book on the same subject, however, that succeeds. The author writes well but does not convince me that the science of today is motivated by the same instincts and attitudes that underlay the concerns of religion in anything more than a superficial sense. The only book to succeed in my memory was &quot; tao of physics&quot; which , unfortunately was simply wrong.There is a brave attempt to explain inflation theory in an original way, but it too fails. The most interesting chapters are on comets and asteroids, but apart from introducing the subject by pointing out that people had always thought of comets as ill omens there is no real link between how people may have thought then and how or what they think now. The fact is there is a huge difference in our understanding of cosmology. We may want to know about the stars for many of the same reasons. But that is a trivial observation. Science is no longer a religious occupation.In short I think it is another attempt to fill a market niche of &quot;science-religion&quot;, but without any real ideas it fails. I wish Mr. Dyson would actually read the books that he recommends."},{"Title":"The Prophet and the Astronomer","review":"The Prophet and the AstronomerBy Marcelo GleiserBook ReviewBy Richard E. Noble\\"In this book I explore religion's assimilation of cataclysmic cosmic phenomena and its influence on scientific thought through the ages from the pre-Socratic philosophers of ancient Greece to modern day cosmology ... Indeed, I will argue that we create a scientific world as we do a spiritual one - in order to overcome fear, to defy time, to understand our place in the world, and to justify our lives ... Drawing on the Book of Danial, the Book of Revelation, and an investigation of apocalyptic sects, art and literature we will examine the formation and evolution of the solar system, the extinction of dinosaurs, Einstein's general theory of relativity, pulsars and black holes, the big bang and the inflationary universe, all the way to the latest ideas on cosmology.\\"Reading the above, a curious reader who is not familiar with Marcelo Gleiser might conclude that this is a book by some right wing religious preacher type who is going to do a mystical tap dance on the science of the Universe.Not so.Marcelo Gleiser is the real thing. He is a professor of Natural Philosophy, physics, astronomy at Dartmouth College.If you are like me and found your way to an interest in the origins of the Universe and science in general via early religious training followed by studies of early Greek and Roman philosophers, then you will enjoy reading this book.This author keeps it as simple and understandable as could be expected while dealing with highly complicated cosmological theory and speculative particle physics.The first part of the book was right up my alley. The reader is taken back to before the time of Christ and the Christian era. The author links the ancient Greek and Roman philosophers and philosophies to the heavens.We learn about Zoroaster and other pre-Christian like tales. We see how the heavens have always played their part in the hopes and fears of humans. We see the connection between astrology, astronomy, religions and their holy books.We delve into comets and asteroids make connections between then and now. The old superstitions are constantly being updated to our present day superstitions and similarly cultish ideas. The author continually attempts to explain to the reader the difference between religious superstition and science.This is easier said than done.As the author delves more and more deeply into speculative cosmology and particle physics, the Big Bang, black holes and whatnot, the line between the fantasies of the superstitious and the scientific get more and more blurred.The bottom line: \\"First and foremost, science does not promise redemption. Science is a human invention preoccupied with understanding the workings of nature ... Science may not offer eternal salvation, but it offers the possibility of a life free from the spiritual slavery caused by the irrational fear of the unknown ... Thales of Miletus during the sixth century B.C.E. tried to understand the workings of nature, without invoking the actions of gods or God.\\"Despite Thales the author points out repeatedly the many geniuses of science who specifically sought science as their means to establish the truth of their religious beliefs. Isaac Newton stands out among these. Isaac actually gave up his endeavors in science as a waste of his time to delve more deeply into what really mattered ... the Bible and God's revelations.But as the author attempts to assuage our fears with the wonders of science, he exposes us to new real fears.\\"The conclusion is clear: Earth has been bombarded by large objects in the past and not so distant past, just like all other bodies of the solar system. Scientists use terms like \`cosmic pinball', \`cosmic shooting gallery', 'target earth' and so forth to illustrate the fact that collisions are an integral part of life in the solar system.\\"So the end of our world may still be just around the corner, Big Bang or no Big Bang and whether there is a God around that corner or not. The point being that science may not eradicate all our fears but it may provide a rational explanation.That could be considered helpful; then on the other hand, maybe not.\\"If the history of life on earth, in all its myriad forms, can be understood as an experiment in evolutionary genetics orchestrated by natural selection, the emergence of intelligent life seems to be the result of a chance occurrence, an odd event that would be extremely hard to duplicate elsewhere. The long reign of the dinosaurs ... success and longevity as a species makes it hard to argue for the necessity of intelligent life at the top of the evolutionary chain ... it is much easier to argue for extraterrestrial life than for extraterrestrial intelligent life.\\"We are all aware via Einstein and his famous theory of relativity that matter can be turned into energy but what about the reverse?\\"The converse is also true, energy can turn to matter; it is possible for highly energetic photons ... to spontaneously create particles of matter.\\"Now this is my theory and not the authors.For years I have been reading about a lack of matter in the universe and how nothing can travel faster than the speed of light. It seems that when something (for lack of a more scientific word) approaches the speed of light it gains in mass and consequently slows down. As it continues to slowdown and gains in mass, could it not then turn back into matter at some point along the way?If the answer is yes, then are we not back to the possibility of a steady state universe with matter transforming into energy and energy reforming into matter according and in concordance with the laws concerning the conservation of energy and matter? In which case there is not a lack of matter in the universe. What has always been there, is always there in one form or the other ... and in balance.A few pages later in this book the author criticizes scientific thinkers like Hoyle because their steady state notions suggest that matter must be created ex nihilo (from nothing) to sustain the steady state notion.No, not from nothing does the necessary matter come, but from the energy (light) gaining mass and transforming back into matter.The author is an avid Big Bang supporter. I am not.I try my best to follow along but much of what the author explores in this regard, I feel will all be scrapped as time rolls on.I'm referring to background noise, time having a beginning and ending, that time did not exist prior to the Big Bang, cosmological constants and the super inflationary early universe. All this I find dubious and compensating along with much else that Marcello hypothesizes and speculates upon.But Professor Gleiser's theorizing won't be scrapped by the likes of me. And I intend to keep reading this author. I know one thing for sure. If the science changes, so will Marcelo Gleiser. Because he is a scientist and not a dogmatist ... or a theologian for that matter.Richard Edward Noble author of \\"Bits and Pieces\\" Hobo Philosopher series."},{"Title":"The Prophet and the Astronomer","review":"Cosmology is a contact sport.

I could quibble with some of the choices he made. He leaves out some things which perhaps he should have included, and includes others which he should have left out. Also, like many modern-day scientists, he sometimes is a little condescending towards ancient philosophers, but in general he does a great job of integrating modern and anicent ideas.My complaint is that the book is the wrong size. I have to admit I am not sure what size it should have been. It is a standard 250-page trade book, but it really should have either been a thin pamphlet or a thick tome-- or possibly a richly illustrated coffee table book a la Carl Sagan's Cosmos.

They are usually called the Jungle Novels. In the first book; Government, there is a detailed explanation of the social and economic structure under the dictatorship of Porfirio Diaz. We see how Indian peon work on farms as serfs, always in dept to the large land owners. In some ways the first book reminded me of the books of Victor Hugo where he combines social science with novel.In the second book; The Carreta, a young man makes his living traveling the roads of Mexico with an ox drawn cart full of goods owned by his master.This third novel in the series is actually better than the first two in some ways. In the first novel, Traven gives a tremedous amount of social commentary, which is good, but the characters lack the cohesion and depth of a novel. In the second novel, a romance between Andres and a young runaway Indian girl becomes a marriage, but they experience one challenge after another in a system that is rigged against them.In this third novel, Celso, a young Indian man who has assumed his father's debts and has gone to work in the mahogony plantations of Southern Mexico, must survive under the cruelest and most brutal of conditions. Celso is a more heroic character than characters in the first two novels. He is heroic in assuming his father's debts. He has a critical consciousness that allows him to make judgements about the system in which he is trapped. He begins to try to figure a way out of the system instead of resigning his fate to daily back breaking toil and death. The reader dearly wants him to escape. Therefore the reader becomes more emotionally involved in his struggel to escape from the man-destroying experiences of the Monteria, the mahogany plantations. Celso has a sense of justice and injustice that allows him to look beyond his personal circumstance and at the circumstances that entrap his people."},{"Title":"March To The Monteria -A Novel Originally Publ. 1971, 3rd of \\"Jungle Novels\\" of Mexican, Revolution","review":"This superb novel is one of several \\"jungle books\\" by the author that describes exploitation and debt slavery among the impoverished Indians of Southern Mexico in the early 20th Century.The story centers on Celso, an illiterate young Indian trying to earn enough money to buy a wife. Celso works two years on a ranch, only to lose most of his savings in a quasi-legal swindle. He then undertakes a dangerous trip into the jungle, and contracts to work in a jungle logging camp - called a Monteria. After two years of ceaseless labor on the Monteria he tries to return home with his savings to marry. Once again he is cheated, this time by an under-handed conspiracy involving agents, contractors, and the law. Celso then tries to adjust to his situation as he joins the forced march of fellow pseudo-slaves deep into the jungle to their new Monteria. Readers quickly identify with Celso as he attempts to control his life despite an unfair system that repeatedly cheats and abuses people like him.Author B.

Do not pass up this chance to encounter one of the most startling, emotionally rattling, and beautifully written pieces of noir in American literature. \\"Rendezvous in Black\\" is nothing short of a masterpiece: strange, horrifying, sometimes illogical, stark, achingly poetic, and ultimately devastating.Cornell Woolrich (1903-1968) was the father of noir. Originally an author of \`disaffected youth' novels in the jazz era, Woolrich turned to suspense and mystery stories for the pulp magazines in the mid-thirties. In 1940 he wrote the novel \\"The Bride Wore Black,\\" kicking off a hugely creative period in which he wrote eleven novels (sometimes under the pseudonyms William Irish or George Hopely) between 1940 and 1948, concluding with \\"I Married a Dead Man\\" (available in the compilation \\"Crime Novels: American Noir of the 30s and 40s\\" and also one of his best works). Woolrich then entered a long phase of writer's block, turning out a few more novels and stories before he died an alcoholic recluse. His work is deeply concerned with doom and fate, people trapped in an uncaring world, the slow loss of love, and the inevitability of death. Through it all flows his incredible sense of pacing -- he can wring you dry with \\"races against the clock\\" that make your chest pound like race car piston -- and his stunning word magic that can break your heart with just a sentence.\\"Rendezvous in Black\\" is the second-to-last novel of his major period, and it seems to return to the plot of \\"The Bride Wore Black\\"...at least on the surface. In \\"The Bride Wore Black,\\" a woman named Julie Kileen loses her husband to a bizarre accident on their wedding day. Julie then goes on a quest to track down the five men she believes are responsible for the accident, and kill them one by one after inserting herself into their lives. \\"Rendezvous in Black\\" reverses the sexes, and adds an extra twist. Johnny Marr, an anonymous, average young man, loses his fiancee a few days before their marriage in a weird, bolt-from-the-blue accident (the perfect Woolrich example of the random cruelty of the universe). Marr eventually snaps, and discovers the identities of the men he feels are responsible for the accident. He then seeks to slowly, meticulously track down each one, discover who the most important woman in the man's life is (daughter, wife, protege), and kill her, so that man will forever know the pain that he feels.It's a grim, frightening premise. Woolrich repeats the episodic structure of \\"Bride\\": after the opening chapter introducing the main character and his quest, each chapter after that switches to the P.O.V. of the next person on Marr's \`hit list.' But \\"Rendezvous\\" isn't just a rehash of \\"Bride.\\" As Woolrich's biographer, Francis M. Nevins, pointed out, it is \\"Bride\\" as it should have been, written with greater emotional involvement and deeper horror and suspense. It seems as if Woolrich was trying to correct the flaws of the earlier novel.Correct them he does: \\"Rendezvous in Black\\" opens with a long, stunning chapter, \\"Parting,\\" that captures perfectly the horror of losing a loved one, and then contains one of best portraits I've ever read of a descent into insanity. It's one of Woolrich's best sustained pieces of emotional writing. Each chapter after that, Woolrich tortures us with the suspense as we meet the next target of Marr's horrid quest. Woolrich's use of suspense here is brilliant: as in Hitchcock, we know WHAT will happen, but never WHEN, HOW, or even WHO (which woman in the man's life is Marr's target?). Since we don't know what Marr looks like or what fake name he is using, we aren't even sure which man in the chapter is actually the killer! Meanwhile, the police start to string things together, and with each chapter, Woolrich screws down the suspense tighter and tighter. The second to last chapter is a massive race against death that will probably have you locked in a room reading with sweaty, shaking hands. Even though there are logic flaws in the story the size meteor craters (this is Woolrich's way of showing how universe's basic illogic and unfairness), you won't notice them. Woolrich holds you in an unbreakable spell.Read this book. It is an American classic. You will never forget its power. And you'll encourage the publication of more Woolrich classics. Look forward to re-prints of \\"Black Alibi\\" and \\"Night Has a Thousand Eyes.\\" When you discover Cornell Woolrich, you will never be the same again."},{"Title":"Rendezvous in black (Pocket book)","review":"How could anyone not love Cornell Woolrich? He ranks right up there with James M. Cain, Dashiell Hammett, and Raymond Chandler as one of the godfathers of pitch-black noir. Unfortunately, Woolrich's voluminous short stories and his many novels for the most part remain out of print. No excuse exists to merit such blatant disrespect. Happily, several Woolrich works have begun to reemerge to the delight of noir fans. For example, Woolrich biographer and all around noir aficionado Frances M. Nevins edited a collection of fourteen delightfully bleak stories in the recent \\"Night & Fear.\\" Now we have \\"Rendezvous in Black\\" thanks to the Modern Library publishing house. We can only hope that other novellas head to store shelves soon, specifically \\"The Bride Wore Black\\" and \\"Night Has A Thousand Eyes.\\" But even more fascinating than his stories is the author's life. Cornell Woolrich lived from one black depression to another. He worshipped his mother, drank incessantly, and kept his true sexuality repressed. It was an overriding fear of his mortality and the cruel randomness of the world around him, however, which fueled his desolate visions. Sad to say, but Woolrich's miseries have given generations of fans something to sing about ever since.\\"Rendezvous in Black\\" excels as an archetype of white knuckled, totter on the edge of your seat noir, a story even better than the author's phenomenal and oft copied \\"I Married a Dead Man.\\" This yarn concerns the activities of one Johnny Marr, an ecstatic young man set to marry the love of his life. When his girl, Dorothy, perishes in a freak accident involving a bottle dropped from a low flying plane, Marr's sanity melts away. The desolate young lover discovers the names of five men who bear the blame for the tragedy that destroyed his life, and he promptly embarks on a mission to wreak bloody revenge on these strangers. Marr will go after the people these men love the most in life, using any tricks he can muster in an effort to avenge his shattered life. Woolrich makes sure the reader understands exactly how far gone Marr is in the first chapter, as we see the young man continue to turn up at the couple's favorite meeting place night after night, waiting desperately for a woman who will never show up. Marr's activities assume a mindless repetition, an unremitting yet senseless hope that Dorothy will eventually appear, thus setting the tone for his single minded, relentless revenge plots later on.A rendezvous for each of Marr's enemies, five in all, unfold with cold, methodical precision. The first rendezvous achieves the least suspense of the five, a short chapter serving as a post-mortem of Marr's first act of revenge. It is here we learn how Marr will attack his enemies (through important women in their lives), and meet the cop, Detective Cameron, who takes on the case. The second rendezvous will set your nerves on edge as an illicit affair leads to disastrous consequences, including a vengeance seeking wife and a walk to the electric chair, for the second man on Johnny's list. In the third rendezvous, a wedge driven between a man and his wife results in a murder and a suicide. As the fourth act unfolds, a conceited, secretive daughter discovers the hard way that she should have listened to Detective Cameron and her parents. The denouement, the fifth rendezvous, involves that last man on the list and his childhood love. It also tries to show that nothing, neither running to the ends of the earth nor the best laid plans, will deter fate. If you feel like you've been chewed up and spit out by the time you reach the end of the book, don't fret. This reaction is normal when reading Cornell Woolrich. It is, in fact, exactly what you want to feel.The strength of \\"Rendezvous in Black\\" comes not from its staccato prose and descriptive metaphors, although these elements do play a large part in the success of the novel, but in Woolrich's bleak cosmology built on an unholy trinity of love turned bad, paranoia, and crushing fate. The accident that claims Dorothy, a bottle falling from the heavens, and the subsequent disasters visited upon those individuals Marr deems responsible, displays the writer's belief in a unsystematic, frequently cruel world where events unfold with ruthless certainty. Love is a good thing, or can be a good thing, but too often it morphs into something that can fuel neverending hostility and destruction. Richard Dooling, the author of the introduction to this edition of the novel, does an excellent job explicating the numerous themes in Woolrich's writings, a better job than I could possibly hope to do in a short review. But you don't need really need an introduction to see that the mindset behind the book is seriously depressing.The number of continuity errors, implausible events, and other mistakes in \\"Rendezvous in Black\\" leap off the page. I find it impossible to believe someone could drop a bottle out of an airplane as late the 1940s, for example. Too, I kept wondering whether Johnny Marr ever aged, as a considerable period of time passes from Dorothy's demise to the end of the book. How could Johnny possibly have wooed the teenaged Madeleine if he was in his late twenties? And considering Woolrich describes Detective Cameron as a bumbler, the cop possesses a tenacity that eventually pays off in the end. None of these problems takes anything away from the sheer power of the novel. There were times I literally felt like I couldn't stand the tension anymore, and any book that can cause that sort of sensation deserves attention. If you love noir, you need to read this one immediately."},{"Title":"Rendezvous in black (Pocket book)","review":"This is a suspense story in which one knows the killer and his victims and where there is nothing random about his choice of victims. The murders are acts of revenge against an unpremeditated, accidental death - a death that one can only characterize as 'fateful.' A bottle has been thrown from an airplane, killing a young woman standing by a store window in a busy street. She is waiting for her fiance. Out of the hundreds of people walking that street, it is she who has been dealt this fatal blow. It is an accident that could not have been foreseen, though it can be argued, that its negligence might have been anticipated.That is the beginning of the story. Woolrich wastes no time in setting the psychological tone. Her fiance arrives at their place of rendezvous, the scene of the accident, looks at the stricken woman, denies that it is his \\"Dorothy\\", then leaves the scene. Despite this initial denial, he knows, of course, that it is she, and from that moment a cataclysmic change occurs in his personality and his present world falls apart - a world of romance, marriage and well being. He sheds all innocence and becomes a man singularly possessed - a man seeking revenge against the carelessness of other men - determined to have them pay for this carelessness in the same way he has been forced to pay - destruction of what they prize most.It is a story, wonderfully told - direct, gripping and so thoroughly credible that you read through it quickly, hoping against hope that it will have a happy ending. But it doesn't."},{"Title":"Rendezvous in black (Pocket book)","review":"Plot summary: Ordinary young man loses the love of his life and vows revenge on people who took her from him: once a year, on the anniversary of her death, he will take the love of their life from one of them. A lone policeman becomes suspicious, but cannot convince anyone else that there is a pattern behind the deaths.This is last book in Woolrich's &quot;Black&quot; series of books, and is reminiscent of &quot;The Bride Wore Black&quot;, the first book in the series. It is a fascinating portrayal of a young man turning from a cipher into a force of nature to avenge his loss. Although episodic in nature (giving the prelude, revenge incident, and aftermath for each of the five men he holds responsible for his love's death), each episode is tied together and the intensity of feeling and suspense builds nicely. Although there are some major lapses in continuity and logic (eg. - one episode crucially happens after the end of World War II, while the following episode crucially happens *during* World War II), Woolrich is able to sweep you along so that you either don't notice these flaws, or you don't care about them."},{"Title":"Rendezvous in black (Pocket book)","review":"The introduction to this novel says that Woolrich has been described as the \\"Hitchcock of the Written Word,\\" but adds that maybe he wouldn't have liked this description. It might be even more accurate to say that Hitchcock is the Cornell Woolrich of the cinema - since many of Woolrich's works came before Hitchcock's, and Hitch even adapted one of Woolrich's stories into one of his most famous movies, Rear Window.The point, though, is that this guy writes suspense like you've never seen. I say \\"seen\\" because reading his novels is really a visceral experience. I don't know how he does it but Woolrich can write a beautiful, elegant story that you can sort of just almost SEE unfolding like a movie --- a movie that will move you emotionally and also scare the bejesus out of you.Rendezvous in Black contains six interlinked stories about six doomed love affairs threatened by violence. Five of these are labelled \\"The First Rendezvous\\" through \\"The Fifth Rendezvous.\\" The sixth is the story that ties them all together (but it comes first in sequence). I don't want to spoil the experience of reading this book for anyone, but overall it is just amazing and I cannot recommend it more highly. Woolrich, as has been noted here already, was a protege of F. Scott Fitzgerald's. Like Dashiell Hammett, he's an author who makes mysteries somehow as beautiful as what passes for \\"literature\\" - yet so emotionally gripping that you hardly notice till you are done how beautiful the craft of what you just read really was. The characters are spectacular and each one is described with wonderful psychological details. One of my favorites is this description of the police detective:\\"He was too thin, and his face wore a chronically haggard look...His manner was a mixture of uncertainty, followed by flurries of hasty action, followed by more uncertainty, as if he already regretted the just preceding action. He always acted new at any given proceedings, as if he were undertaking them for the first time. Even when they were old, and he should have been used to them.\\"Little gems like this are on almost every page of this book and they make for a wonderful reading experience you won't forget.I envy anyone about to read Cornell Woolrich for the first time. This book is a great place to start."},{"Title":"Rendezvous in black (Pocket book)","review":"This book is raw every which way. The sentences are ungrammatical, compound words invented by Woolrich pop out at you. Rendezvous in Black is a masterful anarchy of both structure and language. And it all works together as a suspenseful, surreal narrative.The main guy, Johnny Marr is the everyman become unhinged. At the outset we are introduced to him as one of those faces in the crowd, an unremarkable man, what they used to call in 1940s parlance an \\"Ordinary Joe.\\" He thinks he's got it pretty much figured out, he's staked out his claim-- he's got his girl, and has a little money in his pocket. But security is an illusion.A nightmarish accident kills his longtime sweetheart. Her battered body is displayed in death as a gory sideshow attraction on a nighttime street crowded with the sensation seeking public.The freakish and the unforeseen have just sent Johnny an express message straight from Woolrich's parallel universe. Fate has stepped up with a lesson: a cosmic smack in the face that knocks him back and sends him reeling. Now Johnny is compelled to take a detour from familiar and commonplace reality and ditch Main Street for a road of biblical wrath and revenge. This average guy is now on a fantastically contrived mission to make the \\"killers\\" pay for the death of his lost love and the end of all his hope for the future--by making them suffer the excruciating pain he suffers.Both Cornell Woolrich and Jim Thompson are masters of grit, the keynote of the noir genre. Woolrich could have been a celebrity name like Raymond Chandler, Dashiell Hammett and James M. Cain. He wasn't however a self-promoter. He was reclusive, tortured by personal demons and called seedy New York City hotel rooms his home.This book is an unremitting dark ride; the best of it's kind."},{"Title":"Rendezvous in black (Pocket book)","review":"Rendezvous in black is about this guy Johnny who finds his fiancee killed by something dropped off a plane - an accident, pure and simple. This triggers a fundamental reaction in Johnny -- a gruesome fate awaits the passengers of that plane...It's an excellent book, but then I've never read anything by Cornell Woolrich that hasn't been excellent. The language is somewhat complex, and Cornell's quick shifts from plain language to metaphors are sometimes a bit confusing, but also quite poetic.Warning: the downmost review contains spoilers for the ultimate fate of the main characters of the book!"},{"Title":"Rendezvous in black (Pocket book)","review":"Cornell Woolrich is a little known master who deserves to be discovered. I encourage you readers to walk down his inky black streets, to hide among the shadows, and know what it is to live in fear."},{"Title":"Rendezvous in black (Pocket book)","review":"On a mild midwestern night in the early 1940s, Johnny Marr leans against a drugstore wall. He's waiting for Dorothy, his fianc&eacute;e, and tonight is the last night they'll be meeting here, for it's May 31st, and June 1st marks their wedding day. But she's late, and Johnny soon learns of a horrible accident - an accident involving a group of drunken men, a low-flying charter plane, and an empty liquor bottle. In one short moment Johnny loses all that matters to him and his life is shattered. He vows to take from these men exactly what they took from him. After years of planning, Johnny begins his quest for revenge, and on May 31st of each year - always on May 31st - wives, lovers, and daughters are suddenly no longer safe ... Cornell Woolrich's most justly famous novel is one of the true masterpieces of suspense. Johnny exacts his revenge in five meticulously planned and utterly unpredictable murders that Woolrich unfolds with an almost demonic fatalism while the marvellously unheroic police officer MacLain Cameron is in accelerating pursuit. Woolrich's prose is unique. His style is strongly visual - we'd now call it cinematic even though it prefigured much of the film-noir effects that render it, today, almost clich&eacute;. His syntax is occasionally tortured, his word choices odd. Yet as his biographer Francis Nevins has noted, Woolrich's imperfections are a happy marriage of form and function. Without the sentences rushing out of control across the page like his hunted characters across the nightscape, without the maniacal emotionalism and indifference to grammatical niceties, the form and content of the Woolrich world would be at odds. Between his style and substance, Woolrich achieved the perfect union. There are moments when the melodrama builds to such an intensity that it tumbles over into a kind of empathy, e.g. Cameron's late visit to Dorothy's childhood home. You know it's ridiculous, but you feel something all the same. As monstrous as Johnny Marr's revenge is, few readers will be able to damn him completely. This kind of amoral centre is the dark sun around which much of the noir world turns, and Woolrich gives us one of the genre's finest examples. The Modern Library's 20th Century Rediscoveries edition is particularly valuable for its Reading Group Guide, and for Richard Dooling's fine introduction which points to further reading and finds the origins of the novel in Woolrich's own startlingly sad biography. Strongly recommended."},{"Title":"Rendezvous in black (Pocket book)","review":"RENDEZVOUS IN BLACK, one of the final novels in Cornell Woolrich's famous \\"black\\" series that have formed the basis for so many films noirs, is one of his most highly praised works. It is enormously suspenseful: an anonymous young man whose fianc&eacute;e has been killed in a freak accident instigated by a group of wealthy hunters in a low-flying plane takes his revenge by systematically murdering the woman most beloved to each of the five men so they can share in his grief. Each of the five murders occurs in a different chapter and told in a different style: we know that a woman is going to get it and when, but we don't know how and sometimes we don't even know who. Simultaneously, a police detetctive begins assembling clues to catch the killer. Certainly Woolrich can draw out the suspense in each chapter, and the schematic narrative (which often refers to the characters as \\"the man\\" or \\"the woman\\") invests the narrative with an almost allegorical quality that makes the whole work seem over-the-top. But there's very little character development in the text, and the shoddy ironic twists in several of the stories seem telegraphed a mile away. Also, the misogynistic undercurrent to most romans noirs seems queasily overemphasized here: except for the first victim (who dies the most gruesome of the deaths), each of the killer's targets intentionally defies the dictates of male authorities in her life, as if to suggest she deserves what's coming to her. Although on one hand this seems almost a pure distillation of the operatic fatalism of the roman noir, it's simply not as good a work as Woolrich's more fleshed-out books like WALTZ INTO DARKNESS or I MARRIED A DEAD MAN--not to mention such superior suspense novels of the period as (for example) Kenneth Fearing's THE BIG CLOCK or Elisabeth Sanxay Holding's THE BLANK WALL."},{"Title":"A Guide for Using The Giver in the Classroom","review":"I LOVE this book, and I was so excited to teach it!

I then read it and since then I've read a second time. It's a classic story about an orphan in 19th century London. Dickens was a writer before his time and I always enjoy reading his work. Definitely read Oliver Twist if you haven't already."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"Once upon a time, as a child, I read \\"Oliver Twist\\" in an issue of Classic Comics. Once upon a time, as a student, I worked through a reading list of paperback Dickens novels that, for whatever reason, did not include \\"Oliver Twist.\\" When I returned to this early Dickens novel, I read it on a Kindle. I am sorry it took me so long to get from the comic book to the real thing.The plot of \\"Oliver Twist is well known, so let me mention some other things that a grown up reader might enjoy. For one thing, the novel is an angry commentary on how a society treats its poor. The baby farms for orphans, the workhouses, and the apprentice situations have not lost their power to shock. The scene where Oliver dares to ask for more gruel is rightly famous, but there are many scenes that detail the routine near starvation of those dependent on \\"porochial\\" generosity. Along with these scenes go the overseers: the beadle, Mr. Bumble, and his estimable wife, both of whom are regularly depicted eating and drinking their fill. The fact that they are one step removed from poverty only increases their contempt for those beneath them.The London in which Oliver eventually finds himself is equally vivid, drawn from those dank nooks and corners Dickens observed as a young man as he went about his work as a reporter. He also knew well Newgate Prison, where Fagin spends his final days; Dickens had already written about it in an earlier sketch.Another aspect of the novel that is gripping is the way Dickens depicts abusive relationships between men and the women who are love them. The relationship of Bill Sikes and Nancy is the most famous, but it is paralleled by the connection between the snitch Noah Claypole and his subservient Charlotte (both of whom torment Oliver when he is apprenticed at Sowerberry the coffin-maker's). Dickens humorously reverses this dynamic when he depicts Mrs. Bumble ruling over the craven Mr. Bumble, but we understand that this is the exception, rather than the rule. Oliver's existence is, to some extent, the result of the unequal relationship between his father and his mother.The character of the diabolical Fagin induces an unease in a modern reader that Dickens's readers mostly did not feel. He is almost always called \\"the Jew\\" and is, in accordance with the stereotype, preoccupied with money. One of Dickens's biographers, Michael Slater, gives an account of a Jewish reader who wrote to Dickens to object to this.Don't miss this novel. The progress of the little parish boy, Oliver Twist, suggests that a society is only as admirable as its compassion for the least among it.M. Feldman"},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"Oliver Twist is perhaps the most culturally prevalent of Mr. Dickens' novels. Everyone has heard the famous line: \\"Please sir, can I have some more?\\" What a lot of people don't realize is that Oliver Twist was actually Dickens' attempt at a social critique of the prevailing prejudices against the poor and downtrodden in Victorian England, and the appalling work and living conditions that they were subjected to as a result of the Poor Law of 1834. In this capacity Dickens was very successful; his novel helped draw attention to the problem and precipitated a wave of compassion toward the poor. However, his success in improving the image of one marginalized group was perhaps marred by the slandering of a second marginalized population: the Jews. Dickens' anti-semitism is very apparent in the character of the Jew Fagin who is repeatedly likened to a demon, and who is characterized by a jumble of derogatory Jewish stereotypes. By contrast, Oliver is hardly characterized at all except to be described as a kind of nebulous blob of pure goodness who is tried by hardship at every turn-- thereby winning our sympathy.Like many of Dickens' novels, Twist's plot hangs on the convergence of coincidence. Though the seeming acts of fate that drive the story are clearly contrived, it is done in such a self-aware manner that the reader can't help but overlook the ridiculousness of the plot twists. My favorite part of Dickens' story-telling in this novel is the bitingly sarcastic manner in which it is written. The narrative is dry and exceptionally witty, and I frequently found myself laughing out loud at the masterful use of irony that turns what could be rather dark and depressing parts of the novel into dark comedy. The manner of narration makes up for the rather stereotypical good vs evil, villains-get-their-just-deserts plot formulation. I really enjoyed reading Oliver Twist, and I would definitely recommend it for a first time Dickens reader, with the one qualification that it does reflect the prevailing prejudices and racism of the time, and should thus be taken with a large grain of salt."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"Call me biased, but I have thoroughly enjoyed all of the novels I've read by Charles Dickens. He is an incredible (if wordy) storyteller. He can tug at the heartstrings, tap into the cynical mind, and keep the reader wanting more. This novel is no exception. I found Oliver Twist one of his more easy stories to follow, thus I would recommend it to someone new to Dickens' works.Oliver Twist, an orphan born in the pitiful conditions of an English workhouse under mysterious circumstances, experiences the highs and lows of life through a series of curious events. Oliver, spending most of his youth amongst the poor, is exposed to hunger and neglect, cruelty and greed. Desperate of his situation, he takes his chances on the street by running away, and comes across a peculiar band of unsavory characters. After taking up with them naively, he comes into contact with a respectable gentleman, who for strange circumstances, takes a chance on Oliver and cares for him. Eventually, he is captured up by those brutes he was previously staying with, and more mystery and secrets and lies exposed ensue.For me, this was a \\"couldn't put it down\\" type novel. Every chapter had me on edge, wondering the fates of all those involved. It is a novel of cynicism towards England's (ignorant) view towards the poor. It's a tale of love over obligation. It's a tale of individualism, purity versus corruption, perceptions versus reality. The characters ran from sympathetic to loathsome, and the tale was exciting. However, in this novel, some of the points Dickens is trying to make contradict themselves (nature vs. nurture), which keeps this novel from being superior. It's an intriguing and heartfelt read, nonetheless."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"Originally published in a serialized format, OLIVER TWIST represents some of Charles Dickens very first writings. It is easy to imagine his first readers eagerly (and impatiently) awaiting the next installment of little Oliver's saga. Evocative of so much compassion, this powerful tale has reached the hearts of readers for over 150 years, and is every bit as powerful now as it was originally. Both its message of personal triumph despite overwhelming odds, and its broader admonishment for us all to look more closely at the plight of the destitute and homeless, speak powerfully to every reader.This book gives you a very disturbing glimpse into life in England during the early 1800s (or at least Dickens' view of that life). Dark, cold, dangerous, and filthy are some adjectives that are nearly always at the fore when reading OLIVER TWIST, as Dickens employs his unparalleled talent for bringing his settings to life with words. The worst in human attributes are also on prominent display in this work, with Bumble, Fagin, and Sikes being the epitome cowardliness, cruelty, and brutality, respectively. Rather uncomfortably, this book also highlights the all-too-common failures of society in general. While we may have come a long way since the time of Dickens, there remains much that we would rather not have to face about our own culture. Abuse and neglect of innocent children has not altogether faded away, but maintains its evil hold on parts of society.Not to make you think that this book is all about the negatives of humanity. It is also a tale of triumph over evil, goodness coming from love and compassion, and innocence being preserved. Oliver's friends in the second half of the book represent all the best things about humankind and turn this tale into an essentially happy one. That being said, I actually liked the first half of the book (prior to the failed house-breaking attempt) better than the second, primarily because from that point on, while events occur at an increased rate, they are essentially taken out of Oliver's hands.This is a great book, highly enjoyable, humorous, and evocative of powerful emotion. The famous wit of Charles Dickens is in full display here, with puns (Master Bates), sarcasm, and all manner of plays on words and phrasings, being found throughout. It is also a good example of Dickens' penchant for overly verbose writing. Sentences that simply HAVE to be run-ons are found in nearly every paragraph, to the point where you forget the subject of interest as you get lost in flowing descriptive writing (was that a run-on?). For that reason only, I'd suggest this book for more experienced readers looking to sit down and enjoy one of my favorite classics."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"When I had to read this book in my adolescent years, it was literary torture. Today, reading with 25 more years of life behind me and greater appreciation for literary art, it's a great story. I never would have picked this story back up had it not been for the review/referral from a friend. In retrospect, I'm not really certain this story is best read, comprehended and appreciated by an adolescent. The story, and the seedy sides of life exposed, might be better processed by an adult.In addition to the story woven by Dickens, I think what I appreciated most about this writing was how Dickens used the novel as a commentary on life in England at the time of the writing, e.g., society's treatment of the paupers and impoverished, the caste system that existed and condemned a pauper child to destitution at birth, and the judicial system with its corruption and brutality, to name a few. Even as a mature adult reader I winced at how Oliver and the young paupers were brutally treated by \\"the system\\" in the first half of the book.I loved how in the end all the characters, excepting Nancy, received their just rewards and ends in accordance with how they had lived life. The only mild criticism I have was the almost too remarkable coincidence of the relationships of Oliver, Brownlow, Rose and Monks, and how life had brought them together prior even to the discovery of the existence of their relationships and ties from the prior generation. Nevertheless, it's a feel-good ending and the story kept me turning the pages with anticipation."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"I bought the Penguin Classic version and recommend that purchase highly. This is among Dickens's best and almost on par with other great novels such as Anna Karenina, Pride and Prejudice, Madame Bovary, etc. In short, it is a masterpiece that brings together all of Dickens's writing skills with a great story. It has some literary flaws, and I would rate it slightly behind David Copperfield but it remains one of the most original and interesting of Dickens's novels.As background information, I am in the process of reading most of Dickens's 22 novels and longer short stories, and set up a Listmania list. I bought the Penguin Classics version of the novel. As a suggestion, avoid the Penguin Popular Classics with the plain green covers (I bought two). They fall apart and do not stand up to a read, especially books over 500 pages in length. The Regular Penguin Classics with the photo or painting on the front are excellent and some have maps and illustrations (drawings). The Wordsworth Classics are not as good, and some are illustrated.Charles Dickens, who lived from 1812 to 1870, is the best know male English writer of the 19th century. He authored 22 novels plus numerous short pieces. Most of his writing was first written in serialized form, later published as single novels.A young Dickens at the age of 12 had the unenviable job of attaching labels 10 hours a day at the Warren's boot blacking factory. That experience shaped much of his writing career. Still in his teens he became a law clerk, then later in his twenties a journalist. The last job as a reporter led to the serialized writing of his novels. His works were social commentaries with larger than life characters, or colorful caricatures, living in the slums of London. He was a critic of poverty, social injustice, and the slow moving court system.All of Dickens's experiences come together in his novels. The Pickwick Papers is mostly humorous, but Oliver twist is a dark novel set in the crime plagued streets of early 19th century London. There are very few nice characters here. Mostly, they seem very unfriendly, and most a lot worse: criminals, and abusing social workers. The pull between the good and the bad or negative, is personified by the difference of opinion between Oliver's benefactor, Mr. Brownlow, and the criminal Fagin. As is generally well known, the tale contains a cast of very odd characters with even odder names, such as The Artful Dodger, Fagin, and magistrate Fang. The only flaw in the story is that there are too many coincidences; otherwise it is a stunning tale and an innovative book.Having read many of Dickens's novels I still rate David Copperfield as best as a work of literature and rate Oliver Twist as close behind and a must read. The book was read by Queen Victoria and Karl Marx, and both enjoyed the read. The novel had a far reaching social impact. It is hard to fathom that this is one of Dickens's first novels and written in his mid-twenties."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"Crooks and conspiracies, Oliver Twist by Charles Dickens is a tale about a young boy, Oliver Twist, that must face these struggles. Orphaned from birth, Oliver is left to the mercies of a workhouse run by coldhearted people who seek gain only for themselves.

Even when Oliver, betrayed by Fagin's boys, gets a chance meeting with Mr. Brownlow, a kind, rich gentleman, Fagin goes through great lengths to recapture Oliver.

Dickens' second novel is a story of an orphaned boy taken in by a motley crew of robbers gives us a stark fictional story of the considered strength that good has over evil intentions.The character of Fagin, the lead villain with a passionate criminal philosophy, will be played by Ben Kinglsy and Oliver will be played by the newly introduced Barney Clark. The 19th century backdrop, the make up and modern touch are sure to excite audiences when the film is released September 30th. Like their popular and academy award winning film, the Pianist, Roman Polanski and screen write Ronald Harwood will surly due this popular Dickens' classic justice.The unassuming good nature of Oliver Twist as portrayed by Dickens in spite of his troubles and the evil that surrounds him throughout the novel makes this timeless tale fiction for sure, but provides a ray of hope to those who believe that good intentions, in the end, merit a reward. Saved by his benefactor, Mr. Brownlow, Oliver's \\"wrongs\\" are righted as Mr. Brownlow discovers the truth of Oliver's story through Nancy, the girlfriend of Bill Sykes, another master robber. Placing her life in jeopardy, Nancy discloses all to Mr. Brownlow who, while he saves Oliver, is unable to save Nancy from death at the hands of Sykes, once provoked by Fagin.With characters like Pip and Joe in Great Expectations and Madam Dafarge and Cruncher in the Tale of Two Cities, Dickens provides no less a colorful cadre of descriptive characters in Oliver Twist. Fagin, mentioned earlier, is the lead robber with a description that only Dickens can describe literally. Dickens' introduction of Fagin as a \\"very old shivelled Jew, whose villainous-looking and repulsive face was obscured by a quantity of matted hair\\" is certainly descriptive and has, with the upcoming film, caused some critical stir. While certainly lesser known than Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code controversy which will hit theaters in May of 2006, the character of Fagin will likely get some critical attention when Oliver Twist is released at the end of the month. The Ben Kinglsly recreation, though, should be interesting to see.\\"Artful,\\" the quick and cunning lead thief in Fagin's pickpocket gang, is truly in a class by himself as he artfully picks an unsuspecting passer by's pocket and dodges capture. The colorful artful dodger is a character most readers can easily remember and enjoy. And, who can forget the bumbling, spineless miser beadle, Bumble, who is in charge of Oliver during his tenure at the orphanage. Other rich characters stand out, too, in this timeless classic made for film, like Mr. Sowerberry, the undertaker who takes Oliver from the orphanage and first puts him to work.A novel of this detail and length certainly cannot be reproduced in its entirety on film. I understand this work is no different, according to the Oliver Twist Teaching, (...) One of the interesting revelations in novel not reproduced in the film, according to this site, is Mr. Brownlowe's discovery that Monks is Oliver's half brother. In the novel, Monks seeks to keep secrete the inheritance and history of their family from Oliver. Instead of the ultimate discovery by Oliver of a box that contains his family's history he so longed to understand, Fagin leaves him a box of stolen items. Ah, Hollywood!Despite this exclusion, though, the film, like the novel, will likely be an enjoyable one for all ages, including students in high school who are enjoying the novel for the first time."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"Dickens is probably less fashionable today than ever (although the BBC adaptation of Our Mutual Friend might rekindle a similar interest in his work as there now is for Jane Austen's). Perhaps the reason for this fall from favor is the quintessential Victorian nature of Dickens's writing - he was as much the prose apotheosis of his time as Mozart was for classical music or Shakespeare for Renaissance drama. Whatever the capriciousness of current fashion, Dickens is well worth reading. He was prodigiously skilled in his ability to describe people, places and events and his novels are driven by elaborately riveting plots and dramatic denouements. If none of these things appeal to you, there's Dickens's supreme comic flair - he's often funny and I mean hysterically, laugh-out-loud funny. Oliver Twist is one of Dickens's early works and suffers from a few failings such as a tendency to stray into realms of gross sentimentality, not to mention consistent anti-Semitism (although Dickens later tried to redeem his vile portrayal of Fagin with the sympathetic Riah in Our Mutual Friend). But Dickens uncovered his fierce passion for defending the underdog in Oliver Twist and this theme was repeated in some way in all his subsequent work. His depiction of the cruelty of England's poor laws and the petty tyranny of the minor bureaucrats who sprung up as a result of those laws was so vivid that it stirred people to demand change. With the stock of fantastic characters in Oliver Twist it is a strange failing of Dickens that the eponymous hero is not much more than a cipher. It is as if Oliver doesn't really exist, he's just a foil who brings out the worst or the best in those who come into contact with him. The strength of most of the other characterizations, however, makes up for this anomaly. Bill Sikes is such a deplorable villain that his villainy becomes etched in your mind - you almost become afraid that you might bump into him and his evil dog. Fagin, the Jewish pied piper, has a strange charm, although I'm sure Dickens didn't mean him to be taken as anything other than another arch villain (of the manipulative kind - a foil to Sikes's horribly violent nature). There are plenty of other vivid characters, but the great strengths of Oliver Twist are the passages describing London, and especially the miserably poor part of London, in the 1830s. Follow Sikes and Oliver on their trek across this metropolis and you'll get as clear and vivid a picture of Industrial Revolution London as ever was put into prose. No-one could write about dirt, squalor, or injustice quite like Dickens, and when you combine this facility with a real comic genius you have a winning formula."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"(This is a review of the Kindle Serials edition of Oliver Twist.) I always had trouble plowing through 19th Century literature. Dickens seemed to be a genius story teller but the arc of his novels seemed wrong somehow. Reading Oliver Twist in the same pattern of installments it was written for in the first place makes it into a different reading experience. I hesitate to say this but I felt it was a different book when read this way. Apparently Dickens knew what he was doing but until now we had no way to get the books in the serial format the author wrote them.I hope Amazon will publish the rest of Dickens' works as serials. They really are better this way."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"I expected to get a real feeling for the life experienced by much of the English population at that time but was pleasantly surprised by the black commentary on those conditions built into the prose. The vocabulary of the time sometimes confused but often delighted. Some plot outcomes were more simplistic than we expect nowadays."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"I've always been intimidated by Dickens, having heard so much about his legendary wordiness and trenchant prose. This was my first attempt to seriously read Dickens, and I was pleasantly surprised at just how readable this book is. I did notice Dickens's wordiness for approximately the first two pages, but after that I was drawn into the story. I was also pleasantly surprised to discover that Dickens writes with a witty sarcasm- so much for the humorless Victorians. The story of a desperately poor orphan, Oliver Twist offers a deep and complex plot, and plenty of emotional engagement. It's hard not to feel sympathy for suffering young Oliver who, by his own admission, \\"hasn't a friend in the world.\\" This novel is a book about morality, and is clearly a work of social criticism. Dickens reserves his criticism not for the wealthy, who might seem the obvious target, but for social strivers. Those attempting to raise their social standing, such as the sycophantic Bumble, and the criminal miser Fagin receive the sharpest pricks of Dickens's pen. The truly wealthy are the kindest characters in the book; they are the ones who rescue Oliver and show him true kindness. Dickens kept my attention throughout this novel, I will definitely be exploring more of his canon."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"Here's something most people don't know about Charles Dickens's most famous novel: it's not actually about Oliver Twist. True, he is the subject of the title and he does act as the centrepiece of the novel around which all the action and intrigue revolves, but as a character he is so bland he becomes a mere storytelling-device, a pawn that the much more fascinating characters surrounding him are constantly fighting over. So nave, so angelic, so innocent, Oliver Twist is the embodiment of the ideal \\"nature over nurture\\", in which a young boy manages to remain essentially good and pure despite drudgery, poverty and ill-treatment. Imagine this if you will; young Oliver has been forced into the service of a burglar, who intends to send Oliver into the house first in order for him to undo the locks. Tired and frightened, young Oliver has only this to say when he realises his part in the crime: \\"Oh for God's sake let me go! Let me run away and die in the fields. I will never come near London, never, never! Oh pray have mercy on me and do not make me steal!\\"A young boy who'd rather die than steal? Definitely something that modern readers will find hard to swallow, but of course in Dickens's day the ideal of the angelic child whose soul had recently been in God's presence was a popular one. And since this novel is Dickens's most scathing critique of the poorhouses and working conditions of the lowerclass, it was essential for a sympathetic protagonist, a helpless boy whose plight would personify the lives of thousands of children in London - dying in the streets, being exploited by unscrupulous employers, or becoming drafted into a life of crime as their only mode of survival. As a symbol, Oliver is a powerful one. As a realistic character he defies belief.Born into a poorhouse and marked out for a life of poverty, Oliver is noticed by the authorities after his infamous request: \\"Please sir, I want some more.\\" A catalyst for his young life, Oliver is taken from the orphanage and thrown into a series of adventures: as apprentice to an undertaker, a homeless vagabond on the road to London, thrown in amongst a gang of pickpockets, taken in by a kindly gentleman and victim to a terrifying kidnapping. It all makes for a great read; full of intrigue and excitement, unexpected twists and fortunate coincidences. Dickens creates a startlingly vivid portrait of Dickensian London, with clear images of all its social classes, urban and rural settings, and the orders and conventions that ruled society at the time. Reading \\"Oliver Twist\\" (or any Dickens book for that matter), is reading history by a man who was there to see it.As mentioned, it is not Oliver but the myriad of characters that surround him and vie for possession of him that make up the true cast of the book. Each one is a gem in character study, each one an unforgettable personality; from the cruel and sinister Bill Sikes, the pompous Mr Bumble, the whore-with-a-heart-of-gold Nancy, the kindly Mr Brownlow, the pessimistic Mr Grimwig and the irrepressible Artful Dodger (Dickens cannot hide his enjoyment of this character, despite his best attempts to be disapproving of his chosen line of work). And of course, there's Fagin, the world's most famous literary Jew (with the possible exception of Shakespeare's Shylock). Perhaps the most controversial element of \\"Oliver Twist\\" - and perhaps even Dickens's entire career - was his portrayal of this Jewish crook that sends young boys out to pickpocket for him. Often deprecatingly referred to as \\"the Jew\\", Dickens was criticised even by his contemporaries at this stereotypical portrayal and is sure to make modern audiences uncomfortable (practically every movie ever based on \\"Oliver Twist\\" tones down Fagin's villainy, so much so that first-time readers of the novel may be surprised at how truly unsympathetic he really is, unrepentant of his life of crime to the last).As the plot twines between the massive cast of characters, each with their own agendas, each turning up again when you least expect it; lies the mystery of Oliver's parentage and the gradual awareness of his birthright. Dickens magnificently highlights the injustices and hypocrisy of the time, with a biting wit that is often glossed over in discussions of his work; in fact many who have never read Dickens probably think of his work as grave and sombre, when in fact it sparkles with irony and droll sarcasm. Describing it does it no justice, you'll simply have to read the book and find out for yourself.\\"Oliver Twist\\" is by no means a perfect novel; in the third act Dickens gets a little sidetracked by the introduction of heavenly Rose Maylie. This character and her romantic dilemma with a young man of a higher-class is exorcised from the famous \\"Oliver Twist\\" musical and many other movie adaptations, and for good reason. She serves no real purpose in the novel, slowing the story done considerably (once Oliver enters her custody there is nothing left for him to do but wait for the other characters to resolve their problems), and as a character is about as interesting as Oliver himself. Likewise, the major villain of the piece, Mr Monks (also cut from movie and musical versions), who is manipulating Oliver's destiny is also strangely bland (especially when compared to Fagin and Sikes).It is fair to say that the first two-thirds of the book are more lively and exciting than the last portion (at least until a major character meets a grisly end, setting off a nail-biting chain reaction), but that shouldn't stop you from reading the whole of this famous novel. Everyone knows the name \\"Oliver Twist\\", but comparably few have read of his experiences firsthand - make sure you're not one of them."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"\\"Oliver Twist\\" is an excellent, fascinating and compelling novel which I had the pleasure of reading. This book is exceptionally well narrated which distinguishes Dickens as one of the greatest English story writers. The issues he raised are timeless particularly societal issues pertaining to dealing with poverty, class differences, child labour, orphans and the disadvantaged in society. He highlights the need to care for others and not to be selfish. Dickens did a good job of enlightening the middle class in Britain of the hardships that the poor had to endure during his time.Oliver Twist is a very young, innocent orphan who lost his mother at birth. He is thrust into the cruel and unforgiving world. I was moved by the numerous hardships and challenges that he had to endure at such a tender age, including being shot at. He was moved away from the workhouse when he innocently asks for some more food, taken to as an apprentice undertaker and after some trouble runs away only to get into a group of thieves and robbers.Dickens paints a grim, dark and horrifying picture of life of the poor in Victorian England. The author produced some memorable characters like Fagin the miser and the gang of thieves that included The Artful Dodger, Mr Bumble at the workhouse, Nancy the kind hearted whore with motherly instincts, Mr Grimwig who is always threatening to eat his head and those of others, Sikes the murderer and others.Thankfully the book has a happy ending for Oliver. However, Nancy touched my heart and I felt that she should not have met such a grisly demise. Some unfortunate anti-Semitic references taint an otherwise exceptional novel.This is excellent reading for those who like a well written story with exciting twists and turns."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"In this heartwarming classic, Oliver Twist, written by Charles Dickens, a great story is told, I rating it a four out of five stars for content and flow.This book was a great telling of self trust and confidence. Emphasis on caring for others, and the crowds you hang out with helps pinpoint everyday life. Oliver Twist is a young orphan of which brings the story to a humble attitude. The four stars cannot explain how well narrated this story was. Characters such as mean old Mr. Bumble, the parish official, and Fagin, the trouble maker, allow the story to have a unique blend of traits. With this mix of personalities, the story flows smoothly, and allows the reader to connect certain aspects with the world around us. Oliver is treated to a very low standard, until caring others help save and nourish him to be a fine young boy. This helped boost my regards for the story itself, and compelled me to keep reading, as the mischief grew.On top of that, this classic shows that even from the dumps, you can rise to be amazing. Twist's life is a horrid run, where as a child he is sold and bartered from factories to workshops. His determination kept my nose in the book, as he endured treacherous adventures, such as getting shot, and living with a pack of thieves. No matter what though he kept striving, till he ended up with a home, family, and inheritance. This book shows kindness such as that of Mr. Brownlow, taking Oliver in, teaching him the ways of life, and this trek definitely deserves its upper rating and the recommendation stars. This book did not catch me by its vocabulary, but rather the tale and story line itself, which in the end made you want to cheer. \\"Give me some ore, please\\" was Twist's words, but through the plot you will see that even after the loss of his mother, he strove, through the Undertakers life, a scoundrel's, and finally to a handsome young child.If you have read this book and found it to your liking, I would recommend The Time Machine, By HG Wells, Tom Sawyer, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, and other classics, preferably by Charles Dickens. To rap it up, I myself am a twelve year old North Carolina middle school student, in seventh grade. I enjoy being outdoors, reading, playing with building mechanisms, writing stories, and overall, life is great!"},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"I read Oliver Twist for a college class and didn't really expect to like it. It was going to be one of those long, dull Victorian meganovels. I was wrong. Oliver Twist was surprisingly undated. The issues Dickens is analyzing and the societal practices he ridicules are very much debated in this day. The humor is still vibrant as is his rage. The plot and characterizations are pretty thrilling, too.The novel is, obviously, the story of Oliver Twist, an innocent orphan who has to fight the evils of society in order to attain a place of happiness. Most notable among his enemies are Mr. Bumble at the workhouse, Fagin the founder of a crime organization that ensnares Oliver, Sikes the murderer, and Monk the mysterious figure in the background. Oliver must use his strength of character and purity, along with the sacrifices of Nancy, and the support of some wealthy people he encounters to fight his way to freedom.Dickens's writing is wonderful. His descriptions of the society's treatment of the poor are alive with biting humor and scorn. The protagonist is memorable and loveable. The ending is slightly weak but is, for the most part, satisfying.

Fagin, the ringleader, refused to allow Oliver to leave this life because an associate of his - a man known as Monks - has paid him to do so. Charles Dickens wrote the novel in 1838 to champion the rejected and forgotten of England's Industrial Revolution.It was a personal story for Dickens, who had been placed in a workhouse as a child when his father was sent to a debtor's prison. Though his father's fortunes changed in a few months, the experience left a permanent scar on the author's psyche. He wrote Oliver Twist, in part, to turn public sentiment against the English Poor Laws of 1834, which stipulated that public assistance was only to be provided to people who moved into government workhouses. Labor was required, families were torn apart, and the rations of food and clothing were meager.Dickens had to challenge the assumptions of middle-class English readers of his novels while interesting them enough to buy his books. People had abused public assistance in the past, so people supported a system that made public assistance as uncomfortable as possible, in order to prevent such abuses in the future. With Oliver Twist - and other novels - Dickens convinced the public that the pendulum had swung to far again. There were plenty of people left behind by the Industrial Revolution, and it wasn't their fault.Dickens attacked a Victorian stereotype that poverty and vice were hereditary. Nancy and Oliver Twist were poor, but had a solid moral compass. Monks, as we later learn, was born well-off yet possessed malevolent intent. He attempted to hide Oliver's real identity, which is defined - mistakenly, as it turned out - by a corrupt beadle, a blind criminal justice system, and callous or abusive social workers.Another Victorian stereotype was the linkage of a sexual indiscretion to a person's moral fiber. Dickens lived in a time where women had few occupations available to them besides a homemaker. Marriages were arranged for economic reasons, but Dickens was a romantic who believed in love. It was about this time, in the late 1830s, where marriage began to change in the United States - from an arrangement made by one's parents to a choice based on love. It actually changed the structure and style of the American family unit.One only needs to contrast the status of the economically-based marriage of Mr. Bumble with the romantic engagement of Oliver's aunt in Oliver Twist to see where Dickens stands on marriage. One also can note that two heroines of the novel, Nancy and Agnes, were both bearer's of scarlet letters to see that Dickens didn't care too much for those kinds of sweeping assessments of a person's morality.The novel doesn't clearly state that Nancy was a prostitute; most readers of the era when Dickens wrote the story assumed she was, although it's not so apparent today. Dickens did confirm that this was the case in a subsequent interview a few years after he wrote Oliver Twist.Some may be uncomfortable with the apparent anti-Semitism of the story. Dickens justified his portrayal of Fagin by pointing out that many leaders of thieves' dens in London were Jewish. That's not hard to fathom; there were few occupations available to Jews in the 19th century. Yet his constant reference to Fagin as \\"the Jew\\" and his sinister characterizations of Fagin's physical traits are hard to defend.Bob Fagin was the actual name of a senior boy at the workhouse where Dickens spent a few months of his childhood. Dickens didn't like Bob Fagin, and it is quite possible that the Fagin in Oliver Twist is the product of an anti-Faginite rather than an anti-Semite.A teacher might be uncomfortable assigning Oliver Twist for students to read for the anti-semitism. One could also rebuke the story because there are too many coincidences. Of all the people in London that the Artful Dodger and Charlie Bates choose to be a mark, they pick the guy who wanted to marry the deceased mother of Oliver Twist. Of all the country houses in England to rob, they pick the one with a relative of Oliver. If you don't think about those coincidences for too long, you've love this story. It is another masterpiece from the master of English fiction."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"I wanted to rescue the poor boy everyday. He had many adventures from the creative author. I was so happy for his ending."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"Oliver Twist is one of Dickens' most liked and popular novels.Authors, let this be a lesson to you -- create terrific villains.Oliver Twist himself is a twerpy nobody 90% of the books. Okay, he asks for a second bowl of gruel. He fights to defend the good name of his mother. He walks to London in a week. That's all good, but it's all in the first quarter of the book.Afterward he does nothing but get entrapped by criminals. And be such an obvious goody-goody he becomes the friend of the victims instead.Indeed, the man who has a handkerchief stolen by the other two boys, and the family Bill Sykes tries to use Twist to rob turn out to be not only current friends but related to his real family.No author today could get away with such outrageous coincidences.The ending is a sentimental mishmash. He has a half-brother who hates him, and people are involved in complicated plots I could neither follow nor believe.What makes this novel live on is the portrait of Fagin the leader of a gang of child thieves. And the violent robber Bill Sykes and his girlfriend the prostitute (though you have to read between the lines to figure this out), who started with Fagin as a thief when only 4.Although he avoids direct sexual subjects, Dickens otherwise nothing to pretty up the reality of London's underworld of crime and poverty. Dickens got Twist out of this environment as fast as he could, but was wise to keep going back to the criminals, who are the only interesting people in this novel.Dear sweet Oliver and Rose just make us gag."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"This is such a well written, well intentioned & entertaining story that it must be read by all!. The humor, drama, well fleshed-out characters & history keep the reader engaged. Yes, there were a couple of parts that did bore me a bit, but that was when the heart of the story seemed to go in directions that did not interest me personally. They are short-lived, it all does come together well & there is no doubt that this is a masterpiece. I only wish that I had been introduced to this work in 7th or 8th grade. Although it was thuroughly enjoyable to this man in his 40's, I would have been quite influenced by it in my early teens. Thank you, Charles."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"A thoroughly timeless, enjoyable classic work!From the very beginning of the book, Charles Dickens transports to reader right into 19th century England with vivid atmospheric and environmental descriptions. Each character is brought to life organically within this setting which makes the book just absorbing to the reader. I felt like I just melted back in time and walked the same streets as Oliver, Sikes and the Artful Dodger.Dickens was a master at using literature to hold up the mirror to society, revealing its faults in the hope to crack the delusional facade. Those pretense-only Christians met the tip of his spear (or pen) first. He thoroughly impales them, but then shows how it's possible - and necessary - to change. Oliver is an icon of youthful innocence and sincerity, victimized by the powerful through no fault of his own. Bates is the one who reacts to the catalyst and indeed does change to live an honest life. Dickens really pegs the various characteristics throughout assorted humanity. Fagin, that puppetmaster and child trafficker who masterminds the means in which to break youthful spirit. Sikes, the brute that uses fear to enslave and manipulate. Monks, the most treacherous of all that plunges into the trap set by a heart devoid of forgiveness.Unfortunately, as recently evidenced by celebrations of Dickens' 200th birthday, many mistake the author to have crusaded for \\"social justice\\" through his works. This is a mistake. The signature hallmarks of works like Oliver Twist and A Christmas Carol is that it is the individual that must have a true change of heart in order to make a better life for themselves and others. I'm not aware of any Dickens work that produces a character which, after his revelation, then forces the local government to exact that same change upon everyone else. Dickens was wise enough to know that such forced conversions only produce hypocricy and derision.I've read numerous complaints that Dickens uses too many words. Well, I'm firmly in the camp that believes he didn't write enough! His flourishes of prose are a treasure. If ever you grow weary of this post-modern world with its deadened literature and bleak prospects, crack open Oliver Twist and remind yourself that it wasn't always so."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"This is one of my absolute favorite books of all time, and my first Dickens read - I think I first discovered it in 7th grade.

I can't believe how badly everyone treated him, lied about him, and abused him. Those stupid people thinking they were being chariable by giving him just enough gruel each day to allow him to be their slave should have been enslaved themselves.The story was wonderfully woven and took the readers on high and lows, ups and downs, until it came to a grand finale'.This book follows Oliver's adventures from birth, living in an orphanage, being sold out as an apprentice, being inducted into a gang of thieves, and more.

It was first puplished in a magazine as a continuing serial novel, but soon found it's way to a publisher as a complete work in 1837. Dickens is one of those authors, who've lost their respect, the more time has passed. I can, in a way, understand why, as I've read this novel.It tells us a story about a ten year old orphan boy, who, after many coincidences, gets involved with the underworld of London.The story is almost nonexistant, as ridiculous coincidences carry Oliver through the uncomplicated plot, and totally useles and two-dimencional characters occupy as useles individual storylines that lead to nowhere, as the only truly interesting character ins Nancy, a prostitute trying to get away from the captivating claws of organized crime. A character recognicable from countless of works, but still fascinating.The novel works perhaps best if it's being thought of as a description of the early 19th century England, and especially the lower class, whose part in that era social structure is quite disturbing, especially as that same kind of social exploitation is still being commited around the world, and even all so-called siviliced countries don't have a decent social health-care system, paid maternity leave or affortable educational system etc.&quot;Oliver Twist&quot; is a classical example of the romantic genre of literature, where all difficulties are conquered, as amazing coincidences unite people together.&quot;Oliver Twist&quot; can't be judged by the criterias of today, as it is packed with storytelling underlines and events and coincidences beyond beliavability, backed with too many shallow characters. It's nearly two hundered years old, and should be respected as the classic it is, even if it's a painfully ridiculous read, that perhaps underestimates the readers of the 21st ceuntury."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"I thought this book was pretty good. Charles Dickens showed how England people lived back then how poor there were and they were basically starved to death they only had breakfast lunch and dinner. I like how Charles Dickens used his word choice some of them were pretty funny. And I thought start to end the book was pretty good he had a good plot and ending to his story. I advise other people to read this book."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"This book is about a boy named Oliver Twist who mother died when he was at an early age.Oliver meets alot of people along the way.My favorite part is when Oliver tries to still a man stuff and lived through it.He had no punishment.The man,his wife,and his niece are going to take Oliver in to be one of them.It was a n old lady who had saved the money that Oliver mother had saved from a while back.The old woman is about to tell her where the money was when she just died in front of the mate.It is a good book to read and enjoy."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"Oliver Twist was not one of Charles Dicken's best works. Being one of his first novels, he was paid by the word. Because of this fact, the book goes on and on about subjects and often has chapters that have very little relevence to the novel's actual plot. Dicken's had great writing skills and definetly had the potential to write excellent works, however Oliver Twist was not one of these. Although the plot of the book was interesting, this 500 page book could have been summed up in about 100 pages."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"Even I have heard of this book by my family. But I have never read this book. I will read this book and write more when I read the book."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"I really didn't like this book at all. I'm a classic literature reader, which is why I picked it up in the first place. It was my first Dickens novel, and I was so disappointed. To me, it seemed to be more about those darn criminals than anything. Judging from this book, I don't like Dickens' style of writing: too wordy, unclear, and imprecise. I swear, the guy could go on for pages talking about a piece of wood if he had to. I got so bored, the words just started slurring together after a while. However, its story about how a boy of poverty becomes rich in so many other aspects is quite touching. But the journey of getting to that point is LONG, BORING, and too TEDIOUS for me to stand. Possibly, if I were a boy, I could relate to this book more. I would, however, recommend this book to anyone who likes a drug-out mystery."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"It may be surprising to know that this is one of the cases in which the movie is a lot better than the book.This book is literary garbage, an over-written mess with a terrible story.The main problem has to do with just how ridiculous and convuluted it is. If you've seen the musical movie, prepare for a story that is not only different but of poor construction. This is likely from its serialized roots. The convolution would be fine if the work was not written in a ridiculous amount of detail that muddles the already fuzzy story.People also complain that the book is anti-semitic. A top criminal is referred to as a Jew. That claim is ridiculous. If you know a lot of crime fiction, you'd probably know that there are a lot of Jewish criminals and they usually are identified by that detail.I adore the film, which is classic and has great music. Stay far away from this book, which IMO is bad."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"At long last, I have completed this dreadful book. I started reading Oliver Twist ten months ago and swore it off a half-dozen times. I disliked right from the first chapter, but the deeper I got, the more I felt compelled to finish it so I could truthfully say that I'd read this \\"classic\\" and that I didn't like it. Oliver Twist is #5 (chronologically) on the must-read novels ofThe Well-Educated Mind: A Guide to the Classical Education You Never Had. I thoroughly enjoyedDon Quixote (Penguin Classics)and even the challengingThe Pilgrim's Progress (Penguin Classics), and I absolutely lovedGulliver's Travels (Penguin Classics)andPride and Prejudice (Penguin Classics). This book, however, is not in the same class.This is the first Dickens I've ever read, and despite my absolute loathing of this novel, I won't swear him off as an author: I \\"get\\" what people like about him. However, please pay attention to the negative reviews from readers who have read other Dickens novels when they say this is not his best. I trust them because they identify all of the things that I hate about this book and say they're absent from his better works.First and foremost, Oliver Twist is excessively wordy. Dickens never takes the opportunity to say in fifty words would he could say in ten -- he uses 100 or more instead. That's because, as I've learned, he was paid by the word to write this! While modern writing stresses the concise, this is the opposite. There are dozens of examples one could point to, but off the top of my head, here's one: A murderer is feeling and he runs into a street vendor hocking some kind of Victorian stain remover. It goes on for a page and a half about all that this cleaner can do, only to get to the point that the vendor says it can even get out blood stains (which the murderer has on his hat), and then the murderer flips out and runs away. There's even one chapter that begins with several paragraphs explaining that it has nothing to do with the plot, and everything -- everything -- is described in such obsessive detail, you will have to skip over entire sentences just to get to the point time and time again.Secondly, the character of Oliver is thoroughly unlikeable. He's such a sad sack that I was actually rooting for his bullies and tormentors. Dickens quite unskillfully tries to manipulate his audience into false compassion by throwing everything short of sexual molestation at the poor child, right from birth. In this ugly underworld, everyone is petty and cruel for no reason -- but they're especially mean to Oliver. We only later find out why.The books politics are thoroughly Marxian, too. The unspoken villain, all along, is industrial capitalism. This is why the poor degenerates in the slums live so badly. But, of course, if not for capitalism and the industrial revolution, most of them would have never lived at all. This would have suited the elites -- the true heroes of the story -- just fine; for what starts out looking like a portrayal of the injustices (real and imagined) faced by the working class, Oliver Twist is really an elitist smear against the \\"low-born.\\"Aristocrats have always championed socialism as a means of preserving the old order. Capitalism, even the state capitalism of Oliver Twist, allows for too much social mobility. By mid-way or so through this book, it becomes evident that it is only the lower middle class -- the petty bourgeois -- that are exploiting those under them. The elites are of unimpeachable character and come in to save Oliver -- who, (spoiler alert) is high-born after all! No wonder all those low-life miscreants were so rotten to him.Now, for what was good about the book: The criminal gang. The characters of Fagin (though probably antisemitic), Sikes, the Dodger and Charley Bates, and especially Nancy are wonderfully rendered. The sections of the book that focus on them -- WITHOUT that annoying little brat Oliver -- are enjoyable, even in spite of Dickens' verbosity. Oliver is the worst, but all of his elitist protectors are unbearably overdone, too. Every scene involving Oliver and them is so \\"oh, I'm so grateful, I love you so much;\\" \\"Oh, Oliver, you bring us so much joy!\\" -- and that's after five minutes of meeting them.And finally, the plot: It is built on such ridiculous coincidences.. I can only marvel at how dumb the nineteenth century audience must have been to gobble this up. Still, I wouldn't have necessarily hated it so much had it been told over 100 pages instead of 455. I can only imagine what a modern book editor would do if Dickens submitted this manuscript. This book was simply awful. I hated it. And yet... I feel compelled to give Dickens another shot, nonetheless. If indeed I'm fooled twice, then shame on me."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"I read this book as an assignment and really did not enjoy it. I thought the characters were not very developed and as mentioned before, Dickens was paid by the word and I think he went off on tangents that had little or no relevance to the overall plot.

Having been bought off, after being orphaned at a young age, left with no one to care for, the author explores the idea of being great without being able to return the sentiments of being loved for. Essentially, Oliver has no object of desire because he has no causes to fear except the debt house, he is and constantly was courting pity and somehow was not satisfied with the ideals with Victorian era which has sustained a livelihood for the author and his family. He is seeking for more principals which did not afford to his father, who died while he was young. He, the author, did not learn anything beyond those skills which was taught to him to sink his father, and has little time he felt to improve upon because somehow he manages to never explain why his father was unavailable in the first place. To give him credit, not everyone wants to or would excel their father in their deeds, but he put words into the mouth of someone similar in his circumstances is like writing a diary of oneself and accept he would be fully rewarded for it. Even though I read this more than 10 years ago, I remember vaguely thinking why and how would the author constantly lay the burden on no one but himself as the saviour and provider. In his other books, he placed a character as his uncle, who was the cause of his pain, he lowered the rank his father and chosen to eschew his responsibility as a son.

They incorporate the sharp wit that pervades Dickens' work. In terms of plot development 'Oliver Twist' is not Dickens' strongest or cleverest novel, but the story is simply delightful.

With its vast array of characters and vivid depictions of the lower rungs of Victorian society, this Dickens classic--an extraordinary study of social Darwinism--will remain such a classic for years to come. Of course, this is not just a cold-eyed \\"study\\".

How can you go wrong?"},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"I have read a number of Dickens books and can certainly call myself a big fan of his work. Considering the overwhelming popularity of \\"Oliver Twist,\\" it's a bit surprising that it took a graduate class to present the first opportunity for my getting to read it. While the book is good, it is not without its problems. I found the character of Oliver to be a little flat and a whole lot of unbelievable. Furthermore, Dickens played around with a lot of themes dealing with knots and mazes which was mildly tiresome.And while I got a couple of big belly laughs out of Bumble's character, I was really peeved with Nancy's outcome. For those who have not read it, I am being cryptic for a reason.All in all it is a clever little book, though it is clear it is one of his first. However, when you compare this one to the likes of \\"David Copperfield\\" and \\"Dombey and Son,\\" it leaves a bit to be desired.For those who have never read Dickens and are afraid to pick up one of his many novels that are half a foot thick, start with \\"A Christmas Carol\\" or \\"Great Expectations\\"....and then give \\"Twist\\" a whirl."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"Oliver Twist was written for all audiences at every age. This book would appeal to all who like to read stories with a little adventure, mystery, and a good versus evil scenario. This book is considered a classic because it can be read then and now and greatly enjoyed by all young and old. I personally would recommend this book to everyone who is anyone. Oliver Twist is the story of a young orphan boy with a life of poverty in the 1830s. Oliver is an orphan boy whose mother died at his birth and was sent to live in an orphanage for the first nine years of his life. Then, sent to a workhouse to stay. He was later put out because he was convinced to ask for more gruel at dinner and sent out work for a chimney sweep then a undertaker. After differences he ran away to London. Oliver met this boy named Jack and stayed with him and his benefactor, Fagin. Oliver was trained to pickpocket and failed at the job. He went to stay with this man named Mr. Brownlow to get his life straight and on track. Then begins the cat and mouse chase between Oliver and Fagin for Oliver himself. In the end.................Sorry you have to read it and find out what happens to Oliver and the rest of the characters. This story displays the evils of the Poorhouse \`s of the time and the corruption of the people who work there. It also shows London's crime with an emphasis on petty robbery and pick pocketing.

They are boring, confusing, wordy and highly over-rated. Oliver Twist, however, is humourous and very easy to read. The characters are delightful and memorable. Bumble the Beadle, the Artful Dodger, Fagan, Bill Sykes and, of course, Oliver himself. Just because a book deals with what others believe to be &quot;timeless&quot; themes (as are supposedly the case in A Tale of Two Cities and Great Expectations) doesn't make them great books. Even if we assume that other Dickens novels are well enough written to qualify as great, they still need to be readable, understandable and a joy to read. Thye are not. If a book is complicated or confusing then, no matter how well it may be written it is not great. Oliver Twist is great.

Oliver Twist is actually one of my favourite all-time reads. I try to read it once every few years, and every time I decide to re-read it, I go in search of a copy that I don't already own because it's fascinating the different publishers, typefaces, bindings etc, that this book has gone through. Maybe I'm like Mel Gibson from Conspiracy Theory, collecting all thoseThe Catcher in the Ryecopies, but at least I'm reading them. Mel was just trying to save the human race ... or something like that. Poor fool.A few years ago, I thought that I had run my course with the young Rascal and had actually come away feeling pretty badly about the development of the ending of the story, which, in my honest opinion, is not as strong as the beginning or the arc of Mr. Brownlow. But Dickens was writing in a time when books were not as prevalent and Twist, as we all may know, was a Newspaper column that had developed into a bound and published work due to its popularity. Standards have changed and agents and publishers are more discriminating. But in no way should anyone let that stop them from the experience of reading Oliver Twist as it really is a masterpiece before its time.Recently though, watching MSNBC (a new hangout for me, I admit), I saw a documentary regarding the global sex trade of young woman forced into boarding, shipped around, mistreated, taken advantage of, stolen, uprooted, you name it ... and my mind wandered to a comparison of Young Oliver and the Ageing and scheming Fagin. In the lives of the girls they covered, there always seemed to be the \`Artful Dodger' character who would start off as the mentor, but meet a bad end eventually, and the \`Fagin', who controlled the roost and kept the girls feeling dejected and trapped, thus benefiting monetarily from their toils and of course the 'Sykes', who was the one who met head-first with the law. I felt incredibly bad for those girls and disgusted about the habits of some of my fellow \\"men\\".It really is a shame that in 150 years, this year, Dickens moralist tale of child abuse is still just as prevalent, just as relevant and unfortunately just as insidious and heart-breaking as it was on the cold night that he penned the first article."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"Does anyone enjoy \\"Oliver Twist\\" nearly so much when things are going well for the novel's young protagonist as when they are going badly? Do you notice how quickly you scan the pages when names like \\"Mr. Brownlow\\" \\"Rose\\" and \\"Mr. Losberne\\" are in the text, only slowing down when it's \\"Fagin\\" \\"Sikes\\" and \\"Mr. Bumble\\"?Cruelty can be a positive quality when writing fiction. Dickens' torture test for his young hero saves the book from mawkish excess and, along with an uncompromising social conscience, gives it readability and drive.Oliver Twist is a miserable orphan, his birth a mistake and his life a matter of no consequence to anyone but himself. Yet time and again, a guiding hand of mysterious providence suggests something of deeper importance connected to the business of his life. This is so even when he finds himself in the London underworld, under the guileful care of the master thief Fagin, who bestows praise upon Oliver's eager ears while coaching him down a criminal path where only a scaffold awaits.A bit overlong, yes. \\"It is a tale told of grief and trial, and sorrow, young man, and such tales usually are; if it were one of unmixed joy and happiness, it would be very brief.\\"Though it is ironic how that formula works in reverse in \\"Oliver Twist\\", one understands what Mr. Brownlow means by that statement. The narrative of \\"Oliver Twist\\" covers a lot of ground, and presents a strong case for the reasonless cruelty of life even as it argues for humanistic compassion. If there is any release from life's savagery, it may only be found in death or dreams.In his introduction to my Signet Classic edition, Edward Le Comte notes the \\"fairy tale\\" quality of \\"Oliver Twist\\" as a license for its sentimentality. That may be a hard sell for the casual reader. People come out of nowhere to sacrifice themselves on Oliver's behalf for vague reasons, often involving freakish coincidences. One fair maiden languishes under a life-threatening condition that can only be described as \\"acute Victorianism\\". Oliver himself soon becomes a helpless bystander in his own story, albeit one with perfect manners and diction despite his dirt-poor upbringing. Reading through this only works as a window to Dickens' time.But the novel excels in the negative, in its conception of bad guys such as the homicidal Sikes, the engaging Artful Dodger, and especially smooth Fagin, the real center of menace in the story despite Sikes' bluster. You feel the soot and desperation of these people's sad lives in every bitter page.With Fagin, Dickens plays with his audience's anti-Semitism mercilessly, always calling him \\"the Jew\\" and making Fagin's motives around Oliver obscure early on to recall the insidious \\"blood libel\\" of the time that supposed Jews guilty of slaughtering innocents.Was Dickens anti-Semitic? No. He did write an anti-Semitic book, albeit not by design. It's hard to imagine Dickens' audience in 1838 making a distinction between the criminal and his ethnicity. Nor did Dickens think they would. He didn't care. He was on a mission.And there's the rub. Dickens is not holding back anything grabbing his readers by the throat, which is why \\"Oliver Twist\\" worked then and still does today. It's not his best book, but it's a good one all the same, uniquely committed, maybe his most powerful. Seeing a debased world through the prism of middle-class morality has its flaws, but the focus is painfully keen and Dickens makes it hard to look away."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"One of Charles Dickens very first books was Oliver Twist. Although it seemed that he has been writing for years and years. This book is probably the best book I have ever read in my life. It has got everything from suspense to romance and ever a little bit of humor. It has got something for the whole family even the little ones. The story is Oliver is a little orphaned boy who lived at an orphanage until one day the person in charge takes something to far witch makes Oliver run away on his way to London he gets mixed up with a gang of ruffians and hooligans. Who pick pocket just to keep a roof over their heads and bread on the table with help from a man named Fagin. Oliver learns the ropes very quickly with some assistance from the Artful Dodger the ringleader of their gang.Will Oliver keep the straight and narrow path? Or will he fall into the pit of corruption and thievery to find out you must read the book. This book gives you a sense of hope for Oliver and makes you feel grateful for the things you have. The way Dickens writes makes him the greatest author in this or any generation.Dickens uses a style to where you think Dickens actually talking to you and telling a story. He writes so well you actually want to keep turning the page just to know what is going to happen.

To me, there's always been something mercenary about his writing due to the fact that his novels were written to be serialized in magazines of his time. From one week to the next, he was just winging it, creating it as he went. While his improvisation is impressive, it lended itself to bloatedness and inefficency. I've read or tried to read about 5 of his works and never liked the writing. Despite that, I've tried to keep a positive outlook about the guy. I mean, with his status in the Western canon, maybe I just wasn't getting it. Thankfully, I really enjoyed Oliver Twist. Finally, a book of his that I liked.Oliver Twist is an orphan whose father is unknown and whose mother died during childbirth. Consequently he is raised in the equivalent of the 19th century English welfare system. His raising by the state is despicable. The powers that be in the government of that time, much like our government, had to deal with the problem of indigents taking advantage of the welfare system. They made the homeless shelters and lunchlines so atrocious that the down-on-their luck would HAVE to look elsewhere for help. They went on the assumption that all the displaced were bums just looking for handouts. So the honest and dishonest were treated the same way.Oliver Twist is a victim of this in that the daily meals he is served in the workhouse as a child are not enough to sustain a human being. Foolishly or bravely, one day he stands up and states the famous line, &quot;Please sir, I want some more.&quot; In return for this he is bundled off to be an apprentice undertaker. After some trouble with another boy in the house, he runs away, in the process meeting The Artful Dodger, who indoctrinates him into a gang of pickpockets and thieves led by the Jew Fagin. The question is whether or not a boy who is basically good can escape from such an evil life, or whether he will fall victim to it.This was a great book. The characters were great and the novel has a dark undertone that I wouldn't expect from Dickens. Unlike David Copperfield, this work does not exhaust itself through its very length. The ending tended to be a little too talky and clean."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"This book kept me mesmerized and I could not for the life of me put it down. I'm only a college freshmen and instead of going out to parties and events, I was in my room reading this wonderful book. It was after reading this book that I made a list of 50 books that I wanted to read before I graduated. Dickens told a powerful tale of an innocent orphan's journey through life. There were so many aspects of the book that in order for me to write a longer summary of this book, I would have to tell everything that happened in the book. There were so many surprises and twists, and although I wanted to get to the end of the book, I kept hoping, in denial, that Dickens had written other installments to this tale. However, I was satisfied to know that Dickens had gone a step farther in this story than most authors by telling what happened to each of the characters at the end of the tale. This tale was so interesting that as I read more and more of it, I felt that I had in some way become an extra character in the story; an invisible omnipotent 3rd person from whose view Dickens was writing- maybe as one Rose's servants, or that of her aunt's. I recommend everyone to read this book. It seemed to be much more than a book, and although some of my peers may see it as outdated, the events in the book are still happeneing, only in a slightly different way. This book definitely can teach people the way humans are supposed to be treated and exactly how far a human heart can be extended toward another human in need, regardless of their past. My heart went out to Oliver, and I felt he was a real person that I had to sek out and give a big hug to. Maybe it was reading this book that prompted me to join a club at my college that crochets, knit, and quilt things to donate to children in need. I am so grateful that I happened to read this book.

Hope we learn from this."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"I believe that much of Dickens (and for that matter, much of the works of the time) were written \\"serially\\" in newspapers in magazines. Because of how it is written, it always sort of keeps you interested (every section was meant to want the readers to look at the next installment) without necessarily going anywhere. That's sort of my main complaint: while entertaining, the book feels much longer than necessary.There aren't any descriptions of the flowers and trees but rather a long series of events which seem to take a long time and end in a rather abrupt way (surprisingly enough). It may be that I spend a lot of time reading more modern novels, and so my views on the \\"classics\\" isn't in the right state of mind.Dickens was definitely passionate about the ideas and social views that he had and found a good way to illustrate his arguments (similar to Upton Sinclar in __The Jungle__) in a way that makes the reader step back a bit and feel lucky that the world is a bit more reformed.I don't regret reading this book; in the end it was enjoyable, but I am glad that I had an edition that had a forward which gave me a feel for what the \\"point\\" of the whle thing was."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"I actually started reading Dickens with his later novels - Bleak House, Great Expectations, David Copperfield, etc. - and I found Oliver Twist to be a big disappointment. Besides Dickens' characteristic humor, I found the novel lacked his usual colorful characterization - Fagin is the lone exception. And it is clearly written by a younger Dickens who had not yet developed his mature style. Dickens' biggest weakness is clearly on display, however, that is his poorly structured plots that rely too much on fantastic coincidences. The whole book has the quality of an unpolished, wooden, and even amateurish story. It's really not one of Dickens' best books, and maybe even one of his worst. (I have to read a few more of his earlier books to decide this.) I think if it wasn't for the well-known scene where Oliver 'asks for more', this story would not be as famous as it is. Overall, a big disappointment. I'm selling my copy of the book. It doesn't deserve to sit on my shelf beside Bleak House, Copperfield and the rest."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"Dickens writes like a lawyer.

We ordered this particular book because of the age range listed in the product's details. At the time, there was no \\"Look Inside\\" feature for this book. This book is NOT for a 9 or 10 year old. The vocabulary (acquiescence, unpropitious, jocosity, supplication, assiduously- just to name a FEW) is too difficult, not to mention the unfamiliar British colloquialisms, Dickens' run-on prose, and the couple of CURSE WORDS! I'm not criticizing the original work, I'm just stating that the original work is not suitable for most of the 9-12 year-old age range.

There was way too much description for the stupidest things. I know, it is interesting to know how the characters look, and this book does do that. But, his comparisons were drawn out and boring! Dickens would be writing about Oliver's trip to the country with Rose and Mrs. Maylie, but he would end up talking about angels in heaven and how their cheeks were a similar shade as that of a kind of flower. I mean, this is a very creative way of describing a flower, but that is not the point of the story! And when that description occupies two or three pages, the reader becomes a little discouraged(not to mention bored!!!!) I've read David Copperfield though, and Charles Dickens' writing style seemed to have evolved into something much more tolerable.

I think it shows how orphans struggle. I think that it helps some of us that are not orphans see how emotional it is for them to go throught. I liked it."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"When \`Oliver Twist\\"'s first installment appeared in 1937, it is probable that not even Charles Dickens was aware that his story about the young orphan-turned-thief would become so timeless. Almost 70 years after its first publishing, the novel is still contemporary, and not only because it deals with human nature, but mostly because it depicts children being exploited by villains.In this time when children are even trade as slaves in many parts of the world, \\"Oliver Twist\\" becomes even more resonant. The novel is a social commentary on the social situation of Britain in the XIX Century. With Oliver (the character) Dickens meant to demonstrate the social situation of his time, when the poor classes were getting even poorer and the rich people richer every day. Above all, the boy's story exposes one of the worst periods in history of Britain for the poor people.The environment where Oliver spends most of his childhood is populated by thieves, murderers and prostitutes. At the same time, the orphan always meet good people who want to help him, and nevertheless fail. But there is also the Church and the government, and by that time poor people could only be helped if they moved into government workhouses.One of the most interesting things in \\"Oliver Twist\\" is the importance of the characters' names. The name \`Oliver Twist' is the clearest example. His surname alludes to his reversal of fortune throughout the story. On the other side, Rose Maylie echoes her youth and beauty, and Mrs Mann lacks maternal instinct.\\"Oliver Twist\\" is an unforgettable book populated by strong characters. Dickens prose is so touching and well developed that has funny and sad moments in the right doses. This is one of the books that stays with the reader long after he/she has finished it."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"I found it to be a well-drawn book; the storyline and the characters involved were very entertaining, particularly the story between Fagin and his charges. Although sometimes it tended to extend the text longer than needed and the constant switching between scenes made it hard to follow. But I do acknowledge that this may be due to my lack of patience and comprehension and may attempt reading it again in the latter of my years."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"Yeah, I said it was long and boring before but actually, it's not. I guess you just have to have the right version - I must have gotten the original, unedited copy at my first attempt. OLIVER TWIST was the first book on our reading list for English this year and I knew I'd have to make it through. I've seen movie adaptions of this story so it wasn't exactly new; of course Disney always changes the plot a bit, so I still had some surprises.The basic idea of the book is this: Oliver Twist is a poor orphan cast to the most depressing scenes, struggling against the menace and corruption of lower London. Dickens wrote this book, not only to criticize the failed government poor laws, but to reflect on his own early childhood, of the poverty and loneliness he had faced. Oliver meets a wide cast of characters, in a wide range of good and evil. At the bottom rests Fagin, the greedy and malicious Jew that manipulates children to steal for him. He has a network of thieves about him, and innocent Oliver seems trapped. However, he manages to escape to some wealthy and very kind people, who coincidentially are tied to his mysterious birth.This book is very suspenseful and touching and a pretty good one for class study (I usually like book selecions for English). My advice is to read in attention and speculation - be sure to pay attention to the chiming of bells. ...If you're reading for fun, it's great entertainment too, and a lot less work.

I thought Oliver Twist was not a very interesting character: he is annoying in his naivete, the only memorable quote of his is &quot;please sir, I want some more&quot;. Oliver Twist serves mainly as a pawn to be used by the much more interesting &quot;bad guys&quot; in the book, Fagin and Oliver's brother, and others. When reading the book, I identified with the feelings of many of the &quot;bad guys&quot;.The book is spruced up with the characteristic brand of Dicken's humor and subplots, and has a happy ending for our poor, orphaned, Oliver Twist."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"Like the Shakespearean Works, all the famous novels Charles Dickens wrote have been edited into various lengths and breadths. The point being that each editor trys to outdo his/her predecessor by evolving 'something special'. All are welcomed; although I would add that this particular version of &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; seems to be the most 'original' I have come across. It is quite detailed, and has all the flavours of 19th century English.However, for most leisure readers who just want to have fun, I will recommend the Mass Market Paperback version. Its story is more abridged: more direct; and boasts of the contemporary English we use today."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"This is not the complete book as Dickens wrote it. It has been slightly abridged for young readers. I used to hate the idea of doing such a thing to a book, but I recently read this out loud to my children and the abrigement makes it much easier for kids to follow. As far as I can tell, about a fourth of Dickens' original has been edited out. The plot seems to be intact, much of what is missing are long descriptive passages. Certainly not for purists, but as an introduction to Dickens, especially kids who have seen one of the many movies versions, this is fine."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"While I don't feel this is Dickens' best, I still consider it a crucial work of his. This 2nd novel of his certainly emphasizes the harsh conditions of Victorian England. Also, this novel demonstrates his cynical sense of humour. He also demonstrates his skill of creating dramatic irony. Fagin (the so called villain) treats Oliver and the other boys much better than the legitimate firms. Also, Dickens portrays an interesting contrast. One one hand, we have the frightening psychopath Bill Sikes. On the other hand, Fagin clearly DOES have a conscience. (This is clearly displayed when Sikes goes into a rage and Fagin expresses his concern.) It is also interesting that the legitimate firms abuse Oliver and the other boys without a second thought. I can not overemphasize the grace in which Dickens makes Fagin's death very slow, tragic, and painful for us. We also have altruistic characters such as Mr. Brownlow and Rose. Characters such as Mr. Grimwig add some welcome comical touches. So we have strong images, a bitter representation of the period, comical touches, dramatic irony, and well drawn tragic scenes. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"The story of Oliver Twist has been tested through generations of criticisms and countless tellings; and it has survived, a timeless masterpiece crafted by the wily Charles Dickens. This edition, published by Oxford is well-crafted and contains images which supplement the text well, although it is that text which the reader should focus on. This story follows a young orphan by the name of Oliver Twist through his trials in a tumultuous time. Dickens' use of verbal irony, foreshadowing, and the literary devices which have made him the superstar that he is today among the literary world are readily apparent in this poignant story. The nice (subtle) details are interwoven in a plot and storyline which cleanly wraps itself up in the end of the story, in true Victorian Fashion. The only trouble one might find in reading this book is Dickens' use of language; he uses many old English expressions and terms, but if one wades through them, one will surely find a worthwhile book for any rainy day."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"Product quality and condition was as the seller advertised.

He had called them into view, and it was not easy to replace the shroud that had so long concealed them. There were faces of friends, and foes, and of many that had been almost strangers peering intrusively from the crowd; there were faces of young and blooming girls that were now old women; there were faces that the grave had changed and closed upon, but which the mind, superior to its power, still dressed in thier old freshness and beauty, calling back the lustre of the eyes, the brightness of the smile, the beaming of the soul through its mask of clay, and whispering of beauty beyond the tomb, changed but to be heightened, and taken from earth only to be set up as a light, to shed a soft and gentle glow upon the path to Heaven.&#34;Reunited in the Communion of Saints."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"Some books you put on the Kindle and throw away when you've read them.

I have read this numerous times in my life and enjoy it each time. Highly recommended can't go wrong."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"Dickens makes the assumption that extremes of goodness are inherited and also that general facial features are inherited. So here we have a very good and sweet-looking boy of an unknown father and a mother who dies in childbirth. He becomes a ward of a parish where a certain kind of law-abiding evil prevails. All anyone wants to do is save money and get rid of their responsibilities in any way possible short of actually killing their charges. A key and very famous episode in this stage of Oliver's life has to do with his asking for more gruel: \\"Please, sir, I want some more.\\" He did this, not on his own initiative, but because the boys organized an informal lottery, the dubious prize being the \\"privilege\\" of asking for more gruel. This happens very early in the book (page 12 of this edition) and results in Oliver's being identified as a dangerous troublemaker by the authorities and being shipped out to a funeral home where a new set of evil characters reside. Oliver's essential goodness is recognized and sparks the hostility of this group. He runs away, goes as a homeless boy of perhaps eight or nine to London, sleeping in haylofts and walking for days. He then gets involved (because of the Artful Dodger) in a criminal gang where his air of innocence and sweetness is regarded as a wonderful asset, useful in the commission of certain crimes. He is also, for another reason, desirable to them. They try him out at crime but, on the two occasions that they do, he gets caught and essentially saved and adopted by nice and kind people. The crooks want him back. Thus, for most of the novel, the tension has to do with where Oliver will end up, whether the good guys or the evil guys, will win in the end, and what happens along the way. Along the way you meet the usual fascinating (Dickension) cast of characters: Fagin, Sykes, Nancy, Artful Dodger, Noah Claypoole, Mr. and Mrs. Bumble, Mr. Brownlow, Monk, and so on. An interesting addition to the cast is Syke's dog who is sometimes vicious, sometimes devoted, sometimes dumb, and sometimes shrewd. The dog would make an interesting subject for a novel unto itself.There are problems with the book: outlandish coincidences (read the book to discover what these are) and an unfortunate use of the phrase \\"the Jew\\" to identify Fagin who is the sly, cunning, and mischievous archvillain of the book. If only Dickens had not stooped to such a cravin anti-Semitic device, the book would have been much more palatable to me. One wants to say to Dickens from time to time if one had Dickens standing in front of one: \\"Please, sir, I want less.\\" However, if one can overlook or somehow excuse what seems to be horrible anti-Semitism (treating the phrase as perhaps just a nickname assigned to Fagin by that low-life gang), the book can be seen as an interesting morality tale with Dickens hoping that the good prevails but, being the writer he is, also letting events work themselves out in ways that the subconscious dictates."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"Classic!

Furthermore, I always wanted to see what all the rave was about as far as every play that has been performed in high-schools throughout the country. Now I can understand.

You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"So many people know the story of Oliver Twist from the film or stage adaptions, and these are indeed excellent and worth their popularity. However there is so much more to this story to be found by reading the book.I first read this book aged 12 and recently re-read it. It is short enough that children and young people certainly can enjoy it despite the slightly dated nature of the text. And indeed it does not feel as dated as it might. This is a timeless work, laced with a lot of humour that certainly surpised and delighted me when I read it as a boy.On re-reading, all my old favourite passages were there. The place where Oliver is asked to bow to the board, but not seeing a board fortunately bows to the table instead. The hilarious trial of the Artful Dodger or the comic Mr Bumble and especially his famous \\"the law is a ass\\" passage were all just as I had remembered them. I was more surpised by the biting irony I found on rereading the book though. I am not sure if I missed this when I was younger or whether I had just forgotten it, but Dickens does this very well.The only criticism of the story is a well known one. The \\"Dickensian Coincidences\\" make the world of Dickesn seem like a very small place!

Although it is written about then-modern people doing Victorian things, the morals and themes present in this common work of literature are still relevant today. This was literary superstar Charles Dickens first novel ever. And it shows. But regardless of how simplistic or frank the novel gets, what it does correctly, it does better than most modern authors.Oliver Twist is centered around the titular orphan, and the various adventures he has through the slums of and around London during the Victorian Era. In one sense, this is an adventure novel, about a young boy who gets wrapped up in a conspiracy much larger than he is. In another, it is a prime example of a detective novel, with investigations and interviews and searches for evidence to discover the secrets behind said consipiracy. But, in my opinion, it is most like the extreme characters and innapropriate humor most commonly found in movies such asPulp FictionorKill Bill: Volume 1.Readers with more classic taste than my own may feel the need to scoff or drop their mouths in shock at this point in the review, but let me finish. The aforementioned cinematic masterpieces are both written by Quentin Tarantino, who has a fierce sense of zany and quirky. There has been a lot of literature along this line, but almost always in different genres: Kurt Vonnegut of Sci-Fi fame, for example. But they are all categorized by this extremely campy feel to them.Oliver Twist is a hard book to like if you're expecting airtight writing that gets to the point and tells a dramatic story effectively with good plotting. This is Dickens, not Hemingway. When a character gasps in horror of an event, Dickens would write \\" So and So gasped in horror, their mouth drooping along angular planes of shock and awe\\" or something along those lines. Characters are basically either good or bad, and don't tend to change too much (with a few exceptions--we'll get there soon). Bill Sikes, who is introduced as the Homebreaker, is a jerk throughout the whole novel, Oliver Twist is always the shinging bastion of morality. Fagin, for the most part, is always \\"the evil Jew\\" and is often characterized as the Devil. The Maylies are sickly sweetening as well. It's all black or white.Similarly, a ton of the plot points are quite contrived and a little too coincidental for modern reader's taste. Early on, Oliver, the Artful Dodger, and another little boy pickpocket a rich man named Mr. Brownlow while in a crowded square on the street. Of ALL the people they COULD have pick-pocketed, how do they choose the ONE man who is so deeply wrapped up in Olver's past? See what I mean?But in spite of all this extremity, sublimating the overwritten humor, and ignoring all the stupid things characters/the narrator say (\\" Alas! Poor Dick was dead!\\"-- we make fun of this all the time in my AP Literature class), this novel still manages to shine with a fierce backbone of humanity. Underneath all of the campy and lame emotional antics and plot points is the character of Nancy, who is perhaps the most underrated female character in all of Victorian Literature.What makes Nancy so special? Well, excluding one chapter at the end of the book for Fagin, Nancy is the *only* character in this entire novel who is true-to-life. We're talking living, breathing. Scratch what I said earlier about underrated \\"female\\" character. Nancy is one of the best characters to walk through the pages of all literature.Her conflict is real, her dialogue is real, her actions are real. And *her* character's climax is *the* climax of the novel. Without her, this book would be cheap trash.But the question then arises: if Dickens was capable of writing a character as powerful as Nancy is, why do all the other characters seem so cardboard and amateurish?This is Dickens, king of classic literature, we're talking about here. Each and every lame thing in this book is in this book for a reason (or at least, most of them, because I do admit Victorian people had different tastes then ourselves). Each stupid quibble of morality on Oliver's part is inserted into the text on purpose to provide contrast for Nancy's character. Among this crazy world with characters that seem like college freshmen overacting each of their lines, Nancy stands out like a fluorescent colored light house on the rocks. And coming from someone who would go on to writeA Tale of Two Cities, the only logical explanation is that it was on purpose.And therein lies the true extent of Dickens' genius. He was intentionally inserting themes and symbolism and making things downright unreadable at times before it was cool to do so ( I wish it had stayed that way... Not a Joyce fan myself). The end product of this book is fantastic, and the ride to get there is just as exciting.So, if you're here because you were assigned to read this for school, be not alarmed. Change your mindset about the whole book, and look at it with Nancy as the main character. I guarantee, you'll love it."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"I never read this story and decided to download it on my phone. Such a good story. I couldn't keep my face out of my phone for a week!"},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"Set in early nineteenth century England, Oliver Twist by Charles Dickens is the tale of a poor orphans struggle to free himself from the clutch of criminals in London's dark underworld. I particularly enjoyed Dickens' witty and satiric comments on the society of the time. The characters were vividly portrayed and starkly contrasted; from the evil Fagin right through to angelic Oliver. Fagin's downfall and Dickens description of the hours before his demise had me glued to each page.....I could not put the book down and I loved the way the novel ended....everything just came together beautifully. This was my first Dickens novel and it will definitely not be my last!!"},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"Well I've finally gotten around to reading the classic tale of the little orphan boy who had the audacity to ask for more, and I'm sorry to say I'm a bit disappointed. Aside from leaning heavily on three tropes common to 19th century literature (contrived coincidences, sudden onslaughts of debilitating fever, and extreme melodrama), a few characters' details also unfortunately weaken the moral of the story.First, for a novel that seems to be casting a sympathetic, fair look at the poor and destitute of urban, industrialized Britain, Jews are represented by one of the most unsavory characters. (I'm not one to look for excuses to cry \\"racist,\\" but it's not that he just happens to be Jewish. He is specifically referred to as \\"the Jew\\" time and time again.) Also, the Artful Dodger seems to be perfectly happy practically living on the streets with no parents, stealing whatever he can. (This muddles the idea that street children are driven to crime.) Most unfortunate, though, is the background of Oliver himself. (Minor Spoiler Alert) Throughout the book, Oliver is one of the few poor characters who are consistently good, which gives the story some depth. (Poverty may contribute to crime, but individual people still ultimately make their own moral decisions.) Well, that all goes out the window when, come to find out, Oliver is no ordinary street urchin. Rather, he belongs to a relatively well-to-do family. No wonder he's so good! (End Minor Spoiler)On the positive side, Charles Dickens is a true wordsmith, a quirky and interesting narrator, and an excellent satirist with a very intelligent sense of irony. \\"Oliver Twist\\" is at times funny and heart warming, and at other times gut-wrenchingly sad. It is a poignant critique of the treatment of the poor at its time and place, and I imagine it must have been an embarrassing wake up call to Britain's wealthy elite.These qualities mostly make up for the 1800's clich&eacute;s I mentioned previously, and I would have given the book 4 stars if it had been about 200 pages shorter - thus bringing me to my last point: It's far too long. Now, I don't have anything against long books, but \\"Oliver Twist\\" really drags on unnecessarily. Uninteresting side stories about unnecessary characters take up whole chapters, things that can be said or done in a few paragraphs instead take up whole pages, and much of the book has a \\"filler\\" feel to it. Granted, \\"Oliver Twist\\" was published as a serial over the course of a couple years, but I still think it should be able to hold up better in novel format.All in all, the book is by no means bad. Dickens really does have a clever way with words, and (having previously only read \\"A Christmas Carol\\") I look forward to becoming more acquainted with his work. However, I won't be rereading this one."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"Amazing plot with a great insight as to the problems rife in Victorian England. The story of an orphan boy and his adventures between ages 9 and 12. Great story, didn't lag, wonderous descriptions. I would recommend this book to everyone!"},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"This Puffin Classics edition, under 350 pages, proves a highly readable introduction to Charles Dickens for middle and high school students. Extensive dialogue and abbreviated descriptions keep the plot flowing along, begging for pages to be turned. The editors insist that the actual Language of Dickens has been faithfully preserved, so readers may savor the flavor of Victorian England.This tale of an orphan boy, raised in a dismal \\"workhouse\\" outside London, tugs at the heartstrings even in our modern century. His dead mother has been robbed and vilified coarsely--victimized by rapacious hags entrusted with her alms care. Barely surviving, her baby is doomed to repeat her trials as he is thrust into an unfeeling world to survive as best he can.Sold to a coffin maker where he is further ill-treated the lad decides to run away. En route he meets the artful Dodger, a street-wise gamin who conducts him to the nefarious establishment run by a master thief named Fagin--a sinister Jew who shelters street urchins who plunder the public for his private profit.As in all Dickens' works this book is filled with memorable characters--most of whom are on the wrong side of the law and conscience. Poor Oliver (aged 6-10) serves as an unwilling catalyst as his usefulness is realized; he becomes the center of evil schemes to capitalize on his untrained talents and unnamed birthright. Despite the youth of the protagonist, however, this story is not suitable for young children. Scenes of poverty and brutality are distressing; the level of actual violence is clearly adult fare.The plot is very complicated--not so much the action in the present--as the gradual exposition of behavior and strong emotions in the past. The 19th century had a fondness for cases of mistaken (or hidden) identity. A victim and witness of much child abuse himself, the author wrote this book as a literary vehicle to promote the critical need for Social Reform in various areas:orphanages,funeral practices, slum conditions, the criminal justice system and inheritance laws. There is a solemn undercurrent of regret that a person cannot rise above the deplorable situation of a lowly birth. Can a falsely named orphan buck the class system which is so firmly entrenched? Can a life of harsh degradation stifle all a woman's heart--robbing her of innate compassion and tenderness?"},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"This book was an absolute classic. Dickens (and Twain) were the geniuses of dry humor, and this book is no exception. My only concern is that this material may be &#34;mis-applied&#34; to the present, and may heighten in some readers a sense of wealth-envy, what with Dicken\`s rather unflattering characterization of the rich. Readers must read Dickens with a full understanding of the time in which he lived, and not draw too many parallels to our society today, which parallels i would opine are as frequently mis-placed as otherwise.Note: I apologize if there are any glaring errors above. I am trying to type this from my Kindle."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"The classic tale of Oliver Twist, who's mother died the night he was born leaving him an orphan in the care of the parochial workhouse - a place where paupers were sent and generally given only enough food to keep them working and alive (and oftentimes not even that much!). But when young Oliver dares to ask for \\"a little more\\" it is determined that the workhouse can no longer keep such an ungrateful child. He is sent to work as an apprentice for the undertaker, but due to some very rude treatment he runs away, eventually finding himself in London in the care of Fagin. Fagin is a cunning and hideous old man who runs a gang of thieves and pickpockets, and is intent on teaching Oliver the art and making him a member of the gang.So begins Dickens' classic story of Oliver's struggle to shake off the miserable circumstances placed upon him at birth and find his place in the world. Initially very depressing, with it's forceful depictions of the sorry state of the poor in mid 19th century England, the writing is throughout rather sarcastic, which was probably meant as a social commentary on the various classes. But there is humor and happiness along with the sadness, as various events coincide to help Oliver along his way. And while Dickens is sometimes criticized for a business-like approach to his writing, it's obvious why this book is still considered a classic so many years after it was written. A thoroughly enjoyable book and well worth the time."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"Dickens was a genius, and this work, written when he was in his early 20s, exemplifies that fact. The plot is a bit cliched, and deus ex machinae are everywhere, but, good Lord, the characterizations (and the accompanying names) are superb. The wry insights, the gentle cynicism, the not-so-gentle look at the poorhouses, the indelible imagery, the seamless shifts from comedy to tragedy and back again, all make for an unforgettable book--no matter how many forgettable film adaptations have been made. A joy to read."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"The creative novel Oliver Twist, written by Charles Dickens in 1838, defines a classic of all times. This intense story reflects a young boy's life in London with no family or place to go. Oliver's mother dies while giving birth to her son in the beginning of the book. Oliver's father remains unknown. Throughout the book the reader sees constant struggles. Oliver is befriended by Fagin and his company. Fagin, along with the Artful Dodger, invite Oliver to stay with them and become a thief. During one of Oliver's pick pocketing adventures; he is caught by Mr. Brownlow. Instead of reprimanding the young lad, Mr. Brownlow decides to raise him. Oliver desperately searches for the answer to his past while trying to stay alive on the streets of London. Ironically, Mr. Brownlow is Oliver's grandfather. A dominate theme of Oliver Twist examines the importance of family. Oliver's early years taught him to fend for himself and he suffers from never experiencing a loving and nurturing childhood. The setting of the book plays a powerful role as the story unfolds. Dickens describes the setting of London and all the places that Oliver stays very descriptively. &quot;The street was very narrow and muddy, and the air was impregnated with filthy odor. The walls and ceiling of the room were perfectly black with age and dirt...&quot; (page. 56). Dickens explains the facilities that were available to poor Oliver and makes them sound unbearable. He does an excellent job making the setting come alive and allows the reader to plight. I would recommend all readers at some point in life to delve into this classic. I found Oliver Twist very moving and towards the end hoping only the best for poor Oliver."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"Few works of adult literature are so well known that they become embedded in our cultural fabric the way that Oliver Twist has. Perhaps it is because the title character is a loveable, sympathetic, young boy that the story, over time, has come to be mistaken by some for a children's tale. And perhaps it is because I feel like I have known the story all my life that I only recently realized that I had never, in fact, read the novel. So as I sat down to (finally) read this book, it was with a sense that I was simply revisiting a cherished story from my youth. But as I quickly realized after a very few pages, this is adult literature in all respects - in its sophisticated, intelligent prose, its rich plot, its elaborate cast of characters, and, yes, the occasional depiction of gruesome violence.Surely even those who have never read this Charles Dickens' classic could recite the basic elements of its plot. Who among us is unfamiliar with the story of the young orphan who musters up the courage to ask, \\"Please, sir, I want some more.\\" And yet this novel is so much more than a mere rags-to-riches story. It is also the heartwarming story of the triumph of good versus evil and of the human spirit's ability to face down adversity. Dickens pits an innocent child against the dangers of an uncaring world, and the story's happy ending is at once a celebration of Oliver's innocence and an affirmation of all that is right and just in society.Though the prose can be tedious at times, Dickens' mastery of the English language is difficult not to appreciate. And while some may find the plot clich&eacute;, there is sufficient tension throughout the novel to maintain the reader's interest. For myself, I was continually surprised, as the chapters unfolded, to realize how much more there was to this classic than simply a story about an orphan who falls in with a gang of unruly pickpockets. This is definitely worth reading, even if you feel like you have already read it as a child."},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"I am a 13 year old in 8th grade, and I must say, this is the best book I have ever read. (The hardest too) I got into Oliver when I saw the big broadway show, and decided to read the book. I had never really known about Charles Dickens, and I was somewhat confused by his style the first time I read it. Now he is my favorite author and I am going to read all of his books. I had to read the book twice, because the first time I was too excited and skimmed it. I re-read it and fully understood the whole plot and all the drama this story has. If you want to enjoy this book, read it slowly, and re-read parts you don't get. I loved everything about the book, except the ending kinda just left me hanging. It was also very emotional. I cried when Nancy was murdered, and to tell you the truth, I even cried a little when Dodger was transported. It opened me up to 19th century London, and really let me feel like I was there, watching the characters. The most exciting parts are the ones about Fagin and the thieves. The ones about Oliver in his new home can be slightly dull and boring. But read them anyway. And also, the beginning of the book is a little slow too, but don't lose faith in it, the boring parts end when the Artful Dodger comes in. This is a great book, the characters are so full of life, the plot is great, and everything is just perfect!"},{"Title":"Oliver Twist (Classics Collection)","review":"I'm enrolled in a class on 19th century European history, and one of our assignments was to read Turgenev's &quot;Fathers and Sons&quot;, which I did, and I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it. The class itself really hasn't been that great, but it has opened my eyes to the world of classic literature. Like millions of others, My hatred towards the classics can be traced back to high school where I was forced to read classic literature, and then not allowed to develop my own interpretations of the books. I think most of us have fallen into this rut, and it's a darn shame. It's kind of a two-edged sword; everyone should read some of these kinds of books, but forced readings are often taxing and boring. Then we are forced to learn one interpretation of the book. This isn't what literature should be about.Fortunately, I woke up. I've bought a mess of books, but wanted to start out with something easy and light. Jumping into &quot;War and Peace&quot; just isn't an option, especially since I'm a full-time college student. So I decided to start with &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, a book I should have read years ago but didn't. Also, I'm trying to work my way up to some of Dickens' more in-depth works, such as &quot;Bleak House&quot;.I'm not going to spend much time on the actual story, as other reviews have done a pretty good job in this area. Also, many are aware of this story through the musical adaptation. Needless to say, it's a cracking good tale with enough meat in it to satisfy the hungriest of readers.I read the Penguin edition, and have to start by saying that the introduction was, in my opinion, not very enlightening. Written by Angus Wilson, it does give some good info on what sort of inspirational material Dickens borrowed from to write this book. Wilson spends the rest of his time criticising. Maybe he was cranky because he didn't get picked to do an intro for a more &quot;formidable&quot; book.The actual book is a real hoot. It strikes just the right balances between hilarity, sadness, and darkness. I laughed out loud numerous times while reading this book. The best character in this vein is Mr. Bumble, the beadle of the work-house where Oliver grows up. Dickens is SO scathing towards this guy. The scene where Bumble is making moves on Ms. Corney is an absolute scream. If you don't laugh, you're just not trying hard enough.&quot;Oliver Twist&quot; has a dark side, too. Look at the ominous Bill Sikes. He just oozes bad feelings and you know he's going to hurt someone. The wily Jew, Fagin, is very scary, and you just cringe whenever he is on the scene. Like Satan, this guy is everywhere, causing all kinds of mischief.Apparently, literary know-alls have decided that &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; is a lesser Dickens work. Maybe that is due in some part to the touchy-feely ending. Some also don't think it has much of a message beyond its criticism of the mistreatment of Victorian England's poor. I saw strong themes of hope and redemption in the book. Who can read about poor Nancy and not see her desparate attempt at redeeming her life? Even Sikes, as irredeemable as he seems, has a guilty conscience over his crime.I can understand how some younger people might not like this book. The pacing of the book is slower than most would be used to you, and some of the language is tough for a modern reader. However, the book is timeless. We see the same things in society today that Dickens observed. When the system breaks down, people, especially children, will turn to other institutions, such as gangs, to find fulfillment. I highly recommend this book. Don't overlook it.
