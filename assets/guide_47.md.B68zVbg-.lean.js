I found many of the insights to be quite deep even though I have a very different way of looking at things.The first part looks at the capacity of individuals to have relationships, and how to read two charts against eachother (as separate charts). The thoughts here are interesting and provide a great deal that is missing in other astrology books on the subject. My own approach is quite different from Arroyo's (I tend to read the chart in this area using techniques I have borrowed from horary astrology), but Arroyo's approach is something I find challenging in a good way and providing some pieces I might otherwise miss.The next few lectures look at specific means of chart comparisons. Again, I have very different ways of working here, but still found a lot of value in the author's perspective.The final section describes progressions and transits and provides some guidelines for interpretation. This is also of interest.The informal organization of the book is offset by an impressive index making it possible to find information again when needed. On the whole this really should be seen as a classic in the field.

This volume begins with a disclaiimer, and says that it is eliminating 150 words not being indexed in ths volume, such as is, the, it, and the like.

To give you a frame of reference, stack two VHS tapes, and that is almost exactly the size of this concordance. It is a little \\"thick,\\" but it is paperback, so it is light. The definite \\"downside\\" is that in order to squeeze so many entries into such a small package... the font is amazingly small. So small in fact, that I printed out Gen. 1:1 on MS Word, and matched it to the font size in the concordance. The font size of this little concordance is 4.5 font!If you want to get some perspective on how small 4.5 is, do like I did, and copy Gen. 1:1 into your your Word Processor. Highlight the verse, then manually change the font to 4.5, then print the page. You will now see what you have to look forward to with this concordance.The font is so small that I have to take my glasses off (bifocals or reading glasses), and look at the page close-up. Nevertheless, I am okay with this when I am studying at home, since I often read without my glasses anyway. Furthermore, I ordered an additional concordance (also paperback) along with this one. It is theStrong's Handi-Reference Concordance (AMG Handi-Reference Series). Both books were \\"Used- Very Good\\" condition. I paid $.99 for the Nelson's, and $1.89 for the AMG. I will use the 4.5 font Nelson's at home, and take the AMG with me to Church.The AMG has approximately a 6.5 size font, which is almost 50% larger than the Nelson's. That is still small, but it is a lot easier on the eyes. I can read it without straining, and without having to remove my glasses. The AMG is slightly thinner, and slightly wider/taller.As I said, I got both very cheap, so I am happy with both. But if I had it to do all over, I would only purchase the AMG. It is amazing how much difference such a few points in font size can make.Additional Note: Both of these concordances are NOT exhaustive. Exhaustive (for those who don't know) means that the concordance lists every single Biblical occurrence of the word. As I stated at another review:\\"I am unsure how the editors choose which verses to include/omit, but the strength of a \\"Handi-Reference\\" concordance is that it is used for quick references (at Church, work, a Bible study, etc.), where you may be drawing a blank on a common or popular verse... but you can not remember where you read it. It is also helpful for people who need something a lot more in-depth than the concordance in the back of the average Bible... which, by the way, is also NOT exhaustive.\\""},{"Title":"Nelson's Compact Series: Compact Bible Concordance","review":"This I recived in amazing codition, just like new, compact to take anywhere I go and as always I'm totally satsified by Amazon in thier great service."},{"Title":"Nelson's Compact Series: Compact Bible Concordance","review":"awesome i only paid 94. for this thing and it looked brand new couldnt tell it was uses two thumbs way up"},{"Title":"Agape: An Ethical Analysis (Yale Publications in Religion)","review":"Outka provides an ethical analysis from an analytic perspective of Christian theological writing pertaining to agape from writers 1930 to 1970. Among the central figures that he discusses are M. C. D'Arcy, Gerard Gilleman, Soren Kierkegaard, Reinhold Niebuhr, Anders Nygren, and Paul Ramsey. This work is still one of the very best because of its rigorous analysis of love issues.Outka is not so much interested in offering his own proposals about how best to understand agape, nor is he interested in proposing a particular theological scheme. Rather, Outka analyzes prominent texts with an eye toward how their authors understand agape as ethics. \\"I am convinced that many of the historic ethical concerns of the Judeo-Christian tradition have been encapsulated in the \`love language,' and one ought to try to understand more clearly just what has been meant within that language\\" (5).Early on, Outka addresses what love as a normative, ethical principal or standard means. His concentration is upon how one's understanding of agape affects how one understands neighbor-love. Outka contends that crucial aspects of agape include the fact that agape is independent and unalterable. \\"Regard is for every person qua human existent, to be distinguished from those special traits, actions, etc., which distinguish particular personalities from each other\\" (9). Furthermore, Outka contends that agape entails a basic equality whereby one's neighbors' well-being is as valuable as another's neighbor's well-being.In chapters two and three, Outka addresses how various authors understand agape as related to loving oneself and to acting for justice. Chapter four engages how agape is related to various dominant ethical schemes and what Outka calls \\"subsidiary rules.\\" The author notes that almost all of the authors do not equate agape with a particular given moral code. Chapter five includes the author's assessment of how agape might be understood as a virtue or aspect of one's character. Chapter six entails an examination of how various authors justify or support their contention that persons ought to love with agape. In other words, these are justifying reasons for why someone might regard others with equal-regard. In the seventh chapter, Outka pays particular attention to the claims of Karl Barth with regard to agape. He notes that Barth understands agape as both equal-regard and-self sacrifice. Outka then addresses how Barth understands the major themes examined in the book's previous chapters.In the book's final chapter, Outka explores various issues that have arisen in his examination of dominant texts on agape. He proposes what he believes to be the fundamental content of human agape and some unresolved issues related to that content. \\"The meaning ascribed in the literature to love, in general, and to agape, in particular, is often characterized by both variance and ambiguity\\" (257-258). This has to do, says Outka, with the particular wider beliefs and theological schemes espoused by the writers of the love literature. It also has to do with the many ways in which the word love is used in the English language.Upon reflecting on the matters that have arisen in his examination of love texts, Outka comes to a tentative suggestion for the meaning of agape as \\"an active concern for the neighbor's well-being, which is somehow independent of particular actions of the other\\" (260). This means in part that the human must not let disparities and inequalities determine his or her basic attitudes towards others amongst others with whom he or she interacts.Outka also notes that various problems arise when one understands self-sacrifice as the quintessence of agape. \\"Generally, therefore, I am inclined to think that instead of appraising self-sacrifice as the purest and most perfect manifestation of agape, the difficulties I have considered are voided if one allows it only instrumental warrant\\" (278). Regard of one's self ought to be based upon the fact that he or she is a creature of God who is more than a means to some other end. Outka also notes that agape involves certain social and personal relations thus entailing an overlap between regard of others and social cooperation."},{"Title":"Agape: An Ethical Analysis (Yale Publications in Religion)","review":"This is the definitive book on the ethics of love at this point in time.

Theologically sophisticated, yet always accesible, the book argues for ascribing rights to animals -- including the right not to be killed and eaten -- based on the primacy of love, or the dominion of love, which according to the author should be our overriding ethical and theological principle, one that is grounded in the Bible, \\"God is love, and the one who abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him.\\" (1 Joh 4:16).I think many readers will be surprised, as I was, by how stong a case the author manages to make for animal rights, basing himself on the Bible.The author's prose is excellent.Pelle Strindlund, Sweden"},{"Title":"The Dominion of Love: Animal Rights According to the Bible","review":"The Dominion of Love:Animal Rights According to the BibleBy Norm PhelpsLantern Bookswww.lanternbooks.comReview by Karen Davis, PhD, President of United Poultry ConcernsIs there any basis for animal rights in the Bible? In The Dominion of Love, Norm Phelps, the spiritual outreach director of The Fund for Animals, responds with this question: is there any basis in Hebrew and Christian scripture for human rights? His answer is yes and no. The concept of \\"human rights\\" does not actually appear in the Western religious tradition. Human Rights is a product of 18th century Enlightenment philosophy, an idea that to this day is rejected by many governments throughout the world. Rights is an \\"implementing mechanism,\\" says Phelps, created to enforce the ethical teachings of love and compassion expressed by the Golden Rule-teachings that \\"individual conscience\\" has failed to implement. Now in the West, he says, we are living in the early years of an Enlightenment for the Animals. Where does the Bible fit in?Our culture is imbued with its teachings, everything from an eye for an eye to love your enemies to love your neighbor as yourself. Phelps focuses on the concept of loving your neighbor to urge that we enlarge our understanding of who our neighbor is to include our nonhuman animal brothers and sisters. Even if the Bible does not explicitly include chickens and cows in the ancient notion of one's neighbor, there is enough in the substance of biblical teachings and scattered passages to invite such a reading and the implementation of this reading into our daily lives and protective laws. Does not Matthew 23:37 cite the mother hen as an example of protective love where it says \\"How often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings\\"?Does the Bible support animal sacrifice and meateating? Yes in some parts, and with equal relish, here and there, it supports human slavery, rape, ethnic cleansing and other barbarisms we no longer countenance. \\"When we read in the Bible stories of God commanding or condoning the killing of animals,\\" says Phelps, \\"we should remember these tales of barbarities that God is accused of ordering against human beings. . . . Why should Biblical verses that show divine approval of animal abuse set an everlasting precedent while passages showing divine approval of the murder of men, women, and children do not?\\"Phelps concedes that his approach to the Bible involves picking and choosing-to an extent. But he legitimately argues that he is picking and choosing biblical passages that support the Bible's fundamental ethical call to love God, love Creation, love your Neighbor, and Be Merciful. A stumbling block is what he calls the \\"aristocracy theory\\" of creation, the idea that \\"man\\" alone is made in the image of God and is thus entitled to \\"reduce the rest of the earth's population to serfdom.\\"But even if one nurses an exalted view of humankind, to whom an All Powerful has ironically granted a host of \\"concessions,\\" it doesn't follow that post-Flood morality need be one's own endpoint on Earth and a license for savagery. Rather, says Phelps, if we love creation, \\"we will nurture it, comfort it, care for it.\\" The \\"dominion\\" he sees as alone hopeful consists in a conscious decision \\"to love God concretely by protecting and nurturing\\" all of our neighbors. If Judaism and Christianity do not encourage spiritual growth and a widening of human moral sympathies and obligations beyond the obscurations of history and self-centeredness, including animals \\"in the fullest unfolding of morality,\\" what good do they bring?The Dominion of Love includes valuable Appendices that identify specific biblical verses relating to the Human Treatment of Animals arranged under convenient subheadings, and Suggestions for Further Reading.

It reinforced what I had already knew to be true in my heart but was afraid to express."},{"Title":"The Dominion of Love: Animal Rights According to the Bible","review":"The bible practices animal sacrifice and it's inherently anti-compassion, anti-animal rights, anti-women's rights. The very name of this book is anti-compassion, anti-respect. Dominion. To dominate someone, or to have dominion over them, is an act of violence. Usually the vicious fight for dominance, not gentle, powerful guardians. To try to dominate someone is to try to use aggressive force to control them. Guardian is a very powerful word, the word includes respect for animals and uses gentle as possible methods to protect them and consider their needs and desires as we would any creature we have power over - like our own children. Always the powerful should respect those they have power over, because it's just luck that you have it - and you should grieve for those that don't have it and try to give your power to others. All good to all beings. Dominance is the abuse of power. The men who love the bible like to dominate women also and they would have us connect our sexual desires only to the endless dichotomy of dominion and submission of dogs, versus the goodness and equality of love.I think the bible is the most cruel and stupid book ever written. It's the philosophy of one hand clapping, the philosophy of Nothing - slavery is freedom, cruelty and chlid/animal sacrifice is love, love is gentle and kind, but oh no, love is actually your children being tortured to death in horrific sacrifices to the demands a \\"god\\" who is uh... likely a predator bio-tech jerk. Wake up. Phelps is probably really akin to Fred Phelps and this crap is probably paid for by the pyramid scheme of predation - the new trend is to write books about love and hide things about male or white supremacy in them, torture and abuse, horrible cruelty of all kinds, write a book about animal rights and slither in some anti-animal rights propaganda etc... I'm pretty sure this author is enemy propaganda and is attempting to ease you in that direction. Avoid Christianity, Pagan religions that ease you into animal abuse and all religion that practices male supremacy, white supremacy, animal torture or child torture and sacrifice - real animals and children suffer in these religions. There have been many children genuinely sacrificed and \\"martyred\\" in Christianity, just so some male supremacist jerks can secure more power for their greedy selves. It's not enough you've been given greater size and physical strength, in general, but also must control all governments, religions, family life - everything. Back off and learn some generosity. Voodoo also genuinely harms animals, as well as tribal religions that practice animal sacrifice, hunting rituals etc...I think religion can be an act of aggression - and many religions are in fact just traps that are very cruel. I'd love to see a religion some day that genuinely opposes the suppression and slavery of women, child abuse, animal abuse and the worship of the creators of this bio-tech pyramid scheme of predation. I do not believe that the people who created this world are in any way good. The snake and the tree of knowledge is meant to scare you from the truth about the knowledge of good and evil, for were you to discover it, you would discover that the creators are PREDATORS WHO CREATE PREDATORS and are no different from any other child rapists, slave owners and cruel tyrants - they are evil.

When his father was dying, he promised the man that he would help his stepmother with raising his preteen stepsister. This promise was a result of Simon's feelings of guilt for ignoring his stepsister, and his stepmother knows how to play on those guilty feelings (a stepmother, by the way, who was Simon's college sweetheart and when he took her home to meet the folks-girlfriend and Dad hit it off a little too well).Sara and Simon are very strong, likable characters.

He was the mythologized last lonely &quot;unconquered&quot; Indian who was captured in California in 1911, then spent the last few years of his life as either a guest or prisoner at a San Francisco museum, looked over by scientists who were friendly but had suspicious motives. Since Ishi's death, rumors had persisted that his brain was removed for scientific study, and modern California Indians yearned for the brain to be reunited with Ishi's ashes (themselves kept in a San Francisco cemetery), so Ishi could be given a proper Indian burial in his mountain homeland. The author, modern anthropologist Orin Starn, was instrumental in finding the brain in an obscure Smithsonian storeroom, and for helping with the process of repatriation. This detective work is the main impetus for this moving book.However, Starn describes much more than a dry academic detective story. While he tends to talk about himself a little too much and his philosophical explorations could use some editing, Starn fills this book with highly compelling coverage of modern cultural identity politics for all the parties involved in the Ishi saga. These include the modern California Indians and their divisive struggles to prove their ancestral connection to Ishi, modern whites who embrace stereotypical native mythology with misguided or even ulterior motives, and anthropologists (Starn's forbears) who have displayed shifting loyalties and ethics in their study of so-called &quot;primitive&quot; peoples. Starn also find inconsistencies in the knowledge of Ishi's life and background as espoused by caretaker anthropologist Alfred Kroeber and his wife Theodora, who wrote the famous but not entirely accurate biography &quot;Ishi in Two Worlds.&quot; Most importantly, Starn also turns up new evidence and raises new questions about the mysterious Ishi himself, who was surely more complex and human than the semi-mythological image that surrounds his life and identity. This book is a strongly considered and moving look into the far-reaching cultural legacies of a single Indian, the decimation of his people, and the modern lives of Native Americans and all others who are concerned about these legacies. [~doomsdayer520~]"},{"Title":"Ishi's Brain: In Search of America's Last \\"Wild\\" Indian","review":"At its simplest, this book is a beautifully lucid and often poignant account of how the author, anthropology Professor Orin Starn, tracked down the mysterious whereabouts of the last &quot;wild&quot; Indian's brain some 80 years after it was excised from his lifeless body on a California autopsy table. As such, the book reads like a compelling mystery novel, one that will keep the most jaded and disinterested readers hitched to a twisting and ever-surprising cross-country chain of discovery until the very end. At its most complex, it represents a keen, engaging, and constantly balanced overview of classical anthropological history in the 20th century as Professor Starn carefully uncovers, interprets, and weighs the motives and actions of one of the field's first luminaries, Alfred Kroebur, the man responsible for Ishi's emergence as a museum curiosity and stark emblem of man's &quot;uncivilized&quot; nature. The book will therefore delight Native American historians, political activists, college and grad students steeped in social and culture theory, and even casual readers interested in 20th century Americana. But regardless of the reader's background or incentive, he/she will find Professor Starn's ease and clarity in recounting this captivating story an uncommon joy indeed. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Ishi's Brain: In Search of America's Last \\"Wild\\" Indian","review":"A wonderful read, like a super-smart mystery. Full of fascinating stories, and they are all true! It also pulls together many threads -- history and current issues facing Native Americans, stones and bones, contemporary politics, the way we think about scientific inquiry -- terrific!"},{"Title":"Ishi's Brain: In Search of America's Last \\"Wild\\" Indian","review":"Ishi's story is too well known to need to be recounted here. In 1911, wandering aimlessly -- or was he going somewhere? Ishi (which wasn't really his name), the last of the Yahi Indians-- or was he? early one morning -- or was it late one afternoon? was taken in by a white community -- or was that taken capture?Theodora Kroeber turns out to have taken considerable liberties in writing her book about Ishi. In retrospect, I should not be surprised, considering the way she dressed California Indian tales in tuxedos and evening gowns for the Inland Whale.But just who was Ishi? What does he represent? How should we envisage him? Starn, who did so much to put Ishi's body back together again, in this book helps us put Ishi back together with California history, so we can better appreciate where Ishi stood at this confluence. He approaches every question with great fairness and balance. Many of his investigations of possibilities and interpretations would not occur to the average reader, and help us round out the picture.Although I say Starn writes with justice and balance, this is not a cold treatment of a dead man. He brings Ishi back to life for us, with bones beneath his flesh. He writes movingly about Grizzly Bear's Hiding Place. The whole book is beautiful, in writing style, in treatment, in reflection, in the care he takes. I, for one, am grateful for his detailed recitation of these events, because even though it may slow the book a bit, it shows proper respect for the importance of those events.I can't believe I am writing a whole review without saying anything nasty about a book. Okay, the photos, although superbly reproduced, are jumbled together in no particular order that I could conceive, and I have questions about one caption: which one is Hi Good?Great book, one that was never intended to supplant Ishi in Two Worlds, but complements it perfectly."},{"Title":"Ishi's Brain: In Search of America's Last \\"Wild\\" Indian","review":"An essential account, and the most recent explaining the great fascination with Ishi, who was, to the best of our knowledge, the last truly \`Wild' native American. Although some would argue that the Eskimos have retained their independence, the truth is that Ishi was an amazing person simply because he remained true to his lifestyle, not affected by the outside chaos of invading euro-American cultures. Ishi was a California Indian, living on land that had once been perhaps the most heavily populated Native American lands in the United States. Unlike the Indians in \`Last of the Dogmen' he didn't live in some secretive enclave of hold out Indians, ala Machu Pichu, but instead he was all alone, perhaps more sad then romantic. And this wonderful book explores Ishi, his story and his \`brain'. It explores the nature and character and extraordinary story of Americas last truly Native American. A terrible testimony to a lost culture and lost way of life. A very necessary update on the famous, but not well known, story of Ishi.The greatest downside of this telling is that it is too much narrative and not enough history. This is a shame because the story of Ishi is fascinating without the unnecessary personal jibes.Seth J. Frantzman"},{"Title":"Ishi's Brain: In Search of America's Last \\"Wild\\" Indian","review":"Somewhere in my early years I read Theodora Kroeber's books on Ishi and they have remained among my favorite books that I have occasionally reread. After reading Ishi's Brain, however, these books will keep their mystique but never have the same ring of truth.I was amazed to learn that I am a member of what Orin Starn calls the &quot;Ishi cult&quot;. I had no idea there were so many people as compelled as I am by Ishi's mythology. And now I have learned that Ishi may have been far more touched by &quot;civilization&quot; than I had formerly believed.I recently published a novel, Treasure Forest, in which a character shapes his life according to the Ishi I believed in before reading Starn's book. Daggett grows up in San Francisco in the 30's and comes under the care of a man who had known Ishi through the museum. When Daggett runs away at age 14 to head north, it is to capture the freedom he believes that Ishi had as a lone survivor in the wilderness. My character succeeds living his own version of Ishi's life right up into his 70's, when -- I won't ruin the story for you. But as I wrote, I sometimes wondered what Ishi would have thought of the story, if he would have felt a kinship with Daggett, and I've often wondered how Ishi would have liked Daggett's underground version of Grizzly Bear's Hiding Place.I would recommend that anyone who is fascinated by Ishi read Orin Starn's book. The discoveries it shares ground the Ishi mythology in very human details, bringing it closer to our own experience, coloring it with more authenticity. I am sure it will influence me as I continue to write the rest of my novel's trilogy."},{"Title":"Ishi's Brain: In Search of America's Last \\"Wild\\" Indian","review":"\\"Ishi\\" was by historical consensus the \\"last wild Indian\\" -- the last Native American in the United States living \\"traditionally\\" outside a reservation and the direct constraints of Anglo/American society or government. Ishi was found, about the age of 50, in a desperate and destitute condition near Oroville, California in 1911. The anthropology department at U.C. Berkeley, headed by a noted anthropologist, Alfred Kroeber, took responsibility for Ishi's welfare and care. Although he was \\"exhibited\\" on Sundays at a museum in San Francisco, it appears that Ishi was relatively content during his final few years in that city, before dying of tuberculosis in 1916.The story of Ishi has been published several times before, most notably by Kroeber's wife Theodora. The pretext for this book was the \\"repatriation\\" of Ishi's brain from the Smithsonian, where it had been sent shortly after his funeral and cremation, and after an autopsy had been performed on Ishi (against Kroeber's wishes) and the brain removed and preserved (almost certainly also contrary to Kroeber's wishes). The author Starn was the one who found and brought to light the correspondence documenting the transmittal of the brain to the Smithsonian, where it then had been stored, almost completely ignored and forgotten, for more than eighty years. In addition to telling the story of Ishi and how he discovered that Ishi's brain had been shipped to the Smithsonian, Starn also chronicles the efforts and political machinations surrounding the return of the brain to Native Americans, as well as the difficult decision as to who the proper recipients should be.In the course of the book there is much of interest about American Indians (especially those in California) and their callous mistreatment by the practitioners and beneficiaries of Manifest Destiny. There also is much of interest about some of the contemporary problems confronting the \\"new\\" American Indians, many of whom are now engaged (some unhappily) in squabbles over authenticity and the right to participate in the economic and commercial trappings that now inure to being an American Indian, or at least a member of a recognized tribe.To Starn's credit, the Indians are not idealized or romanticized. ISHI'S BRAIN is no politically correct screed. It reflects a conscientious effort, difficult as it may be, to be historically objective and accurate. It also reflects admirable sensitivity to and understanding of the circumstances impinging on the lives and actions of the various people Starn encountered in following the story of Ishi's brain.Turning to the negatives: ISHI'S BRAIN contains far too much that is personal to Starn. The writing tends to be verbose, sometimes seemingly the product of considerations of style rather than content. There also is unnecessary repetition. Finally, too many pages are devoted to the goings on after the Smithsonian made its decision to repatriate Ishi's brain to the Indians of the Redding Rancheria and the Pit River Tribe. For the last third or quarter of the book I truly was ready and eager for it finally to come to an end."},{"Title":"Ishi's Brain: In Search of America's Last \\"Wild\\" Indian","review":"Bev and I have just discovered a fascinating new book............ a real story of intrigue, mystery, science, flawed human nature and a dozen other superlatives.

Orin Starn is a gifted writer and Professor of Antropology At Duke University. The book is written for readers like us rather than the academic world.Ishi you may recall was the &quot;last wild indian&quot; to come out of the stone age in the USA. You'll recall his tribe had all been murdered or died of white man's diseases. Ishi was alone and spoke a language that no one on earth understood. Ishi was &quot;captured&quot; studied and exploited. You'll become as excited as we are about the story, Ishe the man, and Orin the author. You will find the story riveting and a real page turner.

Ascherson dispels the notion that Poland was just another backward East European nation. The first chapter details the early history of the country and most of the later chapters details the independence, inter-war period, WWII, and the post war Communist domination of this nation. Poland is indeed a unique nation.Poland was one of the first democracies of the world. After the partitions, Poland didn't cease to exist, but lived on with the people who lived in Austrian Galicia, Prussia's Silesia, and the Russian dominated Kingdom of Poland. The author details these struggles with the three large powers, and later struggles with the U.S.S.R. and Nazi Germany. As the Pope stated, Poland doesn't exist on any particular land, but in the hearts of its people.This is good informative short read. There are plenty of pictures in this book that add to the good writing.

These 'total critiques of society' either negate the present for an unseen but hoped for future or wish to bring about the end of history in favor of nature (something before good and evil -- a world of clever animals, I suppose). The two approaches are not mutually exclusive and come together in interesting ways in Marx. Common to both systems is the condemnation of everything that exists (human nature, morality, the current existing order) as false, unreal and oppressive, not needing reform but requiring annihilation/destruction in the vain hope for something completely other than what is.These types of radical negation of the present make even the possibility of goodness impossible -- sense a good life can only be lived in the present. Making the current lives of individuals (their happiness and value) meaningless and require giving-up or forfeiting in order to achieve contentment (content slaves, I guess) that will only come when man is made new.The book deals not just with intellectual contemplative theory but also with actions that lend support and give rise to totalitarianism. Gerhart Niemeyer says \\" Totalitarianism would not be possible in practice if it were not for a long period of intellectual erosion preceding the advent of the activist\\". The average man must accept in-part the views (about reality and ethics etc..) that come to annihilate him. Once our historical past, that which gives our present actions and reality meaning (by being a part of the transcendent/eternal) has been deconstructed -- seen to be totally false and oppressive etc.. there is nothing left to hold society together there is no common ground.Anyone could profit from reading this book -- even people like myself that no-doubt missed and misunderstood allot can gain much."},{"Title":"Kithbook: Trolls (Changeling - the Dreaming)","review":"Didn't White Wolf's short description in the Changeling rule book tell you enough about those big oafs that call themselves trolls?

The actual texts are cheaper, and I find that I get a fuller experience of the book when I read it myself.David Sedaris is the exception to that rule.Don't get me wrong; I love reading his work. I've read everything I can by him and enjoyed every mintue. The exception is that as much as I enjoy reading his work, listening to him read it is all that much better.Sedaris' voice is perfect; soft and dry like his humor. And since most of these stories and essays are autobiographical in nature, his reading takes on a kind of life that you can't get by reading it, it becomes more like a friend telling an anecdote at a party, it becomes personal.Anybody can be slapstick. Anyone can put on a goofy voice and make you laugh by being silly. David Sedaris gives you more to laugh about, and is all the better for it.

One does get the sense from some of the stories that Sedaris was cleaning out his bottom drawer to capitalize on the success of his Santaland Diaries by pasting together a book-length work.But Sedaris' reading, with the help of his sister who does the female or young boy parts, makes the book exceptionally funny. The \\"Rooster\\" story is just terrific. I also loved the \\"Homophobia Newsletter\\" as a wonderful bit of irony about those who embrace victim-hood a bit too easily. That and the \\"Rooster\\" made me laugh the most.The alcoholism theme runs in a number of stories and is dealt with the most in \\"Barrel Fever.\\" I found this story to be quite interesting in its use of irony, including the heresy of poking fun at the 12-steppers whose cure is sometimes almost as bad as the disease.These stories are good and the reading even better."},{"Title":"Barrel Fever and Other Stories","review":"This is the best of the best, as far as I'm concerned. \\"You Can't Kill the Rooster\\" will crack up anyone raised in or currently living in the South - we all have known guys like David's younger brother Paul, a.k.a.

There's almost nothing about the obscure Russian province of their obsession in the book--it's mostly a chronicle of the hobbies of various people who are probably about as interesting--but not more interesting--than most of your friends. The childlike enthusiasm they develop for the language and history of Tuva is charming at times, but after a while their relentless ignorance even of the most basic ways of going about collecting information starts to wewar. Their insistence on providing direct translations of Tuvan in the original turkic word order must seem to the author to be cute--to this reader it came across as mocking the language. Almost any foreign language would sound ridiculous if translated word for word with no corrections for grammar or word order. Both grammar and vocabulary of Tuvan appear to be extremely similar to turkish, so they had huge resources available to them to decipher the language, but it appears from the book that none of them ever figured out that they were even dealing with a turkic language. They never even mention the total lack of words for gender in Tuvan, or the lack of irregular verbs--a huge boon to a prospective langauge student.

Instead, I was bored with insipid details of the author's attempts to arrange a trip to the USSR and other assorted junk. It did not even spend much time on Tuva itself, but on unrelated trivia. It was apparent that the author was immensely more interested in the trip than Feynman, and that even he wasn't interested enough to stay at it to fruition. The author trades on the Feynman name to shamelessly promote the book and con the reader into plodding through endless drivel. Don't bother."},{"Title":"Tuva or Bust: Richard Feynman's Last Journey (plus 33 1/3 Record)","review":"When I was a kid in the 1950s I collected stamps and had quite a few from a mysterious little land called &quot;Tannu Tuva&quot;. It always intrigued me because though I could find it on the old globe we had at home (made before the USSR swallowed the unfortunate Tuvans in 1944)I never heard the slightest news from there, nor did I ever hear of anyone going or coming from that little red country sandwiched between the yellow Soviet Union and green Mongolia. Time passed. A lot of time. Fast forward in fact, forty years. One day I saw a new book advertised--TUVA OR BUST. I could scarcely believe that somebody else in America remembered that hapless little country that once issued diamond and triangle stamps with yaks, camels, archers, and horsemen on them. Yet, they had it at our local bookstore. I bought it and read it as soon as I got home. What a treat ! I had never heard of Richard Feynman, not being a physics aficionado, but he turned out to be a great character. I enjoyed reading about his years-long efforts with Ralph Leighton to get to Tuva. They went through all kinds of trouble and interesting side voyages. I strongly recommend that you read this book. For me, reading the book was only a beginning. I listened to the plastic disc of Tuvan throat singing that came with the book, and subsequently bought tapes and attended Tuvan concerts by the group Huun Huur Tu in Boston. I also became a &quot;Friend of Tuva&quot;. You can find their website on the net. I still drive around with my 'Tuva or Bust' bumper sticker. All of this stemmed from reading this delightful book on a faraway, unknown country and two people's adventures trying to get there. A very pleasurable experience."},{"Title":"Tuva or Bust: Richard Feynman's Last Journey (plus 33 1/3 Record)","review":"&quot;Tuva or Bust!&quot; is the story of three friends in the 1980s, who were determined to travel to Tuva, a little known land in Central Asia, which at that time was part of the Soviet Union. Their original motivation? As Richard Feynman says in the first chapter, &quot;A place that's spelled K-Y-Z-Y-L (Tuva's capitol) has just got to be interesting!&quot;The book chronicles the adventures and misadventures of Ralph Leighton, one of Feynman's longtime friends. Though the book is subtitled &quot;Richard Feynman's Last Journey,&quot; it's really Leighton's story; Feynman is more of an inspiration and a supporting character. Over several years, Leighton and his friends wrote letters, researched articles, read books, and became more and more fascinated by Tuva, a tiny country in the middle of nowhere. They learned, among other things, that Tuvans practice three different types of steppe herding lifestyles, within a hundred miles of each other, and that Tuva is the home of throat-singing, a musical technique in which a single person produces two notes at the same time.Leighton's narration is chatty, reminiscent of Feynman's autobiographical works; one suspects Leighton learned to tell anecdotes from his friend. However, Leighton isn't as inherently fascinating a narrator as Feynman. Also, Feynman's persistent cancer, which kept him from participating in several preliminary trips, and finally killed him shortly before Leighton received permission for a group of Americans to travel to Tuva itself, casts a pall over the book.Still, this is a fascinating story -- a great example of what people can do if they really care about a cause, and don't realize precisely how little chance they have of succeeding. It is also informative, if somewhat superficial in its description of Tuvan culture; I now want to know more about Central Asian peoples, and Tuvans in particular. But while the chapter &quot;Reflections 2000,&quot; included in the new paperback version of &quot;Tuva or Bust!&quot; is interesting, I really don't think it was fair of Leighton to mention a new idea for a Tuvan monument to Feynman, and refuse to give any details. Now I want another reprint!"},{"Title":"Tuva or Bust: Richard Feynman's Last Journey (plus 33 1/3 Record)","review":"I began reading &quot;Tuva or Bust&quot; as a result of my admirationfor physicist Richard Feynman.

Feynman himself passed away from cancer shortly before they got permission to actually travel to Tuva, a remote region of Mongolia near the Altai mountains, a 10,000-foot-high mountain range that separates eastern Mongolia from western China. But because of his illness, Feynman himself isn't so much the protagonist in this story so much as the inspiration, as Leighton discusses the research and preparations that led up to the final journey. But there is still enough of the inimitable Feynman, the &quot;curious character&quot; as he calls himself, in the narrative for it to be enjoyable to long-time Feynman fans. The pictures of Feynman in an elaborate Tahitian headress playing the drums at a concert and dressed up like a Tibetan lama with hat and prayer wheel are truly comical and show the great physicist certainly had a sense of humour about himself too--even as he was dying from cancer.I came to the book partly because I already knew something about Tuvan throat singing and had read a little bit about Ural-Altaic linguistics, and so knew something about the Mongolian languages, and a little about the life-style of the herders in the area. It turns out the Altaic language group has had some capable linguists studying the family over the last 30 years, and a lot more is known now than in the past. I've found at least one site with much good information on Mongolian and Altaic languages on the web in the last year.But all that was by way of saying, stangely enough, that I actually knew something about this remote and obscure area of the world before reading this book, and so was interested to see what sort of adventures Feynman and his friend might have there. Although Feynman himself never made it there, I learned much about the country I hadn't known before, and having Feynman's unique and funny perspective on it made it all the more enjoyable."},{"Title":"Tuva or Bust: Richard Feynman's Last Journey (plus 33 1/3 Record)","review":"This is a book by Ralph Leighton. It chronicles the adventures he and others had in trying to get to visit Tanu Tuva with Richard Feynman, the American Nobel prize-winning physicist.Do you know where Tanu Tuva is located? I do, as I once saw it on a globe years ago. It was a country wedged between Russia and Mongolia, but Stalin took it over in the 1940's. Like the people in the book, exotic locales like this interest me, so I had to read this book.The subtitle of the book is \\"Richard Feynman's Last Journey\\" - but Feynman died before getting to Tuva. Sort of sad after all the trouble they went to to get there. The author did go, but it was very anti-climatic, as he barely said anything about the actual trip after pages on all the hoops they had to go through to get there.If you read the book, it seems like Feynman was involved, but not nearly as much as the author and others mentioned in the book. Well, Feynman was famous, so I guess the subtitle helped attract attention to the book. In any case, the story is interesting and illustrates how weird and frustrating it was to deal with the old USSR - something quickly being forgotten perhaps.To digress, I had a Russian penpal during communist rule, and it was interesting. I had to use registered mail (very expensive) to be sure he saw my letters. He actually defected to England before the Communists were out in Russia, and I got to meet him there at the end of a business trip. Sort of made the book relate to me more as I had this experience.Getting back to the book review, I do recommend the book. It is like a time capsule for life so different, but not that long ago.

Sure: it's not exclusively centered in Feynman, but more around his struggle to make it to this faraway, almost concealed land of Tuva, between Russia and Mongolia.It's about a man's dream and struggle to make it come true. All the books you'll find touching Feynman in one way or another come down to one thing: the meaning of life, what it is to live and fight through life, while having fun at the same time.I DO recommend this book: it is filled with adventure and shows a lot of Feynman's innate curiosity (in an almost childish way, which is good!) and perseverance (an incredible trait which most of us have a lot to learn from).

During that time a professor of mine showed us a delightful NOVA documentary on Feynman. There was a great interview with Ralph Leighton, Feynman's friend, and Feynman himself who became rather obessed with getting to Tuva. Tuva was once a small independent country at the turn of the 20th century(and before) but later was taken over by the Soviet Union. I love this book because it gives you a wonderful view of the genius of Feynman as well as his human side that other more academic books tend to leave out or dismiss. As a side note, recently on a trip to Europe, I met a man who I swear WAS Richard Feynman, I even called out, &quot;Dr. Feynman&quot; and the man turned. He pretended to speak no English and walked away from me. Could Feynman still be alive and living well in Switzerland?"},{"Title":"Tuva or Bust: Richard Feynman's Last Journey (plus 33 1/3 Record)","review":"A peculiar book: Ralph Leighton's TUVA OR BUST isn't really about Richard Feynman, who, the more one reads about him, begins to seem a genius, yes, but more than a little insufferable. He does instigate this whimsical notion of visiting Tannu Tuva (which had become Tuvinskaya of the U.S.S.R. [the book takes place from the late 1970s to Feynman's death in 1989]), but the ball is picked up by Leighton, and Feynman is merely a supporting actor in the book.The quest carries itself through many frustrations, mostly having to do w/ the hermetic paranoia of the Soviet Union, which seems to work like an enormous rural county: If you know someone, then things can be smoothed out; if not, then the official channels will be little help.I'm not sure why anyone would read this book. There's no reason to if you're interested in Feynman, because, besides his concoctions to fit in at Esalen, amongst the New Age mumbo-jumbo, his mind is absent from the book. His personality & his drumming are there on occasion, but Feynman's thinking, no.Leighton is not intrinsically interesting, and though a fluent writer, gives little sense of character. All the foreigners are forgettable, so the index is very handy. When a name turns up on page 150, say, then one can look it up to see which person this is.As one reads, one begins to have the same thoughts about oneself that one has about Leighton's attempts to visit Tuva: Why am I going on?. Moreover, I think that one comes up with the same answer: Just to get through the damn thing. By the time that Leighton reaches Tuva (without Feynman, who died just a smidgen too soon), the appearance is anti-climactic, and the land is colorless: A Nevada trailer-park suburb, but with yurts instead of double-wides.TUVA OR BUST! becomes a critique of bureaucracy. The slow, spirit-killing, mind-numbing bureaucracy of the Soviet Union ensured that Feynman would die without reaching Tuva. Our world, in which stupid little men can control our lives, is death to the spirit, and is death to the spirit of Feynman, insufferable though he may be, and inexplicably kow-towed to by everyone (you get the feeling that Feynman never opens a door for anyone or shuts one for himself).TUVA OR BUST!, in its pedestrian prose, preaches, unwittingly, I think, for a freedom for whimsy, for the spirit, for the individual. At the same time, excepting the author and his male friends (his wife is also colorless), the book has no individuals. So, by the end, nothing: No Tuva to speak of, no more Feynman, nothing but an accomplishment to scratch off the list."},{"Title":"Tuva or Bust: Richard Feynman's Last Journey (plus 33 1/3 Record)","review":"Ever wonder what happened to the country that issued those funny shaped stamps in the 1930s?

And before Google Maps & Google Earth, Americans could purchase satellite photographs of almost anywhere in the world from their government.Tuva or Bust is the story of how, during the cold war, world famous Nobel Prize winning American physicist Richard Feynman decided he wanted to go to an obscure and remote region of the U.S.S.R. Remember that in those days, travel within the U.S.S.R. was restricted. It was difficult even for Russians to go there unless they had some sort of official reason for going. Foreigners wanting to wander around the country found it impossible to get permission.One evening with his friend Ralph Leighton (the author of this book) Feynman started pouring over maps. They came across a city called Kyzyl and decided that a place name spelled with two \\"y\\"s and a \\"z\\" had to be interesting and they decided to go there.They researched the place in libraries, they sent to the US government for satellite photos, and from these they started mapping out the streets and buildings. They began a correspondence with locals. Finally they applied for permission to travel there.Being a famous scientist, Feynman knew he could easily get permission to visit the U.S.S.R. and that, ironically in a supposedly classless society, he be treated like royalty. He also knew that he'd have to agree to several lectures and to meet prominent Soviet scientists and officials. And he also knew that a faceless bureaucrat could at any moment during his tour, cancel his visit to his real desired destination. He did not want that. He just wanted to go to Tuva. So he challenged himself to get there but without agreeing to any quid pro quo. That meant he wanted to go there exclusively as a private citizen.Tuva or Bust is an excellent posthumous follow up to Feynman's two autobiographies. Written in exactly the same tone and with the same style, it's also more focused on a single episode of Feynman's life.A charming and fun little book.Vincent Poirier, Tokyo"},{"Title":"Tuva or Bust: Richard Feynman's Last Journey (plus 33 1/3 Record)","review":"Did you know of certain artists who painted scenes on a human hair!

Richard Feynman, the Nobel Prize-winning physicist who would later serve on the commission investigating the Challenger disaster (in 1986), asked his friend and drumming partner Ralph Leighton whether he knew what had become of Tannu Tuva. Leighton had never heard of the place and suspected he was being set up, but the Encyclopedia Britannica confirmed its existence. Tannu Tuva was once an independent country, but it became part of the Soviet Union in 1944. When Feynman and Leighton learned that the capital of Tuva was Kyzyl--a city without any proper vowels in its name--they knew they had to go there: \\"A place that's spelled K-Y-Z-Y-L has just *got* to be interesting!\\"So began our heroes' eleven-year quest to reach Tuva, a more difficult project than you might imagine. Tuva, buried in the Asian heartland, was isolated, the Soviet Union was forbidding, and even basic information was hard to come by. (This quest, remember, was undertaken before the explosion of the internet. One catches oneself, when reading the book, thinking anachronistically about the task: why not just Google the place?) Eventually, of course, they learned an awful lot--about Tuvan throat-singing (my 1991 edition came with a 45!) and Kyzyl's main buildings, about Tuvan stone carvings and shamanism. And they communicated with Tuvans in Tuvan, using a Tuvan-Mongolian-Russian phrasebook that they turned into a Tuvan-Mongolian-Russian-English phrasebook.Leighton's account of their various attempts to reach Tuva can be confusing--lots of names to remember of contacts who may or may not have wound up aiding in the effort. It all gets a bit muddied. And there is not as much of Feynman in the book as one would like. Tuva or Bust is primarily an account of Leighton's role in the quest, with Feynman making brief appearances now and then. Still, it is good to be in the physicist's company, however briefly, and it is good to be reminded, by this quixotic project of his, of Feynman's joy in experience.Feynman fans, in short, will enjoy the book. Those who are not acquainted with him already, however, should become fans first by reading Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! and What Do You Care What Other People Think?

If you are interested in this region of the world I recommend the film &#34;Genghis Blues&#34; instead. The film is way more insightful and interesting."},{"Title":"Tuva or Bust: Richard Feynman's Last Journey (plus 33 1/3 Record)","review":"I saw Richard Feynman in the program: \\" Tannu Tuva or Bust\\" quite some time ago. So, when I came across this book, I had to have it, and like the show, it did not dissapoint me...at all. As a matter of fact, it was quite entertaining and informative, as Professor Feynman typically is... Thankyou.Peter GrassoDerry,NH"},{"Title":"Tuva or Bust: Richard Feynman's Last Journey (plus 33 1/3 Record)","review":"I think 'Surely You're Joking...' and 'What do you Care...' are the best biographical books on Feynman. They were written by RL with Feynman as first person, that is, as if Feynman wrote it. To me, this added greatly to the books, and I had hoped for something similar from this book.Unfortunately, Tuva or Bust! is written from RL's point of view, not Feynman's. I guess there was not enough direct involvement by Feynman to support writing in Feynman's words. Or maybe RL just wanted to write from his own point of view for a change. Just be aware, this is more a Leighton book than a Feynman book.The book and other reviewers write about the journey being greater than the destination, which I completely understand. But, word-for-word, this book is about RL's journey with Feynman checking in from time to time.That said, I think it is still very much worth reading. It is a facinating story of a facinating time in international affairs, and for the die-hard Feynman buff, there is plenty of new information and trivia. Who would have expected a Feynman connection to Alan Alda?"},{"Title":"Tuva or Bust: Richard Feynman's Last Journey (plus 33 1/3 Record)","review":"Tuva or Bust, by Feynman's close friend Ralph Leighton is a well-written account of attempts by Richard Feynman, Leighton and friends to visit Tuva. The quixotic effort begins with a seemingly random aside regarding \\"Tannu Tuva\\" and its unusual stamps. One thing leads to another and eventually Feynman and Leighton become obsessed with Tuva, learning everything they can about it, and desperately trying to get to Tuva.Reading this book in 2010 reminds a reader of how much the world has changed in the 20+ years since the events recounted in the book transpired. From Tuva being a forbidden location to foreigners, the Cold War, problems trying to locate people, to the difficulties and expenses in telecommunications and transportation, the amazing changes wrought by the telecommmunications/Internet revolution of the past twenty years is glaringly obvious. Although getting to Tuva is not very easy even in 2010, the ease of reaching there and learning about couldn't be more shockingly different. Searches that we can now complete in less than a second with an Internet search engine took Leighton months to complete, if ever. Someone wanting a Tuvan pen pal could now presumably just send out an e-mail. Imagining (or remembering) what life was like 20 years ago was part of the fun of the book for me.The challenges faced by the group, whether overcome or not, provide for stimulating and sometimes entertaining moments. In this day of instant gratification one can delight at the simple pleasures that they achieved through simply getting a book on Tuva, obtaining a picture of it, or simply a letter from a real Tuvan. Feynman's battle with cancer, his resilient spirit, bonhomie, and perseverance are inspiring.Whether you're interested in Feynman, Tuva, the Soviet Union, or are simply curious, I heartily recommend this book."},{"Title":"Tuva or Bust: Richard Feynman's Last Journey (plus 33 1/3 Record)","review":"While I truly enjoyed the story, particularly the casual and engaging narrative of Leighton, the title was misleading. We are led to believe the book is about &quot;Feynman's last journery&quot;, but the irreverant genius is only a secondary character. The story is truly a first-person narrative about Leighton's adventures in getting to Tuva.It is a good read, and I do recommend it, but not if you are looking for greater insight into the life or mind of Richard Feynman."},{"Title":"Tuva or Bust: Richard Feynman's Last Journey (plus 33 1/3 Record)","review":"Having the priviledge of seeing the play QED catalyzed my purchase of this wonderful book. This is no ordinary journey by no ordinary genius(es). It is a hilarious example of persistance required to learn all there is to know (without the aid of the Internet!) about an inaccessible culture, and then secure permission to travel to a dream-like land. This easy to read book makes me want to pick an obscure topic and make it my own hobby.My only disappointment is that the narrative lacked information about Professor Feynman's more personal trials and thoughts during this demanding period of his life. There were many chapters that rarely mentioned Feynman as the &quot;journey&quot; continued. Beyond that, it is a must read, not just for Feynman fans like myself, but for all of us that need to refresh ourselves with a bit of eccentricity in the form of a unique, personal goal."},{"Title":"Sexy Book","review":"esther takes pictures and they pulsate, they dance, they are so incredibly alight with life and joy and sexiness! there's a word that sums it all up: ALIVE."},{"Title":"From Within The Mist","review":"If you love a good fantasy, you're in for a real treat with FROM WITHIN THE MIST!In THE FACE by Jeanine Berry, we move into the future. Scientists have been studying the giant face on this forsaken planet for quite some time. What happens when a young woman with psy powers finds something within the statue within days of arriving? And what exactly does she find?In THE PRICE OF THE SONG by Lazette Gifford, we go back to medieval times. We meet a bard, captured by a group of bandits, blinded and forced to play for them. The bard was used to playing for kings and is now forced to play for bandits. What happens when a beautiful Dryad offers him freedom in exchange for a song?In THE ANCIENT ONE by Sheri L. McGathy, we meet a being. This being lives in the mist. She was born in the mist and has spent all her time within. The beings finally go to a planet and she befriends the spirits of the forest. They show her a glimpse of the future, a horrible future she is determined to avoid. The spirits ask for her help. Will she stay, or will she leave with the rest of her kind?These are just a few of the wonderful stories contained in the anthology. These are all wonderfully written stories, guaranteed to transport you to another time and place. These stories all have a feel of the uncommon and a unique quality and fit well together. I highly recommend this anthology to all lovers of fantasy!"},{"Title":"Elizabeth the Great","review":"A truly excellent book for someone who, like me, wants to find out not only about the events of Elizabeth's life but also what Elizabeth was like as a person. The writing style is clear and very enjoyable and makes Elizabeth seem alive again. As a schoolboy in England, I studied the Tudor Period, but this book goes way above and beyond what one is taught at school level. I learned so much more about Elizabeth's life and personality, that it has given me a whole new level of respect for someone who I had already held in high esteem. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Elizabeth the Great","review":"This book is incredibly well written. It also has the ring of truth. It is not just a biography of Elizabeth I, though it does that superbly, with great insight and scholarship, and always with documentation so that there is a tie-in to actual happenings. But this book also writes in depth about the key people around Queen Elizabeth, so that they too come alive, and sets them all firmly in a vivid and well-described background. This book is fascinating, literate, and a great read, especially for those of us who have an interest in this period in history and its characters."},{"Title":"Elizabeth the Great","review":"This book is not a 'life and times' volume. It is single-minded in its telling of Elizabeth's life. I found the book to be captivating. I keep it on my desk at work for those rare days when I don't go out to lunch. I know that I can always open the book to any page and find an interesting story ahead."},{"Title":"Elizabeth the Great","review":"This is a fascinating look at a fascinating and complex woman. Jenkins's theories as to why Queen Elizabeth never married are interesting and feel much more plausible than the idea that the Queen was continually frustrated in her attempts to marry. That she had a deep-seated fear of marriage and never intended to marry feels more \\"on the mark,\\" given Elizabeth's experiences as a child and teenager. By the time Elizabeth was eight, she had already attended two executions, and her mother and first stepmother were both beheaded long before Elizabeth was grown.Jenkins does gloss over or barely mention some important historical events, but she explains why in her preface: she wanted to focus on the world immediately surrounding Elizabeth. As a result we get a lively account of a woman who ruled England with a velvet fist. Jenkins also does an artful job of bringing alive the people who advised Queen Elizabeth, and the motives of both the Queen and the people who surrounded her are shown fully. Her romantic yet platonic love affair with Robert Dudley is dwelt upon a great deal, and - despite Dudley's shortcomings - it made me sad they never married and bore children together.I did have a little trouble following some events. After Dudley is made Earl of Lieceister, this is the way Jenkins refers to him. She changes the names of other characters also as they move up in rank in the military or become Earls. She also occasionally goes into great detail about an event without reference to what event it actually is (or makes the reference in passing), and I had to read certain paragraphs a couple of times to understand what she was referring to.But the challenge of that doesn't detract from the writing; the book reads like good fiction. The intrigue, negotiating, and secret plots are more complex and better than any novel, because the peril to Elizabeth's life was real. Jenkins also presents a stellar bibliography; it's evident she researched the subject matter thoroughly. I can't wait to read more by Jenkins."},{"Title":"Elizabeth the Great","review":"once i began reading this book,i could not put it down. it is so very fascinating to read the life of elizabeth as written by elizabeth jenkins. this author is brilliant!i think what makes this book so special is,the author's eloquence with her words and her description of history. this biography is rich,full,and rounded. this book is A MUST for anyone interested in queen elizabeth the first. do not pass up this book!!!"},{"Title":"Elizabeth the Great","review":"This excellent book paints an unforgettable portrait of Elizabeth I, &quot;Good Queen Bess&quot; to her loving subjects. Her fascinating life and vibrant personality are caught with great truth and clarity. Elizabeth Regina-LONG LIVE THE QUEEN!"},{"Title":"Elizabeth the Great","review":"I have an old copy of the book, which I have reread a couple of times. This is the most readable biography of Elizabeth I that I have read."},{"Title":"Elizabeth the Great","review":"After reading &quot;Feast In The Morning&quot;, I found I was hooked on these real people and this era. I just had to know what happened after the death of Elizabeth's brother. This biography covers the entire lifetime of Elizabeth, at times it is very difficult to follow. As a persons name and place names were often the same, and in many cases the author would be talking about Lord Robert Dunley, then later she may refer to him as the Protector or as the Earl of Leicester, or as Leicester or The Earl. As you can see this can get confusing to follow who is who.This book really gives you the feel of the Queen and her times. Her nemisis Mary Queen of Scots was present throughout Elizabeth's lifetime and had a big influnence on her. Many times I wondered what I would do if faced with Elizabeth's problems, she was very creative.Many importaint parts of history may have been left out or hardly mentioned, while other unimportaint events were exponded on.It was interesting to read about the Earl of Oxford and his relationship with the Queen, as now there seems to be a camp of people who believe that he was really Shakespear. The author was recounting their relationship without the knowledge of this controversity."},{"Title":"Sugars and Flours: How They Make us Crazy, Sick and Fat, and What to do About It","review":"I sat down to read Joan Ifland's book with a king-sized Snickers candy bar in my hand--I was that helpless where sugar and flour were concerned. But two chapters in, I knew that what I was reading was going to change my life forever. Joan provides a blueprint for living a life free of binges, uncontrollable cravings, and raging. This book is not a diet book, it is a simple, straight-forward guide for a lifetime of good health, and all the associated benefits--including better self-esteem and personal satisfaction. Since I have eliminated sugar and flour from my diet, I have lost more than 70 pounds. My sleep apnea symptoms have disappeared, and I no longer snore! My knees can support my body without pain, and I no longer have to climb the stairs one step at a time. I believe I may have avoided a collision course with diabetes. But the very best part of Joan's program for me is the inner calm I feel where sugars and flours are concerned. I no longer worry and wonder and obsess about where my next sugar \\"fix\\" is coming from, and I am able to make rational decisions about what I need to eat and when. If you ever find yourself eating food that your body doesn't need, you will understand what I mean about being set free. Please give Joan's book a try. Her words are simple, but profound, and they can change your life. May you discover a new, wonderful way of living."},{"Title":"Sugars and Flours: How They Make us Crazy, Sick and Fat, and What to do About It","review":"I was fortunate to hear Joan's &quot;Flour and Sugar&quot; presentation on the first Tuesday night in September. Before she was half way through, I knew her words were changing my life. I purchased the Sugars and Flours book that night.On Saturday morning, I began reading it aloud while my husband and I were driving to Austin for the weekend. That afternoon, we went to Whole Foods and purchased every grain listed in her book as well as other items to get us started. The following day, on Sunday, we had our first day of abstinence from sugar, flour and wheat.Both my husband and I now have 7 1/2 weeks of abstinence, and we are grateful every day. This is the most nurturing thing we have ever done for our bodies. My lifelong sleep disorder left me immediately. We have more constant energy and also our moods are very constant. My husband's snoring has almost completely stopped, and overall we feel our lives are richer. The weight for us is secondary, but additionally, my huband has lost 12 lbs and I have lost 4 lbs.We are extremely grateful to Joan for writing this book and highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in optimal health."},{"Title":"Sugars and Flours: How They Make us Crazy, Sick and Fat, and What to do About It","review":"Joan Ifland's book changed my life. I began implementing the recommendations within it four years ago, when the book was in an earlier incarnation. I lost 50 pounds effortlessly. I have been implementing the book's food plan ever since and have kept the weight off. Eliminating sugars and flours has made me feel better in so many ways. I recommend this book without reservation."},{"Title":"Sugars and Flours: How They Make us Crazy, Sick and Fat, and What to do About It","review":"In this book Ms. Ifland describes what I did not recognize as my addiction to carbohydrates. While addiction may seem a rather strong term to describe anyone's relationship with food, Ms Ifland does a good job of detailing, and documenting, the pattern of compulsive and irrational eating habits that can arise as a result of the way the body digests and processes simple and complex sugars. In the same way that booze can trigger excessive drinking in an alcoholic and a drug can lead to uncontrolled using by a drug addict it is shown that carbohydrate metabolism in many individuals can lead to irrational cravings and eating urges -- even if an individual is not, per se, hungry. I had always thought that I could control my eating and lose weight &quot;if I put my mind to it.&quot; While a person must always be ready to employ mental tools to combat compulsive eating, the elimination of carbohydrates from my diet has eliminated the overwhelming physiological urges that were almost unbeatable by sheer willpower. This food program takes away the offending substances that drove me to the pantry or the refrigerator. In my compulsion to reestablish my sugar levels, I would cram anything into my mouth -- from bread to candy to fruit to nuts. Once I started on this binge I would not stop, even when feeling full or when the symptoms of hypoglycemia had abated. Later, when my blood sugar levels had come down, I would resume eating in an attempt to get another jolt of sugar, or to insure that they did not dip down to low levels again. I did not know that I was being driven by my bodily cravings, until I read this book. I must say that within the first three days of eliminating sugar, flour and wheat I saw a dramatic drop in my craving for excessive food intake. It was such a liberating experience! If you think you might fit the description of one who struggles with carbohydrate addiction, give this food program a try. It is not as hard to give up these offending substances up as it may first seem. And you will not be sorry with the results. I lost 30 pounds without effort over three and one half months."},{"Title":"Sugars and Flours: How They Make us Crazy, Sick and Fat, and What to do About It","review":"I love what Ifland has to say, and I agree wholeheartedly with the idea that it is sugars and flours that are making us and our society sick and crazy. I had been thinking and heading this way for a while, and reading her book helped me to take the next step into freeing my body of these substances.For my own first phase, I gave up obvious refined sugar and all wheat for Lent. I have never felt better, and plan to continue this way. I could never have done it a few years ago, when I couldn't digest a meal without the acid of a cola to assist me!I gave the book only four stars because it is in dire need of a really good professional editor. (I would give it 4.5 if I could!) She tells you from the outset that she is just writing down her own experiences and ideas, and the casual style comes across all too clearly. This book is so important, and I think a good editor could clarify the information that is presented.The second weakness is the recipes. Again, she warns you that she is deliberately vague with them, to give you the idea of how to cook this way rather than specific recipes. As something of a &quot;foodie&quot;, I was very turned off by some of the recipes, and in particular by their general style. I could see that if you were really working to recover from a serious food addiction, you might need to take her rather austere route, but in general I really don't believe that wanting food that looks and tastes great is at all incompatible with eliminating sugars and flours from your diet. Quite the opposite!I hate to be the only person to give a down note to the book. I do still highly recommend it - all my friends can attest to that! I'd just really like to see it produced more professionally. Do read the other reviews, they are quite inspiring."},{"Title":"Sugars and Flours: How They Make us Crazy, Sick and Fat, and What to do About It","review":"This is a very eye-opening book!

E.D.E.N. Southworth was creating fearless, independent, intelligent heroines at a time when her contemporary best selling novelists were portraying silent and submissive heroines. Capitola and the other colorful characters in the story are unique and endearing, in spite of their melodramatic qualities. Because this was first a serial publication, every chapter is full of action and fun. I will always recommend this book to friends, and in fact, I am ready to name my first daughter Capitola! Read this book!"},{"Title":"The Hidden Hand or, Capitola the Madcap (American Women Writers Series)","review":"I just loved this book. I started out reading it for a class, but the class was cancelled. I finished it anyway, and I think everyone should read this book. Capitola is sassy and brave and daring and smart.Everything a heroine should be!!"},{"Title":"The Hidden Hand or, Capitola the Madcap (American Women Writers Series)","review":"This novel, originally written in 1859, begins with Colonel Warfield, \\"Old Hurricane,\\" being called from his cozy bed into a raging storm to hear the deathbed confession of an old, black slave. It seems that the evil Gabriel Le Noir had killed his brother and taken his pregnant sister-in-law into hiding. This old slave attended the birth of the twins--one stillborn boy, one living girl--and hid the girl and raised her by herself. This girl, Capitola, was now living in New York City and was 13 years old. Old Hurricane fetches the girl and has her live with him as his ward.Meanwhile, the story of Marah Rocke and her 18 year old son Traverse begins. She's a wholesome, suffering single mother. Traverse is noble and hard-working. They are befriended by Doctor Day and his lovely daughter Clara. Traverse and Clara fall in love, but first, Traverse must establish himself as a doctor and so on. Evil tidings befall, and their love is thwarted. Will it ever work out?Meanwhile, back at Hurricane Hall, Capitola grows up and is quite a pistol. She's spunky, disobedient, and thoroughly enjoyable to read about. She captures a notorious criminal and escapes from a few of them as well.But, how do these stories tie together? Who is Col. Warfield's nephew? His estranged wife? How do the evil Le Noirs fit into this story? Will Traverse be shot in the army? Will Clara be force to marry Craven Le Noir? All these tantalizing questions are answered in a clean, entertaining story which leaves you with a happy ending.If you enjoy adventure with a somewhat predictable outcome, morals entwined in your stories, and don't mind young men who would die for their mothers, then I recommend this book to you. It's not overtly heavy on the morality and sentimentality as some old reprints are. If you're a cynical old jade who doesn't want to spend 400+ pages reading about these folk, then go watch some TV."},{"Title":"The Hidden Hand or, Capitola the Madcap (American Women Writers Series)","review":"The book is really good.

She didn't even notice the funky odor wafting over from the adjacent cubicle, where fellow copywriter Fred Leary had died unnoticed--until Haley made a fateful visit to his side of the dividing wall.And things can only go downhill from there, as a shocked Haley Jane bumbles her way from one bad decision to the next: feeling up the investigating police officer; asking for a raise but getting fired; and asking for support from her Girlie Brunch bunch, which lands her an appointment with an unusual new age guidance guru, as well as the starring role in her best friend's thesis on human sexuality. If only Haley Jane's well-meaning friends could actually make good on their intentions to coach her through her man hunt and job search, maybe she could wind up with both the hunky cop and the career of her dreams!Then again, knowing those girls, maybe not.What worked for me:There was plenty of humor in this story, along with some terrific (and sometimes hot) twists in the plot. I'm not sure if the author has plans to do so, but the door was left open to revisit this fun group of gals at a later date.Size-wisethe girls were varied. The main character, petite Haley Jane, didn't have size issues per se, but she did entertain fantasies of being a stacked, blonde, sharp shooting Amazonian member of Mensa. Perhaps it had to do with the Bavarian bar maid's outfit she wore in one scene, but Haley Jane took on a decided Sandra Bullock-like appearance in my imagination. (Think \\"Miss Congeniality here.)What didn't work for me:There were a couple of scenes I could have lived without, and the writing could have been more polished. Also I felt I didn't get to know the characters as deeply as I could have.Overall:\\"What a Girl Wants\\" is a sassy and sometimes silly read. Grab a caf&eacute; latte and start up that bubble bath!Warning: there are some coarse words and sexual scenarios in this book.If you liked \\"What a Girl Wants\\" you might also enjoy \\"Coffee and Kung Fu\\", \\"Separation Anxiety\\", \\"Inappropriate Men\\", \\"Bet Me, \\"Blushing Pink\\", \\"The Way It Is\\", \\"Last Chance Saloon\\", \\"Sisterhood Situation\\", \\"Bridget Jones's Diary\\", or \\"Good in Bed\\"."},{"Title":"What A Girl Wants","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this read; plowed through it in two days like a box of chocolates.While there's just the right amount of over-the top silliness (the german beer maid chapter was a riot), I think Ms. Maverick has a real talent for getting to the heart of the most important ideas in the book. The author's voice throughout is engagingly funny in a smart, cynical way that keeps the book from ever getting girlie-sweet or slow.Her take on the dot-com world is right on (been there!). Harley's inner dialogue on her first date and the love the four women have for one another (in spite of vastly different approaches to life) were charming in their honesty. My husband read the chapter about the first date and was shocked, \\"Do women really worry like that on first dates?\\" I thought Ms. Maverick was right on--in fact I felt like I was reading about myself. I was just shocked that he was shocked! What does he think we think about?She doesn't shy away from real issues women need to balance: their own dreams and whether it is realistic to pursue them, the importance of supporting themselves, the desire to develop a career and be taken seriously, dealing with and making decisions about sexuality while maintaining their own strength as independent women who can take care of themselves in a (post?) feminist age, developing and maintaining strong friendships with other women...I look forward to Ms. Maverick's next book eagerly, and would highly recommend it; a great summer read.

So, needless to say, I was expecting a good read. Sadly, I was disappointed.The plot of this book was this - Hayley loses her job and wants a guy so her friends try to give her advice on how to get what she wants - but a thin plot is fine if it's written properly. THis book, however, was not. It was definitely predictable and not that entertaining, although I did find one or two parts funny. Her friends aren't that interesting and you kinda wonder why she's friends with them at all since they don't seem to have much in common. Moreover, the writing style is good but not great, and it seemed like a lot of the book as just comprised of \\"filler material,\\" even though the book is pretty short to begin with. The worst part of it was that the ending was beyond lame. You don't find out what's going to happen, and it's almost like the author just didn't know how else to end it and wanted to get it published asap. There are plenty of better books out there to read and I wish I hadn't bothered with this one.I would not recommend this book to anyone (although I'd love someone to buy my copy of me, haha) and instead would recommend that if you want a good chick lit book tor ead about a girl losing her job and looking for romance, instead buy \\"Pink Slip Party\\" by Cara Lockwood."},{"Title":"What A Girl Wants","review":"This book is just that - dreadful! The worst book I've read in years. I can find nothing complimentary to say about it. The characters are one dimensional and self-absorbed. The writing is sophomoric.

There are exercises and templates, as well.The book is a little out of date when it comes to markets, since it was published in 1995 and is now out of print with no prospect (at the moment) of a new edition. And the technology has left them behind, too, with nearly every professional constructor using software such as Crossword Compiler. But the rules of the crossword game haven't changed, or the strategies to use when your software has done all it can and you have to come up with that last corner.The Random House Puzzlemaker's Handbook also includes chapters on constructing diagramless puzzles and cryptic crosswords, as well as excellent instructions on making acrostic puzzles.If you can't see paying the going price for this out-of-print and hard-to-find book, maybe you can find it at the library, or even through inter-library loan. It's well worth the wait."},{"Title":"The Router Book: A Complete Guide to the Machine and its Accessories","review":"I bought this book and read it right after I got my first router and table for making picture frames. When I finished the book I found I didn't know much more about routers, bits and techniques than before I read it. And the author uses useless terminology where a clear description would be much more helpful. For example, writing about the router I bought he says, &quot;There is about 1 3/4 in. of motor travel once all four pins in the base casting engage both ground helixes in the motor pack.&quot; What? I had to look at my router to determine that he was talking about the distance the motor rotates in its base. The book is also very negative; you'll hear more about what routers and bits can't do rather than what they can and how to do it.I picked the book up again after I had been using my router for about 6 months, figuring now that I knew what I was doing I would get more out of it. I was wrong - there's just really not much useful information, unless you want to see the impressive jigs the author has made. All around, a pretty disappointing book."},{"Title":"The Router Book: A Complete Guide to the Machine and its Accessories","review":"I read the reviews here before I bought this book. Then, I bought it, anyway, and read it cover to cover. This is a highly informative book. No, it is not a book for the expert who owns several of these machines and uses them every day. For the beginner and intermediate level router user, however, it is the gospel. Actually, anyone who owns just one type of router and/or limited accessories will benefit from this book.If you are looking for a comprehensive book about technique for using a router and it's accessories, this is not the one you want. If, on the other hand, you want to know what type of router to use for a particular task, when to use a router table, when to use a particular accessory, how various accessories can make your routing safer and more accurate, then, this is the book you want. If you are trying to decide what type of router to buy, this guide is indespensable.I bought a Craftsman router (1 HP, 1/4&quot; collet) about twenty-five years ago. I have used it several times, but not extensively. Recently, I decided to put together a full shop in my garage. That meant a more powerful router with a 1/2&quot; collet. Mr. Warner's book was invaluable in determining the best machine to purchase for my anticipated uses. I now own a Porter-Cable 895 kit (the 890 series post-dates the book), an off-set base, a circle jig and several other accessories and bits.In summary, this is a book about routers and their accessories, when to use what and how to do it and still keep all of your fingers. There are many good books out there about using a router (and this author has written some of those, as well), but you have to know WHAT to use before the how is important. This is the book for that."},{"Title":"The Router Book: A Complete Guide to the Machine and its Accessories","review":"I highly recommend this book for any beginning woodworker who is thinking about buying, or has just bought, a router. I would also recommend it for those who want a different view on router tables and routers for those tables. I own Mr. Warner's three earlier router books, and his router CD. I find each to be useful in a different way. I'm glad I bought &quot;The Router Book&quot;; I've read it twice.Some other commercially successful authors of woodworking books write about a wide variety of subjects with little, if any, insight. In contrast, Mr. Warner writes insightful books on a subject that he obviously knows well: routers. &quot;The Router Book&quot; gives a marvelous comparison between fixed base, plunge, and trim routers; why the differences are significant; and where and how to use each. I have two fixed base routers; I've used them a fair amount; and I'm comfortable with them. But this book gave me a good summary of routers and helped me identify the features that I want in a plunge router - it made me change the router that I plan to buy. The book also identified router bits and accessories that I found of interest. And his example of how to make a &quot;comb&quot; style template (such as you see on jigs for dovetails and box-joints) was worth the price of the book all by itself. I now find myself making templates for pieces I only need one of: I can work faster without concern about the costly stock, and the template controls the cut to give me better quality. Faster and better is hard to beat.For those considering buying, building, or replacing a router table, Mr. Warner explains why he considers the usual solution of a plunge router on an insert plate an unacceptable compromise. His logic explains problems that I have had using router tables with inserts; and I could find no flaw in his explanations or suggestions. I've sold my fancy router table built on the &quot;American Woodworking&quot; design; I'm going to build a MARKEDLY simpler one based on his design - and I expect it to give more accurate results with fewer test cuts. (The book does not include a plan, but it shows and explains how it's built.)I don't know any woodworker who wouldn't benefit from one of his books. After reading this overview guide, you should consider his two books on router jigs and joinery.As much as I like this book, there are two things that I would change:The title is somewhat misleading in that no one can reasonably expect a 179 page book to be &quot;A Complete Guide&quot; to anything. I'd delete &quot;complete&quot; and leave the title &quot;The Router Book, A Guide to the Router and its Accessories.&quot;The second change would be the publisher - which surprised me because this is a Taunton product and I am glad to own a number of their other books. Mr. Warner's earlier books used a large type face that gave attractive, easy to read pages. This book leaves ridiculously large margins and uses a much smaller type face. Taunton was also careless in that it printed some of the images reversed left-to-right so that you see a mirror image. Not the quality control that I expect from Taunton.Neither flaw goes to the value of the book's contents: I STRONGLY recommend the book."},{"Title":"The Router Book: A Complete Guide to the Machine and its Accessories","review":"This is basically a good book with some strenghts, but also some significant weaknesses:Strengths- Good intro to equipment- Very good safety info- Very good descriptions of when routers, tables, etc. are not the right tool/approachWeaknesses- Virtually no description of technique- Virtually no useful into on jigs (essential to robust router use)Overall, this book is useful for someone who has never picked up a router. Nevertheless, both beginners and more experienced users will also need to buy another book for the substantial material this one lacks.The author clearly has real expertise on the topic and writes well, but this is just far too thin on content to be a one stop guide for even a novice."},{"Title":"The Router Book: A Complete Guide to the Machine and its Accessories","review":"I should have done more research before I bought this, but the book is exactly what it says it is; a book about routers.The 2 main points against it are- as someone else said, very little technique.

The router is a tool with a device that spins real fast and can remove wood. That's what I got from the book.Actually, in all fairness, the author did cover the differences between plunge routers and fix-based routers very well. The book also addresses the popular routers on the market though it seems likely that Porter-Cable may be subjectively promoted a bit much. Additionally, the photography was well done.As far as being a complete guide, it is not. I am particularly interested in learning the ends and outs of router usage and gained no insight here. Even when the book did resort to technique, the author used terminology not applicable to beginners and then did not bother to enlighten readers with an explanation nor with a glossary of definitions. In fact the book reminded me somewhat of old college texts where the author was more interested in impressing his own contemporaries than imparting knowledge on the unknowing."},{"Title":"The Router Book: A Complete Guide to the Machine and its Accessories","review":"It's possible that when I read the description of this book I got the wrong impression of what it was for. The book itself is relatively well written and great if you are unfamiliar with router terms and equipment but the book is pretty lacking when it comes to jigs, fixtures, and routing techniques. Do not buy this book if you are looking to improve your routing skill set, rather buy it if you are REALLY uninformed on what kinds of routers are out there and what each is used for."},{"Title":"The Router Book: A Complete Guide to the Machine and its Accessories","review":"The author obviously has lots of knowledge about routers, and doesn't mind telling you how much more he knows than you.

Before I read it I checked on the biography of the author, as I wanted to make sure he had the intellectual standing to write such a book before I invested my time in it. He does. You can check him on Wikipedia. He is contemporary (1881) with great events regarding the relationship between science and religion, yet everything he covers is applicable in today's world. He recognized the importance of the conflicts that were emerging and investigated the history of the relationship between science and religion, observed their present state, and makes what turns out to be very accurate predictions of exactly the situation we are in today. I am a student of history and I could find no fault with his presentation of historical facts, though he presents them in a context is unique to him at that time.With the publication of Stephen Hawkin's book, \\"The Grand Design\\" we are seeing a replay of the same conflict again between a static belief system and a system that is constantly expanding, making Draper's book all the more relevant in understanding just what is happening and why.As a plus, the author is an excellent writer of his time and I enjoyed his civility, and how he uses his words. A great relief from the \\"yell at you\\" style that seems popular now. If anyone is interested in a well thought out and intelligently presented explanation of why civilization finds itself in the conflicts we see everyday in the news, I recommend this work.BTW the University of Va. has a copy of this book in it's online library. I'd recommend reading the preface there to see if you'd like it.

Note quote marks are the authors work, breaks in between are my comments.\\"So great was the preference given to sacred over profane learning that Christianity had been in existence fifteen hundred years, and had not produced a single astronomer.\\" Oh, really? Pope Sylvester II (1000's), Johannes de Sacrobosco (1200's), Nicole Oresme (1300's), and Nicholas of Cusa (1400's) would disagree and they were just a few Catholic CLERIC Astronomers.\\"Copernicus, a Prussian,...\\" and Catholic Cannon (I wonder if the author knew and left this out or just never came across this bit of info) \\"Aware that his doctrines were totally opposed to revealed truth...\\" and could not be proved scientifically \\"refrained from publishing his book for 36 years...[until] the entreaty of Cardinal Schomberg.\\" Well, at least he admitted that we owe a Cardinal the publishing of this book. Although it was banned, as far as I can tell it wasn't until 100 years after his death with and that mostly due to Galileo's personality conflict with certain church authorities.\\"[Waxing poetic about Galileo noting a couple of astronomical phenomena] and many other beautiful telescopic discoveries tended to the establishment of the truth of the Copernican system.\\" While they were indeed evidence for it, it still was not scientifically provable. For Copernicus still used spherical orbits and his system was no better than the Ptolemaic one at predicting the motions, which is what a scientific theory is supposed to do.\\"By the low and ignorant ecclesiastics...\\" and noted scientists like Tycho Brahe \\"...they were denounced as deceptions or frauds.\\" Now for the Evil Church attacks poor noble Galileo (conveniently leaving out how he insulted the pope...of course being insulted does not justify the actions of any man, but this author is so driven by an agenda that he has made Galileo a saint.) \\"He was then committed to prison\\" otherwise known as house arrest in his villa.The author picks and chooses bits of facts, distorts and lies to create a blatant anti-Christian screed and anyone who thinks otherwise is smoking something. I studied Astrophysics and am a faithful Catholic. There have been many, MANY Catholic scientists who have made notable contributions to their fields of study. So, where can we find a good history of science and religion? I hear Stanley L. Jaki is a good author on the topic or you could just go check out the Vatican Observatory."},{"Title":"History of the Conflict Between Religion and Science","review":"Draper is a man who predicted advances in science when many of those things hadn't been considered by those more skilled and qualified than himself.It is quite amazing to read the predictions of a man made in 1874. His thoughts on what he considers the precipice of the information age. He couldn't possible have known what was in store for this world as it progressed through the late 19th and early 20th century. He certainly would not have understood that the later half of the 20th century would give rise to more knowledge, advent, discover and technology... to more science and understanding than the entire history of humanity thus far. Yet here in his own words he shows that with forethought one can have an idea about how things will pan out.Draper seen the conflict of Religion and Science as ultimately lost by religion if it simply did not adapt to the new knowledge being uncovered in his day and what was to follow. It was probably okay in the 16th, 17th or 18th century to have a 50 year debate on a single subject since science moved rather slowly. It was NOT okay to do that in 1874... and its suicide to think people will do so now with a world of data at their fingertips. In his mind Religion picked a fight they knew they could not win by insisting on absurdity when demonstration said otherwise and that continuing in this manner would simply spell the death of religion. The ultimate threat of 'forget your idea or we will kill you' is now simply gone. Which leaves demonstration in place of forced subservience.For its part in the 1800' those proselytizing science as an 'understanding' of the word tended to face off against religion giving it essentially a forum to make its point.Since this time scientists have learned not to bother questioning religious doctrine. To them the battle is won and most don't care what the worlds religions say. They now simply get on with the job and the voices of those in the religions camp may do as they wish. This is one of the reasons Japanese, Chinese, European and Indian scientists agree the situation in the USA is terrible... but really couldn't be bothered to do anything about it. They know that either the science will demonstrate itself, or it will be forcibly curtailed... either way those are political things that might happen and will not impact on the philosophy of science or its knowledge base. Once discovered and used you simply can't put the science genie back into the box.This book was added to a list of 'banned books' by the catholic hierarchy. Its still on that list even though the catholic church now accept every word of it. But in the In the 1870's that was more or less a sales aid and only served to increase sales of the book. Moreover I find it interesting that to ban such a book someone inside the church had to read it. Surely if its okay for them and only served to have them ban it, then its okay for their congregations?Drapers work in this book was mostly a discussion of the works of others.I find it amazing that although this book is over 140 years old, and even though the things we can easily demonstrate to ourselves on a kitchen table in 2012 are known by many... that some people still see the world in the light of nonsense that those lesser educated did in the centuries before even this book was written.Moreover almost every point raised by those who argue for creation mythology is mentioned and quashed in this book from 1874! These things were known then...we've passed an entire century and there are still people who think the world is 6k years old...Home schooling is not an excuse either... Draper himself was home schooled by his father, a creationist clergyman.I would recommend this easy to read tome to anyone with an interest in the social and scientific evolution of the United States."},{"Title":"History of the Conflict Between Religion and Science","review":"John William Draper (1811-1882) was an (English-born) American scientist, philosopher, historian, and photographer. He wrote in the Preface to this 1874 book, \\"The antagonism we thus witness between Religion and Science is the continuation of a struggle that commenced when Christianity began to attain political power. A divine revelation must necessarily be intolerant of contradiction... The history of Science ... is a narrative of the conflict of two contending powers, the expansive force of the human intellect on one side, and the compression arising from traditionary faith and human interests on the other. No one has hitherto treated the subject from this point of view. Yet... it presents itself... as the most important of all living issues... What I have sought to do is, to present a clear and impartial statement of the views and acts of the two contending parties...\\" (Pg. vi-vii, ix)He notes that \\"I have had little to say respecting ... the Protestant and Greek Churches... In speaking of Christianity, reference is generally made to the Roman Church, partly because its adherents compose the majority of Christendom, partly because its demands are the most pretentious, and partly because it has commonly sought to enforce those demands by the civil power.\\" (Pg. x-xi) He explains his own perspective: \\"It is enough for us ourselves to know that, though there is a Supreme Power, there is no Supreme Being. There is an invisible principle, but not a personal God... All revelation is, necessarily, a mere fiction... There is no such thing as Providence... The vital force which pervades the world is what the illiterate call God.\\" (Pg. 24-25)Of Galileo, he recounts, \\"Knowing well that Truth has no need of martyrs, he assented to the required recantation, and gave the promise demanded... What a spectacle! This venerable man, the most illustrious of his age, forced by the threat of death to deny facts which his judges as well as himself knew to be true! He was then ... treated with remorseless severity during the remaining ten years of his life, and was denied burial in consecrated ground.\\" (Pg. 171-172)Of Giorano Bruno's burning, he asserts, \\"No one can recall without sentiments of pity the sufferings of those countless [Christian] martyrs, who... have been brought for their religious opinions to the stake. But each of these had... [his belief in] eternal happiness... For Bruno there was no such support. The philosophical opinions, for the sake of which he surrendered his life, could give him no consolation... But perhaps the day approaches when posterity will ... [unveil] a statue of Bruno under the dome of St. Peter's at Rome.\\" (Pg. 180-181)He summarizes, \\"Whoever will in a spirit of impartiality examine what had been done by Catholicism for the intellectual and material advancement of Europe... and what has been done by science in its brief period of action, can, I am persuaded, come to no other conclusion than this, that, in instituting a comparison, he has established a contrast.\\" (Pg. 321) He adds, \\"Roman Christianity and Science are recognized by their respective adherents as being absolutely incompatible; they cannot exist together; one must yield to the other; mankind must make its choice---it cannot have both.\\" (Pg. 363)This book, along withA History of the Warfare of Science With Theology in Christendom (2 Volume Set), is one of the \\"classic\\" texts on the conflicts between religion and science."},{"Title":"History of the Conflict Between Religion and Science","review":"I recently took a history of science course (the Learning Company) by Lawrence Principie, who holds dual appointments at Johns Hopkins (Organic chemistry and The History of Science).

NO WAY like those stupid, vile churches, but this book explains greatly about the comparison between science and religion."},{"Title":"History of the Conflict Between Religion and Science","review":"The \\"History of the Conflict Between Religion and Science\\" may be of significant history for a reader who is interested in 19th Century views on religion and science (and as such it certainly has great merit), but for a reader seeking genuine insight on the books topic it largely useless.The author, keeping with his time, follows an evolutionary vision of human thought, instantly discarding any thought of the \\"primitives\\" and seeing true value only in his \\"enlightened\\" mind-set. Perhaps even worse, there is more than a bit of religious propaganda that sneaks its way into the text, without the author ever denoting it as such. For example, the ancient Christian polemic of Bahira, the heretical monk, is repeated as historical fact with no indication that it is at best pure legend."},{"Title":"History of the Conflict Between Religion and Science","review":"Now, after seeing one review on here, I have to make my thoughts known. This is an absolutely amazing book. How anyone doesn't think that it clarifies exactly what the title dictates, is beyond me. There is a disturbing story that brought tears to my eyes: monks took an educated woman, the bishop was jealous of, stripped her naked - dragged her into the church, where Peter the reader bludgeoned her to death - then scraped the flesh from her bones and burned it all in the fire. I totally see how the conflict between science and religion started, escalated and continues on. It is a great book and extremely well written."},{"Title":"History of the Conflict Between Religion and Science","review":"There are two problems with this book: First, its title and introduction lead one to believe that it will be an objective depiction of the anatomy of a conflict. Instead, it is a polemic against Christianity (mostly Roman Catholicism) and an endorsement of Science. Second, although its conspicuous copyrite year is 2010, the book was actually written in the late 19th century.The book presents very detailed historical material of the evolution of science and Christianity from the time of their origins up to the late 1800s, and concludes that Christianity, during most that time, severely hampered the vigor and freedom of scientific inquiry. The essence of the author's thesis is that in trying to explain everything about everything Christianity had, in large part, stepped on ground that would have been better served by observation and experimentation. In its determnation to maintain the upper hand, and in vacating the ideational ground upon which Christ stood, Christianity ultimately killed people, stifled free thinking and stymied the progress of civilization for at least a millenium before the Protestant Reformation. At least the author implies as much.This seems axiomatic from the standpoint of the 21st century and it might be true that Christianity lost its way within a short period after Christ's death. But, in the author's 19th century zeal to extol the virtues of science he omits an examination of what Christianity did accomplish on ground that it rightly stood. For instance, \\"Seminal Christianity\\" is not designed to be scientific but rather to be interpretive; it's not to explain what the universe is but why it is there; it doesn't speak to the human mind but to the human heart. To paint Chrisitrianity, in general, negatively in contrast to the neoreligion of science might have worked in a culture bathing in the first glow of Darwinism. However, those brush strokes don't impress the modern mind that knows religion and science try to do different things, knows that any religion is not monolithic, notwithstanding the indiscriminate carpet-bombings of Christopher Hitchens, Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, et al. As one tradition steps on the ground of the other, it is wrong.Draper was drunk with the miracles of late 19th century science and was understandably myopic.

Chapters examine media representations of options, people's lives, events, and social issues with an eye to considering how media changes self-consciousness itself, inviting viewers to transform their lives into performance pieces. An intriguing survey adds much new material to the already extensive publications on media and society."},{"Title":"Mediated: How the Media Shapes Your World and the Way You Live in It","review":"As the author of a book on teens and adolescent development, I'd recommend THIS book as the best current book on adolescent development that's been written. The problematic and accurate nature of that statement is that Prof. De Zengotita hasn't written a book on adolescent development--it's a book on media studies and culture. And there's the rub. If, in 2012, you want to know anything accurate, useful and prescient about how American adolescents develop their identities, you must understand the bi-direcitonal effects of media. This is one book every involved, caring parent will want to read. I'm quite sure he'd reject the hyperbole, but I feel strongly about parents reading the title."},{"Title":"Mediated: How the Media Shapes Your World and the Way You Live in It","review":"I found Thomas De Zengotita's thesis on our modern state of near complete domestication (\\"mediation\\") to be brilliant, exciting and liberating. I also found his writing, while refreshingly intelligent and creative, a bit glib and cynical by the end, and his realistic conclusions more than a bit sobering. Yet, given the coherence of his insight and argument I was mostly glad to accommodate his breezy and sometimes rambling (as well as occasionally scathing, acerbically critical) style. It is ultimately an honest and personal analysis, combining both his smart Ego, and his smart-aleck Shadow, and makes for a quick, fun and entertaining read (appropriately enough for this mediated boomer).So what does it mean to be \\"mediated\\"? It refers to the whole process of seeing ourselves through the lens of an auto-reflective, hyper-rational and self-conscious (thus superficial) world. The result is a world increasingly presented (and perceived) as if we (as individuals) are both the focus of it, and the author, and the one capable of controlling it. This kind of hubris is nothing new, but the technology that gives us both the illusion of complete control and knowledge is.What I liked most is how he brings his anthropological lens to bear on the current human condition, and so gives a deep psycho-analysis to the culture and some of it's main players. And this is a rather chilling analysis... And probably a rather challenging one for most readers educated/conditioned in the modern PC age (\\"politically correct\\" primarily, and \\"personal computer\\" incidentally). As he writes;\\"But - the dialectic of mediation again - in reaching for the real in that way, they succeed only in extending the reach of the virtual.\\" (pg 94)\\"The inherent aim of the ethos of mediation is to turn everything into an option, even when it can't literally succeed.\\" (pg 128)(This then explains the wide-spread popularity of the illusive ideal of \\"social justice\\". We have become conditioned to expect \\"anything is possible\\", even when we know it isn't.)\\"You become an elaborate apparatus of evolving shtick that you deploy improvisationally as circumstances warrant. Because it is all so habitual, and because you are so busy, you can almost forget the underlying reflexivity.\\" (pg 187)\\"But it is obvious to other people. I mean, you see it in others, don't you? Why should you be different?\\" (pg 188)\\"This is a serious diagnosis of a serious condition. Would we rather not know about it because it's incurable?\\" (pg 193)\\"But what that says is that representational technologies have colonized our minds. That may be the simplest deepest way to characterize the whole history of representation to the extent that our thoughts no longer wander on their own, stocked only with materials drawn from direct experience, to the extent that they follow flows of representation instead - to just that extent we don't think our own thoughts. Literally.\\" (pg 196)Profound stuff. Welcome to the Matrix.(Personally, I feel all is not lost, this may be an accurate description of life in the false (image projected, filtered and layered) world we call reality, but there are ways available to us as individuals to wake up and see/experience it all differently. Perhaps the extinction of external mystery - through the discovery/mastery of everything material through science - will push us to look more seriously at the internal/spiritual world. And this will be a good, and truly limitless venture - for, after all, the unconscious is inexhaustible.)PS, as good as this book is at exposing the issue of our mediated/virtualized world, if you are interested in knowing the underlying reason for such a development read Iain McGilchrist' s remarkable study of the brainThe Master and His Emissary: The Divided Brain and the Making of the Western World, which clearly shows how this is the result of the rise to power of the left-hemisphere of our brains."},{"Title":"Mediated: How the Media Shapes Your World and the Way You Live in It","review":"This book is about the effect technology, and especially communication technology, has had on our lives. At times I found myself applauding his perfect descriptions. But then I found myself thinking, \`wait - that can't be true. It's terrifying.' It's like reading Machiavelli. Part of me doesn't want to believe the author is right. A mirror-image of our foolishness, unfiltered by media's magic and charm, is not the most pleasant experience.The author writes:\\"But \\"The Simpsons\\" is comedy. Its success derives from an underlying sense that people have about our world these days - namely that it's going off the rails. But that's underlying. In the trenches of daily living we don't typically give in to nihilist apprehensions. On the contrary, we stuff our lives with schemes and projects.\\" (p63)* * *At one point the author says he wishes he could be a little more positive. So do I. I wish he could be more positive.

Unlike French theoretical discourse Zengotita's prose language is clear and illustrative, it is not an academic essay, and although the message 'we are reproductions of ourselves mediated through the image thus nothing is real and all is simulacrum' is not new it is high time that this theory was publicly restated.Zengotita does this in an entertaining and accessible way."},{"Title":"Mediated: How the Media Shapes Your World and the Way You Live in It","review":"This is the most insightful, intelligent, and entertaining analysis of the social and cultural history of our times that I have ever read.

Unfortunately, after a few dozen pages, it seemed like the book was a good EXAMPLE of that thesis, and not an elucidation of it. It reminded me of James Joyce, and while Joyce's style can be wonderful for a novel, it kind of stinks for an expository work.

Although de Zengotita brings up some interesting and important points, he has an incredibly convoluted (and, frankly, smug) writing style which unfortunately seems to be passing for intellectual rigor in the academy these days. A bigger problem is that he hasn't made the effort to organize these insights into any coherent theory or even anything coherent, period. The result is that we are left snippets of insight coupled with the vague notion that he's onto something really important, and frustrated with his refusal to exercise any intellectual or editorial discipline so that we can be more clear about what exactly that is."},{"Title":"Mediated: How the Media Shapes Your World and the Way You Live in It","review":"This book goes beyond a sociological/anthropological analysis and offers up a cultural psychoanalysis of the multiheaded beast that is today's modern media.

I'm keenly interested in the affect media has on individuals and society and have read quite a lot in this area. Zengotita's breezy, intelligent and humorous style merely frustrated me. He presents mostly opinion, an extended essay. It is fascinating opinion, but not the sort of helpful fact-based analysis or data-driven synthesis I was hoping for. Perhaps if this is your first introduction to the field, the book would be enjoyable (though Neil Postman's \\"Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business\\" is for my money a great essay-like introduction to this field."},{"Title":"Mediated: How the Media Shapes Your World and the Way You Live in It","review":"The front cover of the paperback version has a quote from Norman Mailer: \\"'Mediated' has the same liveliness and intense intellectualizing as Marshall McLuhan's 'Understanding Media.'\\" After reading this book, I have come to the conclusion that Mailer didn't think much of either.This book is a collection of loose associations underlaid with hostility towards some of the more pampered and clueless members of our society (his students, perhaps). The style has zing, but that is not a valid substitution for reasoned argument.Worst of all, the book posits that the public is spoiled and in charge. This flies in the face of the notions of manufactured consent, of debate and consumption within a narrowly prescribed range of acceptable alternatives, of the subtle and not so subtle inculcation of fear of speaking out that has been noted by authors like Noam Chomsky and Al Gore.The \\"whatever\\" response the author notes may well be an expression of the futility of expecting anyting better, not an expression of bored power. The public may not be so much \\"mediated\\" as confused and shaped by an ambiguous and dishonest array of information. The \\"method acting\\" may well be intimidated and overly cautious speech--in that sense, it is, indeed, self-conscious.This book does note some cultural markers, but ties them together poorly. With the exception of the chapter on the acting styles of Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush, where it does come to life impressively, it is a terrible book."},{"Title":"Mediated: How the Media Shapes Your World and the Way You Live in It","review":"I've read and re-read this book a number of times. I never knew that someone else could even have as much insight into the patterns of my thoughts as De Zengotita does. It's a brilliant book -- and while its is very well argued and thought out, I couldn't shake the eiree feeling that I vaguely knew it all before... This however only strenghtens the book, for it demonstrates what a rich and deeply accurate account 'Mediated' is -- De Zengotita gives you enough perspective on the phenomenological processes of mediation to give you a tour of your own mind. Whether you like to craft playlists on iTunes; take eco-tourism vacations for their authenticity; are a dog-person; or have ever told anyone the story of where you were on september 11th, this book has something to say to you and your most personal thoughts."},{"Title":"Mediated: How the Media Shapes Your World and the Way You Live in It","review":"I would like to give this review 3.5 stars, so I rounded up to 4.The book appears to be mostly informed opinions from Zengotita. It doesn't have as many facts and studies as I'd like, but his opinions are not wacky or anything. I certainly agree with most things he says. I agree that technical advances occur there is just simply more media for one to take in, therefore taking longer to reach a \\"culturally accepted\\" point of media intelligence.Zengotita's views in the book are, simply put, his views. Again, not much fact (although there is some), but it's easy to agree, and his observations are right on. I would also say one of the major points of the book is to show the reader HOW the media is affecting society, to make you aware. There is something to learn from this book, however, it's definitely geared more to those who are VERY interested in media and culture, not those who are just looking around."},{"Title":"Mediated: How the Media Shapes Your World and the Way You Live in It","review":"\\"Mediated\\" is the best book on the media I have ever read.

We are, Zengotita argues, so self-absorbed, so obsessed with our own flattery, so hell-bent on the creation of our own perverse sense of celebrity that we have lost the true measure of greatness. For example, he argues that we can no longer aspire to great heroism because truly heroic figures are no longer relevant in our media world. Heroism, which requires devotion, sacrifice, imagination, and mythos, has been replaced with counterfeit celebrity that makes \\"heroism\\" appealing only when it's a consumer product. Literalism, self-aggrandizement, being pandered to by an onslaught of advertisers in every media form, and the resulting delusion that we are always the center of the universe makes us into pseudo celebrities so that we have no room in our consciousness for the real heroes of the world. He makes a great case for the fact that we have become, thanks to the media, more like full-time actors than real humans. All of us, he says, have learned from television \\"method acting,\\" so that a media person could stick a microphone in front of any Average Joe and that Average Joe would be able to give a polished interview. We're all competing to be the star in a world of wannabe celebrities.He does a good job of showing how television gives us a God's-eye view of everything so that we have a delusion of omniscience and this false power fuels our delusions of grandeur. Additionally, this God's-eye view spoils us so that we can't live in stillness and see life in the here and now but only media's cheap, hyped representations of life.This unhealthy quest for god-hood, he shows, has taken shape in the popularity of Reality TV shows, which feed our sense of entitlement, self-pity, and our narcissistic wish to be recognized over others.By showing how our inability to embrace true heroes connects to our obsession with making ourselves into pseudo heroes, Zengotita has found an original, sometimes funny, and always profound way to make us look at the way the media is shaping our psyches and our souls."},{"Title":"Mediated: How the Media Shapes Your World and the Way You Live in It","review":"In recent years, Tom de Zengotita has emerged has one of the most ambitious of the Harper's Magazine essayists. Fans of those essays won't be disappointed here. Mediated combines the themes of his Harper's work into a seamless whole. The result is an engaging, funny, and deeply serious meditation on the role of mediation in our frantic postmodern lives.De Zengotita is an anthropologist by training, but a cultural critic/philosopher by trade-and a damn good one who covers his ground with authority. As a teacher at the Dalton School, he enjoys deep exposure to the trends of teenagers, and as a professor at NYU's Graduate School of Arts & Science, he has his finger on the more absurd developments in the highbrow stuff, too. Both modes of being are beautifully fused in this book, enabling him to tackle his subject from both directions.The gist of his argument is this: The ultimate (and often intentionally secret) goal of modernity is to get God out of the equation so man can finally become the author of his own being. The terror of arbitrariness-the accident of your race and gender-and the universal pain of anonymity, are cured, superficially, by the freedom to make choices. Mediation steps in to give you \\"options\\"-to give you the freedom to choose this or that and pave the way to selfhood. Everything, including the ground and the sky, can be thought of, presented, packaged, and (sometimes) sold in ways that are flattering to You and only You. Forget heroes and idols. You are the center of it all. And celebrities? They need You to buy into their brand, too.(Two examples Me-centeredness I've noticed since reading the book: The \\"Welcome- Your Name Here\\" bit on the opening page of this very site, and Citibank's ATMs way of addressing you like an old friend: \\"Hold on, I'm working on it\\" as if a computer that can't speak can somehow have a casual, friendly tone.)In Mediated, you'll learn why storms now have names. You'll learn why people describe 9/11 as a \\"surreal\\" event. You'll learn why George Bush assumes the postures of Texas manliness. You'll learn why it has become normal to implant fish genes in strawberries. And, of course, you'll learn why we feel compelled to put words in \\"quotes.\\"All of this is placed in its historical context without being dry and academic. In the same, casual tone, de Zengotita explains the philosophical underpinnings of the Simpsons and Harry Potter, and how Nietzsche, Descartes, and Locke, relate to the prospect of human cloning. In the process, we learn what we have gained from mediation and what we have lost. And we've gained and lost a lot.The book is deeply funny, and delivered with a modesty rare in such lofty pursuits. A must read for anyone who wants to talk with depth and seriousness about the cultural issues that define our era."},{"Title":"Mediated: How the Media Shapes Your World and the Way You Live in It","review":"Tired of your newsweekly's glitzy \\"media\\" column?

Combining erudite philosophical insight, humanistic anthropological concerns, and highly readable language, he takes the hyper-self-conscious world of reality shows and 24 hour news in which we live, and questions the effects it is having on the way we think about ourselves, and the way we see what's around us. The examples he uses are absorbing, hilarious, and scarily dead on. This is the kind of book that changes you, and sends you back to the world with new weapons of perception..."},{"Title":"Mediated: How the Media Shapes Your World and the Way You Live in It","review":"Contrary to the last reviewer's posting, this book was not difficult to follow. In fact, De Zengotita's voice is so fresh and clear compared to most academics who have tackled similar topics. And if one thinks his thoughts are \\"fragmented\\" - this has more to do with the nature of the topic than anything else. And as for extracting a single sentence quote to make a categorical claim about the overall value or style of a book - well that's just careless use of rhetoric to make a point that most likely doesn't hold.This book is very well written; it expresses in depth thoughts clearly and with simple yet effective language. However, it is no wonder that there would be resistance from readers - after all, the Modernists convinced us that analytical rigor and stylistic performance were in some sense separable. The old-schoolers claimed that when analyzing world and culture that one must do so with detachment and \\"objectivity.\\" This book shows that such divisions between \\"analysis\\" and \\"performance\\" (and that such concepts as \\"objectivity\\") no longer hold (or mean the same thing) in a mediated culture. If readers are demanding that De Zengotita's writing be more detached, more logical and analytical and less performance-oriented and less concerned with involved personal experience then they missed the point.The other thing I want to say about this book is that - yes, it is about the media and its effects - but it is also about something more fundamental. This book is the most clear expression (or demonstration) of what it means to say we live in \\"the postmodern era.\\" There has been a lot of books written on what \\"postmodernism\\" means, and most of them are lofty academic expositions that speak to only a select few. This book speaks to everyone and says some very thoughtful things about what it means to live in a late-capitalist, media-driven postmodern society. If you're interested in that kind of thing, this is a 5 star account that won't disappoint."},{"Title":"Mediated: How the Media Shapes Your World and the Way You Live in It","review":"Yes, this book is that good.-----The entertainment/industrial complex owns our sense of community and comparison. I can only guess how people used to establish a sense of community in the 1800's (walk a quarter mile to borrow a cup of sugar?) but commercials and news and Nielsen ratings own what we each think everybody else is doing/watching/considering at any given moment.-----The reason a tv blaring in the background helps you not feel lonely is not just because of the voices and music snipets. It gives you a distinct sense that this is what everyone (the tribe) is doing right now. That's why finding your favorite song on the radio is so much more fun than just popping in the CD... because you know it is being shared.-----I can see where the other reviewers are coming from as far as his zig-zag method of discussing topics. I had to almost chuckle at one part where he compares so many things (I think it was Harry Potter to \\"Where the Wild Things Are\\" among other things) and filled it with so many amendments (this is just like this except this is this, and substitute a sense of this for a sense of this), that in no time there is little difference between \\"Apocalypse Now\\" and a bottle of windex in my garage. 4 out of 5 stars, man I'm mean.-----That being said, I think the style is supposed to ride the same frenetic energy as all the media outlets out there now (TV, movies, internet, games etc). Also, I understand he was/is a columnist and as such the book has a less formal, less term paper feel and a much more conversational feel. I personally like it. Its like sipping a little too much coffee with a friend and consequently the spirited conversation gets just a little wacko.-----I almost forgot. A if not THE major thrust of the book is not just what hold the media has over you, but the rather new, strange sense of entitlement people have regarding current events as they happen. It's as if a generation or 2 have been raised that have gotten over the \\"wow\\" factor of television. No longer impressed by anything moving on the screen, most of us have a sense now that commercials as well as their shows are trying for, aspiring toward our approval and/or money. As such we are each passive (observers) and active (passing judgement). (Even these very reviews are a way of joe-average getting to comment and pass judgement on a high quality, compelling book that somebody else had to bust their hump to produce.)-----Maybe back in black-and-white-tv days there was an idea that the content of television would demonstrate our nobility as a country, as a society or for our era as proud, serious men in ties tried to speak as if they were etching stone tablets in the annals of time. But, in this present postmodern era this new generation I'm describing already know that television (a.k.a. the tribal watering-hole) isn't really about anything more than wanting to be accepted by the viewers so that \\"Will and Grace\\" can have a 7th season and Michelin can sell tires.-----We no longer get a sense of community from the news (etching the annals of time) because as viewers, we detect the news-show itself more than its content. The news reports on reality and none of us are reporters. Plus bad news stories piled on bad news stories that are much worse than anything that has ever happened to you leaves you no hook on which to hang your identification.-----We do get a sense of community from sitcoms because they are about \\"real\\" things like dating, going to the health club, getting or losing a job, getting coffee with friends and zinging your buddy with a one-liner etc. Plus they are funny and people like to be funny when retelling their favorite parts of the sitcom to others. THAT gives a sense of community.And then at the end of the day the news finds what is worth reporting about people who went about their daily \\"real\\" lives anyway, doesn't it? Whether politicians, soldiers or people in terrible accidents... they were all on their way home to have a beer with friends or go home to their families, right?-----Its a weird self-referring loop that: \\"Around and around it goes, where it stops? ...\\"It doesn't stop. No one even understands what \\"it\\" is. And it changes every few years.This is all just the tip of the iceberg.Big fun topic.Little fun book.Go.Read."},{"Title":"Mediated: How the Media Shapes Your World and the Way You Live in It","review":"Having just finished reading this book, I am about to do something I have never done with any other - immediately start reading it again. After what is at heart a pessimistic and rather fatalistic vision of our present and future, I feel strangely uplifted and inspired. Maybe, as other reviewers have mentioned, it is the feeling that a crucial truth is being unmasked about the direction man, and the West in particular, is heading. He makes a persuasive case for why people want what they want and why cultural and media organisations respond to us in the way they do. Perhaps it is the rare exhilaration of reading something that feels like agenda-free speech, someone seeking only to find a pattern in it all. Or maybe it is the excitement of receiving an authoritative perspective it is hard to challenge. The writer uses history and philosophy to support highly sensitive powers of observation about the present. He clearly enjoys people's strengths and their foibles but fears for us. He would be the first to admit he is not a god, but it feels very important to listen to what he's saying."},{"Title":"Mediated: How the Media Shapes Your World and the Way You Live in It","review":"With a degree in anthropology, Dr. De Zengotita sees into our world with an incitefulness that most of us lack. He looks at our present lives and sees things that most of us miss. And in this book he is looking at the impact of the media (mostly television) on our society and that of the world. And to a surprising extent, the impact of the media controlls the world.The media controls what we see. For instance the United States media talks about each American soldier killed in Iraq. Yes, that's a tragedy. But what about the 125 people a day dying in automobile accidents in the US alone. What about the almost 3,000 people a day who die from AIDS. They aren't news.I live in a small town; far, far away from the centers of power, of media. I'd kind of like to know what's going on in the world, not have some puffy haired guy talk to me endlessly about a rock star on trial, or a right to die case. But of these things we have no power. We listen to what the media wants to tell us.A great book that talks about the changes that TY and the Net have brought to us."},{"Title":"Mediated: How the Media Shapes Your World and the Way You Live in It","review":"De Zengotita's central tenet in \\"Mediated\\" is that images and forms the media produce serve primarily to cater to our self-centered nature, here called the \\"flattered self.\\" These feed the meaningless, amorphous \\"blob\\" of postmodern consumer culture, which serves no purpose in society. As the media becomes more fractured and prevalent, messages and truths become essentially meaningless. One problem with his \\"blob\\" concept stems from its primary characteristic: amorphousness. It flexes to encompass all of De Zengotita's ideas. Ironically, in doing so, the concept of the blob diminishes the bite of his arguments, allowing him leeway to wiggle out of more detailed descriptions of his theories.He posits that the new power afforded to individuals alters various aspects of our lives, including puberty, politics, and entertainment. People no longer are able to \\"fill in the blanks\\" in the lives of their heroes, so heroes naturally become more local and less monolithic. Individuals are afforded god-like modes of power, making the \\"extraordinary\\" commonplace. The increased rate and type of interactions become overwhelming to individuals, who find themselves unable to process or deal with them. In reality, I would say this is a straw man argument; people rarely feel overwhelmed by information. What is not useful or required passed quickly through, not remembered and not harmful.Like many scholars of a certain age, De Zengotita's is pessimistic about the possibilities of media. One of his many suggestions is that a music concerts now \\"provide fans with the only experiences of transcendent social belonging most of them will ever know\\" (given that they are not religious and not \\"joiners\\"). It's a provocative statement - but would he recognize such an event if it he found it? I believe he would be less likely to recognize such an event than other scholars who gives new forms of mass self-expression more credence. On other fronts, he is more convincing - take for instance his examples of interactions between \\"real\\" versus artificial through the complex interactions between audience and players in reality television, or the public revelation and cleansing of talk shows.The \\"flattered self\\" and \\"meworld\\" cannot fully explain the multitude of interactions and motives encountered in modern life. It's a difficulty we encounter since the rise of mass media, where the media are inexorable from its audience and participants. On the dust jacket, Norman Mailer praises the book, saying \\"there are anywhere from three to ten stimulating ideas on each page.\\" Indeed, De Zengotita's ideas are poignant, and excuse his occasional overreaching or unconvincing example. (still, using one's own children is an example of the latter... \\"weak tea\\" as a professor of mine frequently said)The idea of the \\"flattered self\\" is an entirely appropriate metaphor for the current age. This basic concept is primarily what makes this book a provocative read. At one point, this was its title. If this remained as the title, the focus refined, and its arguments condensed, \\"Mediated\\" would be a true classic. Unfortunately, it's not quite at the level of Neil Postman, although one can detect a few strokes of his felt-tipped pen in De Zengotita's carefully considered arguments."},{"Title":"Mediated: How the Media Shapes Your World and the Way You Live in It","review":"I live in Rwanda (East Africa) where life is not yet saturated with media, and that helped me to put this book into sharp perspective. In other words, I'm not sure I would have known how mediated I am without the context of a (yet) unmediated society to prove it to me. (And ironically, here I am putting this review out on a worldwide media!)It's funny, engaging and witty and then disturbing and provocative because it's getting at the heart of who we are. I'd go as far as suggesting that it can change your worldview or your behavior. The next time you take out your cell phone or camera to snap a picture and say \\"Got it\\", think about what you've got. A memory? An experience? An essence? An understanding? Or maybe just a substitute for those things. And that's just the beginning of his search for how we separate our Selves from our mediated lives.My biggest concern is that our society may be so mediated that it will have a hard time believing de Zengotita's concerns are truly significant. Don't let this book get lost in the ocean of media around you -- it might help you get back to dry land."},{"Title":"Mediated: How the Media Shapes Your World and the Way You Live in It","review":"Line after line, page after page, this book has an effect on you that is otherwise unique to truly great song lyrics. It is the feeling that a writer has discovered something in you which you never really bothered or dared to dig up, and distilled it with such frightening and beuatiful accuracy that you feel suddenly like you have been waiting your whole life to hear those words.

There is some wisdom here and there, but not worth the headache you'll get trying to decipher what is going on in his head. Here is an example:\\"If you say your own name to yourself at such a moment, it will seem utterly alien. You will then understand the sacrament of baptism.\\" Huh?At first, I thought his writing may just be over my head, but after re-reading most of it, I realized it was just bad. It's like the whole book was written when he was high or something.

I had to read it for a book report."},{"Title":"Mediated: How the Media Shapes Your World and the Way You Live in It","review":"Mediation means dealing with reality through something else. In this book, mediation refers to arts and artifacts that represent and communicate; also to the effects on the way we experience historical happenings in the world and our place in it. Nowadays the media has reached a new, higher plane of being \\"engendered by mediating representations of fabulous quality and inescapable ubiquity.\\" I love those words!Cell phones, answering machines, digital telemarketing messages, Xerox machince Web sites, and BlackBerries are a part of media today. These are ways of communication. Consider the Inspector Clouseau redux. It's all a farce as far as the news and tabloid papers present the details of any event.This is censorship in the worst way. I will just go back to the library and take the book out again and redo the review only make it more detailed and much longer and see if they take it off, too. The media today is warped. Something is going to have to be done as it is full of things the terrorists need to know to dishevel this country and the media is helping in any way it can.He calls astronomers 'dorks' and perhaps he is right. I have a son who is one and pretends he does not enjoy the trips to Pasadena with the tours he gives for students. He's a liar. The Justin Helmet Principle takes care of the first question that this isn't about media per se but about being a mediated person in a world made up of represented opinions.This book is aimed to \\"zap the zeitgeist\\" (whatever that is); they can't represent the reality as it is beyond mediation. That is part of the unrepresentable mood that eludes mediation at the dawn of the age of terror. Thomas de Zengotita has a PhD (as does my son, the derk astronomer) from Columbia University and teaches at Dalton School in New York. Norman Mailer offered his salute to this author on the success of such a marvelous treatise on his emotions, remembrances, and what he thinks others should do.

However, Lubet provides plenty of examples to make sure his points are understandable.The third edition improves upon earlier editions by including a new section on electronic visuals and new sections covering evidentiary problems raised by the internet. Moreover, Professor Lubet's experience in teaching at Northwestern University and his authorship of over thirty books provide him the tools necessary to very effectively teach the law student and lawyer the theory of trial advocacy in this highly readable book."},{"Title":"Modern Trial Advocacy: Analysis and Practice","review":"I had to get this for a class.

You aren't going to learn anything definitive from these chapters and all the practicing lawyers I run into think the authors ideas are just plain silly.

All NITA's renowned full trial programs use the text, as do prominent law schools nationwide. Steven Lubet guides the beginning advocate from developing a winning case theory through all phases of trial. He explains how to present a case as a story, and how to tell the story to the jury powerfully and persuasively.Since its initial publication, Lubet significantly enhanced the book in 1997 and now he revises it again to include a new chapter on the most recent revolution in trial advocacy: technology in the courtroom.\\"Electronic Visuals,\\" the new chapter by Edward R. Stein, provides a useful and insightful introduction to technology in the courtroom, ranging from evidentiary issues to practical advice. The new edition also includes updates to Federal Rules 702 and 703.Modern Trial Advocacy contains separate sections on case theory, witness examination, making the record, and talking to the jury; a comprehensive discussion of case theory explaining how to test and develop alternate trial strategies; a portion of each chapter addressing ethics concerns as they arise in practice; and a unique chapter on persuasion theory describing how the principles of cognitive theory can be used to capture the jury's imagination.Modern Trial Advocacy presents a realistic and contemporary approach to learning and developing trial advocacy skills. Lubet writes in a clear, concise style that is attractive to both the beginning advocate and the experienced trial lawyer. And, most importantly, this book offers a sophisticated theory-driven approach to advocacy training that distinguishes it from other books in the field.Summary of ContentsEach chapter includes a thorough discussion on preparation, analysis, techniques, and ethics.

It's interesting that one of the areas where the cutting is most obvious is in the area where the &quot;editor&quot; disagrees with Hodge the most, that is the locus of &quot;eschatology&quot;. The editor is a Premillennialist and Hodge, like all Princetonians was a clear Postmillennialist. If you want to read Hodge without the excess verbiage, buy A.A Hodge's &quot;Outlines of Theology&quot;, which is based on the very same lectures that Charles Hodge published as his Systematics.

If wanted to study theology that was consistent Orthodox Presbyterian theology, consistent what was taught by the Puritans and the Westminster Confession of Faith. Hodges Systematic Theology is consistent with what Princeton University was then and no longer. Princeton fell into the suede to the popular intellectual pursuits of other theological seminaries. This work is comprehensive in presenting sound theological thought. Comparisons are made between theological thought of the Presbyterian church and Calvinism with other schools of thought in theology: Roman Catholic (called Romanist), Lutheran, liberal theology and nonChristian thought. The arguments for historic theology of the Reformed theology are sound and give a fair presentation of contrary thought.I do not think this book is a difficult read who is familiar with theological terms, but its length demands a determine reader. I read each of the three volumes at three distinct times. I read several other books before moving until I went to the next volume. Although in three volumes the book is divided into four topics: Theology Proper, Anthropology, Soteriology and Eschatology. Charles Hodge argues on page 32 Ecclesiology is included throughout the book.Theology Proper is the study of God. Hodge includes a discussion what the Bible teaches of the being of God, of the three held personality of the Godhead, or that of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost are distinct in persons, same in substance, equal in power and glory, relation of God to the world, or His decrees and His works in creation and Providence.Anthropology is the study of man. Hodge includes in this discussion the origin and nature of man. In this discussion he includes Darwin's theory of Evolution and why he finds it wanting. Besides thoughts from other theologians, Hodge discusses other scientific arguments of the origin of the universe. Anthropology is not limited to the origin of man and creation. It included of man's original state before God, man's original probation, Man's fall before God, the nature of sin, effect of Adam's sin on himself and the effects of Adams sin on prosperity. Who and what is man?Soteriology is the study of Salvation. Hodge includes in this discussion God's purpose in providing salvation to man, God's plan of salvation for man, the person of Jesus, the work of Jesus, Jesus as redeemer, the application of redemption; regeneration, Justification, sanctification and means of grace.Eschatology is the study of death and final events. Hodge includes in this discussion the state of the soul after death, man's resurrection unto life or unto death, the second advent of Jesus, the general judgment of all men: (some unto salvation and others unto damnation), the end of the world, and a new Heaven and New earth.Ecclesiology is the study of the Church. That is the True church that includes all those truly saved by the Grace of God. What makes up what is taught in the Bible and what is contrary to God's Word. I repeat this book shares the views contrary to orthodox teaching of then the Presbyterian church."},{"Title":"Systematic Theology: Volume 2: Anthropology","review":"Even without a table of contents, this is worth the time reading through it and studying its contents.

I've even used the cashier page to start talking with her about money, and why I go to work (so we can pay for things we want to buy). And as the previous reviewer noted, it provides an awfully good role model, when the little girl puts treats back on the shelf!"},{"Title":"You Are Extra-Ordinary","review":"Written by Roger John Williams, biochemist, nutrition researcher, teacher, and writer. This book was used as a collage textbook for physical education. In nutrition he explains, \\"If we continue to try to solve [nutritional] problems on the basis of the average man, we will be continuously in a muddle, because the concept of 'the average man\\" is a muddle. Such a man does not exist.\\"This eye opener describes how people look extremely the same on the outside as opposed to their innards. We watch all these operation movies and sometime real operations and take it for granted that our organs are easily identifiable and similar like noses and eyes. However, it turns out that they may vary greatly in form and even location to an extent. To some people it is intuitive but it took this book to bring my attention to realizing the differences of innards and their different reaction to the same substances."},{"Title":"Imperial China: Photographs, 1850-1912 : historical texts","review":"This book principally consits of photographs. The text mostly introduces the photographers and sets the scene (so to speek) for the photos.The photos themselves are astonishing. They are all taken between 1850 and 1912, when China was still living like it had done for the past 3 thousand years, in all it's high culture and barbarity.There are photos of gorgeously attired couples in dragon robes, all formally seated like ancestor portraits. There are also city-scapes and photos of remote temples and the Summer palace before it was burnt by the invading armies of the west. There are scenes of executions which hide NOTHING and scenes from the imperial court and pictures of heart-breaking poverty.This book is an eye-opener. I've never seen a collection of photos like this anywhere else. I highly reccomend this book to anybody interested in Imperial China, Costume or social history"},{"Title":"Imperial China: Photographs, 1850-1912 : historical texts","review":"Imperial China Photographs 1850-1912 combines photographs from that period with a smattering of the history of China and the history of photographers in China during that time. Both amateur and professional photographers are presented. The history is written with the usual Western spin on the events that took place in China during the decline of the Manchus and the abuse of the Chinese by the Allies.There are approximately 116 pages of photographs, some candid, some posed - all quite interesting. Wherever possible, the pictures are accompanied by dates, photographer's name, subject identified, and some have additional commentary. It would have been helpful to have even more informative commentary on the pictures. Some of the better known photographers included in this book are Thomas, Miller, Beato, Wilson and Mennie.Near the end of the book is a thirteen page article written by Clark Worswick, titled \\"Photography in Imperial China\\". This article identifies various amateur, professional, and government photographers working in Imperial China, and tidbits of information about them.The book also includes an index of commercial and amateur photographers of China, 1846-1912, and a list of which collections supplied the photographs included in this book.Overall, an engaging browse!"},{"Title":"Imperial China: Photographs, 1850-1912 : historical texts","review":"This is (or would be) an excellent, if limited, record of Ch'ing folks. The prints, however, full-sized as they may be, have lost a great deal in the printing and reprinting. We are rather spoiled these days with digitizing everything and even touching up damaged photos. Many of these are the photographic equivalents of kinoscope video in quality due to the original materials, but also to the printing techniques of the book. When the book was originally printed, I'm sure it was cutting edge.Still, if you are interested in the last days of Imperial China, this is a valuable addition to your collection."},{"Title":"Luftwaffe Fighter Aces: The Jagdflieger and Their Combat Tactics and Techniques","review":"I'm the guy that recommended this book to Bowhunter0. If you're 'into' PC flight simulators, aviation, history, or combat stories, you'll enjoy this book. Mike Spick uses diagrams and photographs to illustrate his points, and in the world of air combat a diagram of two airplanes with dashed lines showing their flight paths can go a long way to explaining energy states, relative attitudes, and shot opportunities. He also covers the basic maneuvers, terminology, and the history of the combat aircraft utilized by the aces. One particular section even has a brief talk-through of the steps a Luftwaffe pilot took to launch a 109, fly it, and land it in one piece.Mr. Spick has written another book about Allied aces and their tactics, which I would consider to be a companion piece to this book. He's also written several other books about military aviation which I've found to be very entertaining and plain ol' good reading.If you're serious about your PC flight simulators then you'll get a lot of benefit from Mike Spick's two books. If you don't read his books, well, I guess you'll just spend a lot of your time back at the hangar trying to figure out how that 109 pilot managed to shoot you down yet again."},{"Title":"Luftwaffe Fighter Aces: The Jagdflieger and Their Combat Tactics and Techniques","review":"Sometime studying the opponent is much more instructive than glorifying the victor. As long as this book is concerned, the riveting description of German training, tactics and traditions is really exhaustive.It is surprising to see how long the duty tour was for a German pilot and how dedicated they were to their job, under the word of honor and chilvary that permeated the Luftwaffe tradition. Notwithstanding this credit and a self taught decency, despite the terrible strain of combat, the portrait of their character and lifestyle is really vivid. But even if this psychological trait is instrumental to understand the German aces achievement in battle, the most interesting feature of the volume is the comprehensive examination of pilot training practices, mental preparation and flying skills. A large discussion of combat tactics and fighting methods is presented for each ace, well depicted in the contest of climate, theater of war and available equipment.Beautifully researched, the book is quite easy to read and each chapter is a clearcut account of all threads leading to a conclusive analysis of how German aces outscored the Allied by a wide margin."},{"Title":"Luftwaffe Fighter Aces: The Jagdflieger and Their Combat Tactics and Techniques","review":"Micke Spick's book was a disapointment. It is not very well researched and I found a lot of stories in it, which other books described better and more in depth. Some facts about the pilots are myths and have been shown to be wrong. The comments about the radar in the book are so brief that it gives you the wrong impression about the different approaches the germans and british had to this new technology. The tactics of the german pilots are only described briefly. Yes, we already know that the germans invented the &quot;rotte&quot; and the book goes tell you about &quot;schr&auml;ge musik&quot;, that the germans tried to shoot at very close range and so on and so on. There are no new facts in this book. For anyone who already read a few book about the airwar in europe, this book can't be recommended. It gets two stars because it is a fair introductory book at at low price."},{"Title":"Luftwaffe Fighter Aces: The Jagdflieger and Their Combat Tactics and Techniques","review":"The book shows the history of the Luftwaffe during World War 2, and a little about the origins of it. Also it elaborates on a number of the top Experten (Aces) of the German air force of that time.It shows a number of tactics and maneuvers in simple but clear drawings, but is not covering this in-depth.However, it is clear enough to show you how the German flyers could ammass the number of air-victories they had, and what difficulties and advantages they had over their opponents.The book is very readable, offering once in a while statistical/technical information to provide a background on the why's and where's of the airial combats."},{"Title":"Luftwaffe Fighter Aces: The Jagdflieger and Their Combat Tactics and Techniques","review":"How can one claim 352 victories? How can 106 pilots each claim a 100 or MORE victories? What were the Luftwaffe fighter aces doing? There's the book to tell you!Mr. Spick first starts off with a chapter explaining basic combat tactics and then dives into the history, starting with the Spanish Civil War and ending with retreat from the East and the Jet Aces. Lots of first person accounts, detailed information on both German and Allied aircraft, and postwar examination of military records. Mr. Spick also deals with issues of training, climate and even morale!A must for anybody interested in World War II, the Luftwaffe or just the development of 20th century air combat in general."},{"Title":"Luftwaffe Fighter Aces: The Jagdflieger and Their Combat Tactics and Techniques","review":"It seems like the author never took the time to do any research. Most of the information on tactics is either deducted from previously published pilot stories or based on common knowledge about the subject, and brings nothing new to the table. It's probably a good, cheap and readable book for the novice but borrows heavily from well known sources, making it a waste of money for the person who already has a few book on the subject."},{"Title":"Luftwaffe Fighter Aces: The Jagdflieger and Their Combat Tactics and Techniques","review":"While there are many books on Luftwaffe fighter aces, this one is different because it compares and contrasts the specific combat tactics favored by many of the legendary (and not-so famous) German aces. Each chapter analyzes a different theater of operation and provides brief bios of the successful aces of that theatre. Like Mike Spick's &quot;The Ace Factor&quot; this book is a fresh view on a well-covered subject. An excellent and easy read with helpful diagrams and insightful statictical appendices (as opposed to the same old &quot;top scorer&quot; lists). I would love to see similar books from Spick on the RAF and USAAF aces"},{"Title":"Luftwaffe Fighter Aces: The Jagdflieger and Their Combat Tactics and Techniques","review":"Well written &amp; informative book.

It gives a very general description of the jagdflieger in world war two. I re-read this book because I recently became interested in ww2 flight simulators. I was trying to gain some tactical insight. While the book does provide some insight, it falls short in this regard. Though a well reseached work with personal interviews from the legendary german aces: Hartmann, Rall ect. It does not break any new ground."},{"Title":"Luftwaffe Fighter Aces: The Jagdflieger and Their Combat Tactics and Techniques","review":"This book was very interesting.

I would buy this book again!"},{"Title":"Luftwaffe Fighter Aces: The Jagdflieger and Their Combat Tactics and Techniques","review":"Mike Spick's book on the Luftwaffe fighter aces is one of the rare examples of a technical manual being incorporated into a historiographical text. The research is flawless, and most of the aces I know accept the work as being one of the best in print. I would easily recommend this book to anyone wishing to broaden their understanding as to how the vaunted German fighter aces fought and survived. DEFINITELY A GOOD BUY."},{"Title":"Luftwaffe Fighter Aces: The Jagdflieger and Their Combat Tactics and Techniques","review":"I bought a copy of this book three years ago. I loaned it to someone and never got it back so I bought another copy which I have almost worn out. &quot;Extremely readable&quot; would be an understatement. No student of air combat can afford to be without this little gem, especially at the price. The author, a prolific and highly respected aviation writer, gives a concise, lucid account of the way the Luftwaffe pilots developed their tactics from the Spanish Civil War to the end of WWII. This is not the weighty tome you might expect. It doesn't tell you &quot;everything&quot;; it doesn't pretend to either. The highlights are the little biographies at the end of each chapter and the insight into some rarely-covered topics, such as the air war at night. First class, as I said."},{"Title":"Luftwaffe Fighter Aces: The Jagdflieger and Their Combat Tactics and Techniques","review":"This book represents the Luftwaffe and its tactics as used throughout WW2. Great information on when and how they employeed thier different tactical approaches to attack and disengage from combat. Several diagrams clearly show how the different manouevers were accomplished. If you have read anything about the Luftwaffe, its' pilots, and campaigns this will compliment your knowledge on the subject. The book does a great job following the tactics use in each campaign arena and they clearly had different approaches in each.

Not only was there incredibly interesting and informative bios on each of the many featured aces, but there was discussion of tactics that each used.

Williams is better than anyone at describing and conveying Dylan's genius. Almost overflowing with enthusiasm, Williams reviews Dylan's earliest, most celebrated albums and concerts with an emphasis on Dylan's unique delivery of the material, rather than foculsing on his simply his words or politics, as many less perceptive writers tend to do. Reading the book makes you see Dylan not as the &quot;voice of a generation&quot; but more simply and accurately as the generation's most visionary artist and performer."},{"Title":"Bob Dylan Performing Artist I: The Early Years 1960-1973","review":"This is by far the best book / series of books I have ever read on Dylan. The main thesis of the book is that Dylan is more than anything else a performing artist. That is to say that his primary artistic contribution is in creating spontaneous art in the moment whether that is in a studio or on stage in front of a live audience. Within this framework, anyone coming to interpret and enjoy Dylan's work can build their understanding that the work should be judged not so much as great songs, but great performances of songs. Admittedly Dylan (particularly in recent years) is an aquired taste, but once you have that taste his work is infectious and you can't get enough of it. Thus you can appreciate each permutation of a song as a fresh expression of emotions, ideas, and being in the moment. Great stuff!"},{"Title":"Return","review":"I studied Medieval and Renaissance Spanish in college, leading me to explore Arabic and Persian literature (in English translation) -- first, ancient, then, modern. So, I'm quick to pick up any translation of modern \\"Middle Eastern\\" poets to see where the art is. Khaki's small book does not disappoint. Here is an exceptionally fine -- refined -- poet, fully aware of the conventions of great Iranian literature, bringing the full force of its elegance and power to bear on late 20th century Iranian politics. Most of us know about the Shah, the Savak, Khomeini, the Ayatollahs, the US alliance with Sadam Hussein during the Iran/Iraq War -- but we rarely stop to think of the net effect of all of this turmoil (a nice word for systematic arrests, murders, brutal executions, disappearances all in the name of supplying or denying certain commodities to the West) on soul of a nation whose poetic traditions are at least 2,000 years older than ours. My only complaint here is that this book -- with only 34 pages of poetry -- is much too short. More rewarding, and certainly more worthy of the author, would have been a book that included translations of selections from his Farsi poetry. That's a plea, not a pan."},{"Title":"Return","review":"The poems are poignant, rich and overflowing with a wide spectrum of emotions. They will touch the heart of anyone who has loved, laughed, hoped or deeply suffered. Ala's poems are succinct and piercing, using just the right number of words and phrases to encapsulate raw emotion. As read the poetry, I felt myself empathizing with the inexorable pain he must have endured at the hands of his captors. Yet, despite this suffering he never lost hope in the redeemable emotions of humanity, in love, tenderness and kindness. I recommend this book to everyone as a catalyst for human compassion and as a stimulus for greater perception of emotional depth."},{"Title":"Pastoral Foundations of the Sacraments: A Catholic Perspective","review":"Klein, like the rest of the new theologians have bought into modernist philosophy. If you want solid traditional material on the sacraments I would avoid this like the plague. Fr. Gregory Klein writes in this book on page 86, the following, \\"Eucharist begins with the assembly, the people gather in the name of Jesus Christ. While the details of the environment in which the people gather, the occasion on which people gather, and the manner in which people gather are not unimportant, eucharist is about people.\\" This is the prevailing mentality that modern theologians have today. Pope Benedict XVI however sees this theological position as being in complete contradiction to the true meaning of the liturgy and the Eucharist. \\"For the Liturgy is not about us, but about God. Forgetting about God is the most imminent danger of our age. As against this, the Liturgy should be setting up a sign of God's presence.\\" (The Organic Development of Liturgy, page 13) On page 83 he quotes known dissenter Fr. Richard P. McBrien, \\"The ancient custom of reserving the eucharist for the sick and dying gradually led to the practice of placing tabernacles in churches, often on the altar, and the custom of eucharistic devotion tended to overshadow the actual celebration of the eucharist.\\" It is clear that these \\"new theologians\\" view devotion to God in the Blessed Sacrament as being an obstruction to true \\"Eucharistic\\" celebration!"},{"Title":"Pastoral Foundations of the Sacraments: A Catholic Perspective","review":"Superbly simple read. Yet, a great aid to a person trying to venture into a deeper Sacramental understanding."},{"Title":"Pastoral Foundations of the Sacraments: A Catholic Perspective","review":"I am still in the process of reading it.

It worked best once I'd seen the material in my class textbook. On the job, I find this handbook invaluable for most engineering disciplines involving physical system analysis. It is one of my favorite books. The next edition (4th) is larger, heavier, and somehow, not as interesting. The magic is in this 3rd edition."},{"Title":"Handbook of Engineering Fundamentals","review":"If you purchase only a single engineering reference work this year, purchase this one.

But the for that fraction that you do need you will find it indispensible."},{"Title":"Handbook of Engineering Fundamentals","review":"This is the most comprehensive and useful reference book I own. Every engineer and technical person should own one!But be warned, if you're not already an technical person/engineer and/or genius, it may be a little hard to follow (very involved calculus topics are covered in just a few pages, for instance). If you're looking for something to use as a quick reference for all the subjects you took long ago, this is it - if you're looking to learn something new in great detail, buy a subject-specific textbook first."},{"Title":"Handbook of Engineering Fundamentals","review":"The essential book to own if you are serious about engineering. Everything you need to know. It is amazing how much Eshback packed into one volume. Tapley has continued the tradition. Everything you learned in school and need to recall, plus everything you should have learned."},{"Title":"Handbook of Engineering Fundamentals","review":"Like I said, if you're an engineering major, this is THE book to have before you start your freshman year. I see that there's a 2009 edition, but it has quite a few less pages. I'd stick with this earlier edition, or mine. I had the 1975 edition when I started at R.I.T. in 1976 in mechanical engineering. All the basics are in this one book. There are all the necessary unit-conversion tables in what has to be the best layout I've ever seen; all the tables are very easy to use and EVERY possible conversion you need is there. There are all the basic mathematic formulas (e.g., areas & volumes of all geometric shapes) also in the best and easiest-to-use layout I've ever seen. And that's just the start. Just about every engineering topic is covered to some degree. Like another reviewer said, if you have just one handbook, this is the one to have. Actually, when I was in college, I was just about the only engineering student with a copy of this handbook. It's as if it's a well-kept secret. I was a mechanical engineering student, so I also had Mark's handbook for ME's. If you do get a copy, don't go telling all your classmates that you have it. Keep it to yourself, and hide it in your desk. I'm serious! Make it your \\"ace in the hole.\\" That's what I did, and I can't imagine going through engineering college without a copy! My grades directly reflected the fact that I had this book. And, once you're out in the working world, this book will continue to help you. This book is my \\"first-go-to-book\\" whenever I'm faced with something new. And when you're out in the world, you'll be faced with new and interesting things all the time. Why not read up on things in Eshback before you go into a meeting with the big-shots and wow 'em? If you're an ME, your list of reference books should read: 1) Eshback Handbook, 2) Marks' Handbook for ME's, 3) Basic Dictionary (e.g., Webster's Collegiate), 4) Basic Thesaurus (ditto on Webster's), 5) Machinery's Handbook, 6) Dictionary of Technical Words & Terms (e.g., McGraw-Hill). Remember, you need the latest edition of any course book, but your reference books don't have to be the newest. College is expensive, and any of these reference books can be 20+ years old and still do a great job in helping you out. After all, engineering doesn't necessarily change all that much from year to year. The basics are the basics in engineering, whether it's 1975 or 2015. Thanks for reading my review!"},{"Title":"The Portable Thoreau","review":"I got this book within a timely manner and am very satisfied with the product and the seller."},{"Title":"The Portable Thoreau","review":"This was a very difficult book for me to read as there was too much going on. Thoreau had a wandering mind as well as body, and that comes out quite well in this collection of his works. Unfortunately, I don't like that sort of writing. It always felt like he was rambling and would never stick to one topic. While this is an admirable quality it is also frustrating. There were some interesting parts in this book. I particularly liked aspects of \\"Civil Disobedience,\\" the chapter in Walden on reading was riveting, and his \\"Life Without Principles,\\" had some interesting thoughts. And, too be fair, I read through this rather quickly. But, this is a book only for philosophers and Thoreau/Transcendentalist scholars. Average readers should stick with \\"Civil Disobedience\\" and Walden."},{"Title":"The Portable Thoreau","review":"I'll be honest: I picked this up because I wanted a copy of _Walden_, and getting a selection of Thoreau's other writings was icing on the cake, so if all you want is to confirm that this contains the uncut text of _Walden_, I assure you that it does. For completeness, though, I'll mention everything else in the book as well, with a few quotes to let Thoreau speak for himself.&quot;Natural History of Massachusetts&quot;, 1842 - This isn't what the title might suggest, still less the official subject (given the usual dryness of scientific papers). Like G K Chesterton's Father Brown, Thoreau takes the view that science is a grand thing when you can get it, but that the true scientist should be able to know nature better, and to have more experience of it by noticing fine detail without losing the big picture. &quot;I would keep some book of natural history always by me as a sort of elixir, the reading of which should restore the tone of the system.&quot;&quot;A Winter Walk&quot;, 1843 - Exactly that, seen through Thoreau's eyes. &quot;There is a slumbering subterranean fire in nature which never goes out, and which no cold can chill.&quot;&quot;The Maine Woods&quot;, 1848 - A year after retiring to Walden Pond, Thoreau took a trip to Maine, recorded herein. Some of the word-pictures drawn include those of the pines before logging - and afterward, when rendered down to matches. But once away from the areas near Bangor, much of the country was still wilderness. &quot;And the whole of that solid and interminable forest is doomed to be gradually devoured thus by fire, like shavings, and no man be warmed by it.&quot;&quot;Civil Disobedience&quot;, 1849 - Very influential on Gandhi and Martin Luther King, and quite capable of making a reader squirm even today - if one isn't prepared to back up one's principles with action.&quot;A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers&quot;, 1849 - Not just a travelogue; this is Thoreau, after all, so extra layers of historical discussion and a little poetry are here too. This is a revised and somewhat trimmed version from the original - Thoreau's own later text.&quot;A Yankee in Canada&quot;, 1853 - The beginning of Thoreau's tale of his first journey to Quebec, with a bit of culture shock at his first exposure to a Roman Catholic society.&quot;Walden&quot;, 1854 This would be worth reading if only for 'I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately...', re-popularized in these latter days because of its prominence in the film _Dead Poets' Society_, I expect.&quot;Journal&quot;, 1858 - Not Thoreau's entire journal for 1858, but a selection. The complete journal was his collecting-point of raw material - everything from first drafts of letters, essays, and lectures, to a review of every natural detail the trained surveyor had seen that day.&quot;The Last Days of John Brown&quot;, 1860 - Thoreau didn't attend John Brown's memorial service, but wrote this essay, which was read for him. &quot;Now he has not laid aside the sword of the spirit, for he is pure spirit himself, and his sword is pure spirit also.&quot;&quot;Walking&quot;, 1862 - &quot;I have met with but one or two persons in the course of my life who understood the art of Walking, that is, of taking walks...&quot;&quot;Life without Principle&quot;, 1863 - &quot;We may well be ashamed to tell what things we have read or heard in our day. I do not know why my news should be so trivial - considering what one's dreams and expectations are, why the developments should be so paltry.&quot;&quot;Cape Cod&quot;, 1864 - &quot;The Wellfleet Oysterman&quot; - Thoreau's chat with the elderly oysterman (being asked in after a walk) proves his observation works for human beings as well as the rest of nature - and that he has sense enough to ask somebody who ought to know about nature in the area. &quot;I was fourteen year old at the time of Concord Fight- and where were you then?&quot;A miscellaneous selection of Thoreau's poems is also included, along with a chronology, bibliography, introduction and epilogue by the editor."},{"Title":"The Portable Thoreau","review":"This is a &quot;collected works&quot;-type volume, which I recommend because it gives you the whole package deal, and if you enjoy *Walden* you'll probably want to read more. *Walden*, Thoreau's most famous work, is my favorite book in all the world. Though it is admittedly not for everyone, there is a virtuosity and vibrance to his prose which led one critic to call it some of the best poetry in the English language. In 1845 Henry Thoreau built a small house with his own two hands on the shore of Walden Pond, just outside Concord, Massachusetts, and proceeded to inhabit it for two years, two months, and two days with the purpose of discovering the meaning of life, of paring life down to its most basic elements through self-exploration and communion with nature. Seeing nature through Thoreau's eyes is an experience akin to that of a farsighted person donning corrective lenses for the first time and discovering the extraordinary beauty of things which had been right in front of him all his life. This should be required reading for anyone with any environmental feeling and for anyone interested in self-reliance and personal freedom (which should be all of you). You might want to read &quot;Civil Disobedience&quot; too: people of the ilk of Ghandi and Martin Luther King, Jr. lived by this essay on passive resistance. The introduction and epilog by Thoreau scholar Carl Bode frame the volume well and offer enlightening and apt insights into Thoreau's history and psyche"},{"Title":"The Portable Thoreau","review":"This volume represents a collected works of Thoreau's writings, which a previous reviewer has done well to catalog. Every couple of years I find myself returning to this book to walk with Thoreau and attempt to rediscover my core values and love for pure writing and critical thinking. Thoreau invites his readers to shed the encumbrances of their lives, willingly brought upon themselves in the form of mortgages and jobs they cannot afford to abandon. In short, we become tools to our tools-that is, slaves to materialism.In \\"Nature,\\" Thoreau states: \\"The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation.\\" Referring, in my opinion, to the eternal quest for material items at the cost of intellectual enlightenment. According to Thoreau, a man will spend his entire life working to obtain a nicer house and to surround himself with the trappings of wealth, all the while forgetting that nature, and the pursuit of simplicity and knowledge are true wealth.This book should be a part of your home library."},{"Title":"The Portable Thoreau","review":"This book is a collection of essays, poems, and chapters of books written by Thoreau. It includes:Essays:--Natural History of Massachusetts--A Winter Walk--Civil Disobedience--Walking--Life Without Principle--The Last Days of John BrownBook excerpts:--The Wilds of Penobscot (from The Maine Woods)--Life in the Wilderness (from The Main Woods)--Concord to Montreal (A Yankee in Canada, Excursions)--Selections from 1858 (Journal)--The Wellfleet Oysterman (Cape Cod)A sampling of 18 poems is also included, as well as the full text of Walden. Supplementing this material by Thoreau are an introduction and epilogue by the editor, a short chronology of the main events of Thoreau's life, and a short bibliography. There is no index.For a book that tries to capture the essence and variety of Thoreau's work in one volume, the choice of essays is quite decent. \\"Civil Disobedience\\" and \\"The Last Days of John Brown\\" represent some of the best and most well known of Thoreau's political works. \\"Life Without Principle\\" is perhaps the most well-known essay describing Thoreau's economic philosophy. The remaining essays are classics of his naturalist writing. If there were more space, it would have been great to include \\"Autumnal Tints,\\" \\"Wild Apples,\\" or \\"The Succession of Forest Trees,\\" as well. The book excerpts also present a decent selection of highlights. Certainly, Walden is Thoreau's most well-known book, and it contains material on many of his characteristic topics, so it makes sense to print the entire text. Due to space constraints, material from the other books can only be excerpted, so only the most outstanding or popular sections of the other books appear in this volume.Carl Bode, the editor, includes a short biographical sketch of Thoreau in the introduction, and provides brief notes that describe the context for each of the items included in the book. In the biographical sketch, Bode follows the biographer Canby for the most part, and doesn't seem very impressed by Thoreau's writing on nature, terming him \\"merely an amateur botanizer.\\" In the epilogue, Bode summarizes a 1957 unpublished doctoral dissertation by Raymond Gozzi, in which Gozzi does an extended Freudian psycho-analysis of Thoreau, based on his writings and known biographical details. Gozzi's findings, at least as reported by Bode, are bizarre, as for instance, when it is claimed Thoreau's affinity for swamps as being sexual in nature, or when it is proposed that Thoreau had an Oedipus complex and his relationship with John Brown was colored by his identification with Brown as a father-figure. In sum, this book provides a decent taste of many of Thoreau's more famous works. The biographical sketch can also be useful for students of Thoreau, but the epilogue is more useful as an example of the oddities of Freudian analysis than a serious account of Thoreau and his work."},{"Title":"The Portable Thoreau","review":"This anthology contains Thoreau's major writings. First and above all 'Walden'. And then far far back the travelogue reflective work ' A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers', the famous essay on ' Civil Disobedience' which would be important for Gandhi and Martin Luther King, a scattering of his poems , 'The Maine Woods', ' A Winter Walk' ' A Yankee in Connecticut' and ' The Last Days of John Brown'As Carl Bode makes clear in his excellent introduction surveying the work and life of Thoreau , Thoreau was always one who heard the sound of a different drummer. His aim was to be a poet , a poet who was true to the facts of life and to its deepest transcendal reflection. Bode tells the story of Thoreau seeking a way to make a living, and able to find only a vocation. And that vocation found in the two years and two months at Walden Pond gave the world a literary masterpiece and Thoreau his time of realization. Bode makes it clear that all that came before and all would come after in Thoreau's life would be anti- climax. Bode also tells the story of Thoreau's complicated relation with Emerson, and of Thoreau's learning the heart of his own doctrine from Emerson' 'Nature'. The emphasis on Nature, and on the transcendent world of the Spirit , and on a kind of life apart from the ordinary commercial business of mankind would become essential parts of Thoreau's message. And this Thoreau always closer to the facts of life than Emerson. Thoreau's two disappointed attempts at love are also seen as critical steps in re- enforcing his natural tendency to walk and dream alone. Thoreau towards the end of his life subdued a bit his radical individuality in his effort to serve the anti- slavery cause. But he is the quintessential American individualist, the man who goes his own way to see something no one else has seen before. Bode concludes his introduction with Thoreau's short poem , a summary judgment on his life' My life has been the poem I would have writ/ But I could not both live and utter it./It is clear despite this negative judgment that in another sense the life he did come to confront and live most deeply was the one he shaped with his words. And the testament he left behind has been for many an enhancement not only of their sense of literature and poetry but of their feeling of the possibilities of life."},{"Title":"The Portable Thoreau","review":"Really just wanted to turn back time to when I read Civil Disobedience and Waldens Pond back in high school. Wound up getting a wonderful anthology of Thoreau that has taken a prominent place in my life again. The \\"portable\\" part should come with a disclaimer; I can barely cram it into my coat pocket and it lQQks rather odd tucked into my waistband.He still makes so much sense, and yet, the mainstream folks will never buy into his straight forward sensibility. He threatens their power structure built on taxes and politics, so his ideas will never fly.Damn glad to have the book though!It's a keeper!"},{"Title":"The Portable Thoreau","review":"Very nice collection of Thoreau's work. Perfect for anyone wanting to get better acquainted with Thoreau."},{"Title":"The Portable Thoreau","review":"This product arrived as promised and on time. I have no complaints. It is what it is&#8230;a collage book. I used it for class and it served its purpose."},{"Title":"The Portable Thoreau","review":"Every so often, I come across a book that not only causes me to examine my most steadfast beliefs but also resonates with them, as if the book was a tuning fork struck against my soul. Walden by Henry David Thoreau is one such book. Calling it a mere book I feel, is doing it an injustice. What these letters, these syllables, and words form in their entirety is, to me, one of the great literary works of art. Walden by Henry David Thoreau is a work of the greatest, deepest philosophical proportions that any lover of wisdom would be doing him or herself a disservice by passing the opportunity to take the trip to the pond by. Walden by Henry David Thoreau, unlike other works of this magnitude, is also not written so as that it confounds understanding to those whom would read this as template to their own love ode of nature.On the dust jacket or back of the book you might find something equivalent to saying that Walden is the two year, two month, two day, (and knowing Thoreau two hour) chronicles of a man that built a home and lived by a pond that gives title to the book. It might also express his declaration of discontent of what was then modern man; his society that he felt lacked its right to claim civility, and his technology. This is all very much true but like Thoreau, there was more, much more than those opening words and simplified thoughts laying on the surface can explain.What resides in these pages are, what was then, a new philosophical view that respected nature. It explained that nature was more than something to be tamed and or bent to the will of man and called for recognition of its sovereignty. In Walden Thoreau also asserted that to call one's self a man, a civilized man, one must not behave as the beasts of nature.\\"The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation. What is called resignation is confirmed desperation. From the desperate city, you go into the desperate country, and have to console yourself with the bravery of minks and muskrats. A stereotyped but unconscious despair is concealed even under what are called the games and amusements of mankind. There is no play in them, for this comes after work. But it is a characteristic of wisdom not to do desperate things.\\"Henry David ThoreauWaldenThe first chapter, Economy, the longest single piece of work in the book, outlines why he embarked on this mission. From early on, it reads as if a semi-edited stream of consciousness that expresses a yearning to simplify one's life and rid oneself of the rigors that social life and a proper standing in high society of New England demanded.\\"Most of the luxuries, and many of the so-called comforts of life, are not only indispensable, but positive hindrances to the elevation of mankind.\\"Henry David ThoreauWaldenHe expresses his contempt for the high esteeming attitude, which still prevails today, people had and have for fashion, homes, and miss appropriated civic pride and calls all that read to come to an epiphany of what is true and what actually is necessary in life. He also does not shy away from telling and expressing his faith. He also does not hold a close mind in that believing he can only learn from faith solely but expresses how all of nature is part of creation and there by his learning is only heighten, not hindered by experiencing and being a part of nature. This being a part of nature he also felt and expressed that civilized man was again retreating from too rabidly.\\"Why should we live with such hurry and waste of life? We are determined to be starved before we are hungry.\\"Henry David ThoreauWaldenI pause here to say that the chapter entitled Reading will forever hold a special place in my heart because of this quote here,\\"A written word is the choicest of relics. It is something as once more intimate with us and more universal that any other work of art. It is the work of art nearest to life itself. It may be actually breathed from all human lips; not be represented on canvas or in marble only, but be carved out of the breath of life itself.\\"Henry David ThoreauWaldenIf you read Walden for nothing else, I say read enough to get to this point. Read until you have arrived to this statement so you can fully appreciate the profoundness and beauty of what had been written, what your eyes just had the privilege to have read. Anyone that writes, anyone that sings, anyone that appreciates literature, poetry, and song for the art that it is understands the wonder that was expressed by such an uncomplicated and deeply insightful statement. One other statement that truly reveals how this man born in 1817 and this work written in 1854 was far ahead of its time, reaching into our own some one hundred and fifty four years later, but also shows how far we have not gone in the those one hundred and fifty four years.\\"Society is commonly too cheap. We meet at very short intervals, not having had time to acquire any new value for each other. We meet at meals three times a day, and give each other a new taste of that old musty cheese that we are. We have had to agree on a certain set of rules, called etiquette and politeness, to make this frequent meeting tolerable and that we need not come to open war. We meet at the post office, and at the sociable, and about the fireside every night; we live thick and are in each other's way, and stumble over one another, and I think that we thus lose some respect for one another. Certainly less frequency would suffice for all important and hearty communications.\\"Henry David ThoreauWaldenClearly Thoreau touched on points that we still speak about today, if not it is probably worse today. We do not sit down with friends or family today for even one meal yet we hold strict contempt for strangers that disobey the rules of etiquette and politeness. I once saw a woman curse another woman out because she did not hold the door open for her as they were walking in the store, but the woman that walked in the store in front of the other woman did not even see or know another person was behind her so why would she hold the door open. If we change the post office to starbucks or some fast-food place for lunch and the fire side to tv or computer and we have relevant commentary about today.This is where my love affair with Walden ends. If you are reading this work for its philosophical merit alone then I will say upon approaching the chapter The bean field skip to the conclusion. The remainder of the book is just details and true odes to birds, fishing, the pond, and other natural aspects that have worth but reading all of them becomes very monotonous. Read this book for its philosophical worth. Read this book for its historical value and being one of the early roots of environmentalism and naturalism in America. Read this book and ponder.\\"Shall we always study to obtain more of these of these things, and not sometimes to be content with less?Henry David ThoreauWalden"},{"Title":"The Portable Thoreau","review":"This is a nice size copy.

How do you get a group's attention when you need it? More importantly, what primary skills do you need to be taken seriously when you want to sway the actions of another person, a team or an organization? Fiona Elsa Dent and Mike Brent answer these questions and more in this straightforward book. They balance practical information with pertinent academic research as they show you how to gain influence and explain why their strategy works. Their book provides a solid framework for learning and using persuasive skills in business and social settings. It includes tests and exercises to help you get the most from each chapter. getAbstract recommends this strategic book to readers who want to influence others."},{"Title":"Influencing Skills And Techniques for Business Success","review":"\\"Influencing\\" is a must read. It is a primer for those wanting to explore, learn and enhance their techniques to influence and build effective relationships.The book adopts a very concise and pragmatic approach towards the subject of influencing. It has a universal appeal and the target audience is not confined to the business community alone.The chapters are well laid out with a useful blend of theory and exercises backed up with key learning's summarised at the end of each of the chapters. The reader is essentially guided through a six-step model of influencing which forms the core of the book from chapters two to seven.Step 1 is understanding and being aware of one's influencing environment (that is culture and related behaviours that work and those that are not acceptable)in business parlance.Step 2 moves to explore the important concept of self-awareness and provides an in-depth discussion on the key skills (i.e. listening, questioning & probing, body language and the like) and attitudes for effective influencing. This is followed by an insightful chapter on \\"influencing styles\\" where the reader is encouraged to examine and identify one's preferred styles between the \\"push\\" and \\"pull\\" styles illustrated.Step 3 is essentially identifying the needs, wants and the style of the people to be influenced. To this affect, some powerful frameworks on the \\"Influencing Stakeholder Network Map\\" and the \\"Hermann's Thinking Style Preference model\\" along with a section on power and influence bases are presented and discussed.The next step in the influencing model involves more of a process of reviewing the data at hand about the present environment, examining one's approach in the context and that of the influencee's in order to plan for the way ahead.Step 5 introduces the reader to a number of tried and tested tools and techniques for effective influencing all of which can be useful to add to one's influencing toolbox.The final phase of the model is to examine the range of various approaches and decide upon and adopt the most appropriate influencing strategy to the situation, the people involved and the issues at hand.The authors, Fiona Dent and Mike Brent both of whom are faculty members at Ashridge Business School contend that the model for effective influencing is not a one-off action but is based upon a structured process towards planning, preparing and analysing before one starts the actual process of influencing.They further conclude that being an effective influencer requires not only to be aware of the necessary skills of influencing but to also possess a certain frame of mind that requires one to have patience and to practise which in the long term leads to better decision making, more participation and higher motivation.There is also a resource section provided at the end that makes mention of the \\"Influencing Styles Questionnaire\\" which was developed and based on the model presented in this book. The questionnaire and supporting material is available from Ashridge and would assist the reader and users to determine their preferred influencing styles.If you are looking for a book on the subject of influencing backed up with models and practical applications then this book is a must have!\\"Influencing\\" merits a serious read and is a worthwhile investment."},{"Title":"Bestias (Spanish Edition)","review":"This is a very good translation of Crowley's book and has a fine hard cover presentation. Fortunately Minotauro Editions has restarted the publication of sci-fi volumes as it did in the early \`50s, allowing Spanish reading public to get in touch with this genre.Crowley proposes a strange universe to develop a new Aesopian world.USA has disintegrated in a bunch of minor Autonomies and City States competing among them in an endless struggle. There is a feeble nominal Federal Government and a new emerging Union for Social Engineering trying to gain political control, this specific feature reminds me of a very similar state structure on PKD's \\"The World that Jones Made\\".In some earlier stage, scientists had done some bio-engineering experiments producing some hybrid new species: the Leos grown from the improbable combination of human and lion cells. There are also other strange specimens: a fox-man, a dog with some undetected talents and, of course, lots of human characters, with their own goals and needs.Combining all these elements, Crowley structures a very interesting novel. The Beasts traits, (fox's cunning, lion's braveness and endurance, dog's fidelity and self sacrifice) are potentiated by the mixture with human traits. Humans in their turn had been subject to over stressing situations in a changing background. So the interactions between so different characters are always open to collisions due to their diverging natures and interests.The power shifts from one group to the other. At the same time all of them are approaching to each other, seducing and being seduced, in a continuous dance in a spiral course.There are some reminiscences and resonance from Aesop fables and his wise animals proposing intelligent lessons to humankind.This is a book to be tasted as a rare dish by sophisticated readers.Reviewed by Max Yofre."},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"I picked this anthology up due to the inclusion of C.E. Murphy- and I was not disappointed! Murphy's tale, \\"Banshee Cries\\", continues the saga of Joanne Walker, the central figure in \\"Urban Shaman\\". In \\"Urban Shaman\\", Joanne was a police mechanic for the Seattle Police Department until the department replaced her while she was in Ireland with her dying mother. Consequently, she became an unwilling police officer who also has a spirit guide, Coyote. In this story, Joanne communicates with her dead mother, Sheila MacNamarra, to thwart a serial killer who had also tried to kill her mother. \\"Moontide\\" by Mercedes Lackey was an unexpected surprise for me. Moira na Ferson has been trained to be one of the Grey ladies- able to appropriately interact at court and yet have the skills of an assassin. Her father sent her away many years ago and has shown no interest in her until he mysteriously demands she return home. Once home at the Highclere Sea-Keep, she discovers her father, Lord Ferson, has befriended the pirate, Massid, Prince of Jendara. I won't spoil this intriguing story by revealing the nefarious plot Moira and Kedric the Fool uncover and ultimately thwart. \\"The Heart of the Moon\\" by Tanith Lee was the weakest of the three stories and a disappointment to me as I had previously read and enjoyed some of Lee's work. Clirando, a warrior for the goddess Parna, discovers her lover, Thestus, and her sister-friend, Araitha, have betrayed her by having sex. She challenges and beats both in duels and both are banished. Before Araitha leaves for her banishment, she curses Clirando. Clirando then receives word that Araitha died in a shipwreck, thus cementing the power of the curse. Clirando and a band of her warriors are then sent to the Moon Isle, a mysterious Isle where selected individuals were sent for the Seven Nights. From there, the story is a series of hallucinations/dreams where Clirando meets her true love, Zemetrios, and both earn their redemption. Perhaps others will enjoy the underlying meaning behind the story (such as the pigs representing Clirando's evil faces) but I felt it was too confusing. Overall, I recommend this anthology based on the strength of the stories by Murphy and Lackey."},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"I'd been trying to get a hold of this anthology for a while, so I was pleasantly surprised when Luna included it as the \\"free\\" book I received for trying their services. The three novellas in this volume, I believe, epitomize the blend of rich fantasy, strong female characters, and romantic elements offered by the books in the Luna line. Being a bit of a romantic myself, I prefer a solid \\"happily ever after\\" type ending, or at least a strong \\"happy for now\\" one. So, the first two novellas in this collection did deliver more solidly on that promise than did the last, but that in no way diminished my enjoyment of this collection, and each story within it.Moontide by Mercedes Lackey starts off this anthology. In this story, the author takes us back to her Five Hundred kingdoms, only this time, it tells the tale of the daughter of the lord of a Sea-Keep sent off to fosterling. Her father wants her back, and she's certain it's for a marriage proposal. However, the proposal doesn't exactly materialize, and what she discovers means treason against the crown. She has only the skills she learned as one of the Countessess' \\"Grey Ladies\\" and a Fool, on which she can rely. Will it be enough to stop a threat to not only the King's person, but his very kingdom?Having been disappointed with the author's work of late, I'm very pleased to have found a story which drew me in and kept me turning pages. Our heroine is a strongly drawn character, with a strength of will and a keen mind, which makes her the perfect foil for her father's plans. With the Fool, a man who is never quite completely drawn, we're shown that in him, she has a partner to help save the king. While the romance is understated, it is there, and is satisfactorily wrapped up in the story. I certainly hope we see more of the Grey Ladies in future stories.The Heart of the Moon by Tanith Lee is the middle story. A warrior, wounded by the betrayal of a man she called lover and a woman she called friend, finds herself cursed. When she's sent to the Isle of the Moon she finds herself on a spiritual journey and meets a man similarly betrayed. As they work through their issues, they discover a love for each other. Except once their time of the isle is over, they're torn apart, and have to find their way to each other.I'll be honest, I hadn't been impressed with Tanith Lee's contributions to romance anthologies in the past, and I didn't expect much this time around. However, this story with is poignant characterization and the emotional trails of the characters, created a compelling read, and once that impressed this reader. The Heart of the Moon is a journey of the heart.Banshee Cries by C.E. Murphy, ended the anthology. An author whose work I wanted to read, I found myself eagerly looking forward to this story. A reluctant beat cop has to come to grips with her shamanic power, her dead mother, and her position within the police department.I found the characterization and sense of place in this story; however, I kept looking for romantic content and found it lacking. This was mentioned as being book 1.5 of the series, so perhaps reading the first book would help ground the reader in the world and the sense of place. However, as an urban fantasy story, this tale does its job in creating an otherworldly sense to our day-to-day lives, and the narrator's unique and strong voice makes it a page-turning read."},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"It's hard to really 'rate' a grouping like this, where I had divergent reactions to the three works.The Lackey novella I found to be boring and obvious. Yet another plucky young girl who, through the power of feminism, can walk circles around the rest of her society, solving a barely transparent plot against the kingdom. I suppose fans of hers will like it well enough, as it's fairly typical of her work.I'd been meaning to read some Tannith Lee for some time, and I can see the appeal. I liked her writing style, and the character-centric story. It was okay, even enjoyable, but fairly forgettable.But I loved the C.E. Murphy story. She's got such a strong and clear voice. This ties directly into last year's \\"Urban Shaman\\" novel, and is a nice continuation of the story. I'd recommend reading that instead, but if you do and you want more, this is a large enough chunk to make it worth the trouble. Ultimately, I hope that this causes fans of the more popular Lee and Lackey to discover this exciting new author."},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"\\"Moontide\\" by Mercedes Lackey. At Sea Keep Moira na Ferson must choose between what her father wants of her and what her king demands of her, but she has always been independent and strong. Whichever sire she obeys will cause harm especially to her so being independent and strong and strictly adhering to the laws of marriage as they pertain to her, Moira heeds the advice of the Fool.\\"Heart of the Moon\\" by Tanith Lee. Warrior priestess Clirando once sought love, but instead received pain and a curse. She wears a mask to hide her inner hurt until she meets Zemetrios. As she begins to feel love again, she expects him to betray her as the curse will surely intercede unless he can get her to join him in questioning what they hold to be true, the greater truth of love.\\"Banshee's Cry\\" by. C E Murphy. Joanne Walker has vowed to never use her powers as a shaman, but soon has no choice but to rely on her \\"gift\\" for the good of her people. She must solve ritual homicides that have occurred under the full moon and can only do so by using that which she detests employing.These three romantic fantasies are well written tales of love between strong protagonists with the powerful females having the more obvious flaws; in fact the men seem underdeveloped in comparison. Still sub-genre fans will enjoy each novella that has a different spin making for a fine anthology.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"In this book,the authers took old ideas and made them fresh and new again.

I did enjoy her dedication to her mother who wanted to know about Jo's mother. Considering how Jo's mother treated her in Urban Shaman you could almost hear C.S.' mother saying \\"are you trying to tell me something?\\". Her novella does continue Jo's growth as a shaman and does get her mother off the hook so to speak. (I always invision Jo as Angelina Jolie--if they ever made Urban Shaman into a movie she'd get my vote for the part) Anyway the story was well done but didn't quite seem to make it to the same level as Urban Shaman. Perhaps when her novel comes out next May it will be back up there.I enjoyed Tanith Lee's story as well. It was well done with a suprise ending about what the journey on the Island she was sent to was all about.Mercedes Lackey's story was OK but more of a romance than the other two with no particular spiritual depth to it.

Not the first time I've been sorry about it.

Anyway, if you've read the Walker papers, you'll find Banshee Cries duplicates an awful lot of explanations (with the identical same phrases, which really gets my goat, did she just use generic fill material?)

The only clue the I found that could indicate that this story would fit in the Five Hundred Kingdoms is the presence of the Fool. Other than that, it simply read as a good fantasy plotline, with equal parts romance, intrigue, and adventure. The story wrapped up nicely, with no loose ends, but I would love to read a full novel about the Grey Ladies - not much information is given on this group of women and they certainly have much potential for a good full-length story.The second story is by Tanith Lee, whom I have never read before now. I rather enjoyed the world development, despite the length she had to work in, and the imagery was both mysterious and beautiful. After I read the story, I went looking online to see if this world fit into any other novels, but I could not find any information on this. Still, I plan to check out more of her work now.The third story by C. E. Murphy takes place in her Walker Papers series, specifically between the first and second book. Since I have only read the first two books in the series, I thoroughly appreciated how this story filled in a few blanks for me about what is happening in the series. In this story, Joanne learns about her deceased mother, who turns out to be quite a fascinating character. I think I may even prefer her to Joanne.

Her father seems to be planning to marry her off to an enemy prince and they make many sly comments about ships sinking in the storms that frequent Highclere. Here father's new Fool seems very interested in all the goings on, but is he a spy for the King or is he working for her father and the prince? Could trusting him see her married to the prince and imprisoned in his harem or will it lead to salvation?For some reason, of all the characters in this story, the Fool was my favorite. I would have liked to have seen some of the story from his point of view. We were told about his wit, but never got a chance to see it. I liked how Moira handles her role as a spy and the whole confrontation with the prince. It's a lot more realistic than having her be blas&eacute; about it, as if it's something she does all the time. And really, no matter how much you train or prepare for a situation, you aren't truly ready for the reality of it until it's there in your face.The Heart of The Moon - Author: Tanith LeeClirando is a warrior woman, strong and honorable, who's happy with her life. And why not? She's leader of a band of warriors, of which her best friend from childhood, Araitha, is one and she's got an attractive lover, Thestus. Things couldn't be better! That is, until the night lighting strikes the Temple of the Maiden and, in the scramble to save the roof, she discovers that Araitha and Thestus are having an affair. She challenges them both in battle and wins. They are both shamed and must leave the town of Amnos, but before her ship sails Araitha visits Clirando for a parting shot. She curses Clirando to be filled with emptiness, to find joy in nothing and to sleeplessness, that she may find no rest. Clirando shrugs off the curse and goes on with her life. Until she hears that the ship Araitha was on has sunk. Suddenly she can not sleep, she finds joy in nothing, and there is a burning emptiness inside of her. Clirando and her band are called to go to Moon Isle for the Seven Nights, a festival to honor the moon being full for seven full days. Strange things happen on this island and sometimes people don't return. The first night there her band sets up camp and Clirando takes the watch, but the impossible happens, she falls asleep. When she wakes up, her band is gone and there is no sign of where they could be. Clirando sets off to find a village or some sign of her girls, but she finds odd creatures who follow her and haunt her with their strange cries. In her trek through the forest she meets Zemetrios, a fellow traveler also looking for a village who wants to share her fire and travel with her. Is he who he says he is? He has a past more painful than hers, which he shares with her. Is he telling the truth or is this some trick. Can she trust him in this place full of ghosts and illusions when those closest to her have betrayed her?I can't think of a thing that I've read of Tanith Lee's that I did not like. This novella was no exception. I liked that his was about a journey of self-discovery and forgiveness. Both Clirando and Zemetrios had to go a long way to deal with their ghosts and to accept themselves as they were. And I liked that Zemetrios' issues weren't easily settled.Banshee Cries - Author: C.E. MurphyThis story was describes as 1.5 in \\"The Walker Papers\\" series. I didn't readUrban Shaman (The Walker Papers, Book 1), though it is on my TBR list, so I felt that I was a bit behind. It wasn't that I couldn't follow the story, but I did feel that some of the interpersonal stuff was really lost on me.I won't give summary bit about the story because there's so much back story that I'm just missing. I don't feel comfortable doing it. I will say that this novella moved Urban Shaman up on my TBR list."},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"I really liked this book. Reading new authors gives me a chance to see how they write."},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"The first story is \\"Moontide\\". Moira is the daughter of the lord of a sea keep who sent her to the Countess for fostering. The Countess has a reputation for turning out socially expert marriage bait. But she also turns out Gray Ladies who are spies and assassins. Moira is one. Overall the story is well written with a decent plot and it shows a side of the 500 kingdoms where the folks are not involved in the inner workings of The Tradition (a force that makes things come out the way it thinks they should). Her father calls Moria home with an obvious intent of marring her off To cement an alliance and gets more than he bargained for.I had trouble swallowing a boat house that would withstand a 30'+ storm surge but hey this is a fantasy so a gimme. The plot is a little linear and predictable if sometimes funny. The principal characters are well drawn although Moira's father and his motives are never fleshed out. Unfortunately; there are a number of annoying editorial errors and I have the impression that review of this story was rather cursory. e.g. \\"the sigh of the phoenix embroidered...\\" (thats got to be some realistic embroidery) and then in one case the beacons are fulled with fish oil and then by magically treated sea coal.3 1/2 stars, much better than average.The next story \\"The Heart of the Moon\\" Cliando is sent on a quest to a mysterious island by a priestess after being betrayed by friends. There she meets Zemetrioss who has similar issues. The symbolism is well done like something fromThe Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion: A New Abridgement from the Second and Third Editions (Oxford World's Classics)orThe Hero with a Thousand Faces (Mythos Books).4 1/2 just misses a 5 star rating as the plot is a little predictable (at least if you are familiar with either or the above books).With \\"Banshee Cries\\" Walker combats a supernatural serial killer. The story falls betweenUrban Shaman (The Walker Papers, Book 1)andThunderbird Falls (The Walker Papers, Book 2). Walker is still trying to come to grips with her powers and is uneasy with them. The characters are well drawn with some good humor as well. The plot is good but no big surprises.Overall 4 stars.As a book I would rate this anthology at 4 stars."},{"Title":"Winter Moon","review":"Torn between duty to her father or to her king, a woman choses a third option in Mercedes Lackey's Moontide, and learns to listen to the wisdom of a fool.

Very juvenile and predictable, and about on a par with her Gryphon series, particularly the second and third book.

However, don't expect &quot;The Runaway Jury&quot;, &quot;The Firm&quot; or &quot;The Pelican Brief&quot;. This book is nowhere close to the quality of Grisham's other books.

The ending was incredibly anti-climactic. Grisham could have done something bold at the end (think sister), but went with some obscure, hardly believable, ending. Very, very weak. Don't waste your money or time. Unless you need something to put you to sleep."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Fans of Grisham will no doubt find a lot to like in The Last Juror, especially those well conditioned to the sparse, even lax, writing style that he and others have made very popular. The novel draws us into the adventures of a young man who goes to work, at age 23, for a small town newspaper and winds up owning it in short order. The heart of the story, however, revolves around the rape and murder of a woman living in the small town, the trial and sentencing of the accused. Fast forward nine years, with a few intervening details thrown into the mix, and the accused is out of jail and threatening the town by just being back in the area, even though no one knows what he's up to.The characters in this novel, including the narrator, are not sharply drawn and, indeed, are almost forgetable from one chapter to the next. It is written in a style close to a memoir, forcing the narrator to tell what happened rather than letting it unveil itself in the manner of a good yarn. The &quot;looking back&quot; aspect detracts from the internal drama of the story. In other words, and doesn't call on the writer to expand the drama of scenes, since he, the narrator, already knows the outcome. I was left with the impression of a lot a events passing before me, without much chance to experience them or have the insight that must have come to the narrator living through them.Grisham throws in a thinly disguised version of Wal Mart to give details of what happens to a small town when the big discounter hits the area. This is a worthy effort because he shows how, in fairly short order, local businesses are driven under by the mega competition. Too many people, perhaps, have not considered the impact of their bargain hunting buying habits.Part of the inspiration for the concluding section of the novel clearly came from the Washington, DC, area sniper events of a year and a half ago. Grisham doesn't over play this aspect, however, which is good, for to do so would have overcome the story with artificiality. I had the impression from the closing third of the novel that Grisham was starting to hit his stride. Enriching elements that could have enlivened the earlier part of the book were rushed into the closing section.There was at least one glaring error of internal consistency. It happened in regard to explaining what the character Sam Ruffins had done while on the run from a jealous husband with murderous intent. There might have been other errors of this type that a more careful reader could find. Even though the error I discovered was rather small, it is not something one expects to find in a book by an experienced, best selling writer.This book was not boring and it covers a sweep of southern life late in the 20th century that many will find interesting. The importance of religion in small town life, the easy corruption of small time politics, the lasting impact of racism and segregation are all worthy topics given a breath of life in the novel. Grisham brings out a portrait of a vivid African American woman who overcame racism, something other author's have neglected, or been unable, to do. Her role in the storyline, however, is secondary, except for the friendship between her and the narrator. Still, all in all, for me, this was not a deeply memorable read. Enjoyable at times, yes. I am left with a question: how can something be interesting without being revealing, dramatic without being memorable?"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I have read 12 of Grisham's 17 novels. He truly gave the best of himself at the beginning of his writing career and has been on a downhill slide ever since. He used to write books that I literally could not put down. I had to force myself to finish this book. It had none of the page-turning, pulse-pounding suspense of his earlier books. It was just...boring. On top of that I found it to be sloppy, too. There were times when he told us (again) what he had just told us 2 pages earlier. Whoever edited this book also missed several mistakes (Miss Callie would have counted!)Want good Grisham? Go back and just reread his older stuff because he's obviously not going to give us anything new that comes anywhere near his earlier books. If you're dead set of reading this, check it out from the library. Don't waste money on it."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"This was nothing like any of Grisham's past novels....the title alone is nothing like you'd expect. First, there was no 'last' juror...only 3 died in the book. And there was no single juror that held any precidence over the others at all that had any major plot line of the story. I feel that two thirds of the novel is completely irrelevant. I'm sure that it would be interesting to anyone wanting to know about the history of Clanton during the 70's; to them it would have been astounding....but no, it was a historical bore!I wanted a courtroom thriller, but really, any drama in the courtroom happened completely randomly in the last 10 pages....I kept reading only because I wanted the monotonous story line to end.If you are looking forward to one another one of Grisham's better thriller, wait till his next book....this one is a bore from page 5 through 455.

I fail to understand why the author thought that this might be interesting."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I just finished reading The Last Juror and all I can say is it is probably one of the best books I've read this year. The story is simple yet complex, and the characters are beautifully drawn out.

While I didn't complete a manuscript, I did manage to get a few chapters (as well as a complete outline... hmmmmm...) to several publishers. Oh, and before I forget to specify, this was all more than 3 years ago.So it goes without saying that I was loathe to finish reading this book, and my opinion remains somewhat biased.

However, the stasis, and hence the collapse, of postcapitalist narrative which is a central theme of The Pelican Brief emerges again in The Last Juror, although in a more self-sufficient sense.The characteristic theme of the works of Grisham is not discourse, as Derrida would have it, but postdiscourse. If the dialectic paradigm of narrative holds, we have to choose between neodialectic rationalism and deconstructivist capitalism. Therefore, the dialectic paradigm of narrative holds that consciousness serves to marginalize the underprivileged.Marx promotes the use of neodialectic rationalism to modify sexuality. However, the primary theme of Long's analysis of the dialectic paradigm of narrative is not desituationism, but predesituationism.The premise of neodialectic rationalism holds that the State is part of the fatal flaw of consciousness, given that art is interchangeable with consciousness. But any number of narratives concerning realism exist.\\"Art is intrinsically impossible,\\" says Derrida. The destruction/creation distinction prevalent in Joyce's Finnegan's Wake is also evident in The Last Juror. In a sense, Baudrillard's model of the textual paradigm of reality suggests that reality is part of the defining characteristic of narrativity."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"You can bid on an autographed copy of John Grisham's &quot;The Last Juror!&quot; Read more at CMTAuctions.com!"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"After SKIPPING CHRISTMAS and, most recently, BLEACHERS I had begun to believe that John Grisham had been abducted by aliens.

John Grisham is back to his best form. Couldn't put it down - especially at the end."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"All of the stereotypes are here in this well-written and entertaining novel.Jack Bryan"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"This novel is set in 1970s rural Ford County, Mississippi. The story revolves around a 23 year old Memphis man, Willie Traynor, who drops out of college in Syracuse, New York, and with the help of his wealthy grandmother lands a job at a floundering small town newspaper in Clanton, Mississippi. A short time later the newspaper goes belly-up, and Willie buys the entire operation, again with the help from his grandma in the form of a 50 thousand dollar loan.Having only his college journalism and some other insignificant writing experience under his belt, Willie attempts to make a go of the newspaper. Soon after he acquired the paper, a horrific murder occurred which shook Ford County from one end to the other. As a result of the newsworthy, headline making murder, and some strategic journalism, the weekly papers start selling like never before. Subscribers soon reach over 5000 which is a huge increase in circulation. Willie realizes a profit and much to his credit is able to repay his grandmother the loan plus interest. However, she refuses the repayment and Willie instead invests the money.While Willie needed to learn some hard facts about the newspaper business, his true learning involved small town politics and getting along with people with views quite different from his own. Willie is a bleeding heart liberal trying to stay afloat in a very conservative small southern town. He manages to do quite well for himself, and after a while he even thrives. He writes personal stuff about the locals which is a huge hit. He also takes a personal interest in some of the town folks namely one such citizen by the name of Miss Callie Ruffin. Miss Callie is a self eduacted black lady from Lowtown with a slew of kids all of whom are grown and on their own. What Willie finds unique about Miss Callie is that most of her nine children have earned college degrees. A few of her offspring are even college professors and a couple are lawyers. This deeply religious woman takes a real liking to Willie, and they soon cultivate a profound friendship which involved meeting every Thursday at her house for a home cooked lunch. Miss Callie soon spoils Willie, but he does not take her kindness for granted. When a local jury is selected for an atrocious murder, Miss Callie is among those chosen to serve. She just happens to be the first black juror in the history of Ford County. Later, when the jury members are in perceived peril, Willie worries about the safety and well-being of his friend, Miss Callie. He goes out of his way to see that she is protected.Much of the story focuses on the murder of an attractive female, Rhoda Kassellaw, and her convicted killer, Danny Padgitt, who comes from a wealthy family who just happen to own their island in the vicinity of Ford County. During the deeply emotional trial, Padgitt, against the advice of his attorney, takes the stand and really screws himself royally when he threatens to kill every last juror if they find him guilty. The threatened jury, nevertheless, finds Padgitt guilty. However, much to the disappointment of Willie Traynor, the jury decided that Padgitt should receive a life sentence instead of the death penalty. Here the author takes some creative license by incorporating a 1970s Mississippi law which makes a prisoner who is sentenced to life, eligible for parole after serving 8 years.Immediately after the trial, Padgitt is shipped off to the state prison in Parchman where he is soon forgotten by the folks of Clanton. Forgotten that is until he makes parole about nine years later. Soon after his release from prison, one of the Padgitt jurors is shot and killed. Then, a second one is murdered by a gunman. The town starts to get nervous and begins pointing fingers toward Danny Padgitt as the alleged trigger man.Willie Traynor does a little research and found that three jurors were responsible for Padgitt receiving a life sentence instead of a death sentence. Two of these three jurors had now been murdered. The question is asked, why would Padgitt want to murder the ones who basically saved his life? Some speculate that Danny incorrectly thought that the three jurors had instead voted for the death penalty. Others theorized that the Padgitt wealth paid off the three jurors to ensure either an acquittal or a hung jury. When they did not get the desired result, then the Padgitt's invoked their own death sentence.Anyway, much attention focused on protecting all the remaining jurors especially the third juror, Maxine Root. Things are uptight and tense for several months with everyone on edge. Willie places much of his attention on his friend, Miss Callie, who also has the constant protection of her adoring children. The jurors stay home for the most part and restrict their outside activities to a minimum. Several months pass with no shootings. Time is obviously on the killer's side. After more time lapses, folks start to relax and drop their guard. Miss Callie again starts going to church. Things begin to return to some degree of normalcy. Then it happens.Maxine Root receives a suspicious package in the mail, ostensibly a package of pecans from her sister. She calls the law, and a deputy sets the suspicious package off in the distance away from the house. He pulled his revolver and shot at the package. After a missed shot, he hit the package which exploded to kingdom come. Unfortunately, the deputy did not set the package far enough away, and several people were injured in the blast, including Maxine Root. Fortunately, no one was killed in the blast. Danny Padgitt was soon arrested.During Padgitt's arraignment something very unexpected happens which results in Willie taking an unplanned trip to a mental hospital to speak with a psychiatrist. There is also an unexpected twist.My OpinionOverall, I enjoyed this book from the first page to the last. It is a fast read that will keep you captivated. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good story. Also, I think this novel will easily transform into a major motion picture, if it hasn't already happened."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I'm a big fan of John Grisham early works... Runaway Jury, Time to Kill etc. But this story and The Summons sucked. I read the The Summons all the way through and I never felt the suspense and after I got to the ending I felt stupid for forcing myself through the book. This story I decided not to even finish. The stories susposed to be about a man coming back and killing the jurors after he gets out of the jail. So I'm thinking that theres going to be about a 100 or so pages leading up to the man getting out of jail then there would be the killings. I got over halfway through the book which was very boring and I was still reading about the time surrounding the trial. I couldn't figure out the point of all this extra info. So I gave up. Don't waste your time if you're a fan of the early John Grisham."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"If you're looking for the typical Grisham \\"thriller\\", this is not the book. The Last Juror is disappointing at best! The story that is outlined on the book jacket takes more than one third of the book to unfold. In other words, the book jacket told us the same thing that a full one third of the book told us. The second third is barely readable! It has absolutely nothing to do with the plot. The book is certainly not what the reader is looking for when reading a Grisham novel.Grisham has indeed earned the financial freedom to discover other genre's, but I wish the publisher wouldn't try to fool the reader into thinking this is another legal thriller."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"John Grisham, long known for his legal thrillers and courtroom dramas and more recently for his heartwarming \\"down-home\\" books, combines his strengths in his latest offering, The Last Juror. With elements from all three styles of his past successes, Juror is at once riveting, suspenseful, and tender. Such a combination doesn't always work, even for a master like John Grisham, and at times the story is stilted, particularly when a major plot development seems lifted directly from a previous novel. All told, however, The Last Juror is a quick, enjoyable read with a little bit of everything readers have come to love about Grisham's books.The Last Juror takes us back to Clanton, Mississippi, the setting of Grisham's first novel, A Time to Kill. At first, the identical setting seems incidental, until we meet familiar characters like Harry Rex, the greasy divorce attourney, and a pre-disbarrment Lucien Wilbanks, protagonist Jake Brigance's mentor from the earlier novel. Juror takes place some years prior to A Time to Kill, and we get to see these townspeople at a stage of their lives earlier than we saw them last.The Last Juror is the story of a town as seen through the eyes of a young but maturing newspaperman. When William Traynor moves to Clanton after college to work as a reporter for the local newspaper, he intends to stay only as long as it takes him to gain enough experience to find a real job somewhere else. But when one of the newspaper's owners dies suddenly and the other goes insane, he finds himself the new owner of the struggling weekly. Most of the book is spent seeing important town events--elections, crimes, social events, and a pivotal murder trial--through Willie's eyes.The murder trial turns out to be an important--but not all-important, contrary to what one might expect from the title--element of the story. Danny Padgitt is a member of a legendary local crime family with roots dating back a hundred years. When he is arrested for the murder of a young single mother, the town takes great interest in seeing a Padgitt finally brought to justice for his deeds. When he threatens his jury that if they convict him, \\"I'll get every last one of you,\\" the stage is set for a classic Grisham legal shootout. What actually develops as the book continues, however, is not exactly what one might expect.The book starts out as an interesting hybrid of courtroom drama, a literary style with with Grisham is expertly familiar, and small-town lore. But as the murder trial of Danny Padgitt progresses, it becomes increasingly clear that this is not a legal thriller after all. For one thing, the conflict in the first part of the book is not so much what happens in the courtroom as what happens outside of it. Unlike in A Time to Kill, where an antagonistic judge combined with a pompous district attourney (Rufus Buckley, who also shows up in Juror) comprise the bulk of the book's conflict, the defendant in Juror's trial is so obviously guilty that the courtroom scenes seem designed mainly to get Danny off to jail so the rest of the book can begin. When the trial is over, well shy of the halfway point of the book, readers expecting a thrill ride like The Firm may well be ready for the action to really heat up. What happens instead, however, is that life settles back down again for the residents of Clanton.The flap copy of the book advertises a legal thriller centering on the murder trial and conviction of Danny Padgitt: \\"In Mississippi in 1970, \`life' didn't necessarily mean \`life,' and nine years later Danny Padgitt managed to get himself paroled. He returned to Ford County, and the retribution began.\\" In reality, however, the convicted murderer doesn't get paroled until the last seventy or so pages of the 350-page book. This is most certainly not a thriller about a disgruntled convict out for revenge on the jury who convicted him. Interestingly, it's not really about the life of newspaper owner Willie Traynor, either, though he is the narrator and main protagonist. What this book is about is the town of Clanton. Grisham paints a vivid and reminiscent-feeling portrait of life in a small southern town.Grisham does a masterful job of hitting the highs and lows of the ten-year period in which the story takes place. Interestingly, he barely touches the race issue that plays such a prominent role in A Time to Kill. Probably this works in the book's favor, as the reader is able to enjoy life along with Willie Traynor and not get caught up too much in the more negative political realities of the period.The story breaks down toward the end when the lighthearted tale takes a belated turn toward Grisham's more familiar thriller genre. The thriller has worked well for Grisham over the years, but to throw it almost as an afterthought into an otherwise non-thrilling story seems like a forced departure from his usual natural style. When the climax of this segment of the story turns out to be a nearly play-by-play repeat of key events in A Time to Kill (in the same courthouse, even), the breakdown is complete.By setting this story as a chronological prequel to Kill, Grisham is able to show us things about the characters that we didn't know before. Unfortunately, he misses some golden opportunities. In Kill, we know that Lucien Wilbanks was disbarred; in Juror, rather than telling us how and why this occurred, we are told only that Lucien is facing disbarrment \\"in an unrelated mess.\\" We see little of Harry Rex, one of the story's more colorful characters, that we haven't seen before. The Haley family, who star in Kill, never appears.John Grisham has attained a literary status that affords him opportunities to experiment with different styles; thus books like Bleachers and Skipping Christmas appear on shelves next to The Firm and Street Lawyer. Whereas in the past Grisham has written either to vent on some troubling legal issue (i.e., King of Torts) or simply to show off his impressive knowledge of the legal world, his \\"home-town\\" books show a different side of this author that works well and has connected with readers. But in The Last Juror he tried to combine too many different worlds and ended up with one that works most of the time but leaves the reader feeling slightly conned.While perhaps not up to the standards readers have come to expect from this author, The Last Juror is a refreshing departure from the kind of rut many authors write themselves into. Grishom seems determined not to allow his work to become James Patterson-like in its one-dimensionality. Unfortunately, he tries to bring too many dimensions into play and ends up with a somewhat unstable-feeling product. Unstable or not, though, the book is enjoyable and well worth the relatively few hours it takes to cruise through. Readers will likely not think of The Last Juror as one of Grisham's better books, but my guess is they'll finish feeling like Clanton is one of America's more interesting towns."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"This is his best yet in my opinion."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I was extremely disappointed with the entire book. I forced myself to finish it, hoping it might get better. I found myself skipping entire paragraphs and missing nothing in the process. The characters are all completely forgettable, and so is the story. The end was predictable, and any moron could have guessed why the jurors were being eliminated.Please don't write another book, Mr. Grisham.This was a complete waste of time."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Being a huge Grisham fan, I could not wait to read The Last Juror. That quickly turned to being unable to wait to finish it! The book began great, but quickly changed. It just seemed like it did not know where it was going...so many things, too many things were going on. I'd pass on this one."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"John Grisham's books tend to be easy to read. Unfortunately, his latest books do not live up to &quot;The Firm&quot; or &quot;The Client.&quot; The plot of &quot;The Last Juror&quot; was so simple that it didn't take a rocket scientist to guess what would happen next. That isn't necessarily a bad thing, but this story line left you feeling unsatisified. I compare it to going to a great restaurant and not getting enough to eat. After plowing through 355 pages, you are left with a &quot;is that it?&quot; reaction. The ending wasn't enough to make you feel full when you left the table."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Grisham disappoints the reader in this drab novel. Too many inconsequential characters, which makes the book choppy to read. Granted, a surprize ending, but not enough to propel the novel into a mediocre book."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"This book was a nice narrative but you can clearly see how the marketing folks got a hold of it and tried to sell it as a thriller. It isn't one."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I skipped through most of the book. The book, to me, seemed to drag on too many unnecessary details. I was bored with most of it and just want to get to the plot and the ending."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I don't always love Grisham -- but this book is wonderful. Not all crime story; but a wonderful tale of a small southern town that has been sort of left out of the civil rights movement, and one young reporter who finds friends, a family to love, a mission, and a fortune. It is just great."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I was very disappointed with this book, in that it did not follow his usual genre. I did not read reviews ahead of time or I would not have purchased the book. I am an avid reader of his books and buy them as soon as they are on the market. The jacket of the book was very misleading. I kept waiting for the trial to be over so we could get on with the riveting story of the revenge issue. It never got off the ground. I almost did not finish the book. The redeeming factor in the book is the relationship with the last juror, which was the whole point of the book. It should have been advertised that way on the book jacket."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Will the real John Grisham stand up please! This makes 3 in a row...surely he is on vacation and this is written by someone else. Where is the wonderful detailed stories of the past."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"The first thing that you need to know about this book is that it is not a thriller. The jacket blurb, about a murderer released from prison after threatening to kill the jurors who convicted him, isn't inaccurate as much as it is misleading. For the most part this is a slow-moving book about ten years in the life of a young man who finds himself living in a small Southern town. The murder and trial is almost nothing more than background color, and the jurors don't start dying until 60 pages from the end of the book.In the middle is Grisham's description of small town life, filled with colorful, even bizarre characters, some of which are carryovers from Grisham's first book, A Time To Kill. For example, the book opens with a gun-toting midget serving legal papers on a newspaper editor named Spot, whose sole passion in life is writing obituaries.But colorful characters and detailed setting do not a great novel make; this one unfortunately has no point and very little plot. But I will admit that I liked the midget better than the albino monk hit man in a certain other bestseller this year . . ."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"The plot...Willie has a rich gramma who buys him the local newspaper that he works for, which turns into a cash cow due to a local trial involving the dirty, isolated family. It's a decent novel for Grisham...nothing great, but not bad either. He gets back to his character development in this one, although it gets a little too cliched a little too often. It's worth the read if you need a decent book that doesn't take long to plow through."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"If I could, I would give this book three and a half stars, but I cannot so therefore I'm going to have to go with my heart and give it three. John Grisham is quite an author as far as churning out engaging bits of prose goes, and that's what this book is, entertainment. This doesn't have the characters or catharsis of the Rainmaker, the suspense and adrenaline of The Firm, or the gripping plot of A Time to Kill; the book is pure entertainment, the literary equivalent of a summer movie- it doesn't really go anywhere but it's fun just to enjoy it while it lasts.Typically I have a short plot description in my reveiws, but that's where I am drawing a blank. You see, Grisham found a way to traverse over 300 pages without any real semblance of a plot. This is more a story of 9-years in the life of a particular character, Willie Traynor. The book is told from his perspective, in the first person, but yet it is missing the human element that was present in one of Grisham's previous 1st-person efforts, the Rainmaker. Also missing, for the most part, are the humorous asides that protagonist Rudy Baylor made in that novel. Instead, the reader is privy to a dull monlogue of 9 years in Willie Traynor's life.Fortunately, Willie leads an interesting enough life for me to reccomend the book...he purchases a small-town newspaper in the town of Clanton, Mississipi (which contrary to the advertisements for the novel has been visited since a Time to Kill in &quot;THe Chamber&quot; and &quot;The Summons) and the book revolves around his newspaper, a murder trial in the town, and his relationship with an elderly black woman.Again, there is nothing groundbreaking here, but if you need some quick entertainment, pick it up. It's loads better than &quot;The Summons&quot; or &quot;The Partner&quot;...but if you can, borrow it from a friend or wait for paperback, it's short and not good enough to merit seventeen dollars."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Fans of John Grisham will surely like his newest novel, The Last Juror. It takes place in Ford County, Mississippi, the fictional county John Grisham has so wonderfully created.What was so delightful about this book, was how it portrayed small town America. Mr. Grisham has so vividly detailed Ford County, that after reading this book I felt like I had been there.This book will, of course, please those seeking a legal thriller. It was a quick read, that I had trouble putting down."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"This is not your typical Grisham novel. No powerful villains stalk these pages, and no tangled legal conspiracy reveals itself at the end. Instead unfolds a chronicle of life in a small Mississippi town as seen from the perspective of a once aimless twenty three year named Will Traynor. In the first pages, young Will borrows a little money from his Memphis aunt so he can buy and become the editor of a dying weekly paper, The Ford County Times. His new job leads him into a long and wondeful friendship with the book's title character. She's Calia Ruffin, an insightful, religious black matron who's raised a very unusual crop of kids. For Will it's the beginning of his long overdue &quot;coming of age&quot;. This tale is filled with quirky characters and colorful anecdotes that felt authentic. I kept wanting to tell myself that this kind of material couldn't be made up. No, this novel does not meander. Yes, there is a murder trial and a secret. Would it be a Grisham novel without both? But here, the answers lie not in some insidious plot but instead in characters and flaws of ordinary people. Grisham applies his usual narrative skill but adds the self-deprecating humor I witnessed a one of his lunch speaches. I strongly recomend this novel."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"A fantastic read! Grisham deviates from the &quot;greedy lawyer&quot; genre he helped to popularize (tho the book contains several characters who are attorneys), and he does what he does best- storytelling of the people in the deep South. Woven into the main plot- a murder and trial- is a fully fleshed corps of characters, some likeable and others not, and as the book proceeds, I found myself truly interested in most of them and the outcome of the plot. This is by far his best written novel."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I'm a huge fan of John Grisham and have read all but one of his books. That said, I don't think that The Last Juror was as bad as some of the other customer reviewers have made it out to be. I was actually quite excited at the prospect of another of Grisham's stories set in Clanton, Mississippi, the same town in which the best book he's ever written-A Time to Kill-is set.In The Last Juror, Grisham has done his usual fine job in developing interesting, colorful characters and in describing the town and its environs. It's very evident that he's familiar with the local color and has done a good job of capturing the look and feel of a small southern town from the early 70s struggling with with everything from racial prejudice and desegregation to corruption to the blight created when a national superstore chain comes to town. I also found the plot to be very interesting albeit somewhat derivative: a member of a very powerful but reclusive family is tried for and convicted of the rape and murder of a young widow. In prison, he receives preferential treatment and gains early parole. Shortly after his release some members of the jury that convicted him are killed. The story is told from the point of view of a college dropout who owns and operates the town's weekly newspaper. Parenthetically, I understand that Grisham did not want to title the book as it was but caved in to pressure from his publisher. After reading the book, I now uderstand why-the title is somewhat of a misnomer. There is no LAST juror, so just put this issue aside and enjoy the book.Other reviewers have criticized Grisham's writing in this book and I must concede that on some level they're right. The book is divided into three sections, the first of which is as well written as any of Grisham's earlier work. The writing in the second and third parts, however, seem to suggest that Grisham started losing interest in his subject and was just going through the motions. I can't remember any Grisham novel in recent memory that contained so many short chapters. That's too bad, because this book really started out with some promise. After the first few chapters I was raving to my wife that this might be Grisham's best book yet but by the end I realized it was not to be.Overall, I'd rate the Last Juror as a much better novel than some of his more recent efforts like the Testament and The King of Torts, but not quite as good as The Summons or A Time to Kill. While I that Grisham revisits Clanton in subsequent books, I also hope that he puts a little more effort into those visits. But then again, maybe my expectations were too high."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"John Grisham is back with an engrossing story of 1970's era Clanton, Mississipi. Willie Traynor is the narrator for this novel in which he buys the local newspaper at the young age of 23 and through this position witnesses all the ups and downs of the town for a decade.When a local woman is raped and murdered, Danny Padgitt is put on trial and convicted. Padgitt, related to a family of thieves and crooks, threatens the jury. Padgitt is sentenced to life instead of the death penalty, and is paroled in ten years. You learn this much by reading the summary of the book.Grisham then spends much time bringing the town of Clanton to life while slowly moving the plot along. Traynor befriends an elderly black woman named Callie Ruffin and often hangs out with Harry Rex Vonner. Traynor visits every church in the county and joins the fight in Walmart type stores invading small towns.While Traynor is the narrator of the story, I never got involved much with his character. While he is a reporter, he sees almost everything, he never really does much. I think Grisham intended Traynor to be the eyes through which we view this small town and all its charms. The plot moves along too slowly at times, but when it does pick up at the end, you feel like you know everything there is to know about the town and its people.Grisham is still one of the best out there. This novel is long and somewhat complex (especially when compared to some other efforts like the Summons.) I enjoyed this amusing and entertaining look at small town life and all of its crazy characters. I recommend this Grisham book to anyone."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I bought this book on a Friday afternoon knowing I would be on an airplane and waiting on a connecting flight for several hours that evening. By the time I reached Dallas I had read almost half the book! I finished it in the early morning hours Saturday. The book is so interesting and typical of Mississippi (and Louisiana) politics.The Last Juror covers a ten year span in the life of a young man, just out of college....five years of college without a degree... who buys a small town newspaper with money borrowed from his grandmother. Shortly after his purchase the most horrific murder of a young mother occurred. This book is a chronicle of how small southern towns really are."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"&quot;A Time To Kill&quot; is the best book John Grisham has ever written. &quot;The Last Jury&quot; is nowhere near the gripping, sweating, heart-pounding novel &quot;A Time&quot; was. . . but its pretty darn good. It is so comfortable. I found myself often supressing the urge to smile and then just giving up and going with it. You can visualize every single character. I felt as though I had my feet up on somebody's front porch, drinking iced tea and talking about each neighbor as they walked by. Loved this story!"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I enjoyed this book because it was a great look at a small town in a very trying time. Grisham writes so very well and has a good sense of what it was like in those times not so very long ago. As some of the editorial reviews said, the book tells of a time, it doesn't necessarily fill with actions. One feels like you really got to know the characters. A slightly above average vacation read."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"The Last Juror is a delightful story about Mississippi in the 1970s. The characters are well developed and fascinating. Don't miss it."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"There's a place in John Grisham's heart where he yearns to tell about his South in the way that William Faulkner did. Grisham is no Faulkner, but his Ford County is an entertaining place to revisit for a nine-year story (last seen in A Time to Kill) that provides a picture of rural Mississippi at the end of the Vietnam War. Unlike Grisham's other books with legal-sounding titles, this book isn't primarily about the law and lawyers. Instead, a murder and its consequences stand as bookends to hold this story about changing Mississippi together.The book is filled with more stereotypes than original characters, but the exceptions make the story rise above the average. The two vivid characters who make the book work are \\"Willie\\" Traynor, the young college drop out, who buys the Ford County Times out of bankruptcy and turns it into a vital part of the community. Traynor stands in for us as non-rural Mississippians in understanding what's going on. The most interesting character is \\"Miss\\" Callie Ruffin, mother to a family of professors, who was one of the first African-Americans to register to vote in Ford County.In the background is a continual sense of dread as the local residents live in fear of the lawless Padgitt family which \\"owns\\" the sheriff and the county when the book opens.This book is considerably more delightful if you listen to the unabridged recording read by Michael Beck who is able to turn simple narratives into Southern charm."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I have read most of the Grisham books but in a completely random order. This one is good, set in Mississippi beginning in 1970. It is the story of a young man who becomes the proprietor of a small newspaper, of course he is befriended by lawyers and law enforcement. This is the story of a brutal crime that rocked the county and continued for 9 years.A beautiful young widow is raped and murdered by a younger member of a notorious crime family. The young man is convicted but does not get the chair due to some hold-outs in the jury. When he is released on parole (life imprisonment can be very short), jurors start being murdered. The convicted murderer seems to have good alibies, and Grisham gives us one of his classic surprise endings.The events in the original murder and subsequent juror killings are literary bookends for the life of the newspaper publisher in this small town. He buys the paper out of bankruptcy as a very young man, builds it up over the years, but never gets too far from the murder that built his circulation.There is a lot of fun here also. Grisham knows small towns in Mississippi, and takes us through some of the toughest times of integration. The newspaper business has its moments also, with an unusual focus on obituaries and religious news."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I thought this story of the little Southern town; its small town newspaper owner and its citizens was just a super read. I enjoyed the world of Willie as he became more known by the folks of this Mississippi hamlet. Mr. Crisham did an excellent jobe of developing his character in such a way that I couldn't help but read page after page wondering what adventure he would stumble into. Without hesitation I would recommend this book to all my friends."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Warning: Spoilers (sort of)This isn't Grisham's best work, but I still enjoyed it. I thought he captured small town southern life perfectly and I couldn't help but adore Miss Callie. However, for as much of the book is spent on her life, Callie is not very relevant to the central story. The book's ending is kind of a downer. I was left wanting to know what became of Willie. Did he ever see Ginger again? What happened to the Padgitts (aside from Danny)?"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"This book reminds you of A Time to Kill. Placed in rural Mississippi, and a murder committed. This is some of John's excellent writings. Willie purchases a local newspaper after a bankruptcy, and he decides to spare no details, and write the new like a news publisher should. The story has a lot of twists and unexpected turns. I would like to see a movie made from this book."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"The last Juror is the second book i've read from John Grisham. It takes place in a small town in Mississippi where a big crime is committed and shakes the entire county. Its is set in the 1970s when segregation was still happening. Grisham did a good job incorporating the issue of segregation in the plot. A white man committed a rape and suicide and was sentenced to life in prison but after nine years, was released. Then certain jurors from that trial began getting murdered. Throughout this entire ordeal, Willie, the county's only newspaper editor, covered the trial.What I was confused about was the title. Personally, i don't think it fits with the story. I didn't see the ending coming when Willie, the main character, found out who had been killing the jurors.Overall, i think it's a good novel and i would recommend it to people interested in books that deal with the law."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"While John Grisham's work often pays only trivial attention to things like character development, plot originality, and creating a realistic protagonist with which to work, 'The Last Juror', does all of those things and it does them very, very well.While this work is somewhat disappointing to Grisham fans who have grown accustomed to his work being filled with detailed legal fiction, the lesser scale of it here only works to enhance the overall narrative. Following this small town editor for decades of his own life and seeing the interaction between himself and the townspeople throughout that time shows the world how good John Grisham can be at telling a story.Having read all of Grisham's work prior to this book, I can easily rank it was my favorite from him."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Over John Grisham's writing career, it seems that he occasionally experiments with new writing styles or themes. With \\"The Last Juror\\", Grisham experiments with the style of first-person writing. The book follows Willie Traynor as Willie narrates the time in his life in which he was first an employee of, then later the owner/editor of the Ford County Times in Ford County, Mississippi.This new style, however, does little to affect the quality of the writing. As is normal for a Grisham novel, the story line is very interesting and easy to be drawn into. Also normal are the twists and surprises thrown in now and then. The story contains a very action-packed trial which, although not covered in great detail, is still rather entertaining with a reasonable amount of legal wrangling described.As a whole, \\"The Last Juror\\" is simply another Grisham novel with a few new characteristics thrown in to make it fresh and exciting. It is old Grisham and yet new grisham at the same time. I enjoyed reading this book, and definitely recommend it, as well as Grisham's other novels. Read and enjoy."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Haven't finished reading it yet, savoring every moment.Haven't read a book by John Grisham yet that I didn't like."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I didn't connect with any of the characters like I normally do in a Grisham book. I am a big fan of his and let's be upfront here, I feel he is one of the best writers around. The book centers around a young newspaper editor in Clanton, Mississippi during the 1970's. Rather than a murder mystery or a legal suspense book, it is a story about a small southern town dealing with the issues of the day, including Vietnam and desegregation. The murder and trial are only a very small part of the actual plot. Don't expect to have a big surprise at the end. It wasn't a bad book for me but it wasn't the legal thriller I was looking for either."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I like literature but I have a soft spot for John Grisham. I am sure Grisham would be the first to agree that he is not a literary writer by any stretch of the imagination. His fiction belongs on the same shelf as Isaac Asimov's. His novels are easy, entertaining reads and Grisham writes good plain unadorned prose. His simplistic characters have always disappointed me, but his genius at presenting, explaining, and resolving moral situations more than make up for them. His stories offer good life lessons and maybe two dimensional characters would get in the way of that.But I wonder if Grisham knows what it's like to suffer with indecision. He knows about the pain of loss and about feeling physical fear, but angst is an important human dimension that Grisham characters never display. In this book, the only troubled character appears only a few times, and while Grisham sympathizes with him, he also labels him schizophrenic; he wonders what kind of hell this man must be living in but he avoids exploring that hell at all. What I mean is that _all_ of Grisham's characters are like Aragorn or Saruman (from the Lord of the Rings books) with no one like Frodo or Gollum. They are all representation of a perfectly representative ideal, they are characters who know who and what they are. No one ever questions himself.But fiction needs tension and Grisham fails to provide it here. There is a little bit of tension from the plot, but the book resolves itself with very few surprises. Grisham usually provides tension by presenting us with several moral dilemmas, with satisfying resolutions that teach us something about the nature of right and wrong. Here, there's none of that: the good guys are good and do good things, the bad guys are bad and do bad things.Nevertheless, it's a fun read. Willie Traynor is a young student living in 1970 off his grandmother's good graces. When she tells him to get a job, he stumbles into Clanton, Ford County, Mississippi and soon buys the decrepit local paper. He turns it around, writes most of it himself, befriends the matriarch of a prosperous black family, Miss Callie. And that's what the book is about. It's a picture of a friendship, about a sweet old lady cooking every Thursday for a nice young man who gets her story out.There is a murder plot, there are a few legal twists, but in the end it's a human interest novel. There's nothing wrong with that but it's missing what I like best about Grisham.Vincent Poirier, Nassau, The Bahamas"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I have enjoyed all the Grisham books I have read except Skipping Christmas.

The Last Juror might not be as much a thriller as it is an insightful story about the deep south - Mississippi during the late 1970's. The characters are as colorful as the characters in the book. The main character, Willie Traynor is not a good ol' boy and not from Clanton in Ford Country, Miss, but he is the 23 yr old who bought the town's only newspaper. In a short time he and Callie Ruffin, a wise and strong black woman with several grown children, become best friends. A beautifully written and touching story with a murder, convict (Danny Padgitt, a young man of the area's mean and controlling Padgitt crime family) and some very funny town characters as believable as the story itself.

If you ever want to know about John Grisham's point of view on Southern living, this book will give you a good insight. There are such prejudice regarding South in this county where legalizing gay marriage and use of marijuana for an entertainment purposes is deemed as an indication of progress while emphasis on math and science education is long forgotten. If you are one of those people who think Southerners are a bunch of ignorant backward idiots trapped in time machine, do yourself a favor and stay away from this book. In this book, John Grisham talks about segregations and discriminations that was so unjustly forced upon Black people in South and how some of them still fought hard to accomplish unthinkable success. He talks about a young white man who bravely stood against racial discrimination and legal advantage given to rich folks. He talks about good Southern food, family, courage, good neighbors and struggles and victories of good vs. evil, all things that are slammed and ridiculed by sophisticated media.

Although this book did not have the same thrilling-suspense like some of his other books, it still maintained the Grisham cliche courtroom drama we've grown to love. But what it also adds is his amazing descriptive ability to actually bring the reader inside the book and make them feel like they are a citizen of the town standing right behind the main character, watching every move he makes. You want the book to move on, you don't care if anything exciting happens, you jsut want to know what's going to happen tomorrow in Clanton. This book was beautifully written and deserves no less than 3 stars on ANY review."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I have read many John Grisham books and although this was not my favorite, it did not disappoint. It did not have the same suspense as The Firm (another Grisham book), but it was a good book. The beginning stars out slow, but gradually picks up its pace. Shortly you will notice your attention being shifted from the main story line to a subplot about a woman with outstanding children. You may forget almost completely about main story until they are intertwined. Overall this is good book, but not the best Grisham out there."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Not exactly what I'm used to from a Grisham novel, but a decent story nonetheless. Tale is set in Clanton, Mississippi, where a young man with his rich aunt as a benefactor is able to purchase the town's only newspaper, the Times. Circulation is decent at best, until a spectactular murder occurs with a member of the town's most notorious crime family (the Padgitts) as the prime suspect. In a world where justice is for sale and judges are for hire, a jury of 12 of the suspect's peers find him guilty of rape and murder, and sentence him to life--which by Mississippi standards is never any longer than 10 years.Over the course of the incarceration, Willie Traynor, main character and owner of the times, manages to create a very successful newspaper while writing at times various human interest stories. One story in particular is about one of Clanton's &quot;colored&quot; families; Callie and Esau Ruffin, who reared 8 children, 7 of whom went on despite all of the prejudice to get their doctorate degrees. During the process of writing the story Willie develops a bond with Callie....who also just happens to be one of the twelve jurors who convicted Danny Padgitt of murder. Willie is also busy keeping tabs on Danny, and his parole bids....especially since Danny threatened the lives of the jurors if they ever found him guilty.....Again, a little slow at first. I think Grisham would have been better served to concentrate more on Padgitt, his incarceration, and the like rather than the friendship/small town happenings aspect of the story. Is Grisham getting soft in his old age??Not bad, but if you want fast, this is not the one to read.DYB"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"John Grisham continues to expand his writing, from courts and trials and litigation, to a home in the Delta and the family who lives there and whose survival depends on the crops and the workers they can hire to bring them in. Then he writes of sports and a team and what it is like to be a kid playing what is supposed to be a game: a game that becomes the game of life. Now, Grisham ventures into an arena that encompasses his love of the law and his comprehension of real life. As I read The Last Juror, I saw how brilliantly the author wove a tapesty of life in the South, using the thread of the trial to hold the fabric together. I found it beautiful and I hope everyone who reads it appreciates the story within the story and can understand life in the South, even as it exists today."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Enjoyed reading this book. The best book I've read in awhile and the best Grisham book I'v read in a LONG while. Very interesting with the political and cultural views of the 60's and 70's."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"It's been awhile since I read a John Grisham novel because I'm not a big fan of contemporary writing. However, after reading the dust cover of The Last Juror, I was hooked. I braced myself for a thriller reminscent of A Time to Kill (after all both books were set in the same small Mississippi town). I was sorely disappointed. Grisham tosses in almost everything but the kitchen sink in this novel as he waxes poetic on small town life in Mississippi, the evils of Wal-Mart, and the wonders of Southern cooking. This is a great sentimental novel but as a thriller it lacks punch."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"While I always love John Grisham's style, I think The Last Juror contains one of his better plots. The characters and setting of Floyd County, Mississippi in the 1970's are both fascinating and real. More goes on in this small town than you would expect: murder, bribery, conspiracy, segregation, and real desegregation. The race issues are realistic and intricately described but the main story, that of the town's attempts to bring to justice a killer protected by his powerful family, is never overshadowed."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I haven't read ALL of Grisham's work. I read The Firm, Pelican Brief, and a Time to Kill when they first came out. My favorite of the three was a Time to Kill. I don't remember it in detail now. I just remember it being a slower pace read than the Firm. I liked it because you had time to get involved with the characters and it described race relations which I found interesting. Don't get me wrong, I loved the Firm too, but it was all action. In between reading those first stories and this book, I have read a few other Grisham novels. I thought Runaway Jury was intersting. Some of the other novels didn't do much for me. Anyhow, this book isn't as good as a Time to Kill, but I feel it has some of the same elements: slow pace and race relations. The main character isn't someone you love or hate...he is really just there to describe events and some of the interesting personalities that are around in the south in the '70's. For those who enjoyed a Time to Kill a lot, then you will enjoy this one, just not as much. For those who REALLY liked the Firm and didn't enjoy a Time to Kill so much, then you probably won't love this book."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Both Bleachers and The Last Juror show a more matured writer and I for one think it is grand. While I love his page-turners, I also love the way he can now tell a beautiful story filled with the lives of characters that matter."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I have always been a fan of John Grisham's writing, defending him in the face of my intellectual friends who consider him to be formulaic and predictable. My response has always been, &quot;Who cares, as long as he keeps writing books with such scintillating plots and characters?&quot;But this latest offering is a bitter disappointment. The pace is plodding and never amounts to anything: no suspense, no drama, not even an interesting string of events. The characters are nothing but cardboard cut-outs. The book reads like a boring photo album, with quick descriptions penned on the back of each picture. The most telling sign is the utter lack of emotional depth, especially when this book is apparently supposed to be a heartwarming tribute to Grisham's somewhat idealized memories of the Deep South.I kept reading this book until the bitter end, convinced that Grisham was going to turn things around. He doesn't. Skip this turkey and save yourself the time and aggravation."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Yes - this book does deviate from the standard JG formula. Rather than being told from the viewpoint of yet another lawyer or judge, it is told from someone completely outside of the legal profession. It gave the story a fresh perspective.More importantly, JG has actually managed to write a character that I did not hate. He has a gift for writing characters that are totally unlikeable, yet tries to put them in the hero role where you are supposed to be rooting for them. See The Partner or The Summons for example. However, The Last Juror brought out a main character who grew and learned as time marched forward. It was nice to see that JG realizes that a main character can develop. I cannot express how important this is to me in a novel - most of his other books I finished and thought \\"Well, that was a waste of time\\". It is so hard to care about a story if you don't care about the people in it. Not the case with The Last Juror.The ending was a little weak. It was easy to spot coming. It may not have been as thrilling as the typical JG novel, but it was entertaining. All in all, you don't read a Grisham novel to be intellectually stimulated. You read it to be entertained on the beach, an airplane, or on a rainy day. In this context, the book fulfills its purpose better than any previous effort by the author."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I have read ALL of Grisham's works -- even before he was well known. I have never read anything of Grisham that I disliked. As a result, I decided to read THE LAST JUROR while being subjected to rehabilitation therapy for my injured back. I was experiencing a great deal of physical pain but Grisham's novel was able to draw my attention away from my personal problems. It moved my mind from my location at the physical therapy center and had me travel to Ford County, Mississippi. Mind movement is the highest praise I can offer to a piece of fiction.Grisham's novel came alive for me because his portrayal of Ford County Mississippi is similar to the small southern community where I live. The characters were lifelike and came alive. More importantly, many of them were quite similar to some quirky characters that I see in my everyday life. I think anyone living in a small southern town would enjoy this novel.Immediately following the publication of THE KING OF TORTS, Grisham was interviewed on National Public Radio. Here, I learned that his wife was encouraging him to move his basic storyline away from the concept of redemption. I was saddened when I heard this because I thought this element was a refreshing characteristic for contemporary novels. When THE LAST JUROR arrived at my door, I immediately wondered if Grisham removed his redemption insight. I see the redemption theme in this novel but not with the great intensity of his past work. At any rate, THE LAST JUROR is worth reading."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I have read all of John Grisham's books. I especially liked this one. It is different from his other books about the law and very different from &quot; A Time to Kill&quot;. The story is about a law case, but not about the murderer or the bloodsucking lawyers- it is about the people in the town of Clanton. The story takes place in Mississippi in Ford county the same setting for &quot;A Time to Kill&quot;. We get in depth into the lives of the characters and get a front row seat to life in this small town. The history of the town and the people in it is presented extensively and is rich with home- cooking, front porch conversations, family, friendships and small town politics. Anyone who has grown up in a small town will appreciate the atmosphere of this book. The people are believable and is typical of Grisham there is a twist in the plot and the ending is not as you would suspect. It is a wonderful read, full of action, mystery and wonderful people. I shared their emotions as I read this book and was sad to see it end. A wonderful read."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"If you are looking for a typical Grisham page turner, this one is not for you. If, however, you would enjoy a liesurely paced look at the adventures of a young, liberal journalist in small town 1970's Mississippi, you will enjoy this a lot. It is a good story that, unlike many Grisham books, reaches a well thought out conclusion. It is &quot;A Painted House&quot; with lawyers."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Unlike most of Grisham's earlier works, like The Firm and The Pelican Brief, this book does not revolve around a life-or-death search for the truth behind a major conspiracy. This book is a slow, leisurely-paced tome that traces the history of a small-town in Mississippi as told through the eyes of the 'Yankee' who takes over the local weekly newspaper.Yes, there is a murder, but there's no mystery. The murderer is sentenced to jail, and when he's released new murders occur. Most experienced readers will already know who the guilty party is, so the joy of the book must be taken from the old-fashioned story-telling rather than from solving a mystery.I enjoyed this book, but won't be recommending it to people who enjoy brainless thrillers."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I've read every one of Grisham's books, the last ten or so immediately upon release. I've never felt cheated, always entertained. I read negative reviews from people who don't seem to have a clue what they want from the guy. He writes excellent books that are great stories and entertaining to read. If you want classic English literature, go take a course at your local community college. If you want a guaranteed good book (which usually turns into a good movie), then keep reading Grisham, he's as good at what he does as any living author. I also think he doesn't get enough credit for stepping out (successfully) of his genre (Bleachers, A Painted House, etc.), which almost no other popular author ever does. Keep cranking them out John, there's lots of us out here who love your work."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"This is a much watered down Clanton adventure. I really enjoyed the characters of Willie Traynor and Miss Callie, and this was really more a story of their relationship than anything. The Padgit fiasco was definately interesting, but the ending is less than spectacular. A good book by Grisham, though definately not his best."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"The Last Juror is one of the most intense of John Grisham's works. It keeps you riveted every step of the way. I couldn't tear my eyes from the pages for more than a second! This book is expertly written and meticulous in its genius. John Grisham shows off his definitive writing style with every turn of the page. He keeps you wondering and wows you with a final twist that is sure to please."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I found this to be another of John Grisham's interesting easy to read books.With the help of a rich relative, Willie Traynor buys the paper where he is employed in Clanton, Mississippi. From there he observes and participates in the story surrounding a rape-murder and its aftermath. This is another story of good versus bad. The Padgitt family living on a small island near Clanton represent the bad. Their activities over the years included stealing, counterfeiting, moonshining and gunrunning. They have pretty much \\"owned\\" the county sheriff for a number of years and have been left free to pursue their own activities. Danny Padgitt is charged with rape-murder as the victim has accused him by name just before her death. He is tried and convicted in Clanton. He leaves the courtroom with a threat to the convicting jury. The good is represented by the Ruffin family. This is a colored family living \\"across the tracks\\" so to speak, in a part of Clanton called Lowtown. The mother, Callie, was a member of the Danny Padgitt jury. The Ruffins had seven children and six of them had earned a PhD. Willie Traynor spends considerable time with Callie and her family and often enjoys her sumptuous southern cooking.After a few years in the state prison Danny Padgitt is released and jurors begin to meet untimely deaths.Through Willie Traynor the author weighs in with opinions on a number of social/moral issues. These include segregation in Mississippi, prohibition, and the impact of powerful discount stores on businesses of small towns."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"This book is not primarily about the law, as the title would suggest. Rather it traces the story of a small town newspaper publisher in the deep south in the 1970's. It gracefully covers a variety of sujects including the influence of the church in small towns, race relations, the legal system, Vietnam, Southern food and drink. It repeats and, on occassion repudiates, various stereotypes--from crooked local sheriffs (true) to illiterate minorities (untrue). It is truly a pleasant read, and it fits together on a par with Grisham's best books. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Looking to kill a few hours poolside I was hoping for a 'typical' Grisham courtroom thriller and picked this up. I must say that the hours at poolside did pass eventually and without fatalities, but I was disappointed in this novel. It's not his very worst, but it's certainly not up to the level of storytelling which made John Grisham's early books so tense.The plot has been summarized by so many other reviewers there is no point in rehashing it here; suffice to say that yes, there are courtroom scenes, but they and any legal wrangling behind the trial do not form in any way the central part of the book. A crime is committed, the culprit identified, tried and sentenced, and then the second half of the book gets started.This is too bad because the story Grisham really wants to tell, about small-town life in Mississippi cast against a background where the Vietnam, Civil Rights, race relations and school integration struggles are all raging, drags and meanders for substantial parts of the book, and the central character (the narrator) comes across as a little bit overly correct.Several of the secondary small-town characters are well-drawn and Grisham does bring out the atmosphere well. But he uses them all ultimately to tell the story first of a young and somewhat callow man who grows into a more mature human being (which is fine if much better done by countless other writers), and second of a woman, the juror of the title, who is so earnestly and reverently portrayed that the Virgin Mary, Mother Teresa, and Gandhi would frankly be jealous of the treatment. Grisham's point is perfectly clear, absolutely hammer on the head clear, but it would be made far more effectively if the characters were a bit more believeable. The crimes and legal action in the book wind up just being the device by which Grisham presents these two main characters, and frankly the payoff just isn't worth the effort."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"The Last JurorJohn GrishamThe Last Juror is a fun read if somewhat tedious at times. The supposed plot is a man convicted of rape and murder threatens the jury. After ten years in prison the man is paroled and jurors begin to die. At least that is what the book jacket says. In reality it is a first person narrative about a young liberal who buys a defunct newspaper in a small southern community. Like many of Grisham's \\"hero's he is the perfect little liberal. He is against the war (Vietnam in this one), he hates the dollar store, and above all he has to do everything possible to help the black community. While some may find these qualities admirable, after a while they can get a little old.In this town the only intelligent people are our liberal hero and a middle aged African-American woman. In fact the crime and the surrounding story is only a sub-plot for these two characters to walk around in. One gets the impression that it all gets in the way. Not to give away to much of the ending, but the title of the book makes no sense. At the end, more than one juror is left.If you are interested in a fast pace crime novel, then pass this by. If you are interested in a young liberal's view of experiences that young liberals would like to have, then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"If you are a John Grisham fan and have read most of his other novels you will find this one on the average. I have read them all and am a huge fan of his. This book is not a legal thriller like a lot of his others. The title of this book may be a little misleading to some people who are looking for a legal thriller. Very little of this book takes place in the courtroom. It is a simple book about life in the small town of Clanton, Mississippi and the events that take place during a nine year span in which a young college graduate named Willie Traynor owns the local newspaper.This would be a great book to read while on vacation or just want to relax with a simple and easy to read novel. It has a very simple plot with just a few characters.Throughout this book I was kind of reminded of A TIME TO KILL, Grisham's first novel. This is a good book but not THAT good, but it did have some of that southern racial theme to it.I found that my favorite part of this book was Grisham's sly sense of humor. There were a couple of times I laughed out loud at his writing. I think sometimes Grisham wants us to take a step back and realize how stupid we are for taking some things in life so seriously. And of course I liked the little twist at the end.I do have to be honest and say that I felt some parts of the book kind of lulled a bit. It is certainly not as good as his early books, but those will always be hard to beat. Overall it is definitley a four star book and in my opinion worth the time spent reading it."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"While John Grisham has achieved most of his success with his legal thrillers, he has also tried his hand at more contemplative and literary works (A Painted House) with reasonably good results. \\"The Last Juror\\" sees Grisham forge in a new direction, by creating a blend of both these two styles. But does it work? The first part of the book focuses on what we know Grisham is good at: the legal thriller, with action revolving around the courtroom. In typical Grisham style, this is what is served up in Part 1, and returns in Part 3. It's what we expect from Grisham, and will undoubtedly please the fans looking for the usual Grisham fare.However in the second part of the book, Grisham switches gears and takes a leisurely and slower-paced excursion in which he treats more serious issues such as the relation between whites and blacks, and the role and function of the church. Much of this is addressed through the eyes of the young newspaperman William Traynor, by giving close attention to the character of Miss Callie Ruffin, an elderly black woman and mother of eight. Miss Callie is one of the jurors alluded to in the title, who served nine years earlier in the trial of Danny Padgitt, a member of the criminal clan of Padgitts inhabiting Padgitt Island. The sensational trial resulted in Danny's conviction for the rape and murder of widow Rhoda Kasselaw. But now that Danny has served his time in prison and returned to civilization, one by one the jurors that were involved in case are killed.This deadly action at the close of the novel is exciting, and is probably what the average Grisham fan is looking for. But it has to be admitted that it only takes place in the last 20% of the book (Part 3), and it takes a significant amount of time to get this point. Quite frankly, I didn't find the extended diversion in Part 2 sufficiently gripping or interesting, at least, not after the more suspenseful appetizer dished up in Part 1. Certainly Traynor's relationship with Miss Callie is touching at times, and Grisham seems to be experimenting with the more literary style of A Painted House by incorporating a more personal touch and developing well-rounded characters in this portion of the novel. But in the end, this doesn't seem to fit with the legal thriller that the rest of the book wants to be.The title is also raises some intriguing questions. Although Miss Callie's character is important, it's not quite clear to me why the book should be named after her. Moreover, the title itself is somewhat misleading, perhaps deliberately so, in order to create wrong expectations in the mind of the reader, because it implies that Miss Callie will be the last juror to be killed, whereas in fact it simply denotes that she was the last juror chosen at the time of the trial.Ultimately, Grisham's blend of styles doesn't seem to work: The Last Juror appears to be two stories in one, one a legal thriller and the other a more heart-warming literary tale, and both threads don't really don't come together properly. Grisham has proven himself reasonably skilled in both styles, but on this occasion the oil of legal thrillers and the water of literary novels just don't mix well. While I admire Grisham for being prepared to try something different, and acknowledge that this will perhaps give some measure of satisfaction to those who enjoyed the more literary style we first saw in A Painted House, the reality is that \\"The Last Juror\\" will probably disappoint many Grisham fans. Don't read The last Juror looking for a pageturning thriller from beginning to end, but if you have any appreciation for the more laid-back charm of A Painted House, you'll also find something to like here too. - GODLY GADFLY"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I like John Grisham, but I think his more recent novels have been lacking in the storyline department. THE LAST JUROR is a typical example.This book is a fairly decent coming-of-age novel about a young journalist growing up in a deep southern town in Mississippi. Unfortunately, there is not much of a plot that holds the events of THE LAST JUROR together. Instead, we get a rather rambling, slow-moving narrative that takes place over a ten-year period, with a generous dollop of Grisham's political views on Vietnam, Wal-Mart, religion, and a couple of other hot-button issues.THE LAST JUROR is not a suspense novel or a thriller (despite being marketed as one). The plot described on the dust jacket of this novel doesn't really get started until maybe the last 80 pages or so. The whole revenge plot feels tacked on and phony. The ending is anti-climactic, to say the least.I think Grisham is an entertaining writer, and his description of life in a small Southern town in the 1970s is actually very interesting in spots. There are some scenes in this novel that are quite charming and enjoyable. But, in the end, it doesn't add up to a good suspense novel, and that's what I thought I paid money for.If you're looking for a good thiller, my advice is to try Grisham's earlier work, or the books of Greg Isles instead."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Upon getting the reading assignment in class that I had to read this book I was immediately upset. I thought that the book would be something that was not interesting and boring, but as I read the book I couldn't put it down. As I turned the pages and the story progressed I became involved. I was apart of the book and I felt the emotions that each character was feeling. Surprisingly the book was a hit, it wasn't something that I would normally read, but now that I have read the book I would recommend this book to anyone who asked what a good book to read was."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I was expecting a more intense courtroom drama and mystery. While that was there to some degree, it is more a story of a small Mississippi town, and a crime and punishment that plays out over many years. I was not, however, disappointed.

Interesting and well-developed characters."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I love Grisham. I've read every one of his legal novels. I'm not sure what this was. Of course, he always writes well. But this was a meandering discourse on life in the old south as it meets the New South. The crime and trial were a mechanism to muse on the old south and its colorful characters and folkways. OK if that's what you want. Great descriptions of southern cooking and answers the question as to why there is more obesity in the south."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I usually enjoy Grisham's books and even tolerate his political views but this book was dreadfully boring.

I like how the story moved and the details were revealed.He developed good characters-Callie was my favorite and I wish I knew someone who cooks the way he wrote it."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"How did I not realize this book was coming out? Thank heaven for the Kroger display as I dashed in for milk and juice Sunday night!I read John Royal's positive review in &quot;The Houston Chronicle&quot; and went to reading. And I did love the reading. But this is not Grisham's best book EVER. This is a good read, comforting as the meals protagonist Willie Traynor laps up on Miss Callie's porch in Clanton, Mississippi's Lowtown. And the suspense of a murder trial in 1970's Clanton, the town of Grisham's first dynamite novel, &quot;A Time to Kill&quot;, does give it a great tone.Best of all it is a story of the little Southern town and its citizens as presented by the small town newspaper owner, a &quot;northerner from Memphis and Syracuse University&quot;. And it is the best of worlds for Willie as he develops a style and a presence as a very important cog, though an outsider, in the wheel of progress that has come to Clanton during his journalist's career. He takes on the persona of a real character as he accepts a gentleman's attire complete with bow tie not unlike Tom Wolfe or Willie Morris, real writers/journalists of our times, who one can picture as inhabiting a Clanton and breaking into the industry in just such a way as fictional Willie Traynor.His cohorts and co-workers are colorful and familiar. And though a modern times tale, there is the feel of the town of &quot;To Kill A Mockingbird&quot; with Harper Lee's characters placed into more modern days. The evil folks still terrorize others, but the good folks stand for truth and justice.I was amazed at the overt bravery of Willie Traynor. I guess one has to credit it to youth and testosterone and the guidance of a skillful veteran writer who drives his main character into difficult situations.I was moved to tears near the end, and found that Grisham is still able to connect to my emotions. I recommend this book for a good winter read. Grisham has produced another tome that is worthy of the good folks of the South."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Probably the best part of \\"The Last Juror\\" is the author's capture of life in the deep South in 1970: its slowness, the bypassing of modernity, the overindulgence in good bourbon to get through the day, the corrupt political system, the influence of powerful families, the racial divide, etc. But this placid way of life is harshly disrupted when a son, Danny, of the powerful, insulated crime family, the Padgitt's, that has dominated rural Ford county for decades, is accused of rape and murder. It is also the opportunity for the newly arrived Willie Traynor, fresh from dropping out of an \\"Ivy League\\"college after five uninspiring years and the surprising new owner (even to him) via his kindly grandmother of the county newspaper in serious decline, to make something of himself.The Ford County Times dramatically increases circulation as it follows the Padgitt affair. The author follows Willie and his ad hoc assemblage of employees and his dealings with courthouse hanger-ons. By far the most interesting part of the book beyond the murder and its fallout is the relationship that Willie developes with the Ruffin family of the Lowdown section of town, especially with the matriarch, Miss Callie. Willie draws strength from the resolve of that family in overcoming the racial barriers of the South in those times.The last chapter of the Padgitt affair begins with the release of Danny after only serving nine years of a life sentence. Everyone's worst fears are realized when a series of what seems to be revenge murders begins. The author brings the threads of Willie's newspaper ownership, the Ruffin family, and the Padgitt situation to an agreeable conclusion."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I have read all of John Grisham's books to date and he is certainly one of my favorite authors, however, for a while there he was scaring me.

I recommend this book as a good read"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Of the 3 Grisham novels i have read, this one seems totally out of Sync. Theres no fast paced city law firms but instead the slow relaxing pace of Deep South. Although the pace of the book will make it difficult for many readers to read \\"just one more chapter\\" before bed, the book still has its place.The deep and detailed characterisation allowed me to bond with the William and those he was closest to, which unwittingly had me rooting for a happy ending. Grisham, details every facet of being part of a small community so that by the time the ending comes the reader feels like they are part of it.The book starts from an outsiders point of view and over each page i became engrossed in the simple lives of those involved in the towns small drama's, and was able to see things through the eyes of William as he tries to blend in.An interesting read, with a bitter sweet conclusion!"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"This book is as well written as any other by John Grisham that I've read. I really enjoyed seeing familiar characters from A Time to Kill come back up with a little background to them. Highly recommend."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Good read. Little slow throughout, but an interesting story. Great description of locale. I would recommend this book to readers who enjoy historical novels."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Interesting and reasonably accurate picture of the climate, fears, hopes, and changes of the radically different '60's and 70's.Engaing, fast-paced and truely interesting depiction of a mythical small town in that era.Nice!"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I think this latest Grisham offering is very well developed. I like his characters, the southern setting, and in general find it to be worthy of his name.Raymond AustinTelevision director of The Saint, The Avengers, Hawaii Five-O, Hart to Hart, Vegas, Quincy, Magnum, P.I., AirWolf, Spencer: For Hire, JAG and many others.And the author of, \\"The Eagle Heist\\" and \\"Dead Again\\" from the Beauford Sloan Mystery series."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Well written and inspiring, like Jackson McCrae's THE BARK OF THE DOGWOOD, and yet having elements of Grisham's KING OF TORTS or even A PAINTED HOUSE (if you can believe that-think setting, not plot) I found this to be a truly enjoyable book. Perhaps this was because I understood that Grisham was creating a hybrid work in a sense; combining elements and style from his other books. The guy has written volumes and it's only natural that the would want to branch out and create something new out of his ideas. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good literary read."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I was hoping for another sleepless night poring over the pages of my latest purchase - alas, I just knew from the title title that JG was back in the saddle and about to hand us another heart-stopping,suspense-filled saga. NOT SO...(although my review of the book is delayed, I did buy it on the release date).I enjoyed the lead characters way of gradually &quot;finding his space&quot; among the &quot;regulars&quot;, but the storyline was VERY predictable.I won't tell (I hate when people spoil the ending!!!) who the killer is, but JG gave a hint of some of the vintage Grisham stuff to which we've grown accustomed. Read this book or watch American Idol, both will probably conjure up the same emotions."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"This book is well worth reading. After initially reading the leaf, one would expect a can't-put-it-down thriller such as &quot;A Time to Kill&quot; or the &quot;Pelican Brief&quot;. I think it reads closer to &quot;Painted House&quot; because it does more to tell a tale of small town day to day life in rural Mississippi then a story revenged filled killer. A nice twist at the end helps spice up the story line."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I am not going to summarize the book, that has been done enough, I don't normally do that in my reviews.......anyway, I really enjoyed this book. I was surprised at all the mixed reviews I read on Amazon as well as some papers and magazines. I thought this was one of Mr. Grisham's best. I have to admit, for you skeptics out there, I have always been a fan of Mr. Grisham's, but I have felt his last few books have not lived up to my expectations. I think this one is WONDERFUL. I think Mr. Grisham is just a great storyteller, and this was one great story. The charcters were believable and interesting, and the story itself grabbed my interest and would not let go. I for one am thrilled to have a Grisham book that rates up there with A Time to Kill, The Firm,and Pelican Brief. This book will join my stack of Grisham's that I like to reread, just for the enjoyment of a good story."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I have always considered A Time to Kill Grisham's best - right up there with In cold Blood or like classics. This book had the same in depth Characters. The ending was a wonderful twist. I would highly reccomend this read."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"First of all, let me state the obvious, so that any potential reader of this novel will have a good chance of grasping what he is (or is not) dealing with: The Last Juror, John Grisham's latest legal novel, is very good, but it's not like The Firm. This point is so important that at the risk of insulting your intelligence, I'm going to say it again: THE LAST JUROR IS VERY GOOD, BUT IT'S NOT THE FIRM!!! Most fans of Grisham love what I'm going to call &quot;the Grisham formula&quot;: taut, edgy, plot; vividly drawn, but memorable characters; a fantasy situation guaranteed to keep them on the edge of their seats, fabulous, mouthwatering scenes of fattening Southern-style feasts (very much in the manner of James Bond author Ian Fleming), somewhat leftist politics, and finally, the young and (usually) male leading character sailing off into the sunset (usually the Carribean) with fistfuls of cash and plenty of time on his hands. So what's different about The Last Juror? The hero, 23-year old aspiring journalist-turned newspaper-owner Willie Traylor, who borrows money from his wealthy grandmother to buy The Ford County Times and save it from bankuptcy? Nope. The fascinating, larger than life characters, like something from the Italian Commedia D'ell Arte stock shows? Nope. The last juror herself, Calia Ruffin, the imposing, yet soft-hearted matriarch of Clanton's most successful black family, is one of the most luminous characters Grisham has ever created, and the southern soul feasts she prepares are certainly juicy enough to set any reader's mouth watering. The chance for the hero to make lots of money? Nope, this happens as well, as Traynor makes the Times a phenomenal success, enough to entertain a very lucrative buyout offer. The politics? Not there either, as Grisham takes a very thinly-veiled (and VERY dated) jab at the Wal Mart chain, and opposes the war in Vietnam. No, it seems the primary reason that many fans of &quot;The Formula&quot; will feel cheated by the Last Juror is the fact that the (mostly) excellent plot is hurredly jammed into about 100 or so of the books 350+ pages. Danny Padgett, scion of a very corrupt local family, brutally rapes and murders a young single mother, is sentenced to life in prison instead of receiving the death penalty, vows revenge on all the jurors, and is parolled after just serving ten years. However, the majority of the book does not concern the plot, but instead focuses on the character of Willie Traynor and how he grows from a wet-behind-the-ears college kid into a responsible adult. Thus, the story of this book has more in common with the relaxed tone of Bleachers or perhaps A Painted House rather than the edgy, frenetic pace of The Firm or A Time To Kill (which was also set in Clanton). Grisham is still growing and improving as a writer as he ages, therefore he simply cannot write the exact same type of books as he wrote fifteen years ago; there are important, mature changes in pace and time, and for the most part, the changes work, particularly in the scenes involving Miss Callie and her lovely brood of children-turned-college professors. The scenes with lawyer Harry Rex are also excellent for comic relief and Willie's goal of visiting every church in town provides a wonderfully unexpected subplot. Still, for such a relaxed pace, the ending feels very rushed and the reader almost feels cheated out of a proper denoument; Grisham could have taken another dozen or so pages and made a much smoother ending, this one feels as if it were written on deadline. (For that matter, a personal gripe: Where, oh where, is The Grisham Female, that delicious blend of sass, smarts, and sophistication notably absent from the last few novels. Think Darby Shaw, Ellen Roark, or Gabrielle from The Runaway Jury, and you get the idea. Ginger, the female love intrest in this book, appears in a mere dozen pages.) Still, the resolute, compassionate character of Miss Callie is worth the price of the book alone; this black-white, mother-son-like relationship will warm your heart and the plot, though rushed, does end in a nice twist. Get The Last Juror, for while it's not A Time To Kill, or even The Rainmaker, it's delights are very real and certainly firm enough for many readers, even if the plot seems a bit too flimsy for devotees of the famous &quot;Grisham Formula&quot;."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"When I picked up the book, I was expecting a legal thriller like so many of Grisham's previous books. This is not a legal thriller. Actually the main focus on this story isn't about the trial but about the main character's friendship with one of the jurors. It's not a bad book...but if you were looking for a legal thriller...this wasn't it. Wait for paperback if you really feel like buying the book."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Grisham is back and in top form. I really enjoyed this book--its a quick, interesting read. Like most Grisham novels, The Last Juror is set in the south. But unlink most other Grisham novels, this isn't in the viewpoint of a lawyer, judge or client--despite the title. The view from the editor/jouralist looking at a grisley rape/murder over many years is unique.The one criticism I have is some of the plot twists (away from the rape/murder case which is the focus of the book) you could see a mile a way. Grisham is at his best when dealing with crime and the law. Not so much with everyday human life and relationships."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I have read all of John Grishams book and find they are all similar yet differentIn the Last Juror, Grisham makes the characters truly aliveI wept and laughed out loudhis honesty and capturing the time and place is remarkableI also enjoyed his descriptions of the food and love of a mealIn so many books it is as though no one ever eatsit is truly one of his best books and I highly recommend it"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"John Grisham's The Last Juror is a very good read, but it is not a mystery. It's the story of a college dropout, who finds acceptance after becoming a newspaper publisher. Grisham sets the story in Clanton, Mississippi. The setting of his first novel, A Time To Kill. Several of the characters from that book are back in this one. The unusual characters are what makes the book so enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"My wife Michelle bought this book for me recently, and judging by the title I sat down prepared to read another of Grisham's famous books about lawyers. To my surprise, this one was very different. It seems Grisham has branched out recently with the Painted House, and Bleachers, and that has given him a different writing style than the one he was famous for in the Firm, Pelican Brief, and others.This book takes place in a small town in 1970's Mississippi, and centers on a young man who has taken over the local newspaper. The young man is not form the area and therefore is an outsider to the community he writes his newspaper for. The story flows with the slow steady pace of life in the Deep South, and is rich with detail and the mood of the time. While not as quickly engaging as some of his lawyer books, this one has far more substance.Grisham depicts the struggle with racism, the naivet&eacute; of youth, and the &quot;above the law&quot; clans of bootleggers and crooked police. The best aspects of the story were the ways in which this 23 year old owner of the local newspaper has to learn the ropes. Blessed with a youthful enthusiasm, yet to be tempered with wisdom, he finds himself in the eye of the storm. When he prints news articles about the murder, and the accused, he suddenly finds himself center stage in a hotbed of corruption and a public trail he is seen to have influenced.I won't spoil the plot any further, as this book is a great one to pick up and read cold. Overall, I recommend this as a good departure from Grisham's usual formula. If you liked a &quot;Painted House&quot; then I think you will find this book closer in style to that one."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"John Grisham's new novel, &quot;The Last Juror,&quot; is set in Clanton, Mississippi in the 1970's. Joyner William Traynor is a twenty-three-year-old college dropout with a background in journalism. His wealthy grandmother lends Traynor the money to buy &quot;The Ford County Times,&quot; a bankrupt weekly newspaper. The young man, dubbed &quot;Willie&quot; by the folks in Clanton, is determined to turn the newspaper into a profitable enterprise.When a young widow named Rhoda Kassellaw is raped and murdered in Clanton, Willie reports the crime and the subsequent trial in lurid detail. &quot;The Ford County Times&quot; gains a host of new readers and Willie becomes a fixture in Clanton. He also makes himself the target of some dangerous people. Danny Padgitt is accused of the Kassellaw murder, and his family is well known for bribing public officials and killing people who cross them. The Padgitts are not at all happy with Willie Traynor's coverage of the Kassellaw murder. Danny even has the temerity to tell the jurors that if they convict him, he will get them sooner or later.With &quot;The Last Juror,&quot; Grisham is in top form. He beautifully depicts the assorted characters in Clanton, including the corrupt politicians, the drunken reporters, the gun-toting citizenry, and the good Christians who have a personal relationship with the Lord. One of most memorable characters is Miss Callie Ruffin, a black woman who has raised eight children, seven of whom went on to earn PhD's. Willie writes a lengthy and complimentary feature in his newspaper on Miss Callie and her family. He also becomes Callie's dear friend and a frequent guest at her bountiful table. Miss Callie is the first black woman voter as well as the first black juror in Clanton, having been picked to serve on the Padgitt jury.&quot;The Last Juror&quot; has suspense, excitement, warmth, and gentle humor. Without preaching, Grisham perfectly captures the racial tension and the social upheaval of rural Mississippi in the seventies. He tells his story through Willie Traynor with effortless simplicity and with great affection. &quot;The Last Juror&quot; is a pleasure to read, and it is one of Grisham's finest novels."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Yes!We return the brooding town of Clanton for a thriller with heart that reminds me of the passion that made A Time to Kill and The Firm such great books.Danny Padgitt gets released from prison a mere 10 years after getting a &quot;life&quot; sentence, and members of the original jury are starting to drop like flies.If you're like me you felt a steady decline in Grisham's writing since his first few novels. It was almost like he'd forgotten where he came from. He tried to redeem himself with Painted House and Bleachers, but I really couldn't get into them. There was a lot of heart in those books, but I didn't feel for the plot. There was a lot of plot in some of his later thrillers, but not a lot of heart. Finally we have both and it's a grand slam."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"As usual, Grisham doesn't disappoint, whether it's a legally-based thriller, a down-home &quot;Painted House&quot; or any of his other great reads. At least there's some consistancy in this world. Also liked &quot;The Firm,&quot; &quot;Bark of the Dogwood,&quot; &quot;A Child called It.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"This feels like Grisham's attempt to write Southern literature, rather than suspense fiction. The entire book feels like a feeble attempt to imitate Harper Lee. Don't let the book jacket fool you, a full 1/3 of the book cover stuff that isn't related to the trial at all.The editing is also poor. Once he used the same exact descriptive sentence in two different places in the novel. In another, he describes a young man wants to be a draft dodger but is convinced to go to Vietnam by his parents. Less than 10 pages later Grisham writes that the parents begged their son not to go.The entire plot is a let down. There is no suspense, the &quot;surprise ending&quot; meager and predictable, and Grisham wastes half the novel writing about utter non-sense that is not related to the story and is not charming."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Wow, was this book bad. I've read just about every Grisham novel, and while some have been good and some a little weak, this one was clearly the worst. For one thing, you could have easily cut out 80% of the pages to tell the &quot;thriller&quot; part of the story. I understand that isn't the whole thing the book is supposed to be about, but you literally at times wonder if that story is ever going to get told. There are SO many instances where Grisham wanders off on a tangent for NO REASON relevant to the story. Why do we have to hear all about Grisham's enlightened views on the Vietnam war through the eyes of a main character back in the 70's. It has NO bearing on any aspect of the story. Its just odd, unrelated filler. Same goes for an investigation and cataloging of all the southern churches and their basic tenets. Its always good to learn something in a fiction novel, but that &quot;something&quot; should be in the course of telling the story, not oddly jammed in with no relevance except to fill pages.And, its not as if waiting around for the ending was worth it either. It is dull and disappointing. Which is a pretty good summary of the whole book. If you are looking for a more entertaining page-turner this summer, try something from Brad Meltzer, like The Zero Game or The Millionaires."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"This has been the worst book from Grisham than I have ever read. It was a waisting time. Page after page I was expecting things change or come better but at the end I was dissapointed with this book. I should read the amazon rate before buy this book. I'll do next time."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"The first Grisham I read was The Partner. I loved it and proceeded to plow through every one of his books. In the last five to six years, save The Brethren, his books have become nothing more than essays that go nowhere. After now having read The Broker and The Last Juror (both having only the thinest of plots- if they can be called plots) I can confidently say I would only buy another Grisham if all the book stores and publishers in the world burned down and someone was giving one away. You may think I'm being harsh, but I get the feeling Grisham's heart is no longer in it and he is only writing for his publisher and hip pocket now."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"This is the worst book I've ever read because it was advertised as a THRILLER but there was zero suspense. It was such a boring book that it's a wonder that I even finished it. In contrast, I read the DA Vinci Code in 3 days because I simply couldn't put the book down.If the Last Juror had been advertised as a novel about a small Southern town, somewhat like To Kill A Mockingbird, I would have had a different mindset and probably would have enjoyed it more. I read Mockingbird in 3 days also."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Book is intriguing enough to keep you interest like any other John Grisham movie. Can't remember all the mistakes, but one that stands out is his mention of 9mm \\"Glock\\" pistol collection of Harry Rex, but Glock was introduced in US in the early 80s. I guess everyone that isn't familiar with firearm history is just happy to mention the Glock pistol name to fill some pages.There are some more, but I am surprised that John Grisham has failed to perform this simple research."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Willie Traynor was born in Memphis, but was educated in at Syracuse. That makes him an outsider, and perhaps a Northerner, in the eyes of small-town Clanton, Mississippi residents. When this fresh out-of-college youngster takes the reigns of the failing local newspaper, therefore, success is dubious. Luckily for Mr. Traynor, a horrifying murder is just the headline to shock his newspaper back to profitability.A young widower and mother is brutally raped and murdered by Danny Padgitt, the scion of an influential outlaw family. Where once the Padgitt family was treated with fearful deference, Willie attacks head-on with bold front page stories and incriminating photography at substantial risk to himself and his business,.Danny Padgitt is ultimately convicted, but surprisingly is spared the death penalty. In open court, he swears revenge on the jury. By greasing the wheels of the Mississippi penal system, the Padgitt family succeeds in getting Danny released after serving only 9 years. Then, jurors start dying.Though the plot is not without interest, this is certainly not one of John Grisham's better novels. The foreshadowing, in particular, seems heavy-handed and will probably, for many, ruin or at least dampen any surprise at the conclusion. I, having decided I had \\"figured out\\" the book about halfway through, found it difficult to slog through the last portion of the novel. Likewise, the \\"Southern\\" color is laid on pretty heavily and, though I can claim to be no expert, appears fake-y. Bountiful home-cooked meals fixed by a heavy-set, strongly religious, older black woman, for some reason, sets off my cliche-dar. I also found the narrative point-of-view distracting. The book felt, to me, more like an odd memoir than a riveting crime/legal thriller.The book, however, does have the courtroom drama and the supporting extra-judicial action that makes a novel a Grisham novel. The writing is easy and breezy - just the thing to pass some time on a beach or an airplane. As a bonus, you may recognize some of the characters and settings from some of Grisham's other books - perhaps the beginning of a series exploring the depths of Clanton, Mississippi?"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Usually John Grisham's books are a pageturner. Unfourtantly, The Last Juror is not one of those. I'm not even sure what the title is refering to. The first half of the book starts out strong but the 2nd and 3rd parts are weak. Parts of the book talks about Danny Padgitt but once the trial ends, it seems like Grisham is just filling paper to get a full length novel. There are even parts of the book where it's just gibberish. In fact, some things don't belong here.Last time Grisham visited Ford County was in the book A Time to Kill and that was 10 times better then The Last Juror as it had was filled with suspense and mystery but in The Last Juror, there's none of that. I like Grisham's past books but this one falls flat throughout."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"If you liked \\"A Painted House,\\" then you'll like this book too. It is not one of Grisham's intense law dramas, but is more of a humorous coming-of-age book about life and interpersonal relationships in a small town. It was very well written---one of my favorite Grisham books."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Alright, let me set a few things straight from the get-go: I am neither a Grisham basher, nor do I like to go out, buy, and read his books just to make awful commentaries about them and post them on Amazon.com (in fact, I go to the library). But, I have read over half-dozen Grisham novels, and something must be said about this stinker.To start with, (SPOILERS AHEAD!!!) the title of the novel should have been potentionally something like this: \\"The Last Juror, with 2/3 of the Novel a Waste.\\" Or, I like this one more: \\"The Last Juror: Find out what it all meant by reading the last 20 pages.\\"The plot, while seemingly okay, concerns a jury who hears a case of a rich boy who raped a single mother--along with other horrible things that added to his guilt, and of course, the decision of the jury (and the reader). After sentencing him to life, the rapist gets pretty mad, and threatens to kill (or wait, to 'take revenge') on all the members of the jury who put him in his place--and he does, albeit much, much later. Pretty unique plot line, no? Certainly it's Grisham's best yet? NO. It seems a bit strained, boring, and, uh oh, like I've heard it before? Like in a distant movie? In any case, I don't remember, and the idea of a prisoner getting out of jail and taking revenge on the jury who put him behind bars was something I couldn't resist--so I picked it up.Now, bear in mind that all of this plot is displayed quite outrightly on the hardcover's inside jacket description. So, it's pretty much old news; that is, the whole novel has just been blown by the little vindette on the cover. Oops.The first 50 pages concerns the main character, some Billy of sorts (his real name isn't important, and his development in the story is pretty lackluster, like most of the characters in the novel, except for Lucien, the crazy lawyer who represents the rapist), and his presence observing a trial of the rapist. Billy works for the county paper, and of course he has to be at the only Ford County's brutal murder/rape trial. So he is, and for nearly 55 pages we are DRAGGED through the details of the murder, and the deliberations of the jury. Since we already knew they would find him guilty, we are not surprised that Grisham wastes another 30 pages dragging that matter out.And then the threat from the rapist, and following his sentencing to life in prison (which somehow, according to Mississippi Law, really only means roughly 10 years, give or take).At that point, one would think Grisham would delve right into the retribution of the rapist after he gets out of parole a few years later. But no, this is not the case. Grisham wastes about 150-200 pages talking about complete and utter nothiness--it's all filler. Nothing important. Just skip until about page 300 in the hardcover, and you will find out that the rapist starts mudering his jurors. And Grisham doesn't even do that well.He totally screwed this one up. He wasted 2/3 a novel with pointless things, the characters lacked development, the suspense was null, and a family having 7 PhD children, while the parents are dumb as dirt, just defies genetics.Grisham: I still like you, but you really struck out with this one.Audience: Do not read this unless you are in masochism. But if you are, then read it, or watch the View.This is nothing like the fantastic The Runaway Jury, so don't be dupped like I was in thinking The Last Juror would be like that!"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I agree with many of the comments that indicat ethis is a relatively good book, even if it varies greatly from previous Grisham novels oin terms of pace, plots, etc. What bothers me is the book cover sells it as another Grisham novel. Mostly it sells the murder, his statement to the jury, that he has been released and there is revenge. I purchased the book based on wanting an action novel. Weeks later, it is nothing more than a well-written account of a newspaper editor making commentaries on coming of age in the south. Nothing wrong with it, but don't bait-and-switch the reader as to thinking it is a \\"typical\\" Grisham novel"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I thought \\"The Last Juror\\" was very interesting. It seemed to relay what small town life in the south was like in the 70's very well. I thought the plot was very interesting, after it got going. The beginning of the book was a little slow (about the first 100 pages). The twists and turns in the story were a little predictable, but still held my interest. I was, however, disappointed by the ending, which I found to be very abrupt and anticlimactic. Overall, I enjoyed reading the book."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I started reading The Last Juror knowing only that it was the latest Grisham book and with that I had certain assumptions of what the book would be. Boy did I under setimate this book. Sure it is about a trail. Sure the \\"Last Juror\\" is in peril of some sort. That is where all my pre conceptions stop.This book is filled with such colorful small town southern characters all written with such admiration, devotion and love that I couldn't help fall in love with every character and this small fictional town.The last page had me in tears, which I REALLY did not expect coming in to it. If you are looking for the suspense and pace of The Firm, this is not your book. But if you like great characters and not too worried about when you get to the 'meat\\" of the story, then this book is for you.I really loved this book and can not recommend it enough."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I found this to be a very enjoyable book, filled with the tapestry of times gone by, both the innocent and the guilty, a fairly seemless story of a young man coming of age, an horrific crime, and resolution.There can't be a more oppositional place for Willie Traynor to settle in then Clanton, Mississippi around the time of desegregation. Syracuse University educated you can just see Bubba and Cooter, second cousins, sitting in front of the General Store when Willie (then just Will) rides into downtown Clanton, long hair and all, in his Triumph Spitfire, talking about that 'damncommiejunkieliberalcatholicdeeeeeegenerate' who takes a job at the dying newspaper as a cub reporter.Mr. Grisham is patient and takes his time creating a sentimental (OK, occasionally too sugary) journey for Traynor, funny, sad, and insightful, draping it over a horrific crime of rape and murder that rocked the small town.I admire Grisham, like Lehane and Parker, because they all have a successful formula and yet are unwilling to stay with something safe. Profitable but not very creative.So with \\"Painted House\\" and \\"Bleachers\\" Mr. Grisham steps out and tests the water. And I believe with \\"Last Juror,\\" he combines his sharp trial narrative with a gentler view of life in the South.I have to be honest with you. Being a Vietnam Vet, Grisham's (Willie's) editorial against the Vietnam War in 1971 brought tears to my eyes. His relationship with Miss Callie is warm and tender and courageous, and his stuttering outrage at the Parole Board Hearing for Danny Padgitt is profound.Very good book. Nicely hung together. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebury"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I have read nearly every one of John Grishams books, and they have all been very good. He is one of the few writers now-days that really know how to write, how to develop characters, and how to move the plot along when it is required. This book does that, and then some. In typical Grisham fashion, the main character ends up in Mississippi ... this time the guy is a newspaper man, not a lawyer ... dont worry ... there are enough lawyers in the story ... we don't need another one. I do not want to spoil the plot, but suffice it to say, I read the book in one day (and part of the night ... was up til 2:00 AM reading it) it is that good. The cliche \\"I could not put it down\\" is true in this instance. Get it, read it, you will be glad you did."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I liked the way the story moved,describing the life of a young man and his rise up from a college frat boy to an owner of a small town Missippi newspaper. I liked the way he developed a relationship with the townspeople who were much different than himself. The way he was openminded and grew to love his way of life and the people who made it up. The story flowed with a slow rhythmic beat and sort of felt like a lush breeze blowing over your skin. I don't think there was much of a plot, just a slice of life story that reflected a happiness that comes from openmindedness and fearless nature when we come upon differences in culture, race, social class, etc. It kind of reminds me of how a river meanders and lazily slugs onward. Thats kind of the pace of the story. Which worked for me!Lisa Nary"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"This brings me back to the John Grisham that I fell in love with reading when I first read A Time to Kill. Not only did I love the story and the twists thrown in to keep my guessing, but I just loved the overall feel of the book itself. I felt like Grisham's writing was almost fluid, his character development being some of the best I can remember from any of his books. At the end when Callie's family was gathered around her bed at the hospital, I felt like I was standing there in the room with them, and that I would recognize any of them on the street if I were to pass them.Overall, this book was just fun to read!"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"John Grisham is probably best known for his many formulaeic legal thrillers. Some are better than others but they became too predictable. Some became his vehicles for commenting on society and social values and sacrificed the story to make a point (i.e. &quot;The Chamber).His most recent book, &quot;The Last Juror&quot; takes us back to the Grisham we saw in &quot;A Time to Kill&quot; which I believe is is best novel. Through extensive character development, we get to know Willie Traynor, Harry Rex, Miss Callie and the other inhabitants of Clanton. Seen through the eyes of Willie, we become immersed in their lives as the biggest murder of the county occurs. The trial, the subsequent years, the release of the murder and the revenge killings happen to people we have grown to know and care about.It becomes a page-turner because we want to know about these people and their lives. The ending is fairly predictable but it is a satisfying tale and well worth a few hours of your time. It is a well written book and much more believable than many of his high-speed &quot;legal thrillers&quot; that leave you breathless but forgetting the story not long after you are done. The well-developed characters and the sense of place(a small Mississippi town in the 70's) are what make this book unforgettable."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"The characters in the book are ones I couldn't get enough of. This may be John Grisham's finest work to date. The suspense is intense and the setting is another great tribute as with A Time to Kill, set in Mississippi. Don't miss this one. Grisham fans will love it, and if you're new to John Grisham, you will be hooked! Another book that I highly recommend is &quot;He Never Called Again.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I loved this book. Being part southern,I can attest to the realism and beautiful prose along with a knockout plot. I hated to finish the book and wish there was a sequal in the works. Most of Grisham's books have interested, educated and entertained me. This one is one of his best along with a surprising change of pace. I cannot imagine anyone not loving this book. The characters are so real they jump off the page. If they ever make it a movie, it would never do the book justice. This is five star stuff."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I expected more of a trial book due to title and cover. The book was a mixture of the trial and life in the south. I did enjoy it but let down because of false expectations.I believe that Mr. Grisham does a wonderful job of makeing you feel like you know his characters. I love Mrs. Callie and her family.Even with this three star review I will by Mr. Grisham's next book also. He always keeps me interested."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I was a tad disapointed by this effort by Grisham, though I would say it is a great read. He has again managed to share a story of common people, of the human condition, of less-than-perfect characters and for that his story moves and flows. But, it lacks the rythmic suspense of some of his other bestsellers. There are no offshore accounts in the Caymans, no greedy businessmen or shady lawyers. In a sense, everyone in this small town life is flawed, but noble in a way.I enjoyed The Last Juror for humor and storytelling, but I was put off by Grisham's unusual amount of language and sexuality. We all know he can tell a good story without having to reach down to the levels he did in The Last Juror.All that being said, I would say that The Last Juror is worth reading, but it is definitely not the heart-pounding thriller you've come to expect. It is definetly not as good as the majority of his other books."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I was disappointed in this latest book. I was exited to hear it was taking place in Canton &amp; the story sounded great but somewhere along the line the book just didn't prove to be what it could have been. Where is the John Grisham of &quot;A Time to Kill&quot; or The Painted House?&quot; It was still a good read just because John Grisham wrote it."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I felt the book was fascinating ive always had an interest towards different societies in the US but Grisham disapointed me ive read some of his other works and this one surprised me to be one of his slower ones. The book was not a page turner. He could have ended it several times but drabbed on for too long. By the last third of the book i was nearly ready to put it down. But i kept through classic Grisham ending which was worth the wait to an extent."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"John Grisham's novel The Last Juror did an excellent job of keeping the reader enthralled. While many believe that the end of this novel is not as entertaining as those of his other novels, I find Grisham's fusion of all the sub-plots into one coherent ending breathtaking. The whole plot of a family having so much power over a community never ceases to remind me of the lesson on political machines in U.S. history. We all enjoy seeing the bad guy fall and Grisham shows that in a quaint fashion.I also enjoyed the characters of this novel. Grisham portrays the main character, Willie Traynor, as a nonchalant college-grad who is simply looking for a job. As the novel progresses, Traynor transorms into an industrious newspaper editor who is anxious to portray evils in the world. It is my sincere opinion that everyone can relate to Traynor in some sort of fashion. Whether it be his youthful attitude in the beginning, or his undying passion to root out the evils in society, or his simple attraction to one of his peers of the opposite sex, we all can find a niche in his character.Truly, Grisham does an excellent job as depicts some unique aspects of American life and relates them to the legal system. What you find in this novel is more than suspense or entertainment, you will find perspective. You will find your eyes open to another world around you."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I used to be an avid John Grisham fan. I would anxiously wait for his books to come out and be one of the first to purchase a book. Lately, his books have strayed and have not caught my interest. This book sounded like it could be in line with his first books, so I was anxious to read it. I can usually finish a Grisham book in less than a day... this one dragged for about a week. I forced myself to finish it so I could start a new book. The main character is not very interesting and it makes it hard to feel any involvement in the choices he makes in his life. If John Grisham continue the same trend, I will have to find a new author to enjoy."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"A thriller should thrill. This book is so besotted with its politically correct agenda that it forgets to entertain and is a great yawn instead. First, a disclaimer: this is the first time that I've ever bought a new Grisham (based on a good review I read) and thought that I might happily rest my mind with a few hours of diversion. Unfortunately, the first murder after the opening event does not take place for almost 200 pages. In the mean time we are subjected to endless blather on race relations in the South of the 1970s, the Viet Nam war, the death penalty, and Richard Nixon. Grisham's views on all of the above are just as predictable as the novel's ending. His characters are either so perfect or so villainous that the stereotyping becomes quite grating. All the &quot;action&quot; takes place in the last 40 pages; the solution is completely predictable and as unsatisfying as anything else you will find here including the bite-sized sentences and paragraphs. I won't make this mistake again."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"What a disappointment- the introduction sounded soooo interesting; well, the book was interesting up to the point of the trial and conviction of Danny Padgitt; Then, instead of projecting ahead as the book promises after Padgitt gets out of jail in 9 years, Mr. Grisham is now rambling on and on; i am two thirds through this book (by the way i started out absolutely loving it) and there is still no mystery, no suspense about the revenge of Danny Padgitt-so when does the retribution begin Mr. Grisham? did you get lost somewhere in time and begin to love your writing to much you forgot where the storyline was going? I wish i could get a refund. You know the real kicker is, i really enjoyed the book so much until Mr. Grisham got lost in space somewhere with all the characters in this town in Mississippi-- puh-lease--i will finish the book because i bought it but i would not recommend you spend your hard earned money on it; if you must wait till it comes out in paperback if you can't resist Mr. Grisham's books."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Great book. Indeed the story is about the town of Clanton,Mississippi seen through the eyes of a liberal Yankee newspaper editor. You'll enjoy reading the book if you like reading about small town Southern culture. Not Grisham's very best but still a very good book. He does well painting pictures of small town life and the dynamics among the groups in those towns. Keep it up Grisham!"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"By 1970 the Ford County Times went bankrupt sped up by local boycotts when the owning family began adding obits of Negroes to the newspaper. Former cub reporter Willie Traynor, who went north for college, drops out of school, takes over the troubled paper from the aging Caudle family to the dismay of most of the white populace of the Mississippi County.Willie's paper gets a circulation boost when the police arrest Danny Padget for the vicious rape murder of Rhoda Kasellaw, a widow mother of two young children, who identified the culprit before she died. Being a spoiled member of a prominent family, Danny threatens the jurors if they convict him, which they surprisingly do as the evidence besides the deathbed statement of the victim is overwhelming. Less than a decade later, Danny is freed and the jurors are being killed off one by one. Willie, who admired the first black juror in the county's history, Miss Callie Ruffin, risks his life to keep her safe, but retribution is coming.The insightful look at little things that add up to major social relationships in 1970s Mississippi during a time of revolutionary change is John Grisham at his best. Those minor items like an obituary for a deceased black person or the first black juror brings the era into stark reality. However, when the tale twists into a serial killer storyline, that subplot is very exciting, but also takes the focus away from the social lens of change and upheaval. Still John Grisham entertains his fans with a terse suspense tale that isquite as superb as A TIME TO KILL, thus pleasing his vast readership.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"This novel is NOT the typical John Grisham legal thriller/murder mystery (though it contains elements of both), so the back cover description is deceptive. What it is is a look at a small town in Mississippi in the 1970s, seen through the eyes of a young man who finds himself running the town's weekly newspaper. It reminded me of some of Dickens' works, which were \\"incidents in the life of ______\\"--type novels. TLJ is well-written, has good character development, and enough of a plot to pull you along. The reason there are so many negative reviews is that readers were expecting something else, and are expressing their disappointment. But if you know what you are getting when you start I think you will find this a good read.I must take issue with one of the reviews here. In the novel Grisham takes shots at Wal-mart/K-mart type stores [under a different name, of course] for wreaking havoc on the economic and social lives of small towns. Being opposed to this is called by a reviewer \\"liberal\\". Well, I am more conservative than Reagan, and I deplore what these big-box stores have done to rural America, turning the downtown areas of so many towns, which used to be alive, vibrant places, into ghost-towns. Sure, people can get some things cheaper than before, but can we truly say life is better, more worth living, in such places?"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Grisham strikes again, but not as hard as usual. In this book, he just does not offer as much of a puzzle to be enjoyed by the reader as he usually does. The story does not really capture you, and as a result, leaves you wondering why you are trying to get through a book that really is not as good as it could have been. It just kind of drones on and on for a while before it gets to be the least bit interesting, but when it does it can draw you in. However, that is only the last forth of the book. Otherwise, it is very, very slow. If you are a fan, you can expect enjoy this book, but if you are not you might be bored. This may even lead you to question why you are reading this author, but you should try other titles before you jump to the conclusion that he is overhyped. Anyway, get it if you are a real Grisham fan, but try another title if you are not."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"For the most part a very enjoyable read. There were parts that were a little slow but overall I enjoyed the book. Great ending."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"At the heart of the book is an excellent detective story of perhaps 100 pages which matches the better pieces of Agatha Christie. The trouble is that Grisham padded it out to a full-scale novel by throwing in everything but the kitchen sink: Missipppi corrupt politics, black history and cooking, the Viet Nam war, and so on. There should be a law against such blatant padding!"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"i was very pleased with this purchase. it came exactly as the seller described and in the same time frame as advertised. i would definitely order from this vendor again."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"For starters I have no idea how anyone could give this book a bad review. I now wait for all of his books to come out in unabridged books on tape as he uses great narrators - the BEST being Michael Beck who really outdoes himself in this one. Listening to him is like finding an old friend that you missed. This book is a very good story about the south in the 70's with compelling characters and a lot of humor. If you are thinking of reading this - take a chance and listen to it instead - I guarantee you will become a fan of Michael Beck's in addition to John Grisham."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I discovered the legal thrillers of John Grisham along with most Americans in the summer of 1993 (when the film The Firm was released) and spent several weeks reading his forst four novels. The best was A Time to Kill in which Grisham captured race relations in a small southern town. I read each sucessive Girhsam blockbuster each summer. Other than The Rainmaker I felt let down, some (The Brehtren, The Partner) were funny, but not truly cpativating novels. After the King of Torts I was losing faith in Grisham- The Last Juror changed that.This was fantastic. It is admittedly a beach read, but seems more quality than most of this genre. Grisham returns to smalltown Mississippi and describes issues ranging from lecetions, to the decline of the main street downtown, to race. I could absolutely not put it down. The characters were wll drarn and multidimensional. It is not technically a thriller, but certainly held much suspence. I hope John Grisham keeps writing like this!"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"A little different twist to his stories but very interesting. A little of small town, Desegragation in the 70's, A quasi adopted family that happens to be black with he being white, and wonderful names for many of the characters. The setting of the sniper at the courthouse and Baggy hanging out of the window on a electric cord had me laughing to the point I could'nt stop. Your certainly cannot miss with a Grisham novel, wonder what will be next."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"The Last Juror, John Grisham's latest novel, is filled with surprises and twists that will keep you reading for hours. Willie Traynor, a young kid just out of college, buys a small weekly paper in sleepy Ford County during the 1970s .The rape and murder of a young mother by Danny Padgitt, one of a known criminal family of Padgitts, headlined the paper and sold many copies. Willie's paper reported all of the gruesome details and infuriated the Padgitt family throughout the trial. During the trial Padgitt threatens the jury to avoid a conviction. Danny is convicted for two &quot;life&quot; sentences for his crimes but the courts paroled him in less than ten years. With Padgitt out the jurors, judge, and even Willie could be in danger. Grisham's writing turns a mediocre story idea into a great thriller. This book is a great read, Grishham fan or not."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Grisham's experimentation with new styles and voices has been an interesting journey for his readers. This side trip back to Ford County was his first since The Chamber, cast as a first person account of a young man's pursuit of himself.The characters were interesting, and the dialog as genuine as Grisham readers have come to expect. One thing I have enjoyed about Grisham's legal novels has been his realistic depictions of many ethical dilemma faced by his protagonists. In The Last Juror, numerous ethical challenges await the young editor whose voice tells the story. The reader is never sure that Willie recognizes that he is straying, which would not be so problematic if we weren't left to doubt whether Grisham recognizes them either. He seems very comfortable with the editor as advocate and participant. Willie makes several decisions that seem unlikely or at best ill-advised that Grisham seems to support.The book was enjoyable, but I was never tempted to sit up all night to get it finished. On the bright side, I intend to add it to a list of extra-credit readings for my journalism students and challenge them to resolve Willie's problems in ways more appropriate than those he chose."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Grisham is still on top of his game, if you ask me. Sure, this isn't KING OF TORTS or THE FIRM, but then, it's not supposed to be. What it is, is a well-written book, blending styles from A PAINTED HOUSE and some other prime Grisham fiction. No, it's not as fast-paced as some of his other books, but then, we all need to take a break!Also recommended: Bark of the Dogwood and A Painted House"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"the unique thing about this book is that it relies on the operation of the newspaper to make the plot compelling and not so much the murder. A murder in a small town is something that has been done numerous times in other books and movies, so Grisham takes it from the perspective of a 23 year old kid who just started his own newspaper in Tennessee that is responsible for reporting it. The kid went to college for five years and still didn't graduate, and he did an internship after four years at Syracuse. Grisham said that his grades were on a steady decline as he progressed through college. So, for me, this was like reading the story of my life. I've been going to college for journalism for over three years and my grades have been on a steady decline. A lot of John Grisham's books have been made into movies (The Client, A Time to Kill, The Rainmaker, The Chamber, The Pelican Brief). I'd like to see this get adapted into a movie. I've only read 50 pages of it so far, but it's pretty solid."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"He's back!! The John Grisham of old has returned. No, it's not his best work (The Firm, The Chamber, Pelican Brief.) But it's far and away better than the last 7... 8.... 9... books he's put out. I was really apprehensive about this one, I have been so disappointed in his books lately. But this is definitely more in his old style and definitely worth reading. If you like &quot;old school&quot; Grisham, this one is worth a look."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"The protagonist of this book is Willie Traynor, a young man fresh from college who, with the help of his wealthy grandmother, purchases a newspaper, The Ford County Times, in Mississippi. It is 1970 and all is quiet until a local woman is raped and murdered. Now a trial is set to begin with a member of the notorious Padgitt family. The jurors are selected, one of them being the first black female to serve and also a dear friend of Mr. Traynor. The trial is heavily covered in the paper, increasing the sales to Willie's delight. When the convicted, Danny Padgitt, is senctenced to life in prison, the town relaxes...except for those that understand that a life sentence doesn't necessarily mean he will remain in prison for life.1 Tension mounts years later when he is released on parole and deaths occurr once again in the town.Mr. Grisham is back to writing about the courts and laws, the things I love to read by him. But this book doesn't stick to just the courts. It's more of a mixture between his action packed earlier books (such as The Firm) and his later, low-keyed home town books (such as A Painted House). He spends a great amount of time exploring the lives of various characters, sometimes giving more detail than needed. I found myself becoming bored in spots, wishing for more excitement with Danny Padgitt."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I have really loved most of John Grisham's books (though he has had some real stinkers) but this book is now my favorite from John Grisham.There are a lot of similarities between this book and To Kill a Mockingbird. It is a story that took place several decades ago in the Deep South back when black segregation was unfortunately prevalent. It is a story with a court trial that will show you the character of many residents of Clanton... but the court trial is not what makes this book amazing (dislike a lot of Grisham novels). Like To Kill a Mockingbird, the most interesting things about this book are the characters and their reaction to the court trial.The biggest strength of this novel is the character development. You see how the protagonist, Willie Traynor, grows from a new resident working for a small newspaper to somebody who owns the local newspapers and finds a good fit in a town who generally will not trust you unless they trusted your grandfather. You fall in love with many of the characters in this book, including Miss Callie, a black woman with a mountain of faith in God and a strong desire to see her family grow up with as many opportunities in life as possible. She is almost too good to be true, which is her only fault.I would recommend this to anybody looking for a good character book. The town is rich with a cast of lively resident and the story was nearly impossible to set down. I really loved this book and I think you would, too!!"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Awesome! This is a magnificent meld of Grisham's legal-thriller type stuff with a beautiful story of small-town interactions and friendships. I thought this was a great development in Grisham's writing style, and this was the book that made me want to try The Broker. Definitely pick this up. But DO NOT READ THE INNER JACKET, because it gives away about 70% of the action, and I would have rather seen the plot develop without reading the spoilers in the jacket. I don't know why they put so much info there."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Spending much of the first of the year traveling, I took along a stack of books. The Last Juror was on the bottom of the stack as far as books to read. By the end of the book, I was very disappointed that I had reached the end. Though I had read a number of Grisham's earlier books, I have not kept up with his later novels.At times I found myself comparing the leisurely Southern pace of the novel and the character development to Harper Lee's To Kill A Mockingbird, but there was an underlying anticipation throughout the book.I found the main characters, Willie Traynor and Callie Ruffin, very compelling and likeable. I identified personally with life in a small Southern town and saw much of my own family in the various characters found in the South.This is truly one of Grisham's best books and by far my favorite."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I really enjoy John Grisham books. It seems that whenever I get into a rut reading all I have to do is go back to reading something he wrote. This is only the third one I read (I've also read the Client and Runaway Jury and loved both of them) but I do plan on reading several others.This book had everything you could want from a book. It was easy to read, it had colorful characters, a very detailed story that moved at an appropriate pace, and a thrilling suspense factor where you had to keep reading to see what was going to happen. It also had a truely appropriate ending that summarized everything perfectly. I could not put this book down.I also enjoy historical fiction books and while this wasn't historical fiction in the traditional sense I enjoy reading good fiction books where you also learn something as well. Learning about how a small town dealt with all the issues of the early 70s like segretation etc was very interesting to me.This book does get a little gory at the beginning when it describes the rape and murder of one of the characters but it's necessary to evoke the passion needed to truly feel for the characters involved.Another brilliant book by John Grisham."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"At first, The Last Juror held my interest like most of Grisham's books do. After the murder trial, which takes place very quickly, the book begins to sag. It becomes a diary of small-town living as seen through the eyes of city slicker Willie Traynor and doesn't pick up much again. What a disappointment."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"A pleasant and easy to read story with the obligatory bad local boy, poor black matriarch with the wisdom of Solomon and all her children having become professionals, the initially distrusted \\"Northerner\\" from Tennessee, the drunk who can write a good story, and the former reporter, an eccentric who had a thing about obituaries. Oh, yes, the protagonist also has a strange and unlikable father and a sense of idealism. Despite the insistence on these stereotypes, it was a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I have only read three John Grisham books so far - (The Last Juror, The Firm, and The Summons) - and this one is his best. It's not just a legal thriller like some of his others, it has a great story of life in Ford County - see The Summons and A Time to Kill.It starts with a young man coming to Ford County and working for the town newspaper, which he then buys it. This is the main reason I liked it. It told the story through the owner of the paper instead of another lawyer. This book has some great characters who make the book."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I don't know if the title of my review makes sense to you; it does to me.Grisham's fast-paced legal thrillers are driven by the story. In these, the characters are second to the story. While these books are enjoyable, the characters are sketched, not developed.In The Last Juror, I became acquainted with the people of the town. I would like to have met some of them in person. Others, I would have crossed the street to avoid.Miss Callie, Willie Traynor....if you are ever in my town, stop by for a cup of coffee and a piece of pie."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Although I'm not to the point with Grisham as I am with Patricia Corwell's Kay Scarpetta series, I'm getting a little burned out on uneven writing. I finished The Last Juror, Grisham's latest novel, and I can't say I liked it as much as I thought I would. The jacket cover led me to believe this was an action novel focused on revenge. The novel takes place in the 70's in Mississippi, and a small town is forever altered when a brutal murder and rape takes place. The killer is the son is some powerful criminal elements in the county, but they are unable to buy off the jury to acquit him of the crime. The jury convicts him of the murder but can't sentence him to death. After 10 years, he's released from prison and jurors start getting killed. Everyone thinks he is guilty due to a threat he made at the trial. All this action takes place against the backdrop of a young man who moves into the area, takes over the weekly local paper, and turns it into a powerful force of the community during all the changes that occurred in those turbulent times.The novel is split up into three parts. The first one delivers on what I thought the novel would be. A crime, intrigue, fear, and tension. The crime is solved, justice is served, and the criminal is sent to jail. The second part then heads off in a direction that is completely detached from the main story. There's no action. It's just the advancement of the guy's career and life of running the paper. Even when the third part of the story kicks in, the action of jurors getting killed doesn't kick in until the last 50 pages or so. The ending twist comes up pretty quickly, and the final end of the novel sort of leaves you sitting there thinking &quot;he ended it like *that*?&quot;If you were reading this for a human interest story covering the changes in the deep South during the 70's, it would work better in my opinion. But to build this up as a crime thriller and then basically drop that angle until the last few pages left me feeling a little cheated."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"When I decided to read this book about two weeks ago and bought it from my local B&amp;N store - the main reason was the summary I read on the cover recanting what seemed to be an exciting tale of a defendant being spared his life yet seeking revenge on the jury that convicted then sentenced him to life in prison. What I found the real story to be is following a young gumshoe news reporter and his experiences with the people in a small southern town. Yes, it begins with a murder and there is a significant plot surrounding it - but don't be fooled into thinking this is a legal courtroom thriller by any stretch of the imagination. It more so narrates a small towns activities and how a community reacts to rather big events such as the previously mentioned murder trial mixing in their traditions with politics, people and work. And although I thought that the book's ending could have had a surprise or two instead of putt-putting to the end (which is the reason why this book for me gets 3 instead of 4 stars). (The only 5 star book i have read in the last few months was the Di Vinci Code). I would say that this was an enjoyable read. I would recommend this book to those of you who would like a good general story about people - not necessarily about a courtroom drama"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"After SKIPPING CHRISTMAS and, most recently, BLEACHERS I had begun to believe that John Grisham had been abducted by aliens. But with THE LAST JUROR Grisham comes home to what he knows best: legal literature.THE LAST JUROR tells the story of a young newspaperman who scrapes his funds together, along with help from family to buy The Clanton Times his old paper when he was starting out in the world of journalism. Playing his cards right and reporting on the &quot;dangerous&quot; story of a brutal crime and the trial that ensues, the paper is off and running.But, when perpetrator of the crime is released from prison early and members of the jury start turning up dead, the people of small town Clanton are faced with the vengeance of the criminal and his family.Okay, the resolution of the story is predictable but THE LAST JUROR but the writing is vintage Grisham and marks his almost prodigal return to legal drama and that's certainly worth the wait.THE HORSEMAN"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Ok I am not saying this is a bad book - it does hold your attention and there is a little twist at the end but it is just not what I have come to expect from Grisham. I expect more law talk, suspense and action - this bordered on Chick Lit. There is nothing wrong with talking about people's feelings but that should be in a book by Danielle Steele not Grisham."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"This book is plainly a good read when nothing else is available. It is OK, but do not expect the &quot;action&quot; that was present in earlier novels by Mr. Grisham. I felt as though the book lacked something but I can't quite put my finger on it."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I enjoy Grisham. The man can tell a story! But this time, it was a slow, boring story. This is even worse than Bleachers. It's predictable, it's uneventful,.....Very disappointing."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"My reaction to Grisham's recent books has been varied. In &quot;The Summons&quot; and &quot;The Brethren&quot;, he seemed to have grown bored of his own writing, whereas &quot;A Painted House&quot; and &quot;Skipping Christmas&quot; were attempts at new and great things.&quot;The Last Juror&quot; starts off with a long character sketch, as though Grisham didn't have a better way to kick things off, but then he speeds us into a gripping story. He introduces us to some memorable characters, and, as always, his dialogue and insights into human nature are superlative. We witness a murder and the resulting trial through the eyes of a green newspaper editor. We come to love and despise some of the townspeople.And we wait for the dreaded moment when the murderer gets paroled, vowing revenge on his trial jurors.If Grisham had skipped the whole second part of the book, he would have done nothing to disturb the plot. The book would qualify as a breakneck thriller. Instead, he spends a number of chapters providing a look at small town life in the early 70s. War, racism, and capitalism are tackled--with commendable wisdom, yes--but the story drags. Once we wade through to the third part, the story takes off again. And Grisham adds a believable twist at the end.I put this one down feeling that it was one of his best ever, save the social exposition in the middle section. &quot;The Last Juror&quot; will not be Grisham's last word. Thank heavens!"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"We've sometimes complained one doesn't know what to expect from Grisham: long-winded drama (&quot;Chamber&quot;); gripping suspense (&quot;Pelican Brief&quot;); humor and whimsy (&quot;Skipping Christmas&quot;); or just plain yarn-spinning (&quot;Painted House&quot;). To us, he nearly perfectly combines all these elements in &quot;Last Juror&quot;. Really two-thirds of the book is a charming and often funny account of how recent college graduate Willie Traynor buys the Mississippi small-town weekly, the &quot;Clanton Times&quot; (setting for &quot;Time to Kill&quot;), ingratiates himself with the residents, including those on both sides of the tracks (white and black), and both creates a winning business and brings new life to the otherwise fairly sleepy little burg. When a sensational rape-murder occurs, ostensibly by a member of a reclusive family that owns their own nearby island, on which they pursue any number of illegal businesses, Traynor gets into the fray with headlines and editorials. When the Padgitt kid is convicted, but eight years or so later gets paroled, and jurors start to die (as threatened by the convict at the trial), the intensity of current affairs reaches new heights as the remaining jurors, one a steadfast personal friend of Traynor, fear for their lives. The ultimate outcome was a huge surprise. And the death of Traynor's black friend at the end is nothing short of evocative and emotional -- and more than one crocodile tear ran down our face at the conclusion.So while we are never quite sure what to expect from our prolific popular novelist, and while we often find fault with his boring dialogue or weakening plots, we shall be among the lavish praise-givers for this fine book. It touches almost all our senses and feelings, and leaves us highly satisfied and entertained. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I had such high hopes for &quot;The Last Juror&quot;. This novel started off with a bang and then fizzled very quickly. This was like reading a road map but without a destination. Having &quot;The Last Juror&quot; as the title was very misleading because I was expecting all types of twists and turns indicative of previous Grisham novels, instead I ended up just grateful that I checked this out of the library. I cannot in good conscience recommend that anyone buy this book. Please help your local library's circulation numbers and check it out. It seems that Mr. Grisham's characters are as tired as he is. Maybe he doesn't want to play the suspense game anymore. If that's the case Mr. Grisham please stop writing novels under the cloak of legal suspense and call it a wrap."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Master storyteller has tried to view at the legal proceedings with a journalist's (who is an outright opportunist, albeit with some moral standing) perspective. The descriptions of the events in the courtroom are pretty repetitive. A nasty defence lawyer with no ethical groundings, a domineering judge who's supportive to the victim, a diverse and vacillating jury and a small town setting. Sounds familier?But all said and done, there are very few individuals who can spin a story around a single disturbing event. Although this time, the most critical ingredient of Grisham's tales is lacking. Strong characters. Be it The Rainmaker, The Firm or even the offbeat A Painted House, they all had very well defined characters who all had a role to play in the climax of the story. This is where the book falls short of expectations. Perhaps the element of suspense would have saved the day. But the suspense builds up in parts and looses momentum midway before picking up little bit in the end. A uniform thread of suspense would have held the diverse events together.Maybe something better is coming our way from Grisham next time!"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I have read almost all of John Grisham's novels and I have enjoyed them in varying degrees. Until I bought this book I had considered A Time To Kill to be his best, even though it was his first and even though others were best sellers.Grisham is a Son of Missisippi and he does his best writing when he return to his roots. Both of the novels I have just refered to are set in Ford County and the author knows that place like the back of his hand.The people are real, the town is real and by the time you finish the book you figure you could find your way around there,too.Willie Traynor is the narrator for this ride. He is a Yankee who went to Syracuse University, dropped out and found his way to The Ford County Times. It is a family owned weekly that has found it's niche by writing the best obituaries of all of its citizens that one can imagine,white or black. Including blacks is the idea of the current owner and as good as he is at writing obits, he is in no sense a businessman and the paper is forced into involuntary banckruptcy.Willie has a rich grandma who cares about him and he convinces her to loan him $50,000 to buy the paper. Thus, in his early 20's, Willie takes charge of the local weekly.Soon thereafter, a local woman is raped and murderd. The cirsumstances are terrifying and the accused is arrested with the victims blood on his shirt. The accused is a member of a local clan who live on an island just of the coast and whose lawless ways are well known.Willie gets very involved in the trial and it's coverage. Previously he has befriended a black woman who ends up on the jury. The accused is convicted, but spared the death penalty by the same jury and is sentenced to two consecutive life terms.Thats the good news. The bad news is that in Mississippi, life means 10 years. Th worse news is that somehow the consecutive terms have been made concurrent. This particular murderer has had the bad judgement to tell the jury that \\"If you convict me. I will kill you all.\\" Neverthe less he will be up for parole in less than ten years.Nine year later, with the convicted felon out on parole, jurors start being killed and the town is in turmoil.That is as far as I go with the story line. You need to read the rest to see how it comes out. I deduced the outcome about 20 pages from the end and you may or may not, but the important thing to remember is that this is Grisham at his best. Talking about the people he knows about and a town he understands. In so doing he draws us all into a better understanding of each other. This is a truly wonderful story. I hope you read it."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"William Traynor, a 23 year old, takes over a small Southerntown's newspaper with some financial help from a rich relative.A brutal rape/murder by a member of a feared family who has previously been above the law begins a chain of events that lead William to some dangerous circumstances. William learns of MissCallie Ruffin, a black woman who has put 11 of her 12 children through college. Some of my favorite moments are when William visits Callie once a week and savors her wonderful home-cooked meals, the likes of which he has not experienced before. MissCallie becomes the first black juror in the town's history against the accused murderer. A trial ensues, a verdict rendered, etc. However, the strength of this novel is not thecourtroom scenes, but the depiction of William's strength as ajournalist and his relationship with Miss Callie. The book ismore &quot;The Painted House&quot; than &quot;The Runaway Jury.&quot;My favorite Grisham remains today &quot;A Time to Kill.&quot; Very moving."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"This is a tale of one town Clanton Mississippi but in a way it is two books. The first is a story of the Danny Padgett case and the young crusading newspaper editor who makes his smalltown weekly on the strength of his coverage of the trial.It is also a tale of race relations in rural Mississippi as change finally comes to Clanton.Unlike several of Grisham's latest legal tomes, the trial story rings with authenticity. I would have preferred greater development of the Padgett case, leaving the second story as an excellent subplot. Both stories would have been more meaningful.But make no mistake, while this is not A Time To Kill (also set in Clanton) it is his best legal thriller in many years. It could have been more thrilling, thats all."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"This book was so disappointing. I've red lots of John Grisham's books, and I found this one almost totally uninteresting. I kept waiting for something exciting or suspenseful to happen, and even the waiting wasn't written suspensefully!Certainly not up to John Grisham's standards."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"John Grisham is one of my favorite authors; however, I was a little disappointed in this novel. The storyline was basically good, nonetheless, somewhere in the middle of the book; he strays off the subject and wastes a lot of unnecessary time and pages on subjects not really relevant to the main storyline i.e., visiting every church in the county and the history of same. The murder and subsequent trial and the background information of Clanton, Mississippi in the 70's was very good reading and I believe had he stuck with the main plot of jury, trial and revenge, I definitely would have given the novel at least four stars. His friendship with Miss Callie and the Ruffin clan was heartwarming, yet again, he put too much into the problems of Sam and his unfortunate affair, adding nothing to the main plot of the story. There was entirely too much irrelevant verbiage on unrelated subjects. I also felt that after spending quite a bit of time explaining how rough and tough and revengeful the Padgitt family was, the resolution to the antagonist of the story came much too easily. I am not giving up on Mr. Grisham, because I have read many an excellent novel by him; however, \\"The Last Juror\\" did not meet the high standard of work that I expect from a Grisham novel."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I was able to read this book in two sittings. Mr. Grisham writing style has improved quite a bit. And I have always liked it. This book takes place in the south in the seventies. A young man just out of college without graduating and moves to a small town where he takes a job on a county paper. The county is in Mississippi, Grisham's old stomping grounds.This young man, Willie Traynor, ends up being the narrator of our story that takes us through almost a decade of life and turmoil in this town. He ends up owning the paper and interacting with a lot of interesting characters. He makes good friends with the Ruffin family who is God fearing and raised eight children. Seven of which earned PhD's. And runs afoul of the most nefarious family in the county.We watch Willie grow up before our eyes; there is some courtroom drama and suspense. The plot is definitely character driven. And Gresham tries to put in a twist, but I found it a little to easy to figure out long before I reached the end. (I will not tell you where I figured it out, for that will ruin the ending for you. But the clues are there.)The Ruffin family is endearing, but the Mississippi in the early seventies was still pretty much segregated. I would love to have known the Miss Callie Ruffin character. This book is definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I just finished the audio version of The Last Juror today, and it was a great time the entire way. I don't listen to many audio books, preferring to read at a faster rate than recorded readers--but this book was different. The story is definately good, but Michael Beck just added something different, I could really believe that he was Willie Traynor, plus he did a good job with the voices of other characters.The story isn't a \\"typical\\" Grisham legal thriller, but it did have elements. Basically we see life in Clanton, Mississippi from the perspective of Traynor during the years that he is editor of the county paper: 1970-79. There is a big murder trial at the start of the book that provides an overarcing plot, but the book is about so much more. We see Traynor interact with the town, turning from J. William Traynor from Syracuse to Willie Traynor of Clanton. He crosses the tracks to Lowtown to interact with the city's blacks, including the woman who becomes his best friend, the superb cook Callie Ruffin. As the novel unfolds we get a small town perspective, filtered through Willie's eyes of murder, trials, journalism, the Vietnam War, Desegregation, the changing of small-town life, and the importance of religion in the South. Furthermore, you don't just get a narrator's perspective on these events--you see what the community thinks, especially when Traynor pens controversial editorials and articles.You aren't just getting a novel when you pick up The Last Juror, you're getting a portrait of a small Mississippi town during the seventies. You're going to meet many friends and perhaps some old acquaintances if you've read A Time to Kill, set in the late eighties in the same town. Don't expect one of Grisham's legal thrillers, but if you want an excellent story with a realistic plot then you can't miss this. I wasn't ever bored, really enjoying the rich descriptive language and everything else. If you can I suggest trying the unabridged audio with Michael Beck."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"This book took me at least a month of commute listening to finish. However, it was worth the time!I guess I was expecting the basic John Grisham legal thriller, but that's not what this book is. It's more of a tale of crime and life in a small town in Mississippi, with wonderfully quirky characters that we have come to expect from Grisham. Despite the book not being what I expected, I came away from it being quite satisfied.I recommend it -- just be sure you know going into it that you're not reading something along the lines of The Firm or The Testament or the other legal thriller books by Grisham."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"You know a book is good when you're sad you've finished it!I am an avid reader and this is by far one of the best books I've read.I look forward to more John Grisham novels!"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"This is a great book not a book that is superior by any means.

I liked it but didn't love it!"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"John Grisham has slowed down the pace in \\"The Last Juror\\".A large part of the book was side-track from the main story. There were detailed descriptions of how the main character a 23 year old owner of the only newspaper in Clanton spent time with a couple of African Americans.While the main story only occupied a very small portion of the book.However, as usual the Maestro Grisham has always save the twist for the last where he surprised readers towards the end.Still a very good read but the pace is lacking as compared to previous John Grisham's novels."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I'll be honest, this is the first Grisham book I've read. I though it was a great book, as far as a novel depicting a character and a town, and the changes that both go through over time. However, it wasn't what I expected with my first Grisham novel. The main point of the book was not the murder which happens in the first 20 pages. I will make this comparison: If the film \\"A Time To Kill\\" is an exact representatin of the book, and you enjoyed reading the book, then \\"The Last Juror\\" is one you want to stay away from"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I have been very disenchanted with ol' John lately - every novel seems to be very heavy-handed anti-corporations, etc (King of Torts and Runaway Jury immediately come to mind).

It could have used a little more character development and a little more suspense, but overall it was an interesting read. Grisham does a good job of creating a believable setting and picks interesting story lines to follow. Worth the read."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"The Last Juror is a very intriguing story and I was pleased to learn more about the southern town of Clanton, Mississippi where Grisham's first novel, A Time to Kill, was also set.Being a life-long journalist, former newspaper owner, and current author, I particularly related to the newspaper angle in this book.Grisham is the master of the courtroom, so I'm glad he's back haunting the \\"halls of justice.\\" It's a page-turner, as I find all of Grisham's work. His superb style and suspenseful \\"twists and turns\\" held my interest from beginning to end.Betty Dravis is the author of the young adult novel, THE TOONIES INVADE SILICON VALLEY, just released in April, 2005, and of MILLENNIUM BABE: THE PROPHECY."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"After several page turners but not exactly mind blowing best sellers, Grisham's \\"The Last Juror\\" is one of his best books yet. He returns to Clanton, Mississippi and to his roots in person and as a writer. The plot is interesting and the character development superb. A great read."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I listened to the abridged audio CD version of this book. I have read just about everything that Grisham has written and I think this is the best one to come along since A Time to Kill. Willie Traynor is a very likable character and his interaction with a town full of other interesting characters makes this a page turner. This is probably the best novel I have seen in a couple of years."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Enjoyed the book a lot, not Grisham's typical courtroom drama. ALthough there were courtroom scenes in the book the story was told not from a Lawyer's perspective but from the town's newspaper owner. Found the main character courageous as he took a newspaper famous mainly for lenghthy obituaries to doubling the circulation by printing what he felt the town NEEDED to know about situations that had been ignored for many years."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I kept waiting for the story to start, but it never did. I hung in there, thinking that eventually something was going to happen. Even when there was a ripple of an event, it was written about in an uninteresting way. No suspence, no intrigue, just a waste of time in my opinion."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I think John Grisham usually writes excellent legal thrillers, but this one was horrible. He seemed to be very wordy without having a point. He dragged things on, the conclusion was poor and unfullfilling for all the time put into reading the plot. The characters were likable, but just did not seem to go anywhere."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I was ready for a great story in typical Grisham style. What I got was a chick flick. I usually quit a book like this after 90 to 100 pages. I should have this time. However, I kept hoping the story would get better. Save your money and re-read the firm."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I must admit that I fell asleep often while reading this book... which is rare because John Grisham usually keeps me up all night with his usual page turners. I thought this would be a come back after &quot;Bleachers&quot;, which bored me to tears, but I was sadly mistaken. Can we please see more of the old &quot;John Grisham&quot; next time?"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"\\"The Last Juror\\" is the latest novel out of the Grisham factory of legal thrillers. This one is set back in Ford County, the setting of his first novel \\"A Time to Kill\\", but we also see Clanton, which I believe was the town from \\"The Chamber\\". I have not been very impressed with Grisham's work when he has strayed away from the legal world, but this novel is a step back in that direction. To be perfectly honest, Grisham puts one foot back into the legal matters that he has made his career on, but his other foot is in the day to day style of story he told in \\"A Painted House.\\" This was an excellent blend of Grisham's two literary worlds.The setting is 1970's Mississippi. Willie Traynor. Willie is a young reporter for the local newspaper, who, in an interesting set of circumstances, is able to buy the newspaper and become the new owner of the local paper. For perhaps the first time in one of Grisham's legal novels, the protagonist is not someone who is directly connected to the law. The future of the paper does not look good. It was failing quickly (thus Willie was able to purchase the paper), and it doesn't look like Willie has much chance to significantly increase the number of readers...at least not until the brutal rape and murder (committed in front of the victim's children) with the suspect being part of a family with a deservedly poor reputation. Willie begins reporting every aspect of the case and the trial (and does not hide his bias), sales of the paper begins to soar.We are taken through the trial (and years later when what happened becomes an issue again) through the eyes of Willie Traynor. Willie began as an outsider to Clanton, but as time passes he becomes an accepted (if colorful) member of Ford County.I have always liked Grisham's legal books, and this one is no different. While Grisham may never be nominated for the highest literary awards, his books are fast paced and entertaining and fun to read. That's important, to read something that you enjoy, and I have enjoyed nearly ever book Grisham has put out. They are similar and follow a formula, but Grisham is good enough (and is maturing as a writer) that for the brief amount of time that it takes to read his book, we are brought into Grisham's world."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"This isn't one of Grisham's best, but it did keep my attention. It does start out slow, but Grisham does a good job of making you sympathize with his characters"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Grisham's latest book is suspenseful and filled with memorable characters. Unlike his other legal thrillers, this one only has a few court scenes. It is about Willie Traynor, a college dropout who buys a local newspaper. A terrible murder occurs in the town and Willie covers it in his newspaper. The murderer threatens to seek revenge on the jury that convicts him. The plot continues as Padgitt, the murderer is released from prison. The jurors begin to die, one by one. Overall, this novel is adequate, but not nearly as exciting or intriguing as Grisham's early works. The unique characters such as Miss Callie, and her family make the novel worthwhile."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"John Grisham divides his latest novel about a young man's venture in newpaper publishing into three parts. Part One evokes \\"The Rainmaker\\" in the way he presents 23-year old Willie Traynor entering a new profession and coming up against danger and challenges that demonstrate his appealing humanity, intelligence and calm drive.Shortly after this college dropout starts operating his new paper in his adopted Mississippi town, he's reporting on a lurid capital murder case complicated with a bought sheriff, a powerful criminal family, and a system corrupted by greed and fear.Willie develops a tight bond with Callie Ruffin, a matriarchal black woman who becomes a juror in the case, giving him more than a casual interest in its outcome and in the convicted man's threat that he will kill every member of the jury when he gets out of jail. In part two, the tension of courtroom dramatics completely subsides while Grisham indulges in Willie's development of his paper, his relationships, and town issues. Grisham finally returns to the murder plotline in the last part, some years later, when the murderer has been paroled far earlier than he should have been, and members of the jury are getting killed.The Last Juror makes a finely detailed read on issues of justice and civil rights but doesn't come up to Grisham's earlier novel for consistent intensity. One has to appreciate, however, his absorbing way with the dimensions of character and human motivation, which explains its number two position on best seller lists (at the time of this writing).[...]"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"For one hundred and seventy four pages I was captivated by Grisham's uncanny ability to once again unfold a masterful story revolving very subtly around a gruesome rape and murder, but revolving not so subtly around a southern town, its people, its shortcomings, and its peacefulness.When Part Two of the book began, I felt like I was reading a different novel. Were it not for the sneaking suspicion that something &quot;big&quot; was forthcoming, I would have not completed the novel. For approximately 100 pages, Grisham wanders in his writing, and there seems to be very little tying the stories together. I was astounded, as this is not the Grisham I am used to.Although the storytelling is superb, the story itself leaves much to be desired. Grisham fans will truly enjoy the growth in Grisham's writing, and will see a writer who continues to evolve as a story-teller, and an author. If this is your first jaunt into Grisham, I would suggest one of his earlier books."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I look forward to John Grisham's books because they have a plot that keeps you interested. I worked in a law office many years and like his descriptions of law procedures. I've read all his books. Some are better than others but I'm glad I read this one. I read it in two days because I had to find out what would happen."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Grisham is a pretty good novelist, and I've read some other stuff, but I was a little disappointed with this one. It seems to drag on a bit and the ending is a bit predictable.wwr@virginia.edu"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I first became acquainted with Grisham through the PELICAN BRIEF and haven't missed one of his books since. Despite the seeming rut his books became entrenched in, I nevertheless marched on and tried to keep interested.A PAINTED HOUSE, was a great departure from the usual legal thriller, and I greatly enjoyed his venture from the &quot;boiler plate&quot; style his books had become.Likewise with the LAST JUROR, I was pleasantly suprised with his return to Clanton, Mississippi and his wonderful style of telling his story about the growth of a young adult thrust into a career he never imagined, and managing to become succesful despite himself.As an avid reader of Grisham's novels, I secretly hoped that he would explore in greater detail some of the characters I remembered from A TIME TO KILL. Lucien Wilbanks could easily have become more of a major character and we could have been given more detail about his legal career.Despite this, I highly recommend this book and would encourage Grisham to once again explore utilizing some reoccuring characters in his future books."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Well, one thing this latest Grisham book is not short on is controversy. No, it's NOT a legal thriller in the sense of his other books, but the writing is something of a cross between THE FIRM and A PAINTED HOUSE.Grisham is merging his styles and ideas in this book. So many times we want our favorite authors to stick to one genre, but they're people as well as writers and need to grow. Give the guy a break. This is a good read. No, it's not a page-turner in the sense of some of his other books, but it's still better than most of the stuff out there.Also recommended: POMPEII and McCrae's BARK OF THE DOGWOOD"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"This having been his first legal thriller in a couple years, I was not completely impressed by the movement or character development in this book. I have read all of Grisham's books and would easily place this near the bottom of the list.The initial concept is interesting, but his storytelling was lackluster and characters a bit cliched.I kept thinking the &quot;crime family&quot; resembled the Clampetts and his protaganist was unbelievable at times. A lot of the characters were shallow, and the end was disappointing.If you are going to read this, wait for the paperback or get it from the library.Or just re-read the good ones: A Time to Kill, The Client, The Brethren and The Pelican Brief."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I like most of John Grisham's book, they are compelling, interesting and suspensful. My favorite is A Time to Kill. The Last Juror was interesting in that it didn't go through a trial from the beginning of the book to the end. In fact, the rape/murder trial in this book lasted just a few pages. Rather it centered on the lives of Willie and his new Clanton, MS. friends, some fun and interesting characters. Willie is fresh out of college and buys a small county newspaper in Clanton, MS with a loan from his grandmother. The story talks of his years there and how he befriended a black, Christian lady and her amazing family during the early 70's in MS. This was my favorite part of the book, reading about Callie and her family and the conversations she and Willie had. She was a great character and certainly made the book for me. Grisham always does a great job of character development--I can always see a picture of them in my mind. It's a good book and kept my interest, but I was a little dissapointed with the end. I felt like there were still stories to tell about what happened to various characters."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"This is one of the best books one get to read of John Grisham and any author one can think of.The way he presented the story was lucid ,simple and always keeps you engrossed.This is one of the best book one can nread in the recent times.GOOD WORK JOHN .KEEP GOING."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Several good court scenes are not enough to salvage this book, as Grisham stretches the plot needlessly through page after page. Actually, although this book is fast-enough reading, you can get through it even faster by checking out the plot summary on the dust jacket. It takes you up to page 291 (out of about 370). Even then, the ending is rather anticlimactic.Hard-core Grisham fans, wanting to preserve their record of reading everything he's written, will have a reason to read this book. The rest of us can surely find better ways to spend even the short time needed to read it."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"The Last Juror. John Grisham. United States, March 2004. 355The last Juror is John Grisham's fisrt book since A Time to Kill to be set in Ford County, Mississippi. Like all other John Grisham novels, it it a courtroom suspense thriller that catches you in at the very beginning with a crime. Unlike other John Grisham Books, most of it takes place outside the courtroom and offices of lawyers. It is written in first person by a newspaper owner and reporter for the small county. This book deals with issues such as segregation and the Vietnam War. This book is set up to read like the diary and life of Willie Traynor in a small southern county.The book starts out with the brutal rape and murder of Rhoda Kasselaw,a young widow looking for companionship. Her last words before she died in her neighbor's arms were &quot;Danny Padgit. It was Danny Padgit.&quot; Danny Padgit belonged to a corrupt family who payed off the police and judicial system in order to be overlooked as they grew and sold marijuana extensively. Willie Taylor and his newly bought newspaper company are very excited to be dealing with such sensational news in quiet old Ford County. It is just what Willie needs in order to get the almost bankrupt newspaper going again. The court case and the story of Willie's life and the community are what the rest of the book deals with.This book is filled with southern history in the seventies. Some of the points the author talks about are the influence of the Vietnam war, the corrupt nature of the judicial branch (which may not be just history), Black and white segregation and the desegregation movement, and when the President granted amnisty to draft dodgers, He talks about how these things affected the county that Willie lived in. After hanging out for with some Vietnam vets, Willie comments, &quot;No wonder we lost the war-everybody was stoned.&quot;Strangely, this book overwhelmingly has the theme of death which is not a habit for John Grisham. I'm not sure what the author's point in this would be. Maybe it would be, people die and you have to learn how to deal with it.He might be trying to show us some history that we can learn from - for example, when talking about the Vietnam War. In the book, Willie writes &quot;What the hell are we doing in Vietnam? ... Our failure has been even grander than that of the French, and we're not finished yet.&quot; This shows that the author definately thinks that we made mistakes in that war and that we should learn from them.Maybe he is tring to show us that with all our fear of people who are different or mean, we lose sight of who's really dangerous; ourselves. When talkimg about the impact of black athletes in football after the desegregation, Willie says &quot;But those white folks sho had been so adamantly opposed to accepting black students were suddenly transformed that Friday night.&quot; This shows that the author thinks that white people were making a bigger deal out of the segregation than need be. There was nothing to be afraid of.These are just a few of my speculations. You can make your own when you finish reading the book. This book was very educational and interesting, but there was not much happening in the middle of the book. There was a big lull of just ordinary life and talk. Although this may be true about how life really is, you shouldn't write a book like that. If you are a patient reader and can get through the middle part, the book turns out to be very interesting, exciting, and educational."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I enjoyed this book. The protagonist, Willie Traynor, is a journalist/entrepreneur who grows up page by page, and I enjoyed his journey. The town of Clanton is carefully drawn. The book is true to the 1970s as I remember them. And the crime that is the catalyst was truly despicable and movingly told. All that said, there are some disappointments. First of all, I figured out whodunnit and why well before the book ended, and I hate it when that happens. And it does seem to be a valentine to the death penalty, which bothered me enormously. (This from the man who wrote THE CHAMBER?) Perhaps Grisham was just being true to the feelings of his characters, but the blood lust did strike me as creepy. Still, this is a very good writing trying something new, and I applaud the effort."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I say bait and switch because being John Grisham, you expect full-blown legal thrillers a la Runaway Jury, The Firm, The Clietnt, etc. But we've seen him try to broaden his range by writing more &quot;setting&quot; and story pieces, rather than potboilers. This trend started with &quot;A Painted House&quot; which was just ok to me, and the thread continued with most of his books after that one where the character's personal story and growth was the theme rather than just the character's response to a situation. As long as the story is good, I don't mind. If you come to this book expecting a potboiler or vintage Grisham, you'll be dissapointed. If you come expecting a good story and seeing if Grisham's gotten better at telling character stories, you will like this book. I think that John Grisham is a storyteller along the lines of Stephen King (different subject matters but still able to grab you and hook you in) and I recommend this book to all those who want an interesting story to read. It is one of his better ones, almost as good as King of Torts."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"2*Hm...Mr Grisham has set the action of three of his 14 legal thrillers in the small town of Clanton in Ford County, in \\"rural Southern Mississippi\\". The first one was \\"A Time to Kill\\" (1989), the action of which takes place in the mid-'80's; the second one, \\"The Summons\\" (2002); this one (2004) sees its events over a span of 9 years (1970-79), thus preceding those of the other two novels. We find again some of the characters portrayed in the first book: Lucien Wilbanks, still in legal practice as a wily trial lawyer before his disbarment which, towards the end of the book, is however imminent (by the way, where's Jack Brigance?! from what we knew, he already ought to be Lucien's associate at this time);; Harry Rex Vonner, the overweight, mean divorce lawyer, sloppily dressed and looking, but smart and likeable; Claude, the owner of one of the local eateries, barking at customers to finish their meal in 20 minutes so as to accommodate others (the Coffee Shop and the Tea Shoppe, apparently, aren't opened yet); in the third and final part, Judge Omar Noose and the prosecuting magistrate, Rufus Buckley (appointed, we learn here, in 1975). Sheriff Ozzie Walls is not yet in office, and the position is occupied first by a corrupt man, then by an indifferent (as far as characterizations go) one. The scene is the same: the town's square with its courthouse, presumably with General Clanton's (the town's founder and namesake) statue but minus the old men sitting there, spitting out tobacco juice on the lawn; and the nearby Parchman state penitentiary. The book is in three parts: the first one concerns the gruesome rape and murder of the mother of two children, the trial and conviction of the proven criminal, with a sentence to two consecutive life terms in jail; the third one sees his being paroled out (at the second try) after only 9 years of imprisonment, thanks to a distorted presentation of the facts of the crime and of the record of the trial to an incredibly gullible parole board, probably under the thumb (with a financial \\"consideration\\", of course) of the wealthy and wicked family of the convicted man. As soon as the latter is out of jail, serial killings of three former jurors begin and, of course, the direction of suspicions is obvious, because of the threat he had hurled at the jury before it entered its room to deliberate. The second part is a liaison in time. This division takes away the gripping continuity of \\"A Time to Kill\\". The trial scenes are not as compelling. The white/black racial issue is again present, but it was better presented there, as well as the characterizations; and the evolution of the events much more gripping in its continuation. Callie Ruffin is a nice attempt at characterization, but she looks useless in the context and economy of the plot (nothing on a par with Nicholas Easter's in The Runaway Jury). A Time to Kill, and The Firm, with the gripping continuity of their action, were for this reader \\"no-put-down\\" books; this one needed 4 or 5 dragged-on, reading sessions. The final twist is not convincing. The impression is that Mr Grisham must have found himself in a hurry to deliver the manuscript to the publisher by the deadline."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I enjoyed reading this book as I usually do with Grisham's new novels. Though I read it in one day, and though the characters were described in a way that I felt like I got to know them, the plot and ending wasn't as developed or memorable as The Brethren or The Firm. As I came to the end of the book, I wondered if there couldn't be something that culd have been added to it. I felt that the mystery and ending intrigue could ahve been drawn out or further explained. I was just amazed as I came to the last twenty pages that it was all going to be wrapped up in that short amount of material. Sadly it was. I'd have given this book five stars had the ending been more developed."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"The plot was too similiar to that of &quot;A Time to Kill.&quot; This book was certainly not as good as that one but nevertheless enjoyable and a must read for Grisham fans. More time could have been spent on character developement and character relationships. This novel lacked the usual Grisham humor, complex characters, and plot twists. Overall, still a good read but not one of Grisham's best efforts."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Thought it would be another great courtroom thriller like Runaway Jury or The Partner. Instead, it's a long winded, wandering human interest story."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"In between the taut exciting thrillers Grisham used to wirte and the pointless drivel of A Painted House and Skipping Christmas. The first part was pretty good, not predictable at all, but then he just changed modes and starting droning on and on about boring small town life and didn't get back to the story until near the end. I long for the days of The Firm, A Time To Kill, The Partner, The Runaway Jury. Those were books I couldn't put down. It's been several years since Grisham's produced anything like that. This will be the last hardcover Grishal novel I buy--from now on, I wait for the paperback."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Told in first person, this latest Grisham tale is a plethora of interesting and eccentric characters, intrigue, realism and tension, and wonderful writing that we've all become accustomed to in a work by Grisham,Like &quot;A Painted House&quot; this book is set in the South. Like Grisham's legal thrillers, this one deals with trials, courtrooms, and everything in between.But this novel is a hybrid of all of his past (successful) attempts. This one blends his previous styles into a great melange of inspirational writing and plot. The premise alone should make you want to read it, but that aside, the execution and writing are marvelous. A truly enjoyable tale of small town life, mystery, and local color, all blended into a fun read.Also recommended: The Firm, Pompeii, Bark of the Dogwood, Drop City"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Who is the last juror? These characters are ones I couldn't get enough of. This may be John Grisham's finest work to date. The suspense is intense and the setting is another great tribute as with A Time to Kill, set in Mississippi. Don't miss this one. Grisham fans will love it, and if you're new to John Grisham, you will be hooked!"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"This was a very good book. I purchased the audio version and listened to it as I traveled from Houston to Atlanta. Grisham is a masterful storyteller, but I think we all agree with that.This book is a social commentary on Small Town, USA and gives one vivid images to nibble on. Who among us can't see Clanton, Missippi or these characters? Like another reviewer, Mr. Grisham could do us all a favor by giving Harry Rex, Judge Noose, and Rufus Buckley more page time. However, I, too, was a little perplexed why it was called the The Last Juror. Maybe someone much more analytical than I can answer that.What Grisham does better than almost anyone else is give us characters we love. Willie is likeable and you want him to succeed. Lucien is a shark and you want to hate him. Harry Rex is...Harry Rex. Danny Padget is a murderer and you want him to fry. The Ruffins are a loving family and Willie might as well be considered the ninth Ruffin(Aside a little confused about the Sam story, Could have been tied up more, but I'm splitting hairs here. Gotta find something to gripe about.) Throughout the novel, minor characters float in to give the book substance. They serve their purpose.I am a Grishamite. I don't love all of his books but I love most of his characters. Next to Baldacci, Pelecanos, and Patterson, he is one of the best. Some of the plots are outlandish and over the top, but that's his perogative. To one interested in a very good book, this one is worth a serious look. Great job, Mr. Grisham."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"As John D. MacDonald writes: &quot;Story. Story. Dammit, story! Story is something that happens to someone you have been led to care about.&quot; Don't look for that here. The Last Juror does nothing so much as suggest an author with a contract to deliver x number of books and needing to fill pages. There is no thrill here and little mystery, and when the mystery is revealed it is a writing cop out, not a natural evolution of story and character. Grisham writes a three-part novel: in the first he relates a horrible crime and boring trial (with none of the skills we have come to expect in these areas); then, in an interlude, Grisham writes &quot;My Little Town, Mississippi,&quot; essentially an authorial look at laws and culture in small town Mississippi; he then returns to the story he started with and tries to rekindle interest. There is no one to be interested in here and no suspense. He generated more suspense in the first ten pages of A Time to Kill than this entire book.I'm not holding Grisham to previous standards to say he should never change as a writer. But for a proven commercial writer and a proven storyteller, this is not a solid effort. It reads like a writer with writer's block, boredom, or detachment. I picture an agent saying, &quot;We need another lawyer book&quot; and Grisham saying, &quot;I want to write about other things,&quot; and the result is a subpar concoction of both.The saving grace is Grisham's writing ability, which is still up there among commercial fiction writing. He is always readable, something that can't be said of all top-selling fiction writers."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Help me finish this boring book. Stuck on page 200 or so and page after page of some boring town election. He cant create suspense, he can barely stay awake writing his own books. How did anyone finish this book?"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I believ the negative comments are from those who like CNN and USA Today - they like their stories in sound bites. This is a rich, warmly told tale that is a story, not a mystery, but a story. And a fine one at that."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I have to admit the last few books from John Grisham didn't exactly &quot;grab my attention&quot; to put it mildly. But this book made me have faith in Mr. Grisham's ability to get to an audience once again.Set in a small town in Clanton, Mississipi, Willie Traynor is not at first accepted by the townspeople. After a while, though, he is accepted by both the white and black population. But through one of his editorials, he does a human interest story on a black woman and her seven children that all obtained Phds. While doing an interview with this woman, they become the closest of friends.The book centers around the rape and murder of a young widow and mother. The crime was committed by Danny Padgitt, the Padgitt family that lives on an island and can literally get away with murder. But Danny is the first Padgitt actually convicted of a crime. After the trial is over and he is finally found guilty, he threatens the jury and tells them that he is going to get each and every one of them.The jury has a choice, death or life in prison. After much debate, they decide life in prison. Most people don't understand that &quot;Life&quot; in Clanton usually means ten years.Danny is released after nine years, and it seems as though he is carrying through with his threats. This is where the books takes a surprising turn. There are several deaths, is Danny carrying out his threats?I thorougly enjoyed this book and would recommend it. What got to me most was the ending.Recommend to anyone"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"&quot;He returned to Ford County, and the retribution began.&quot; Kudos to the person who wrote this line; you certainly know how to sell a book. You sold one to me, and I haven't bought a Grisham book in years. I thought I was in for a tightly-wound tale of suspense and intensity as a released killer wreaked vengeance on an entire jury, that it would come down to the last juror, and that he or she, along with the usual assortment of beer-drinking, barbeque loving, eccentric friends almost every Grisham main character has in tow, would triumph in a spectacular, bang-up conclusion. Not so.What I did get was Grisham's very accurate descriptions of small-town southern life. The town of Clanton is the true main character in this book, and it was an interesting enough character to keep me happy and reading. Also interesting is following Willie around as he tries to develop his paper into a publication people have to have. As usual, Grisham shows us that the path to success is certain to have its share of days when you feel like a loser or a fool.However, many things about the book bothered me. I realized early on who the real person to watch out for was; Grisham made it obvious. It left me wondering about Grisham's assessment of his readers' IQ. Another troubling aspect of the book was how certain events were described after the fact and with only a few sentences. It felt like he was a tour guide in a museum, running behind schedule, hurrying you through the exhibits with the condensed version of facts. Often times there was too much information given about things that didn't really matter and not enough about things that did. People appeared and disappeared with seemingly no other purpose than to pad a few paragraphs or pages. To be fair, in life we come into contact with lots of people each day who take up our time but will have little to do with the outcome of our personal stories. But in a book, if you take up lots of print, you better be about something important!To conclude, if you are a Grisham fan no matter what, read the book. You will enjoy it and think I don't know jack, giving it only 2 stars. There are some suprises and plenty of nice moments, the kind that make you think John Grisham would be a good guy to sit on the front porch with and wax poetic about life, spurred on by cold beer and a comfortable rocking chair."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"The book starts out in 1970 as a popular newspaper goes under. Enter Willie Traynor, a college dropout that stuns the local community with his quest to raise the newspaper from its ashes. This is soon accomplished with his daring editorial efforts and his coverage of a sadistic rape and murder that has been pinned on the town's secluded bootlegger family. Despite the influence of the Padgitt family in the community, Danny is sent to life in prison. Many viewed this as a tradeoff from the death penalty that he deserved, but regardless the community soon places the crime and the guilty party behind them as they move on with life.Nine years later, Danny's life sentence receives a parole. During this time, Traynor learns to adapt in a town known for unique characters and lack of trust from outsiders. When Danny is once again a free person, Traynor has more than his hands full to report on as jury members are turning up dead.True to Grisham's roots, this book returns to court action that made Grisham a household name. However, there are shades of the sentiment side he has recently displayed in such recent greats like Bleachers. If you like Grisham's work you are going to love this book!!!"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"In his latest novel, John Grisham has returned to the small town of Clanton, Mississippi, the scene of his first book A TIME TO KILL. Once again he has proven that he has the knack of drawing you into the book, compelling you to read more. I found that this was both good and bad in the case of THE LAST JUROR, good because I always had the sense that something was about to happen and I was desperate to find out what it was. Bad because, more often than not, I was left hanging.Covering the years 1970 to 1979, it's written in the first person from the point of view of Willie Traynor, a young outsider to the town who has just purchased the town newspaper. It's through his eyes that all the events in Clanton are reported.The big story of the day was the rape and murder of a young local woman who was able to identify her attacker as Danny Padgitt to her next-door neighbour. Much is made of the powerful and infinitely corrupt Padgitt family. We hear how dangerous they are when they're crossed, how ruthless they are when dealing with invaders to their land. They are an ever-present, menacing storm cloud lurking on the horizon of the peaceful town of Clanton. Traynor, as an outspoken mouthpiece against Danny Padgitt looks to have put himself firmly within the Padgitt's sights, as have the potential jurors for the trial.Callie Ruffin is the last juror chosen for the Danny Padgitt trial. She is a notable selection because she is the first black juror chosen in Ford County and she is a god-fearing mother of eight adult children and a friend of Willie Traynor. She is a fascinating character and her past is drawn out over a series of extravagant home cooked lunchtime meals that she prepared for Willie.As it turns out, the trial of Danny Padgitt is over one-third of the way into the book. From that point on it really reads like a study of life in a southern small town during the 1970's. Consequently the pace of the book settles down to match the comfortable lifestyle that comes with living in a small town. While this is fine and pleasant enough, it all became a bit frustrating after being revved up by the frenetic activity in the opening and the continual references of retribution that could possibly come from the Padgitt family.Admittedly, we do see some action later in the book, but these sequences too are punctuated by long pauses of inactivity. So much so that rather than building up tension and suspense, I found that it had the opposite effect and it was more a sense of relief that something was happening that I felt.I suppose the most damning observation I could make is the realisation that the anecdotes told to Willie about the misdeeds of the Padgitt family sounded a lot more interesting than the actual events of the book. The story of sheriff's deputies going missing on Padgitt land appeals to me a lot more than the manoeuvrings of minor politicians in an election race.It also seems that Grisham's chronic ending problem is continuing. I've been disappointed in the way Grisham has ended his books in the past (notably in THE FIRM, THE CLIENT and THE SUMMONS), often leaving the whole story unfinished at the final full stop. I felt that he did it again here. After meandering through town learning about every religious belief in the county, renovating Willie's house in record slowness and drawing out the discussion of whether or not to sell the newspaper, we were suddenly nearing the 350-page that appears to be Grisham's limit. Before I knew it, everything was wrapped up in a clumsy package and the book was finished. Long and carefully constructed plotlines were cut without a by your leave and characters who had become very familiar were abandoned.As mentioned at the start of the review, Clanton Mississippi was the setting of Grisham's first book, A TIME TO KILL and as such, we are reacquainted with a few of the characters from that book. Making his reappearance is Harry Rex Vonner, lawyer and source of all sorts of useful local knowledge for Traynor. Also, there's the deliciously unscrupulous defence attorney, Lucien Wilbanks, one of the better &quot;man you love to hate&quot; characters I've come across. Smaller appearances are made by D.A. Rufus Buckley and Judge Omar Noose who both have much larger roles in Grisham's earlier book.All is not lost with THE LAST JUROR. Read it for the pleasant imagery of rural living in Mississippi. Relax on Callie Ruffin's front porch over a delicious home-cooked meal. Delight in the increasingly profitable newspaper business built by Willie Traynor. But don't go looking for a tension-charged mystery."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"About halfway through this book I turned to the front and counted how many books the author had already written before this one...16. So this is his 17th novel. Like many other reviewers, my overall criticism is there is a lot of padding or \\"fill\\".

It is not even close to his other jury titled book \\"The Runaway Jury.\\" This books is very slow and the real mystery only begins in the last 50 pages. Up to that point, it is very slow and actually boring. Quite a drop-off from Grisham's usually high standards in my opinion"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Willie Traynor, a 23 years old, just out of college, sort of a long haired ivy league radical, comes South to find himself. He ends up greatly maturing as he becomes a newspaper reporter and then owner of the Ford County Times,a small circulation local paper which he builds up and ultimately sells for $1.5 million. Along the way there's plenty of excitement. The son of a wealthy family brutally rapes and murders an attractive young widow. When he's sentenced to prison he threatens to kill the jurors who put him away. When he's ultimately paroled the killings start. It's thought that he's the perpetrator. But it turns out that he wasn't. It was a deranged assistant prosecutor.

I felt like I knew all the characters pretty well, but I think a lot of it was unneccesary and just made the book kind of dry and boring in spots. Overall I think the book was pretty good. It could have been better though. Throughout the entire book it seems like you're getting set up for some huge dramatic ending. That dramatic ending never comes."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I am still a big fan of Grisham's earlier books, especially Pelican Brief, but I think he's run out of ideas. The Last Juror is tired, boring, derivative and a waste of time."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"After the travesty that was \\"King of Torts,\\" John Grisham returns with a novel that appears, on the cover, to be another legal thriller but is, in fact, something else entirely. This is not about courtroom theatrics or terrible murders or greedy, corrupt lawyers seeking justice that will benefit their pocketbooks. No, \\"The Last Juror\\" is much, much different than your typical Grisham fare.It is a story of humanity. John Grisham has entered a new field while treading on familiar territory. He has written something that touches the pulse of the 1970's in Ford County. This is the story of Willie Traynor, newspaper editor, and his friendship with Callie Ruffin, a black woman and mother of eight, and a fledgling newspaper founded on obituaries. Danny Padgitt's actions are known fairly early on, and there truly is no question as to his guilt.There are some courtroom theatrics here, but they are secondary to the relationship between Willie and Miss Callie; indeed, the courtroom scenes are secondary to the character development and onset of desegregation that the denizens of Ford County are faced with. If anything, \\"The Last Juror\\" is the sort of novel one would expect to read in a 20th Century literature class. There is a fair amount of suspense, and there is some criticism of the legal system (70's and current) and of course a bit of preaching, but it all works.Grisham has crafted one of his best novels and given us a slew of memorable characters; the Ruffin family will stay with you long after completing the novel. As will Willie and the eclectic bunch of \\"old folks\\" who dominate the town. Social criticism is also a bit heavy, with the arrival of Bargain City and the Padgitt clan's unsavory vocations. I would hesitate to compare this to such literary giants as \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" and \\"Huckleberry Finn,\\" the major theme in \\"The Last Juror\\" is similar to that found in both the aforementioned novels, that of racial tolerance and the transendance of boundaries.But, when the jurors start to fall, you will believe that Danny Padgitt is indeed guilty of fulfilling his promise...but then Grisham wants you to believe it, which makes the ending all the more impactful.Be wary, diehards and casual fans--this is not your typical John Grisham. It's something better."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"There are so many riviting aspects to this latest Grisham novel that it's hard to know where to begin. First, there is the old vs. the new with regards to the south--how it has changed, is changing, and will change. That in itself is enough for a book and reminds me of other writers who have tackled that slippery slope: McCrae in his Bark of the Dogwood and Conroy in Prince of Tides. But the most intriguing aspect of this Grisham book is his characters. Then again, that's always the most intriguing aspect of his work. In any other writer's hands, the character of Danny Padgitt (how's that for a white trash name?) would be a cardboard cut-out. But in Grisham's he's flesh-and-blood. And Danny literally &quot;gives&quot; the newspaper in the town new life when he commits a murder. As with all media, they love sensationalism, and the Ford County Times--the paper that Willie Traynor now owns--is no exception. Seizing the opportunity, Traynor splashes the gory details all over &quot;the Times&quot; and the result is that he an instant celebrity and also a marked man. Padgitt finally gets his, but not full-out. His life sentence is evidently not quite as &quot;lifelong&quot; as everyone thought, and as soon as he's released, the killing starts. This, all because of his statement to the jury on his way out that he will have his revenge on the jurors. Lovely. Especially if you're one of them. All through this excellent plot, Grisham weaves the lives (or lackthereof) of the colorful characters in the town--yet another aspect of southern writing (again, McCrae or Conroy), and it's really these people that create the landscape and backdrop for this book. The entire novel reads like a well-done combination of Grisham's legal thrillers, his homage to Mississippi (A Painted House), and his foray into small town Southern America. Without a doubt this is his best effort to date."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Last week I finished listening to John Grisham's The Last Juror during my daily commute. I was very impressed. The first notable thing about this story is that while there is some courtroom time, it is NOT about a court case or a lawyer, etc, like many of Grisham's books. Grisham is a fine writer, but in this story about a small southern town and it's very young, very green newspaper editor/writer, he outdid himself. I'll warn that it doesn't have quite as much \\"excitement\\" and \\"suspense\\" as you occasionally find in his courtroom thrillers. It's more laidback than those, although there is some suspense and a touch of blood and gore. This story is about people. It's about a town that changes over time and the townsfolk who change with it - some with relish and some kicking and screaming. It's about Willie Trainer, the newspaper owner who comes to town, an outsider, buys the newspaper, and over time gains the respect, loyalty and love of the town he serves. The true beauty of this book, though, is the incredible way that Mr. Grisham introduces you to the characters and the townspeople. Each character in this book is a story finely woven. You're not reading/hearing that Joe Blow eats eggs for breakfast and is wearing black pants and a blue shirt. You learn about these people: their past, their present, and you look forward to their future. The writing is masterful in the creation of characters that we care about, are interested in and who shape this story. When I finished the story, I actually left the radio off for the rest of my ride home just so I could think about what a wonderful story it was and how much I enjoyed it.Following Grisham's other non-courtroom drama's, specifically A Painted House, I see his talent is truly in character development. But, while A Painted House was good, it wasn't like this story. This had a much more satisfying plot, filled with wonderful characters, and an end that was somewhat expected, but that provided an end to a tale and to an era. I recommend this story. The narration was wonderful. Don't go into it expecting the same old Grisham, though. Go into it expecting a good story about people who touch you.This review is in reference to the unabridged audio version and the narration was excellent on this version. This is definitely a book for the commute."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"If you read the description on the back cover, you will get the idea that this is a taut thriller about a convicted murderer seeking revenge on those that put him away. Doesn't that sound exciting? Actually, it is anything but. This is John Grisham's ode to life in a small southern town and his regret for what such towns have lost. While the trial-related story starts off promisingly enough, the trial ends about a third of the way into the book, but the story just lumbers on without direction. Through the eyes of his narrator, a young newspaper editor, Grisham takes the soapbox on issues such as desegregation and a not very veiled attack on Wal-Mart and its effect on small town America, revealing his liberal leanings. The novel should more appropriately have been called &quot;Dinners with Miss Callie&quot; since much of the the book centers around his relationship with a middle-aged black woman from the &quot;wrong side of the tracks.&quot; Pages and pages are dedicated simply to descriptions of the southern dishes she prepares. If this is your cup of tea, then by all means, pick up a copy of the Last Juror. But don't be fooled by the marketing campaign."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"The 1970s . . .a small town in the South is the setting for this latest Grisham novel. That, plus the colorful cast of eccentric characters might be dangerously cliched material in any other author's hands, but not in Grisham's. This book is like a cross between &quot;A Painted House&quot; and some of his better known courtroom books. It's actually not so much a &quot;mystery&quot; as it is just a good story, interestingly told.Also recommended: The Firm, Bark of the Dogwood, Capital Crimes"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I actually managed to read \\"The Last Juror\\" without knowing anything more than it was the \\"new\\" John Grisham novel. From the title I assumed that it was about a trial and about a juror for that matter, in a similar vein to \\"The Runaway Jury,\\" but that is not really the case even though the cove photograph certain reinforces the idea. There is a juror and there is a trial, but there are parts of a larger tapestry told by the book's narrator.This narrator, who is not the titular figure, was born Joyner William Traynor but becomes known as Willie when he ends up working on a small newspaper in Clanton, Mississippi. Actually he ends up doing more than that, becoming the owner of the \\"Times\\" through a couple of simple twists of fate, although he never really graduated with a journalism degree from that \\"Ivy League\\" school Syracuse. Will, as he called himself, had his Triumph Spitfire and his long hair, but not much else going for him. However, this person Willie becomes rather interesting as he tries to build up the circulation of his little newspaper in Ford County. After all, even if he hails from Memphis he is still considered a Yankee by the people of Mississippi.Along the ways he makes a friend of Miss Callie Ruffin, an elderly black woman who has eight children, the first seven of which have earned doctorates; we will learn about why the youngest child does not have his Ph.D. yet in the course of this tale. However, everything changes when the most sensational murder case anybody in Ford County can remember happens. Willie knows this is his big chance to boost circulation for his newspaper. However, this means crossing the family that has been running Ford County behind the scenes for over a hundred years.Grisham makes the point several times that Mississippi is behind the times more than any other state in the Union and his Author's Note at the end acknowledges that he has mistreated some of the bad and weak laws that existed in the state in the 1970s, the decade in which this story was set. But \\"The Last Juror\\" really is about changing times, even if the changes come too late in the estimation of some. What Willie does to not only make Clanton a better place but to become a part of his adopted town is a recurring theme, even if it never seems to be the driving narrative of the novel.The only real step in the story is when things start happening towards the end of the book and everybody in town assumes they know who is behind, whereas everybody that I know who has read the book (okay, that is just two other people, but all of us agreed) jumped to the right conclusion. Not in terms of who, mind you, but in terms of what was really happening. You would think some of the characters in the town of Clanton would have at least had an idle thought in this direction, but Grisham is being so blatant in ignoring the obvious alternative explanation that it is impossible not to guess what is really going on.\\"The Last Juror\\" is set in the Deep South and has the rhythm of a story told on the front porch. Like many such stories it is about much more than what it is supposed to be about, so those who are compelled to find linear narratives in the novels they read are going to be frustrated, but hopefully not disappointed by Grisham's tale. You may not come to a final conclusion about what this novel is really about until you have read the final page, but there is really nothing wrong with that, even if it swims against the tide of contemporary best selling fiction. This is not a great novel or even a great Grisham novel, but it is a solid yarn, his best in years, and at this point in his career that may well be as good as it gets."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Grisham returns to Clanton, Mississippi, home of his previous novels \\"A Time to Kill\\" and \\"The Summons\\", with a story that starts out without the lawyers, but quickly falls back into the popular formula, even bringing back the character of Harry Rex Vonner, who stole the show in \\"The Summons\\".The central character this time (Willie Traynor) is again a young, white male, lazy on the educational side and looking for an easy way through life. Only this time, he's not a lawyer dabbling in torts (as per \\"The King of Torts\\"), but a journalist who takes over a newspaper in Clanton in the seventies. He's got cheap accommodation, a couple of local characters to help him along, a rich relative, and lots and lots of good luck, all of which combine to make him a success story.The brutal rape and murder of a local woman sells a lot of newspapers, and his fearless coverage of the case and subsequent trial make him a lot of friends, but also some deadly enemies, particularly the secretive underworld bootlegging family of the accused killer Danny Padgitt.It's a pleasant enough story about the affairs of a small town and the running of a small newspaper, and covers cook-outs, drinking, families, obituaries, Sunday sermons, poker, cornbread and chitlins, as well as racism and the closing of small businesses by the wheels of progress, but it's when the lawyers and legal system are called into action that things get ugly.The plot thins towards the end, when people who served on the jury for the murder case start getting killed, and everybody keeps barking up a convenient tree when their reason for doing so makes no sense whatsoever.The ending is somewhat anticlimactic, with hints being thrown here and there in earlier chapters, and Grisham again wraps it up as quickly as possible.All things considered though, it's a good read, and one of his better ones in recent times.Amanda Richards, December 30, 2004"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"John Grisham displays the ability to write a vaiety of types of books, all entertaining and unique.The Last Juror was not as fast paced and full of plot twists as some of his other works, but I think he was trying to portray life in an unspoiled, slow-paced Mississippi town in the 1970s - one that clung to Old South values and Old South traditions.I thought the commentary on how \\"Bargain City\\" swoops in and impacts small town America was interesting.I was very pleased with this book, and I am also proud of Mr. Grisham for keeping his books mostly clean and sticking to his faith in God."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Only Grisham could write characters that you hate so much, yet don't mind being around. It's the mark of a great writer; one that is able to keep your interest in a character while letting you know he's the worst possible excuse for a human being on the planet. Such is the case with Danny Padgitt-the murderer and sociopath in Grisham's \\"The Last Juror.\\" But Danny is only one of a handful of people that populate this small town where a newspaper has failed and, even though recently purchased, needs a shot in the arm to revive it completely. Enter Mr. Padgitt. And while he helps out with circulation figures-albeit in an indirect and unintentional way-he's also the vehicle that pulls the plot along, swearing to exact revenge on the jury that put him away for life. Life turns out to be only nine years and people start to die shortly thereafter-you do the math. At any rate, \\"The Last Juror\\" is an excellent read, full of great descriptions, wonderful characters, and a great plot. But then, you be the jury.Also recommended: A Time to Kill, The Firm, Bark of the Dogwood"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"In my (December 17, 2003) review of &quot;Bleachers&quot;, I claimed that &quot;I'm mildly anticipating John Grisham's next legitimate novel--&quot;The Last Juror&quot;--due early next year.&quot; In that statement, I should've used the word 'greatly' instead of 'mildly', because Grisham's latest legal-thriller was nothing short of spectacular! I've never read one of Grisham's full-length novels in one day, but I did with &quot;The Last Juror.&quot; I bought the copy I have Friday evening (Feb. 6), which I began reading Saturday afternoon (12:30 p.m.) and, pretty much in one sitting, after about twelve hours, finished reading Sunday morning (12:30 a.m.). I loved this book; I've never given a 5-star rating as part of any book review I've written, but &quot;The Last Juror&quot; could be Grisham's best work to date. I find that I can't really compare the novel to any of Grisham's previous &quot;legal-thriller&quot; novels; &quot;The Last Juror&quot; seems to be a cut above what he's put out since 1991. The story was compelling, the plot wasn't as formulaic/predictable, the characters were great; and even Grisham's writing style seemed to have improved (more refreshing and not as boring). If there are readers who have given up on Grisham, then ol' John deserves a second chance because of &quot;The Last Juror.&quot;A Must Read!"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"A college journalism dropout buys a struggling rural county newspaper in Mississippi, only to find himself embroiled in a sensational murder trial. Really a portrait of the deep rural South in the decade after the end of Jim Crow, with some crime and suspense thrown in.But Grisham uses much of the novel to editorialize, through his protagonist, against the Vietnam War, against Wal-Mart, and in favor of forced busing. The only area where conservatives come out well is where some of the best characters attend church regularly. Read some politically incorrect history after reading this one to get a balanced view."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Kind of reminds me of a good ol' boy talking about the ol' days and oh, by the way, let's throw about 4 pages of story into all the reminiscing."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"The title completely makes no sense although there is a jury that is a major part of this story.

Ok, the author was hungry -- we get it.The church visitations were also useless (and there were a lot of those!). And gee, got any political convictions you'd like to share? ZZZzzzzzz.Michael Beck did a fine job as reader (although Harry Rex sounded like he was speaking with large wad of chew stuffed in his mouth). I just didn't like any of the characters (Willie was such a pompous so-and-so).This was not a courtroom drama or a revenge thriller.

The book slowly plodded along with no real direction. Not much a story: 25-year-old Willie buys a small-town newspaper and writes about the townsfolk. A man, Padgitt, kills and rapes a woman. Man is not sentenced to death penalty because of a hung jury. Newspaper sales go up. Willie befriends an older black woman, writes about her family, has lunch with her every Thursday. 10 years later, Padgitt is released from jail. Willie sells the newspaper. Black woman dies of heart attack. The end. Come on!!! This book was awful.Like most readers, I read for fun. This book was not fun.

I've actually stopped reading it about 3/4 the way through because i have ZERO interest in finishing it. It is very boring, has no suspense, and jumps around a lot. I kept waiting for something to happen and nothing ever did."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"The year is 1970, and callow college dropout Will Traynor, with six months of journalism experience, buys the local newspaper in Clanton, Mississippi. The business is moribund until a woman is raped and murdered, handing Will the opportunity to triple its circulation overnight. What follows is the story of the trial and its aftermath ten years later, when murderer is paroled. Along the way, Will, who has morphed into \\"Willie\\", makes some good friends and some colorful ones, learns about and finds gradual acceptance in town, and chronicles the changes that rock the Clanton's foundations: the decade ushers in racial integration, the residents face up to the outlaw Padgitt clan, big box retailers change the face of Main Street, and the controversy over Viet Nam grows ever hotter.The plot of the Last Juror evolves slowly, although the intermittent violence that erupts prevents the development of ennui. This novel's strength lies in its characters, particularly those of Will and Miss Callie, who comes to serve as a moral beacon in the young man's life. But all of the characters ring true, from the shady lawyer to the newspaper's redneck photographer. Grisham has become a master at evoking the atmosphere of the deep South, and a sense of nostalgia pervades throughout. But this is a story of change, its central issues revolving around questions of integrity and honor. It opens and closes with the writing of obituaries, but the Will who is writing the last one has come a long way. So has Clanton.Memorable, and highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I am from Mississippi and went to school at Ole Miss, so, I am supposed to love John Grisham's books. I used not be able to wait until the next book came out.I find his books to all be cut from the same cloth. What happened to the great suspense books like The Firm and The Pelican Brief? It seems to me that Mr. Grisham is losing his passion for writing. Much like the main character in this book, I think that Mr. Grisham is just trying to produce a story fast enough to meet a deadline set by his publisher and just good enough to pass the minimum requirements needed to sell a few copies.In a nutshell, Mr. Grisham's books are becoming steadily worse. My advice--don't waste your time reading this book."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"In \\"The Last Juror,\\" John Grisham attempts to blend the style of the legal thrillers which made his career with the old-fashioned and atomspheric quality of \\"The Painted House.\\" The result is not unsuccessful, but it's also not up to Grisham's usual standard.Grisham tries to capture the feeling of rural Mississippi in the 1970s, but his descriptions aren't very period-specific; the story could be taking place at any point in the past 60 years. Sentences are often confusingly constructed, as if Grisham wrote the novel in a hurry and didn't edit it. Miss Callie is a nicely drawn, complex character, but the rest of the cast is superficial by comparison.The dust jacket tries to play up the suspense element: \\"...men and women who served on a jury nine years ago are starting to die one by one--as a killer exacts the ultimate revenge.\\" But don't be fooled: the killing of jurors doesn't begin until the last fifth of the book. I'm terrible at figuring out mysteries, but the identity of this killer was obvious even to me.Grisham tries to throw too much into the mix: life in rural Mississippi, desegregation, Vietnam, a discourse on Southern churches, an expose of the legal and parole system in Mississippi in the 1970s, a Wal-Mart style incursion -- all in addition to his legal story. There is so much material that nothing can be treated in depth. Nothing, that is, except the marvelous descriptions of Southern cuisine.\\"The Last Juror\\" is an enjoyable read, but it is not up to the quality I have come to expect from such a fine author as John Grisham."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"As novels go, this one is a bit like Grandma's Oldsmobile, that she takes out for church once a week, or a convertible with its top down on a bumpy road. If you're in a hurry to get somewhere, it might drive you crazy. If you're willing to enjoy some scenery along the way, this might be the vehicle for you.The focus of the story is less on one particular juror -- in fact, it is not even clear what the title has to do with anything in the plot -- as on ten years of a small southern town as seen through the eyes of the young man who buys the town newspaper. The journalist, who narrates the story, tells his adventures with moonshine, desegregation, small town politics, the invasion of soul-snatching malls, a lunatic and a drunk or two, remodeling a house, learning how to eat southern, and, yes, a murder trial and revenge killings. The hero here is a writer, not a lawyer -- does the change of roles mark the evolution of Grisham's consciousness? Anyway, I just finished writing a book myself, and was therefore in a leisurely, Sunday afternoon mood, and enjoyed the slow and meandering drive through town."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Mr. Grisham remembered the first rule of fiction that he followed in A Time to Kill. He wrote what he knew. He finally returns to Clanton, Mississippi with both a great legal story (with the legal inaccuracies Mr. Grisham admits) and great characters - many of whom the reader will recognize from A Time to Kill. Despite the fact that the main character is a journalist rather than an attorney, this book strikes some of the same tones as A Time to Kill.I have always thought A Time to Kill was Mr. Grisham's best book. The Last Juror is on the same level. The characters are fascinating. The story is intriguing and has just enough twists and turns to be believable."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"What a fantastic book! No one writes characters or tells a story like John Grisham. I think this is my favorite book of his yet. It's kind of a cross between his thrillers and dramas (like a Painted House-also excellent). The story moves along so quickly I was half-way through the book before I knew it. This is one of the few books I'll read once a year or so."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I read this book on a 15 hour airplane trip. I have read 3-4 other early Grisham novels, and I much prefer this novel. This is not a novel for suspense - even though the back cover tries to advertise it as such. It is a coming of age story set within a small southern town in the 1970's. I found the novel's protagonist, college dropout Willie Traynor, especially likable, and enjoyed seeing him mature as the story progressed. While some of the characters may be slightly underdeveloped and appear stereotyped, I don't believe this impacted much on the story.The ending was a bit disappointing, but not because it was predictable. The ending didn't do justice to the great character Grisham had painstakingly developed. Not that I was looking for Willie to have an epiphany, but I would have appreciated more exploration of how Willie dealt with the final events in the book. As a result, the ending felt rushed.Overall, if you like coming of age stories this Grisham novel would be a great read.Incidentally, this book is one of the few Grisham novels that I think could be made into a decent movie."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Thank you Mr. Grisham for returning to the story lines that I fell in love with from your pen after THE FIRM. This story was especially interesting to me...because the main character, the 25 year old buys the local newspaper...which was in trouble. You used this character to weave a small town story that kept me laughing, smiling and sometimes mad me angry! (that's what small towns will do for you! :-)Well I am the owner of a publication and found ALL of what you wrote concerning subscriptions and readership quite interesting, to say the least &amp; 100% TRUE. You really did an excellent job of character development...even to the siblings who were landlords. I don't like leaving reviews which tell TOO much of the story because that discourages (in a lot of cases) others from buying/reading the book....so I will simply say this....for anyone who takes the time to read your reviews of this book...this is a definite Grisham must read.

While the characters were enjoyable, I'm not quite sure there was a point to the book at all. There was no suspense, or mystery, or anything worth grasping. It went along at a snails pace and I think this could have been written in 100 pages instead of 355 pages. Don't waste your time or money."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"After reading The Brethern, and The Summons, it seemed pretty clear that John Grisham's work was going downhill. A Painted House, Skipping Christmas and Bleachers were all pretty good, but not in his usual genre of legal thrillers. Then, with King of Torts, although I didn't like it as much as his earlier books, I thought he was on the way back up. The Last Juror proves that this is true.With a compelling story, great characters and plenty of courthouse drama, Grishma creates a feeling similar to his earlier books, A Time to Kill and The Chamber. Having never lived in a small town, I don't know how accurate Grisham's picture of it is, however, the important part is he makes it seem beievable, as well as interesting. I think the courtroom and the small town are where Grisham's storytelling abilities really shine, and getting away form that has made his more recent legal thrillers suffer. I'm glad to see him return to it in The Last Juror.I hope Grisham's next book continues the improvement that I have seen since The Summons, which I thought was his worst book to date. Grisham fans, as well as any fans of the genre should enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"John Grisham's latest, THE LAST JUROR, is his first novel since A TIME TO KILL to be sent in Ford County, Mississippi . . .I've never been to the either the fictional setting or state, but it sure feels like I know it from reading this latest legal thriller . . . the characters all come alive, in large part because the author is so talented in using dialogue that helps move the pace along at near-breakneck speed.JUROR is about a 23-year old college dropout who assumes ownership of a once bankrupt newspaper . . . when a brutal murder occurs, circulation increases as all the gruesomedetails are reported . . . when the murderer is released afternine years because in Mississippi in 1970, &quot;life didn't necessarily mean life,&quot; all hell breaks loose.I really feel like I got to know Willie Traynor, as well as manyof his colorful friends and acquaintances . . . in addition, Iliked the book's ending . . .

I think John Grisham should take a few years off and then maybe he would be able to write like he did 10 years ago. I plodded through this book hoping it would get better, not really caring about the characters and finding it very predictable. It never did get better but it did end!"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"It is true, The Last Juror is a different style than other Grisham novels. But this is not entirely a bad thing. While his early work had fast-moving stories that kept you reading, the dialogue was often stilted, the characters poorly drawn, and the descriptions hackneyed. That said, they were darn good reads.The Last Juror is a good read too, but if you pick it up expecting him to rehash The Firm, you'll be disappointed, as witnessed by the number of negative reviews. Personally, I was pleased by the developments in his style. I spent Part 1 being sure I had read this book before. And I had; it bears great resemblance to his earlier work. Part 2 is where it becomes poetic, an homage to slow, small-town Southern life, and the improvements in Grisham's actual wordsmithing become evident.Part 3 is the weakest - it feels rushed to wrap things up, and the ending was fairly dull. But I was entranced by his descriptions and pleased by how rich and clear Clanton became.Look, if you want to read The Firm, or A Time to Kill, read them. No one will think less of you. But if you want to chart this author's progress, this book is an excellent example."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I consider myself a huge Grisham fan. I thoroughly enjoy his writing but I also notice the decline in substance of his material. Lack of new material? Boredom? The Last Juror is not up to par with his first few published books, notably, A Time to Kill and The Firm, books I enjoyed immensely and couldn't put down. This book I was able to walk away from for days without missing it. It was disappointingly predictable and at times, annoying. I was extremely annoyed by the ease of the main character, Willie's life even though he tried to make us think it was so difficult and painstaking at times. Things just seemed to fall into his lap without much effort. Poor Kid &lt;insert sarcasm&gt;. Willie's relationship with Miss Callie although I applaud Mr. Grisham's attempt to prove racial tolerance and acceptance by his main character, I was annoyed by the blatant stereotypes in which he wrote his black characters. Even though he had all of the Ruffin children earning doctorate degrees, you never saw any of them actually working, especially the women. They were always in the kitchen cooking and their husbands were almost obedient little children. The women always rushed to the kitchen to cook or get food and this is one of the typical Aunt Jemima stereotypes of black women (including being extremely over weight). It was not believable to me that Willie would have been as accepted to the Ruffin family as he was in the book, or that he would have taken the time to be a family chauffer or mediator. Willie laud and loathed Clanton in the same chapter and by the end of the book we really wasn't sure how he felt about living there. Not Grisham's best and it seemed he was reaching for a story here. I think its time for me to retire him."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"For a John Grisham book, I was a bit disappointed with the writing style. It took me at least 100 pages to become remotely interested and even then I still wanted to put it down. The storyline seemed interesting enough: In 1970, one of Mississippi's more colorful weekly newspapers, The Ford County Times, went bankrupt until a young mother was brutally raped and murdered by a member of the notorious Padgitt family. After being sentenced to &quot;life&quot; in prison, &quot;life&quot; in Mississippi doesn't really mean &quot;life in prison&quot;.

But this book was a huge disappointment. There was way too much time spent talking about church visits and introducing yet another new undeveloped character.

The nine years that Padgitt spends in jail could have and should have been condensed!"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"After I have read this book, I had the feeling to be in Southern, with its hot and humidity, but I had preferred a different story to spend my holidays. The title is not what you expect, because there is a trial, yes, and a jury, yes, but is a small part of the book. While you are reading The Last Juror, you are learning how was the life in Claton (Miss) and how a 21 years old, can run a paper with a loan from his grandma.The book is as reading obituaries, nice ones, but no more."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this Grisham novel.

Like other reviewers, I will say that many Grisham fans probably won't enjoy this book, since it is so different from most of his legal thrillers. But I think Last Juror leaves no doubt that Grisham is more than just a fly by night bestselling author. He is actually a good writer."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I've enjoyed a few Grisham novels but this one fell mostly flat for this reader.

It gave you the facts very detailed. The Last Juror gave you the point of view from a new perspective, an outsider who came in and bought a newspaper. Instead of telling you the facts from a jury member or lawyers it let you see how the community felt through all of this. All in all it is a good story, and different those most of Grisham's books."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"That is how the book is written. The story is told through the perspective of an outsider by the name of Willie Traynor who came in, bought a local county newspaper, and turned it around to not only cover the county news and regain its profitability, but it made the locals talk and discuss what is happening in their community.There is a gruesome murder. Traynor covered the trial and the sentencing. Following this, the book covers the story of the town through the eyes of Traynor. It is even told in the first person from his perspective. This continues for the course of a decade, including to the point the murderer is let out on parole. While this book does progress slowly in terms of the main plot line, it wonderfully portrays the life of a small, sleepy Mississippi town and the issues that such towns faced through the 1970s.The ending occurs fast and is rather dramatic, with a surprise ending that will keep you turning the pages right to the very end."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"The Last Juror by John Grisham is not his typical legal thriller, but is more a coming of age story of a young reporter, Willie Traynor and the southern town he comes to call his home. He comes to Clanton as a college dropout, working as a cub reporter on the town's small newspaper. Within a couple of months, the owner of the newspaper has died and Willie, through a helpful investment from a rich relative, finds himself the owner, publisher and editor of the paper. Soon after he assumes ownership, the town is rocked by the brutal rape and murder of a young widow, Rhoda Kaselaw. In her dying words, she accuses Danny Padgett, a member of a powerful family that has been notorious for years for engaging in crimes ranging from drug dealing, to smuggling, to running moonshine back in the days of Prohibition. Despite the implicit knowledge of the family's criminal activities, no member of the family had ever been arrested until Danny Padgett was arrested for Rhoda Kaselaw's murder.At the surface, this novel is about the trial of Danny Padgett, who is convicted and sentenced to life in prison, and then released after nine years. After his release, a series of murders occurs among the members of the jury that convicted him.All of this is, however, merely the dressing for the real story, which is the growth of Willie from a naive, liberal kid who plans to sell the paper as soon as it starts showing a profit, into a well-respected member of the community. The book also traces his friendship with Miss Callie Ruffin, the first black woman to register to vote in Ford County and, with the trial of Danny Padgett, the first black woman to be seated on a jury.It also details the growth of the town of Clanton from a pre-Civil Rights era southern town to a modern town that has faced its racist past.This is a lovely book, at times humorous and at times sad, sometimes even occasionally scary, but more than anything, it is a life story. Those readers who pick it up hoping to find the thrill and suspense of Grisham's early novels will be disappointed by the gentile descriptions of luncheons with Miss Callie. But those who are interested in a rich story will find that as the book develops, they not only fall in love with Miss Callie, but they develop a deep respect and admiration for Willie Traynor, as he transforms from a callow youth into a responsible and prestigious adult."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"This is the first time I have read a book by John Grisham and I think that this one was AMAZING. It takes you on a wild adventure from the eyes of a newspaper owner by the name of William Traynor. He winds up meeting new friends Miss Callie and Harry Hex. As a murder unfolds in this town he must recount all the news and other things going on in the town. But soon the jurors are all dying one by one by an anyonimous killer. Now he has to cope with more murders and the saftey of his friends. I think that this is a great book and I would recomend it to anyone in the feeling for an exciting book full of murder and deseption."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Interesting, richly described, yet like so many of the detailed meals Grisham (it's clearly intervention time, John has become a full blown 'Foodie') has so lavishly described in \\"The Last Juror\\" and \\"The Broker,\\" I was left with heartburn and an uneasy I don't think it was worth the effort feeling. Ultimately, it was satisfying, but it didn't leave me wanting more.Wonderful subtle humor sprinkled masterfully throughout the work to lighten the weighty themes. In general, the subplots often meandered for page after page, but frequently led nowhere; obviously, designed to tantalize and engage the reader of possible conflicts and situations that never materialize. All too often, Grisham's characters seemed more likeCaricatures of polarized moral extremes that can be only be written with the moral certitude of today's lenses, than truly flesh and blood characters -- but thankfully this work is much less preachy than \\"The Street Lawyer.\\"For me, the ending was a half frozen peach cobbler, sure you can swallow it, but it wasn't what you were expecting from an author of Grishman's talent -- it was like catching the last ten seconds of Paul Harvey's \\"The Rest of the Story\\" without truly having all the details to lead you to the \\"ah-ha moment.\\"After reading the book, I am beginning understand why AAA used to issue advisories against out of state motorists driving in parts of Mississippi and Louisiana. Sure there are some great people, some interesting sites, but is the risk worth the reward?"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"After THE PAINTED HOUSE, I stayed away from Grisham's books for a long time. But I remember loving some of his early stuff so picked up the audiobook of THE LAST JUROR, and am so glad I did. The story is told in a languid style that fits the genteel, slow pace of the South. Grisham focuses on character development and does an excellent job. I felt I knew these people (could literally pick them out in our local town) with all their quirks and passions. While not technically a thriller, the story's plot, pace, and descriptive style kept me listening.I was sad for the story to end and would love to read another Grisham novel set in Clanton, Mississippi, to find out what Willie Traynor and the rest are up to."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"The CD's were purchased to entertain me in my car while driving the long road back home from work each afternoons. It exceeded all my expectations and beyond. The sound was of very high quality so I could have heard while driving with or without the windows down. The narrator's diction was clear and flawless. Good product."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Definitely - miles off being his best and certainly not a good book.What I hated about this book was Grisham's inability to hold himself back from rehearsing his pet likes and dislikes.Why do I need detailed descriptions of all the scrummy grub our protagonist is eating? What is the point? No wonder Americans are so obese with this obsession about food. Grisham - it seems - can't go five minutes without mentioning ice-cream - or pizza - or potato with gravy.It's truly pathetic. Why doesn't he just put a bundle of recipes or extracts from his fave menus at the back and just get on with story?What is ironic (and Grisham can't see this) - is that our wonderful black lady mother figure dies of a heart attack and stroke - all because she crammed so much grub in her mouth and fed the world with fat soaked dinners.Anyway - we are treated to drooling mentions of Italy - which is another of Grisham's pet love themes. Then we get the hate themes: the Vietnam war and the rise of the supermarkets.STOP PREACHING JOHN and write a decent book.This was a reasonably interesting book spoiled by Grisham's prejudices and passions.There is also the archetypal Grisham hero: a loser with bad attitude who finds his calling and becomes an overnight success - full of swaggering bravado - total courage and who wins 100% in the end.YAWN - this character is often in Grisham's books and it's boring.I recently read his book \\"The Litigators\\" and this was such a joy - when compared to this tired hackneyed ole gruel."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"This was a first. I enjoy Grisham's books. But this one fell off hard. Perhaps at 1/3 its length it probably would have held together. It's stretched way too far. I finally quite halfway. Not unpleasant. Just mind-boggingly slow. He's not a deep writer. If he doesn't keep it moving everybody's in trouble. Way slow. Only have so much time in this world."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Don't know why I waited so long to read this book. It is a very different story from Grisham. The pace is slower, maybe a bit too slow here and there. But for the most part, a good read. It was interesting watching Willie, as a 23 year old, becoming an owner/publisher, and then seeing how he matured over the years. It was also interesting having a story set in the 1970's during Vietnam, and set in the South, with such a huge gap between whites and blacks, but changing for the better as the story progressed. The pacing may be too slow for some readers, but for me, it was a good story."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"This novel was much more character driven than plot driven than other Grisham novels I've read. I enjoyed the first person narrative and the way the characters became real. This wasn't the kind of book that so gripped me so that I had to rush to read it in one setting, but instead one that I was able to take more time to savor and enjoy the nuances of some of the southern flavors and smells. Enjoyable book."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Like the past few efforts from grisham, this one catches it's stride after a couple of boring chapters, keeps you plodding along out of mild curiosity, blazes through a bunch of frivilous events near the end, then plunges you off a cliff with no climax, and a confusing \\"resolution\\". My love for courtroom novels, and grisham's earlier work keep me searching for his long awaited return to form. This isn't it."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"This is the first book I have read by John and I did enjoy it, but only when I had reached to the 8th Chapter. I found it hard to follow at first as I am not used to his style of writing or this kind of crime/thrillerIt was a bit disappointing about the story line as I thought it may have more to do with the trial and conviction of Danny Padgitt, but it was more about the town and the people in it. (this was nice though as I feel like I know the characters well).It is a very slow paced book and wraps up the story at the last 80 pages or so.I read this 360 page long book in 3 weeks as i found it hard to get into, however I will buy more of Johns books as i know a lot of readers who highly recommend him."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"He's still the best! Grisham has it down pat as a fascinating lawyer and story tell. Read all his books."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Always a big fan of Grisham. As is typical for him he speaks in the first person, but in the role of a lawyer. In this case he is a journalist. A dropout from a private northern university, he picks up a gig as an intern/apprentice for a small town weekly paper. Because of his background, he is not easily embraced by the locals. He eventually accepts his name as \`Willie'.Be patient, he often shifts from storyline to personal details. Caution to the reader: these details are important to the storyline.Taking place in the 70s, the theme addresses Civil Rights and its impact upon the Deep South.Beginning with a murder and the subsequent trial, the main plot deals with the aftermath of a lenient sentence. The sentence is believed to be the product of a powerful family of the defendant, which is at best on the margins of the local society. The murderer is paroled far too early and the events that follow traumatize the town. As threatened by the murderer, the jurors are, one-by-one being bumped off.Even though the story appears to be about the murder, murderer, and the victims, it is really about the personal development of Willie. The identity of the person responsible is left almost to the end. The true ending however, is Willie's soliloquy about what he must do."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Being an avid reader of John Grisham's novels I've reluctantly come to the conclusion he's run out of those superb story ideas that has made him famous. While \\"The Last Juror\\" will hold the interest of many people, it is most likely a different group of people than those who devoured books such as \\"The Firm\\", \\"A Time To Kill\\", \\"The Client\\", \\"The Pelican Brief\\" and \\"The Partner\\".\\"The Last Juror\\" is more a description of a small town newspaperman and his relationship with the last juror chosen for a trial, than it is a legal drama. It continues the slide from greatness, a slide including \\"The King of Torts\\", \\"The Summons\\" and \\"The Painted House\\". All are descent writings in their own right, but are a departure from the action and intrigue that most of his fans long for."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I bought this book because the synopsis sounded good and because I knew John Grisham had a reputation of being a great author of suspense novels. This book was ok, but just ok. There wasn't any suspense that I could see, and it wasn't the type of book I couldn't put down. It was just a nice little tale of a town and it's people. Not a typical Grisham novel."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"In this novel John Grisham has created an in depth and fascinating study of a small southern town and all its characters, tracking their growth and development over time. He details food, customs, race relations and politics. However, that is most definitely not what I wanted from a Grisham novel with a legal title. I wanted suspense and thrill. This dragged on with Michner-like detail providing occasional clues to the secondary legal plot while chronicling history. The denoument was highly anticlimactic. Read it for lovely historical fiction, but not if you want hardhitting, riveting thrilling suspense."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I often wonder if John Grisham didn't write such a good first 3 books, would he be nearly as popular as he is now. He is a good writer, his books flow, they are easy to read, but they just end....I often find myself saying, a book was way too long, I find his too short....This was a good story, well developed, that ended in 2 pages....Maybe that is what keeps his books alive, they are all fast paced and build, I just wish the endings would develop also. I liked The Last Juror, it was good, but I wonder, could it have been great?"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I have just finished reading The Last Juror, and while I enjoyed the book VERY much, I must warn future readers that this book is NOT a suspense thriller! I don't know how it got categorized as such! It is however a very good story. Having read A Painted House, which was a completely new genre for Grisham, I would compare Juror more to it than to his more suspenseful novels like Pelican Brief or The Chamber. NOT suspenseful... but still a great read!"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"John Grisham's latest book really impressed me. When I read this book, I could almost see myself there. I could picture each character, especially Lucien when he was mad in court.It was very entertaining and funny in many places. It was also suspenseful in many places. I liked how Grisham slowly started with the suspense and then made it more and more suspenseful until the end. If you're looking for a book that will surprise, entertain, and will let you have a good time, read The Last Juror by John Grisham."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I would probably rate \\"The Last Juror\\" as 2.5 stars, but since Amazon won't let me do that, and since I am absolutely certain that John Grisham could have done much better, I'm going to round down rather than round up. This is a plodding novel with an obvious plot and a not-very-satisfying ending (no spoilers here). It is a decent read for a boring rainy afternoon, or a warm afternoon at the beach, but that is about it.In a nutshell, this is the story of a very bad family in Mississippi who are involved in moonshining, drugs, etc. One of the family scions commits a dreadful rape-murder, and is sentenced to life imprisonment. He vows to seek revenge on the jurors, and sure enough, when he is released the jurors start getting shot or killed. More would be telling, except that there is not much more to tell.The story is told from the perspective of the owner of the town newspaper owner/editor. Grisham almost manages to make this chap an interesting character (Grisham is not known for the three-dimensionality of his characters) but he fails. Mostly the protagonist-editor relates a series of endless meals with the family of one of the jurors. He manages to make this boring too. The novel goes off on all kinds of tangents about news reporting of the civil rights movement in the 1960s South, and later the struggle between megastores (i.e. a thinly disguised clone of Wal-Mart) and mom-and-pop storefront stores. This is mildly interesting, but has absolutely nothing to do with the plot, and nothing to do with the characters either. Basically it simply represents Grisham on various soapboxes. Maybe he gets paid by the word; that is all I can think of.By the way, Grisham can usually be depended upon to at least write an interesting narrative of a trial. Not here. Here the trial is one dimensional and caricaturistic--never was there a more reprehensible villain or less suspense as regards the outcome. He could have summarized the trial on a page or two and entertained the reader no less.I gave it 2.5 stars because Grisham's prose is not bad, and the novel did contain some interesting insights about life and news in a small Southern town which was interesting to a Southern California boy like myself. But this novel seems to have been written to make Grisham's Mercedes payment or something. It had little to say, and managed to take 500 pages to say it. Entertaining, but that is all, from an author capable of better."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I liked that this book wasn't about another \\"young lawyer\\" still wet behind the ears; I liked seeing Lucien Wilbanks and Harry Rex make another appearance.I thought it was good, and jaded as I am reading so many suspense novels, I didn't really have a clue as to who was the culprit at the end. LOLI was happy with the book, was not disappointed at all. Go John!"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"No suspense at all in this book... it's a wandering tale of life in a small Southern town. The author meanders through 9 years of this and that, finally wrapping up with a touching ending. A nice story, more in the style of Eudora Welty than a murder mystery or suspense novel. The characters are memorable and nicely written, but all through the volume I kept wondering where it was going. I enjoyed it, but I'm notoriously easy to please."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"While this book is expertly written, I was, I have to admit, a bit disappointed with it in the end. I may be fickle, but I like a good fast paced legal book, and this book was advertised similarly to his previous books. So, I was a bit disappointed that this book was a slower paced book that really had more to do with life in this small town than the legal heroics of the situation. I suppose I pre-prejudiced myself against this book, thinking it would be similar to his previous ones. It is a very well written book, and interesting to boot. The characters in the book, especially Willie Traynor, are well developed and cleverly written. Recommend it as a good read, just don't come into it with any pre-conceived notions!"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Other than his short story collection \\"Ford County,\\" this is the only decent book Grisham has written since \\"The Rainmaker,\\" and even this one, much as I love it, had an ending that made me find somewhere private and cry. Maybe it wasn't such a good move to read it shortly after my mom died, and maybe I should have thought twice because of Grisham's taste for bitterly unhappy endings. It could have easily ended in the courthouse, rather than where it did. Up to then, it was a true page-turner, as impossible to put down as any book I can name. Nothing since by him has come close."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"It is not a court-room drama nor a classic Grisham nail-biting thriller; The book is about the life of a journalist in a small southern town and his interactions with the town's inhabitants. The gem of this book is the nostalgic recollection of small-town America during the late 60s and 70s. The novel covers everything from the civil rights movement to the invasion of the corporate giants (Bargain City) that virtually destroy the town. The main plot is about a murder and trial that haunts the town for years. The book is hilarious in some parts and very sad in other parts.When I read a Grisham book I normally don't intend on reading the book again...'The Last Juror' is different...I will for sure read it many times again.5/5"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Unlike many of his other books, this one concentrates more on the world outside the courtroom, It is part autobiography (of the main character) as he makes his own newspaper office, the learning process (such as going to the different churches) and the personal drama that happened around the murder, the ensuing trial, and the consequences of the jury decision in the fate of Danny Padgitt. I didn't enjoy this one as much as Runaway Jury or Rainmaker, but it is still a decent book and an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I am an unabashed Grisham fan and think I have read about everything he's written. I simply loved some of his books and I merely liked others. There's always something special about his legal themed stories but some of the ones that I loved most were not legal at all: \\"The Painted House\\",\\"Skipping Christmas\\" for example (which two were also favorites of my husband). But \\"The Last Juror\\" was a standout special book for me. The legal/lawyer theme is just an embedded part of the story while the principal theme is the unfolding development of Willie's character and the friendships he makes in the town, especially the lovely relationship between Willie and Miss Callie. But all the characters are so finely drawn that you really get to know them and care about them or are at least interested in their fates. Willie, warts and all, is one of my all time favorite Grisham characters as is the unique Miss Callie. I won't go into the story line. Others have done that quite well. I'll just say that this is a book for all ages who like a good story. My very elderly parents lived the last 3 years of their lives with me and I would read to them for about an hour every afternoon. It was a time of companionship and enjoyment for us all. During that time we covered many books and one of them was \\"The Last Juror.\\" They were enthralled from the first to the last word. My Mother paid the book the ultimate compliment for any story when she said, \\"Oh, I hate for it to end. I want to hear more about Willie.\\""},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I listened to the Last Juror a few months ago. I loved the characters, the descriptions, the southern way of life and how Grisham captured it so vividly. I found myself wanting to have some of Mrs. Callie's meals and having conversations with her. I loved Willie Traynor's character as well as all the characters that he interacted with.One of my favorite reads in a long time!"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"This was the first Grisham book I ever read, and I have since read two others, The Firm and The Street Lawyer. The Last Juror has really engaging characters, a likable narrative voice, and a meaningful story that seems realistic and held my interest all the way. This is very good, carefully crafted writing throughout. Unfortunately, The Grisham books I read afterwards are linear, one-dimensional, boring, and give the impression of being carelessly written. The Last Juror is several cuts above the usual Grisham fare, if Street Lawyer and The Firm are any indication."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"That is well worth reading.I am a real fan of Grishom's work, having read most of it. This book represents his style perfectly; he creates a vivid southern setting and characters that kept me interested in the crime, courtroom thriller/drama.The narrator is especially likeable, starting out as a recent college graduate who buys a local small town paper. He is cocky and self assured at first, but he matures in a very realistic way.My favorite thing about this book is the characters and the southern setting. Grishom paints a beleiveable picture of a southern town in the early 70s. The characters are colorful and some are downright hilarious in their actions. I especially like the names he gave some of the characters (Pud Perryman for example).This book is not perfect. There are several holes in the plot that I wondered about as I read the last page, and I was a bit disappointed at the end, but that's probably because I liked the characters so much.Overall, a person won't go wrong with this book to read over a vacation lying by a pool with a cool drink in your hand. I bet you'll smile, maybe even laugh a few times."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"There's a place in John Grisham's heart where he yearns to tell about his South in the way that William Faulkner did. Grisham is no Faulkner, but his Ford County is an entertaining place to revisit for a nine-year story (last seen in A Time to Kill) that provides a picture of rural Mississippi at the end of the Vietnam War. Unlike Grisham's other books with legal-sounding titles, this book isn't primarily about the law and lawyers. Instead, a murder and its consequences stand as bookends to hold this story about changing Mississippi together.The book is filled with more stereotypes than original characters, but the exceptions make the story rise above the average. The two vivid characters who make the book work are \\"Willie\\" Traynor, the young college drop out, who buys the Ford County Times out of bankruptcy and turns it into a vital part of the community. Traynor stands in for us as non-rural Mississippians in understanding what's going on. The most interesting character is \\"Miss\\" Callie Ruffin, mother to a family of professors, who was one of the first African-Americans to register to vote in Ford County.In the background is a continual sense of dread as the local residents live in fear of the lawless Padgitt family which \\"owns\\" the sheriff and the county when the book opens.This book is considerably more delightful if you listen to the unabridged recording read by Michael Beck who is able to turn simple narratives into Southern charm."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"After giving up on John Grisham's books as all being rehashings of the same plot (I hadn't read one in a decade) I picked this up in a used book store on a whim. I was looking for something easy to read and predictable (something Grisham usually supplies) but instead found a thought-provoking, well paced book that exceeded all my expectations and made me remember why I liked A Time to Kill so much that I read 6 more of his books hoping he'd live up to it. Well, he finally has. The Last Juror is a study in the changes that have affected small town America (particularly the southern part). From forced integration and busing to an analysis of the impact of a thinly disguised Wal-Mart this book manages to be fair and judicious. I can see Grisham's own political opinions and leanings but he somehow manages to be respectful of those whose politics differ from his own. That's a gift. As I was reading the book I recognized Harry Rex and Lucian from having read about them almost 20 years ago. To be able to create characters that stay in the memory that long is also a gift. I hope he keeps it up, I just might buy another of his books if he does."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"The title may suggest a legal thriller but The Last Juror ,while it does revolve around a murder-rape trial and its aftermath is not a bbok that fits snugly into this category.The trial is that of Danny Padgett,a member of a notorious criminal family in Ford County ,Mississipi who kills a young mother while here two young children watch .The case is pretty cut and dried but the family is not above witness intimidation and bribery .Padgett is convicted however but escapes the death penalty ,vowing that if released he will exact revenge on the jury.Nine years later he is free and jury members begin to die .The tale is narrated by the local newspaper owner ,a callow young northener named Willie Traynor who grows to love the community and to observe how it changes over the years -the book opening in the 1970's .The special focus is on his friendshsip with the remarkable black woman ,Callie Ruffin all of whose sons are PHD's and who becomes a surrogate mother to Willie ,sharing insights and philosophies over gargantuan home cooked meals at her home .We trace the evolution of the community through changes both national and local -the integration of the school system and jury system (Callie is a juror at the trial),Vietnam and its impact locally ,the growth of corporate strip mall America and the demise of local ,family owned businessses.It is a warm but not sentimental book and while the court room scenes are handled with genuine drama and insight it is in the picture of a changing ,conservative rural community that the book has its greatest interestIt may not appeal to those who like the legal thriller side of Grisham but it is a compelling rural odyssey that manages to be warm ,nostalgic and curiously tough minded all at the same timeA slice of Americana that Garrison Keiller fans should like too"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I wasn't expecting much based on some of the negative reviews about this book, and perhaps that was why I enjoyed it so much. True, it's not at all like Grisham's thriller genre, but it does have the courtroom element and this, coupled with his styles in &quot;A Painted House&quot; and other great reads of his, makes it enjoyable and fun. The story itself is not that unusual but the masterful telling of it reminds me of &quot;King of Torts. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed it. Would also recommend &quot;In This Mountain&quot; and a great new book I just discovered: &quot;The Bark of the Dogwood&quot; by Jackson McCrae."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"The Last Juror seems to show Grisham's change as an author. In his early works he wrote suspense stories. In The Last Juror the suspense which is secondary to the development of wonderful characters. Miss Callie is a wonderful woman who shows how a powerful force for good can make her whole family better. It is worth reading this book just to meet her.The rest of the small town characters such as Harry Rex and Baggy as well as Will himself and his grandmother are wonderfully drawn.Some reviewers have commented that the book lacked suspense. It seems that Grisham is moving in his work. Rather than a fast moving book such as Angels and Demons with little character development, Grisham is now writing slower moving books with wonderful characters. The Testament and the King of Torts are examples. I think that the new Grisham is every bit as enjoyable as the early Grisham but just a little different."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I just finished reading this book and I cant understand why so many people gave it bad reviews. I thought it was an excellent book. Willie was great and all the characters of Ford county were interesting to say the least. Grisham once again shows how talented of a story teller he is. Who couldnt like Baggy, Harry Rex, Miss Callie and her huge family and everyone else. I felt this book to be just as good as Grishams other novels that I have read (The Brethren, The partner, The Last Testament, King of Torts, ect.). Once again Grisham delivers with your not so typical lawyer book, and does a great job. A small town feel with lots of drama I recommend this book to any Grisham fan."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Not familiar with Grisham's work other than the fact that he seems suspiciously prolific, I wasn't expecting anything particularly special. Therefore, I was very plesantly surprised by how well written, compelling and seemingly personal this very entertaining story turned out to be.Great for that long plane ride or to take along on vacation, this smartly written story which says quite a bit about the author's sensitive impressions of the world around him, will keep you interested every chapter of the way."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"John Grisham's \\"The Last Juror\\" is a great book and one of my Grisham favorites.In \\"The Last Juror\\", we learn about living in a small southern town during the 1970's. As we get to know the various characters in the story, many components of individual life, family life, community life, and small town life are revealed. It is through the owner of the local, weekly newspaper, and the newspaper itself that we learn of the town's many lives.The work ethic surrounding the local newspaper appears to be lax, but in spite of individual shortcomings, the job gets done. The editor, reporters, photographer, and others all do their part to get the paper out on time. One particularly interesting aspect of the paper is the importance and detail placed on the obituaries, a carry-over from the previous owner.Murder happens in small towns, too, and this Mississippi newspaper covers the trial with ardent abandon. Among the jury members is one black, the first to ever serve here on a trial jury. You will enjoy knowing this juror, who, outside the trial, shares family, religion, friendship, input on segregation and integration, and much more. In fact, before the jury selection took place, readers of the newspaper were presented with a detailed, two-part biographical look at this person.As serious as this story is, Grisham still manages to include humor throughout the book. Political events occur and are ones that make you wonder about \\"the system\\". The community, businesses, and individuals are faced with change that affects all these lives."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Set in a small Mississippi town in the 70s, this latest Grisham novel is a culmination of everything that has come before. We often complain when our favorite authors get in a rut, producing the same story over and over, then we complain when they change styles.But the most interesting aspect of THE LAST JUROR is the fact that Grisham has managed to combine the best of his legal thrillers with the down-home feel of other books like SKIPPING CHRISTMAS or A PAINTED HOUSE.THE PELICAN BRIEF, this book is not, but then that wasn't what Grisham intended. Instead, it is a more literary attempt to meld his styles and it works wonderfully.Also recommended: McCrae's BARK OF THE DOGWOOD and POMPEII"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I found this book to be entertaining, but not nearly worthy of some of Grisham's earlier works....still worth at least checking out of the library.....a good read...."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"In 1970 a woman gets brutally raped and murdered. He is sentenced to life in prison instead of the death penalty. At the end of his trial he threatens the jury that he will get them back. One year later there is a massive shooting in the Ford County. Everyone thinks that it is one of the Padgitts but is it. After four years in prison he is seen in another city with a parole officer. Why is he let out of prison after only four years?This book is set in Mississippi.It is like a lot of other John Grisham books but it doesn't have a lot of Lawyers in it. John Grisham makes this sound like a real life story that could happen at any time. He keeps the suspense going throughout the whole book with something different in each chapter.Every book of John Grisham's that I have read I just can't stop reading it and this book does not change that either. I hope John Grisham keeps writing and makes the books better and better."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I did not mean to imply that this was a bad book. Far from it. It is entertaining in it's own homely way but It's certainly not the John Grisham I remember from the eighties, the Grisham that wrote the edge of your seat thrillers like The Firm and The Pelican Brief.\\"A jury sentenced Danny Padgitt to life in prison. He sentenced them to death!\\"SettingWelcome to Clanton, Ford County, Mississippi. Grisham returns the the setting for the first book he ever wrote, Time to Kill, for his latest release, The Last Juror.Meet Joyner William Traynor aka Willie Traynor. Willie, who is the narrator for this story, is a reporter for The Ford County Times, when the newspaper goes bankrupt. Having freshly graduated from Syracuse University with a degree in Journalism, Willie is in a position, with the help of his wealthy Grandmother, BeeBee, to buy the newspaper and does.PlotWillie is barely settling in as the Owner/Publisher/Editor etc. of his weekly publication, when the circulation is given a boost because of a particularly gruesome and violent murder of a widow named Rhoda Kassellaw. Danny Padgitt, one of the sons of a notorious, semi-legitimate clan of moonshiners and timber millers, who inhabit a nearby island, is arrested for the crime, after crashing his truck, making a getaway.Sandwiched between the arrest and trial of Danny Padgitt, Willie decides to write a human interest story on a prominent local black family - the Ruffins. This remarkable family has eight children, seven of which have earned, not only college degrees but PHDs and are currently professors at various leading universities.Upon their initial meeting, Miss Callie, the Ruffin family matriarch, serves Willie a scrumptious luncheon and Willie and Callie hit it off wonderfully and become fast friends. Later Callie is the Last Juror chosen for the Padgitt murder trial and thereupon sets history as the first Negro juror in Mississippi history.The TrialAll the evidence points to Danny's guilt and even though he threatened to get the twelve jurors, if they find him guilty, (including Willie's newfound friend Callie Ruffin), the jury still finds him guilty.Though the Juror's found Padgitt guilty of rape and murder, they cannot come to a consensus on the death penalty, so Padgitt is automatically sentenced to the alternative, Life in Prison, which at that time in Mississippi equated to ten years, less with good behavior, a fact that is withheld from juries. This angers the townfolk as they were sure that Padgitt would get the Gas Chamber. Everybody was mad but they didn't know who to be angry with, because the the jurors swore an oath to keep the vote a secret.From this point forward we digress into a fairly dull albeit interesting dissertation, with a couple exceptions, about Willie's interaction in the community and how he turns a marginally profitable newspaper into a successful one.The exceptions are where they try to sneak a parole hearing through for Padgitt and where Padgitt is observed in a work release program with little or no security. Our protagonist, Willie, shows up and rains on their (the Padgitt's) parade in both cases but the writing is on the wall. They are determined to get Danny Padgitt out and eventually they do.ConclusionI won't kid you about this book. I have very mixed feelings about what I read. On the one hand, it a warm friendly story about a fairly sleepy fictitious town and county in Mississippi, pretty much describing rural life in the South in the Seventies. And of course, Grisham has one of the best writing styles around. For this book he even added some southern homilies to make it feel more warm and fuzzy.Except for the Padgitts and their sleazy lawyer, Lucien Wilbanks, the characters are likable if not lovable. The warm, lovable Callie Ruffin kept reminding me of Oprah Winfrey, though I don't know why. Other interesting individuals were Baggy, the staff reporter, who is drunk after twelve noon, Harry Rex, a lawyer and carryover from A Time to Kill, and Wiley, the part time staff photographer.Once Danny Padgitt was sent off to prison, after a third of the book, with rare exceptions it was like reading Driving Miss Daisy. Grisham described how Willie had lunch every Thursday with Callie, and the techniques Willie used to build up the Paper and how he visited each of Ford Counties eighty some Churches for service, one per week and then finally, for about the last forty pages things got suspenseful again and does not end the way you are lead to believe.Again, I say this still held my interest, there was never a danger of my not finishing the book, it's just that I buy Grisham for excitement, for thrills. This was vintage Grisham, sans the thrills and intrigue. Unfortunately he's been doing that a lot lately."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed The Last Juror. Grisham successfully changes things up by writing in first person. The character development is great, with several endearing Southern personalities. The category of &quot;mystery&quot; would not be accurate for this book, though. While the ending was fairly predictable, I was so infatuated with the characters by the end of the book that I did not care."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"The murders are a bore and don't really get underway until the end of the book. No real narrative tension in this book. Grisham can't create original characters--they are mostly steriotypes. The setting is also one that has been done often and better--by Grisham himself, for example"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I am surprised to see so many positive reviews here. The books started off wonderfully, with an interesting protagonist and fabulous details of life in a small town in the 70s. The murder and subsequent trial was also great, and the suspense that this all set up was good too.Then, the story pretty much stopped moving. Grisham got into painful details - scenes that had almost nothing (and I'm being generous) to do with moving the plot. I kept reading because I couldn't imagine he could do this... it had to pick up again somewhere, didn't it?Sadly, no. The last few pages got back into the drama, but the story ended with a neat excuse for real closure. Too simple, too convenient.Someone described this book as \\"literary.\\" I don't see it, sorry. Grisham is one hell of a story-teller. He's got a great imagination. I imagine this is one of those books that \\"by contract\\" had to be finished according to some publisher's schedule. Too bad."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I have read every John Grisham novel and found this to be very very boring.The best way to read this book:1. Read the first twenty pages2. Read about twenty pages in the middle3. Read the last twenty pagesAll the other material is just fluff and a real waste of time."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"This was my first Grsham and I was extremely disappointed with the entire book. I forced myself to finish it, hoping it might get better. I found myself skipping entire paragraphs and missing nothing in the process. The characters are all completely forgettable, and so is the story. The end was predictable, and it was plain to see why the jurors were being eliminated. Maybe I should give his early books a try but so far I am not impressed."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"John Grisham is usually a guarantee for a page-turning read. This, however, is the signal for me to stop buying his books. It kicks off well, then just completely loses focus and direction and prattles on endlessly about this and that and nothing of interest - I have the feeling this is Grisham's attempt at writing himself an \\"Epic\\", and he fails miserably. As for the oh-so-perfect Miss Millie (or whatever her name was), I just felt like pouring one of her oh-so-perfect pot roasts over her head and telling her that her oh-so-perfect, 7 PhD'd kids (yeah, right) bore me to tears. I have to agree with Dr. Ansari - by the time the books starts \\"revealing all\\", you just don't care anymore. Nausea, Grisham style."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I was thoroughly disappointed. Although Grisham does a reasonably good job in setting the historical scene in bigot-ridden Mississippi, the long passages detailing mundane characters and trivial parathemes are mostly superfluous. When the story finally enters second gear around page 420 (of approx. 480) it is too late, and the reader is longing for an ending, no matter how it arrives. Even then, the build up to the finale is jerky and completely lacks suspense. Grisham must be one of the most over-rated writers of fiction today."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Bought the book in February and just finally forced myself to finish it last night. (It looked so lonely on my nightstand, watching piles of more interesting and well written books come and go.)Why did it take me so long to read this particular Grisham work? Because this book lacked the page turning quality of his previous works. The narrative arc was shaky at best, with the ending a shoot'em up let down. Be warned -- many characters waltz in and out of the story, lots of wacky over the top stereotypical southern names to keep track of. I did enjoy the author's thinly veiled attack on WalMart -- he did an excellent job of explaining the damage caused to small town economies by WalMart stores."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I used to LOVE John Grisham, but I found this book extremely boring and yet the perfect book to bore me right to sleep every night. I only needed to read one page each night before I was out. I can understand his other books centered around Christmas and family life being more sensitive and about feelings and stuff, but when the title comes right out and says, &quot; The Last Juror&quot; and there's a picture of a Jury table on the front cover I expect it to be as fast-paced and exciting as all of his other law books. I was very dissapointed. The summary on the inside flaps actually built it up that way, which is why I forked over the money to buy it. But, like many movie trailers, most all of the exciting parts were in the summary and the book, for the most part dragged and dragged. If you are looking for a typical fast-paced John Grisham book do not get The Last Juror. You will be highly dissapointed!"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Really frustrating to spend all this time reading a book that juts goes nowhere. I just can't believe this was the same author who wrote the runaway jury, a time to kill and the firm. This book was basically like a &quot;painted house&quot; with a sprinkle of suspense. Disappointing!"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I was in the airport with nothing to read and there was a huge pile of Grisham's books. How bad can it be? Terrible. If it wasn't a &quot;Grisham&quot; it would not be published. He should stop preaching and write a good story."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"This was an excellent book. I've read many of Grisham's books, lately I've been reading Stephen King. I've only begun reading again the past three months. I bought this book at an airport for my flight across the US. I picked it up on a Sunday and finished it on Tuesday. It was a great book, hard to put down. I was happier reading this book than I would have been watching my favorite TV shows. For me, that is saying quite a bit. Keeps you guessing til the end. Grisham comes through again!"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Small town Mississippi a few decades back. A secretive gangster family, corrupt politicians and a young widow just trying to get on with her life - until it is rudely terminated in gruesome rape and murder. A young man buys the local newspaper and propels himself into the soul of this yahoo paradise.The prosecution of the accused is told through the newspaper editor's eyes. Along the way he is befriended by an African-American woman of remarkable character, who becomes the first black woman to serve on a jury.The story is slow-paced, but thoroughly enjoyable. Several stories run concurrently, all of them seamlessly welded together into an enjoyable whole.It's not a page-turner, but like a fine wine or good scotch, a book to be taken in leisurely sips. The characters are well developed and interesting people. The plot moves nicely and the ending leaves you questioning whether it's contrived or not. There's doubt because you know for yourself that crazier things have happened.All in all, a fine read.Jerry"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I can't believe how bad this book is. It's the first John Grisham novel I have ever read. It is simply dead boring. There is nothing about it that makes it a \\"thriller.\\" The title is completely misleading. Don't even waste your time getting this book out of the library unless you want to read a long drawn out story about a small town in the south. It's not even a good story about that. I agree with everyone else who gave this book one star (or less)."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Juror is written in the familiar Grisham style--lots of local color and engaging characters. But here's my beef: every once in a while, like a faulty rendition on a piano, Grisham hits some false notes that leap off the page and jar the reader's brain. These are occasioned by his ignorance of people, geography or whatnot. And you wonder what happened. Where's his research? Where's his editor? Some examples: A character named Piston cleans offices in the downtown area. Grisham writes that no one knows where Piston lives. You can be damn sure in a small town almost everyone knows where everyone else lives! Small error? Sure, but careless. Grisham describes a river as running straight as though a cut channel. Geologists, cartographers, and other people familiar with landforms know rivers never take a perfectly straight course; they meander. He describes a dinner cooked by Miss Callie as featuring lamb stew. I challenge anyone to find lamb meat outside of the larger cities in the South during that period. In those days most fresh meat was local or within no more that 200 miles. There were no sheep ranches south of the Mason-Dixon. Even today most southerners do not eat lamb. We know nothing about the hero's love life outside of a couple of one night hook-ups. Are we to believe he lived in a small town without a love life? Or if he had girlfriends over, he wasn't the subject of gossip? Come on! Has Grisham got a tin ear? There are merits to the book, but, for me, they do not outweigh a series of false notes."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"This is by far one of the worst books I have ever read! I typically find Grisham books to be entertaining. However, this book was a total bore. In a perfect world, this would have been a great 20 page short story. Hopefully they will not attempt to make this into a movie!"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I'm ready for Grisham to return to writing books like The Runaway Jury. The ending in this book as well as the King of Torts left a lot to be desired."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"In 1970, when 23 year old Willie Traynor took over the ownership of a small town newspaper in Tennessee, he reported the brutal rape and murder of a young widow, attacked in her own home and in front of her children. Before she died, she named Danny Padgitt, a member of a notorious local family as her attacker. At the end of his trial, Padgitt threatened revenge on any of the jurors who found him guilty and, when two of those jurors die as the result of foul play, feelings run high in the town. Willie befriends one of the jurors, Callie Ruffin, an articulate and religious black lady, mother os seven college professors, and one who would find difficulty in casting a \\"guilty\\" vote where it would involve the death sentence. Danny Padgitt IS found guilty but, because of the voting of the jurors, is sentenced to a life term which, in Tennessee in those days, meant that he would be released in about 10 years. Wilie settles down comfortably into the life of a small town dweller and dramatically increases the circulation of the newspaper, merging easily into the towns' collection of diverse and colourful characters. I'm sure that this could make a wonderful movie!"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"This is the type of story you'd see on a TV news magazine show. Instead of taking a break during the story and going to a commercial in between, Grisham has to fill up space. I don't know if it was because he had to fill up pages, or because it allows him to express his own politcial views (D), but Grisham goes all out. Readers can tell that he is trying to talk about Wal-Mart and what it does coming to town (as he sees it), and he uses Vietnam to point out his feelings on Iraq. It's not enough just to point these out, he has to include the editorials and speeches in the text.Why do we have to read through this? This was an interesting story, but it stretched far too long. Where was the editor when this manuscript came in? Did they just let him ramble because they know it will be a bestseller? Just stick with the story. I don't care how short it is. Maybe put two together if you have to. I enjoyed the personal impact ending, as opposed to the plot ending, which was a bit lame."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Grisham, you've gotta be kidding. I beg my fiancee to let me buy this book -- as we are on a shoestring budget-- and she relents and this is what I get? I love Grisham. I hated this book. I read it and realized it was good for something -- to cure me of my insomnia.This is why I'm writing in my spare time. I'm tired of picking up a book in hopes of it being decent and finding out it's a waste of time. I mean, it wasn't even fun to read. That's all I ask for, something halfway entertaining.And the sad thing is, the next Grisham book that comes out will be purchased by me again."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I am so glad I am done with this book. I have never not finished something I've started, but was darn close with this. Boring. If I wanted to read about segregation in the south I would have chosen a non-fiction book.I was excpecting an exciting, fast paced, &quot;whodunnit&quot; thriller. Boring. The charachters are absolutely forgetfull. I really enjoy reading and developing a &quot;relationship&quot; with well drawn charachters. None hear. So much more could have been done with the offing of the jurors. Just bang,bang their dead? How bout some detail!? Boring. This was the first Grisham novel I have read, and frankly, I was extremely dissapointed."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"When buying this book, I read the inside flap and saw that the book was to be about a man who goes to prison for muder, gets paroled, and ten goes after the jurors who sent him away. It seemed interesting, and another Grisham novel. Nver judge a book by the summary.For starters, Danny Pudgitt does not get out of prison until the last fift pages or so -- the the dust jacket has lied (which turned out to be a good thing). Instead, the book follows, through an amazing first person narrative, the life a reporter/newspaper editor in Clanton, Mississippi. We learn how he becomes involved in this case through the stories he publishes... and through a juror.In all, this bok is about Willie's relatioship with the juror, who is only a juror for a short hwile. Instead we learn of her life, Willie's life, and the desegregation of the 1970's in Mississippi.Rather than give a usual courtroom brawl, Grisham steps away from attorney here, and only writes about the court as a reporter would. The reporter knows nothing of law, except was he has learned from... Harry Rex Vonnor.This book reads like Clancy, where you wonder how so many storylines will tie in, but is smooth like Grisham has always been. It brings back past characters (Harry Rex, Judge Atlee, and, nicely, we meet Lucien Wilbanks before he is disbarred).All in all a suberb story, though at times Grisham reiterates himself so strongly that you wonder if he had forgotten what he has written.The story had snares, which made me ask to get back to the story... to Danny and the jurors.If you are looking for a mirder mystery or courtroom drama, don't buy this. Rather, this novel excemplifies teh fact that life goes in in the world, and, even with a small town murder, there are other things to talk about. It is a new way of writing for Grisham, with two surprises at the end -- one of the endings should be spotted by anyone who has read \\"The Summons\\" or \\"The King of Torts,\\" but it still leaves you thinking of how real the story is.When I began reading, i could not put it down, and am glad for the fact. Stunningly written, beautifully crafted, truly original. Four out of five stars. This novel is a magnificant triumph from Grisham that shows he is still original and at the top of his game. I only have one request for the author -- please give Harry Rex his own novel."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"John Grisham returns to the formula which made him famous in his latest book, &quot;The Last Juror&quot;. He uses a combination of setting (Mississippi in the newly-desegregating 70's) unforgettable characters, and a plot which has enough twists to keep the reader interested and guessing. In this book a young man named Willie Traynor has talked his wealthy grandmother into buying him a small-town newspaper with a shrinking circulation. He manages to expand the paper's readership by including human interest stories and just enough controversy to keep the Letters to the Editor column full. When there is a brutal rape and murder, everyone knows that is is Danny Padgitt of the notorious Padgitt Family who did it. The dying woman had his name on her lips and Danny had her blood on his clothes. The Padgitts are extremely powerful people in the community and Willie and his friends doubt that he will be convicted. After the trial Danny threatens all of the jurors, and Mississippi laws (which Grisham admits to exaggerating) allow him to be released from prison much sooner than the town of Clanton expects. Grisham delves into race relations, crooked politics, bad laws, and our all-too-human tendency to judge people without knowing all of the facts. This book has a bit over everything and should be a winner with old and new Grisham fans."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"It's a relief to see Grisham going back to legal nailbiters instead of mundane novellas like Bleachers.Yet, his latest (somewhat annoyingly only available in hardcover!) is more than a thriller. It has a good dose of humor and some pithy social commentary on racism and its aftermath in 1970s Mississippi -- the town of Clayton where the novel is set clearly has larger woes to worry about that the rape + murder of our young protagonist.Yet, for this precise reason, The Last Juror is not a very tight novel. I could weed out page after page of racially inclined banter that lends very little to the overall plot. In fact the title &quot;The Last Juror&quot; -- which refers to the first black juror in the Ford County -- is a little misleading as she remains relatively cursory to the plot. You'll recall from an earlier Grisham called &quot;The Juror&quot; that the title referred to the juror in question, who was the lynchpin of the plot.Here though, I found myself skimming pages, skipping entire chapters etc and comfortably finishing the novel anyway without missing out on any pivotal fact. I wonder if this filler text was Grisham's way of pandering to the town that launched his career (he began as a Mississippi lawyer) or to make up for the very little space this novel would have otherwise occupied...All in all, it's a worthy read, and the writing is fluent and enjoyable as usual, but you've seen more gripping fiction from the ilk of Grisham."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"While Grisham's description of small town Southern America might make for an interesting read as a New Yorker piece, in this alleged 'mystery' novel, it becomes tedious and a bore. Has anyone born since 1960 not read or heard all of this before ?If the background patronizes us, then the plot insults. Anyone moderately well read mystery reader will call this one about 100 pages before the finish line. Mr. Grisham, take a year off."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"when I read the inside flap, I thought this book was going to be about knocking off the jurors. In fact, the book does not even come close to being what the title implies. I guess I liked the book but was disappointed at the end; I wasn't ready for the book to be over."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I was disappointed in this book. I always look forward to Grisham's books, and have read all of them. This one was too slow, and I almost stopped reading. Instead, I skimmed. He seemed wander a lot, and I never was sure where he was headed. I hope he does better with his next one."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Frankly, the dust doesn't seem to be settling over this latest Grisham novel. Has any author, anywhere, anytime, ever created such furor when he changed styles? Surely this is an indication of his talent and popularity. But even so, you'd think that with that many fans, more of them would cut him some slack when it comes to changes in styles and/or subject matter. And THE LAST JUROR isn't that far off Mr. Grisham's regular path! It IS courtroom friendly, and DOES have elements of A PAINTED HOUSE and a few of his other works. So why the big upset? I thoroughly enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone who likes good writing. Forget it's by Grisham--it's just a good read no matter who wrote it.If you enjoy good writing, like McCrae's BARK OF THE DOGWOOD or other Grisham books such as A PAINTED HOUSE or KING OF TORTS, you'll like this book. All I can say is, give this one a chance."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I am a huge JOhn Grisham fan and thus I was soooo disappointed in this book. It was neither compelling nor mysterious..

This is one of those books you really don't want to finish!The beginning is fast...the middle is steady...and the ending is wonderful!I won't give it away here. I'll just challenge the reader to pick it up, read it for five minutes, and just try to put it down!Buster WasdenAlbany, Ga"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Much of the first half of THE LAST JUROR(set in the early '70s in Ford County, Grisham's Yoknapatawpha) concerns a murder, and the arrest, trial, and sentencing of one of the members of the local family of criminals with their own private island (every county has one right?). The story is told from the point of view of Willie Traynor, a young northerner who comes into town and buys the struggling local paper for a song, turning it into a fountain of liberalism the Watergate-era Washington post might have trouble keeping up with.Danny Padgitt, the accused, is sent off to priaon, vowing revenge on the jurors. Much of the second half of the book is devoted to Willie's crusading editorship, opposing Vietnam, exposing political corruption, etc. By the time Padgitt turns up again and people start dying, the town (and the readers) have almost forgotten about him. Instead, we're treated to interminable descriptions of the Southern cooking and homespun wisdom of Miss Callie, a matriarch of the black community whom Willy befriends. The black characters in THE LAST JUROR are one-dimensionally virtuous and could easily be spun off into some sort of Hallmark Hall of Fame movie. More troubling are the female characters, who are either regular churchgoers or slutty, without exception. Susan Sarandon's character from THE CLIENT could have straightened things out in 100 fewer pages.At least, I thought as I read, THE LAST JUROR lacks the cynicism that pervades Grisham's recent work, but in the end Willie doesn't seem to care about very much, other than the money he might make from selling the paper."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"If you expect to get a typical Grisham action-packed thriller here, look elsewhere.Technically this is a good book. I enjoyed the story about Willy and his newspaper-owning life. It's a rather typical story about a murderer that doesn't get what he deserves. This is meant to make the reader hate \\"justice\\" and wonder how people can get away with such crimes. (If you read enough, you'll notice that this is a fairly common line. Writers need to be able to take the story in a direction that rarely, if ever, occurs in real life.) It's not a true story. It's meant to be entertaining.We find out who the real killer (of some jury members) is near the end. It's a bit of a twist, but predictable when you realize it's not who the author made you think it was at first. It takes a lot of reading to get to the meat... not always bad. There is more than one story here, and it's difficult, at times, to figure out which story line is the main subject. I think the title is a bit misleading as well. I think \\"Life Sentence\\" could work.Overall, I enjoyed the break from Grishamism."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I read this book a while ago, but recently thought about it again when someone brought up bad books.I had never read a Grisham novel before this one, and I really expected so much more with all the hype his novels get. As it stands, I have not picked up a Grisham novel since reading this one. What a terrible book. Maybe I missed something, but there didn't seem to be any noteworthy plotlines to warrant writing a book about. I kept thinking, \\"When is all the action gonna happen? When is all the intrigue and suspense going to take place?\\" Well, here's the answer: NEVER.I made it all the way to the end of the book, only because I didn't want to think I'd wasted my time reading the earlier chapters. I was going to make it through the book even if it killed me -- but at least that would have been more action than was in the book!"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I thought this book was, at best, lame. I have not before read Grisham's work, and expected a thriller, a page-turner, perhaps something similar to \\"The Da Vinci Code.\\" What I got was a long, slow, tedious retelling of the trial portion of \\"To Kill a Mockingbird,\\" complete with the southern charm, token black woman, trashy white criminal, rape and murder. I had much higher expectations, and was keenly disappointed."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I am a huge John Grisham fan, but this book was not worth the paper it was written on. He seemed to lose interest in the story he was writing about half-way through. Once the trial was done, he diverted his attention to a lashing of Vietnam and Wal-mart (not so cleverly hidden with another name, but he threw in every cliche the liberal media uses against Wal-mart. It made me ill). These were not relevent to the story, and served no purpose other than to be a pulpit from which Mr. Grisham could vent his personal views. From there I lost interest in the story, but finished reading just to see where he would go from there. Mercifully, he got off the puplit at that point and got back to story. The wrap up was boring, and poorly conceived. Not at all the thriller fans have grown accustomed to. If this is a preview what Mr. Grisham has left in him to write about.

I noticed as I was getting to the end of the story I didn't want it to end, so I savored every word.The Last Juror is one of my all time favorites."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"\\"The Last Juror\\" - what a disappointment. It started out as such a promising grabber - only to fizzle into a frustrating bore. The character development was lame and where the heck was the plot? When reading Grisham's earlier books, I loved being \\"taken away\\"; after reading this book, I just feel \\"taken\\".As a Legal Aid lawyer, and having lived in a small southern city, I applaud Mr. Grisham's adroit handling of complex racial and social issues in previous books. In \\"The Last Juror\\", the character development and plot did not go far enough to either deal effectively with issues or entertain. I'd like to see Grisham take the same characters and write a sequel that has some bite.Please, Mr. Grisham, give us something rich and complex that we can sink our teeth into and then savor long after reading that last page."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Normally, I can not put a Grisham book down. The Firm, The Client, The Street Lawyer, The King of Torts all have that fast paced excitement we expect from a Grisham legal thriller. Such is not the case with The Last Juror. Although there are some interesting parts, this book reads much more slowly and lacks the excitement of most Grisham novels.The Last Juror is much more about life in a small southern town than it is a suspense novel. If you liked The Painted House then you will probably like this book too (I didn't like The Painted House at all). Just don't expect it to be a legal thriller."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"The Last Juror is so disgustingly Grisham, it is ridiculus! This is one of his best so far!"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Grisham has experimented with so many styles lately that he doesn't know who he is. I tried but I coundn't find anything new here. This book stinks!"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I didn't connect with any of the characters. He didn't give me a reason to. There was one point where I thought I might connect with Callie, but it never happened. Grisham wasn't sure where he wanted this story to go, so he rambled on for 355 pages with laws from the 70's that were or were not true; elections that I could care less about because there wasn't a reason to care; he threw in a &quot;walmart&quot; taking over the town; a nude sniper. Although I finished the book, on several occasions, I found myslef asking &quot;why am I wasting my time reading this book?&quot; A waste it is."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I had really been looking forward to this book, expecting (and hoping for) a return to the great legal thrillers that made me a John Grisham fan. Unfortunately, this book wasn't what I expected at all. The book centers around a young newspaper editor in Clanton, Mississippi during the 1970's. Rather than a murder mystery or a legal suspense book, it is a story about a small southern town dealing with the issues of the day, including Vietnam and desegregation. The murder and trial are only a very small part of the actual plot. They help to explain the town and the people living there and it provides some action to keep the plot moving, but don't expect to be surpised at the ending.All in all, it wasn't a bad book if you're looking for a story about a small southern town, but if you're looking for a good legal thriller, this isn't it."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I am not a huge fan of Grisham but I have read most of his books. They make good reading when I'm traveling and want an easy read. The Last Juror was a mess of a book even for Grisham. The book began in Grisham style with some soft details about Clayton County , Mississippi. The plot was supposed to center around the rape and murder of a women by a member of a somewhat demented, reclusive family. When the jury begins to consider the boys guilt, the boy threatens to get them when he is released from prison. The boy is found guilty and sentenced to two life sentences. However, as a result of a loophole in Mississippi law at the time, the judge makes the sentences concurrent as opposed to consecutive as the jury had wished. Meanwhile, a young man from up north purchases the local newspaper and sets out to sensationalize the murder as well as other oddities about life in Clayton. The reader doesn't really know whether the newspaper publisher is a crudader or just another money mongering writer (a' la Grisham)looking for a buck. Most of the book meanders around about an elderly black woman who meets for lunch with the publisher for no reasons that are apparent to this reader. When the young boy is parolled from prison (with the Governor's help) two of the jurors are suspiciously killed. The book essentially ends when a wacho tries to blow up a building after firing at some townspeople, the publisher sells the newspaper (his motive to begin with) and everyone lives happily ever after - I guess. If this all sounds like useless and confusing information you have a pretty good handle on what you should expect if you read the book. Shame on John Grisham!!!!"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"With all the hype,I really thought Grisham was back. I was wrong. This book drags on with very little excitement and no great charactars. What a waste of money."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I'm a die-hard Grisham fan, this book is as great as other books.btw, could you at least be polite and not plug &quot;your&quot; book in other reviews?"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"When John Grisham's first book was published I read it and thought it mildly good. When the second book was published I read that one also and that one was not very good. I was not surprised when I read he had actually submitted it for publishing some years prior to the first one that WAS published. I concluded his writing was trite and perfect for fleshing out in movies. Even though I read two books a week on average I have successfully avoided reading any more of his until the other day when a friend gave me The Last Juror and not having anything else to read I read it. This book is trite, predictable, cliche-ridden and thoroughly boring. The main character writing in the first person is selfish, posturing and patronizing. His descriptions of his weekly food gorging are disgusting. I suspect this book was actually written chapter by chapter over a period of years when Mr Grisham was a student in a Mississippi high school and polished off for publication counting on todays' literary appetites i.e. The New York Times Best Seller Lists. However, I am surprised this latest one even met that smell test."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I've read almost all of Grisham's series. All of them are riveting and page turner. But, this book took me six month to finish. For those six-month reading, I could not help think that \\"is this real Grisham's???\\" I'm so disappointed."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Grisham is one of those writers that I will pick up without knowing what the book is about or what others think. His writing is engaging and he is masterful at suspense. This book is no exception. If he keeps writing them, I'll keep buying them.Anthony Wilbon, Author of \\"The Enigma of Njama\\""},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I'm curious as to whether or not people get paid by the weight of there book. The Last Juror by John Grishham is an over-rated book, full of long dribbley paragraphs.Some of the character development was sub-par, and the plot is repetitive and somewhat predictable. Another problem I have with the book is that it just *ends* in basically one chapter. It seemed like he was like \\"Alright, I'm done. Time to end this train wreck\\".Even though I feel this book isn't John Grishams best, I've still read a lot worse, which is why I gave it 3 stars."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"OTHER THAN THE FACT THAT I FOUND IT TOTALLY UNNECESSARY FOR GRISHAM TO INSERT HIS LEFT WING POLITICAL VIEWS IN THIS OTHER WISEVERY GOOD BOOK, I COULD GIVE IT A 5 STAR RATING. I FOUND NO NEED FOR HIM TO EXPOUND ON \\"HIS POLITICS\\" AS THE STORY WAS SO GOOD.......THIS ONLY DETRACTED FROM THE EXCELLENT STORY AND WRITING.I HAVE ALWAYS ENJOYED MOST OF GRISHAM'S BOOKS AND FOUND THIS TO BE ONE OF HIS BEST BUT LEAVE THE POLITICS TO THE NEWSPAPERS, ETC AND KEEPON WRITING GOOD STORIES, JOHN."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Geez, I don't know why I should bother reviewing a book that has 468 other reviews. Not like anyone will easily find my review to maybe give me some positive feedback. I guess I'll write this assuming I'm gathering a small loyal following of Justman review readers. Ah...I feel energy building from a minor ego boost...let me write...no...CREATE!This is another great Grisham book. I was going to give it 4 stars but man, the last 10% of the book ends up being a big payoff. One would think that such a book would plod along to the promised denoument, but not Grisham. He carries you along to the whiz-bang ending with great back-story about Clanton, MS and its citizens. What a town, what a life.This book is another example of great writing where the journey is more fun than the destination. Grisham sucks you in with the middle and uses it to wallop you in the end. What a ride. A must read, especially if you enjoyed other Grisham novels."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"This novel is not at all what I expected. It focused on people's lives, relationships, and small town habits instead of a courtroom deliberation. It was refreshing. It touched on some very delicate issues such as desegregation of schools and corruption of politicians while at the same time being entertaining and predominantly light. In addition this is one of the few Grisham books with a solid ending. By basing the story on the newspapers existence it gives the book a more structured timeline. I feel this is one of Grisham's best books. For those of you who are avid Grisham fans you should try and see how many names and personalities you recognize from some of his other books."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"This book is excellent, right from the first few pages. It already has a plot that captures your mind, arousing your curiosity to read on, and on...Quite unlike the other Grisham's work, this novel is cleverly separated into 3 different time (and hence 3 parts in this novel) which centres around Danny Padgitt, the murderer in the story. Part 1 talks about the crime, the trail and how the jury comes about making the decision, Part 2 builds up suspense as Danny Padgitt serve his \\"life\\" sentence and covered mostly the success of the \\"Times\\" newspaper and development of the town, and finally Part 3 when Danny Padgitt was released from the prison.Naturally the last part is the most exciting part where most of the mystery unfolds. You would have make many guesses as to why the ending is so twisted, but as it goes along you probably be very surprise by the outcome. At least I do.Grisham also covered some grounds on equality and humanity. In this book, the newspaper owner (cum editor and journalist) managed to foster a very deep friendship with a black american - something quite unusual in that time. And something new is the discussion on journalism. Having done a class on journalism, Grisham brought to life some of the \\"behind-the-scene\\" life of editors and reporters, juggling on what to cover and how to \\"sensationalise\\" issues - all for the motive of increasing subscription.Once again, it is an excellent book that was hard to put down after tossing the first few pages!"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I haven't been too impressed with Grisham's writing of late, but I thoroughly enjoyed the Last Juror. Grisham's depiction of the rural south during the 60's and 70's kept me reading. More than that, I found myself engrossed in the relationship between Ms. Callie and Willie and watching Willie, a \\"city slicker\\" become a beloved member of Clanton. Sure, the book had a murder mystery, romance, etc., etc., but this book was more about the growth of an unlikely friendship and what can happen if we open ourselves up to the unexpected. One of Grisham's best books since A Painted House."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Welcome to Mayberry... err, Clanton, Mississippi, an old southern town full of charm and interesting characters. The central character is a young man who takes over the town newspaper, and tells a story of how his life in the town evolves over a period of 9 years, centered about the brutal murder of a young woman and the ensuing trial, etc. The story rambles, and never really becomes a gripping suspense. But it is a pleasant read - the sort of book that is good for your blood pressure. The ending is somewhat predictable. Grisham writes with class, as usual."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I had anticipated that The Last Juror was going to be like what I found many of Grisham's other books to be -- a suspenseful, legal thriller. The Last Juor is none of these things. It is not suspenseful and it is not thrilling. What it is, however, is one of Grisham's best books from a more literary standpoint. The Last Juror is primarily about what life in a small town in Mississippi was like during the 1970s told from the perspective of the new owner of the local newspaper, 23-year old Willie Traynor. Grisham covers important events from that time period, including religion, racism, segregation, economic concerns and the Vietnam war. Based on the description in the jacket cover about a rape/murder and the fact that the story takes place in the same town (Clanton) as his first, and excellent, book, A Time To Kill, I expected The Last Juror to be one of his better legal thrillers. Despite my not getting what I expected, I enjoyed Grisham's latest book, and found he's grown considerably in his ability to convey warmth and sentiment and to create strong, true-to-life, multi-dimensional characters. If you can overcome the fact that this is not the typical Grisham legal thriller, I think you will enjoy The Last Juror. If, however, you won't be satisfied without the usual amount of suspense, action and surprises on which Grisham has built his enormous reputation, then you should avoid this book. The Last Juror is not Grisham's best book by far, but it is worth reading. If you decide to read this book, I hope you enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"As one of the Grisham faihful, I never fail to show up at the bookstore the day the book goes on sale. Needless to say, I was quite excited when The Last Juror hit the shelves. In my usual new Grisham book excitement, I took the book home, fixed some tea and began voraciously reading. I took a decade-long journey with narrator Willie Traynor in a matter of hours, but it took nearly as long to steer my mind back into the reality of my own life. Not only was I not disappointed with The Last Juror, I happened to be more than pleased with the novel.The Last Juror has the usual plot twists and turns of a Grisham novel, but it sets itself apart with excellent character development. The narrator, as usual, is a flawed yet lovable character that might have more in common with the reader than most of us would like to admit. The people our narrator comes in contact with are genuine and each character calls up the memory of someone in my own life.I was looking forward to revisiting Ford County and the rather interesting individuals who populate the small yet drama-filled town of Clanton. Grisham spent a great deal of time developing the setting in the novel and managed to create an even clearer view of this exciting little Mississippi town. From the narrator's visits to local churches to his initial amusement at the quirks of a small town newspaper and the folks who read it, Grisham lets Willie take us into a world that is very real and feels a little like home. His choice of narrator, a privileged outsider, allows him to use Willie to reveal so much about the town that might be taken for granted by someone in their element.If you are looking for an action packed thriller, this might not be the Grisham book for you. However, I strongly recommend The Last Juror to any Grisham fan or to anyone who loves reading a good book that captures the culture and people of a time and a region."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"When I purchased the book, I expected a typical mystery (something I was in the mood for). That is not what I got. Instead, I got more of a Saturday afternoon movie. The actual \\"murder\\" takes up only a 1/5th of the book. The rest is a sociological study of Mississippi. If I was in the mood for that, I would have gotten a sociology book. Why label it a mystery when that is not what this is about?"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"John Grisham's new novel, The Last Juror, commits one crime: that of misleading the reader with its title and ominous cover shot. From the first paragraph, however, the reader will discern that this is no ordinary Grisham thriller, but a yarn high on atmosphere and character.This reader has undertaken every one of Grisham's thrillers with mixed results, but has not read the recent Bleachers and A Painted House (after learning they were not thrillers per se but, well, more like The Last Juror). That mistake will have to be corrected. Grisham has matured as a writer. In The Last Juror, Grisham's storytelling is effortless. He barely breaks a sweat, even as the book weaves between the main story line (if it can be called that), involving the trial and consequences of an alleged murderer, and the protagonist's observations of, befriending of, and, ultimately, integration into the local culture.The book cannot really be categorized as a \\"suspense thriller\\". However, while the supsenseful overtones the book does have are rarely of an edge-of-your-seat quality, The Last Juror represents a refreshing change from the thousands of cat-and-mouse thrillers out there. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Grisham tells an intriguing, captivating story in The Last Juror. It had several stereotypical yet enjoyable characters. The time and setting of the novel are conducive to an interesting plot with several conflicts and twists.There are some cliche's here though that lessen the impact of the novel. For example, the evil Padgitt family that lives by itself on the island and rarely ventures into town, the redneck sheriffs and gool ol' boys around town. But I'm sure they are founded in truth.Grisham follows through on this story and closes well (unlike The King of Torts which fizzles at the end). It is a good, entertaining read that has more than a little humor and good wit thrown into the mix."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"It seems to me that how you rate this unusual Grisham story depends on what kind of story you are judging it as. It you judge it as a fast-paced legal thriller, it's worth only two or three stars. But if you judge it as a historical story of small town life in the deep south, three decades ago, in which most things that happen are very ordinary, except for some events connected to a sensational murder/rape case, then you give it four or five stars. (Since legal thrillers make more money than small town stories, and the publisher is promoting the thriller angle, I'm wondering why the publisher didn't just insist on another legal thriller. Maybe the publisher is so afraid to loose such a lucrative author that he or she just has to publish anything he writes, and Grisham just felt like writing this one.)The story is not very complicated. In the early 70s, Willie Traynor, after doing poorly at university up north, buys the struggling local newspaper in Clanton, Miss., and spends the next nine years struggling to build its circulation. And as he does so, writing about events in the region, we get to understand the social set up in the deep south in the 70s, with all its race problems. I have never lived in the south, and found his account quite interesting.The sensational events, related in about a third of the book, involve a brutal rape murder by Danny Padgitt, no-good son of a dubious but wealthy Padgitt clan, whose stronghold is in a river peninsula near the Tennessee state line. Danny is convicted, and goes to jail swearing revenge on the jurors, one of which is an older black woman, Callie Ruffin. Callie is from the other side of the tracks in Clanton, but has unusually successful children, except for one wayward son. Willie covers the story of the murder in detail, in spite of threats from the Padgitt clan. He also becomes a friend of Callie, and uses his newspaper to inform the white community of how smart her children are, and how well they're doing. But nine years later, when a corrupt lawyer gets Danny out of jail, jurors start getting killed, and Callie's life is in danger ....The writing is very good, and the book is pleasant to read, if slow. I just finished reading the Star Wars Epic \\"Labyrinth of Evil\\", and compared with that it's a snail's pace. It's certainly no legal thriller either, but it has a charm all of it's own. I figure it's worth the average of 2-3 stars for a thriller and 4-5 stars for an interesting small town story about a part of the country I know little about. That works out to 3.5 stars, so I'll give it four stars."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Although I've spent most of my adult life in the North (and in foreign countries) I was raised in the rural South many years ago, and can still blend in, all these years later, because I know the customs and manners, the friendliness and suspicions, the respect and tensions and admiration and hatreds and loyalties and betrayals, and the proper way to introduce oneself to a small Southern town where one isn't known, in order to gain prompt acceptance as one of \\"us\\" rather than one of \\"them\\". I have also served on juries, and know by personal experience the wrenching debates in a jury room when the judge's instructions on the law conflict with the good sense of ordinary people about what verdict is appropriate, given the special circumstances of the case.Grisham's books sell because they're well written, gripping and entertaining. But I wish to commend two in particular because they portray far better than most novels do the way in which Southern customs work well and the ways they work badly, and because his accounts of grand jury and trial jury deliberations match what I've been involved in.If you wish to understand the complexities of Southern culture, both good and evil, read \\"A Time to Kill\\" and \\"The Last Juror\\". How Grisham knows as much as he does, I have no idea, but he portrays details that I know from personal experience, that I have found no other author describing as well."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"John Grisham has done it again! The Last Juror is a fast paced thriller that everyone is sure to enjoy. There's plenty of grit, humor and social commentary (Grisham addresses the issue of racism in the South during the 1970's) to keep the reader not only interested, but also guessing, until the end.The story is set in a Mississippi town called Clayton during the Seventies. A young reporter, Willie Traynor, has just come to own the town's small newspaper and is determined to boost readership by writing of a rape and murder trial. Reporting of these crimes is against his best interest, as they were committed by a member of the Padgitt family. Previous people who've tangoed with the Padgitt's have wound up dead. Willienot only covers the story, but starts a crusade of sorts to see that justice is served and that Danny Padgitt goes to prison for life. When Danny Padgitt is released from prison less than ten years later, members of the jury that served against him start getting murdered...To tell more of the story here would only ruin it for those who haven't had the chance to read the book yet. Let me just say that this is a very enjoyable read. Grisham goes into great detail in describing Clayton and the characters are very well developed. This is the perfect book to curl up and read for hours."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Not the expected legal thriller with yet another lawyer as the protagonist, THE LAST JUROR is instead a beautifully-written bird's eye view of life in a small Southern town during the 1970's. Instead of a lawyer, the leading character is a young man named Willie Traynor who buys the town's failing newspaper shortly before a brutal rape-murder takes place, forever changing life in Clanton, Mississippi (where Grisham's first novel, A TIME TO KILL, took place). Willie surprises even himself when he becomes a crusading journalist determined to do everything humanly possible to see a brutal murderer convicted and locked up for life.This story not only taught me a lot about life in the South, but also described the ideal journalist, someone willing to put truth and integrity before his own personal safety. Not exactly a \\"thriller\\" like so many of Grisham's earlier books, but a fascinating and thought-provoking story."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"John Grisham has published legal thrillers for years. This time, he's returned to the roots of his first book (A Time To Kill) with a minor character, and a different perspective, both from the hero, and the time (1970 - 1979).The hero in question is a journalist... though perhaps a failed one. He couldn't hack it in college, and went to the small town of Clanton, Mississippi. His boss was probably mentally reduced in any case - it was all about the obits. When they are dead, glorify them. When the paper goes into bankruptcy, our hero gets a loan from his grandmother to buy it... and thus his story.It's a tale of a small town, with legal justice, blacks who made good, a powerful local boy who went bad, a trial, different churches, and good ole boy justice. After all, somebody is killing off the powerful and weathly son of a clan who got released... after a conviction for murder and rape.In then end I do relate to the first person of the story. He reported, he published, he fit in, he served the community. In the end, he sold out, but only for a high price... and I think he deserved the money and the luxuries it bought him. He gave a lot to build up the paper - over 9 years."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"This book is one of John Grisham's best books. The plot is interesting although one flaw I would like to address is that he tries to open up too many issues within the book. At times the reader forgets the whole point of the book. But most of the time it was very entertaining and is a good read for anyone who likes thrillers.Another strong point of the book are the characters. Danny Padgitt, the rapist part of a sleazy bootlegging family,is quite believable as you might find such characters rural areas. Willie Traynor, a college dropout who persuades his rich aunt to loanhim enough money to buy the local newspaper. Callie, the mild-mannered african-american woman Willie befriends while in Missippi. And also a sleazy lawyer bent upon getting his client, Danny Padgitt out of jail.The conclusion is quite surprising and expected at the same time. This makes it a worthy read.Chand"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Read the book and you'll understand, the book doesn't stick to the title, and actually, doesn't stick to much of what the backcover says.

Fantastic books, that if haven't already captured your attention, will."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Let me start out by saying John Grisham does not write the type of books that usually interest me, but this had me page turning well into the night.Danny Padgitt is sentenced to life for the murder of a young mother.

I won't bother with a description of the story it's been done a million times already. Suffice to say that if you enjoy well written novels with wonderful characterizations you will treasure this latest effort by John Grisham. Though I have read all his works I, like many others I presume, have felt a little short changed in the last few years. However, The Last Juror certainly ranks with the best he's authored and it's wonderful to see him truly back in form."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"What makes this novel so enjoyable is that it's more than just a Grisham novel. And it's still just a Grisham novel. The author has taken the best elements of his previous work and combined them for The Last Juror, those of courtroom drama and rural Southern mores. I was pleasantly surprised to be reading about one man's experiences and friendships in a small Southern town rather than a complex legal thriller that raced to the end. Such a story was no less compelling than previous Grisham novels. And being a Southerner myself made it all the more fun and relatable. This is a very good read!"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"This book is an excellent departure from Grisham's formulaic novels, and I loved every minute of reading it.The story is engaging, the characters are people that would be interesting to meet, and Grisham captures the essence of living in a small town without being cynical or critical of it. Once you are pulled into the story -- which Grisham does masterfully -- you will be hard-pressed to put the book back down & go to work.This book inspired me to seek out some of his other books that aren't about young lawyers getting tangled up in organized crime & having to go into hiding -- and I have been delighted to rediscover him as an author. This is a great read."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"This book I thought, was a slow starter, but as you got into it, it became better and better. I liked it more myself after about 150 pages.Willie Traynor moves to Clanton back in 1970 as a newly graduated reporter. It just happened that within the time-frame of a year, he became the owner of Ford County's only newspaper. The paper was always famous for its well-crafted obituaries. The readership was very small until Willie takes over making it a 'new paper.'When the brutal murder of a young mom takes place, her children that she has left alone with no parent, are deeply scarred from having witnessed the crime. It was David Padgitt who committed this crime, and Willie does a VERY detailed story on the crime in the paper, and it's progress as David gets arrested.The Padgitt's are a well-known wealthy family, who manage to get David out on parole after only 10 years in prison. When David is let out, the whole town is in a state of uproar, especially Willie, who speaks his mind at David's trial. Men and women who served on the jury 10 years ago, are suddenly being murdered, one by one. The killer, whom everyone knows is David himself, wants revenge and is going to get it."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"The Last Juror is a book about a man by the name of Willie Traynor coming to live in a small town by the name of Clanton. Right after Willie bought the local newspaper, he got the story of his life. A local window and mother of two children was brutally murdered in her home. Willie decided to go out on a limb and report all of the gory details. That decision changed his life forever. IN this fast action book, Willie learns how to eat in the south, learns a whole new way of talking and how to deal with a diverse group of people. Willie not only dodges several murder attempts, but he does it with ease. This is my first book written by John Grisham, but it will defenitely not be my last. This is a good book to just sit on the couch with a blanket and read on a raininy day. I would defenitely give this book two thumbs up."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I'm normally not the type to go for Irving/Grisham/Clancy novels, but stranded in the Raleigh/Durham airport, I decided to venture into new territory. The review blurbs on the book from the NYTimes and others all glowed that this was Grisham's best work ever. It was \\"atmospheric\\", \\"tonal\\", approaching true \\"literature\\". I was sold.I quickly finished the novel and set it down with a sigh of relief--relief that I'd finished the damn thing and relief that I had never subjected myself to other Grisham works. This novel was light on anything of legal interest, lacking in interesting suspense, and of dubious effect when it came to the verisimilutude of the two main protagonists.There was nothing wrong, per se, with the novel; but by the end I was completely unmoved. For those who say that this novel is great despite lacking in legal suspense, fine; but if you want a good literary narrative than go read a real novel."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"The Last Juror started off excelent, it had a great plot and Grisham built on it well. It may have started to stray somewhat in the middle of the novel, though I still enjoyed it thoroughly. I have been reading many complaints about how Grisham focus's more on the characters than on the \\"Suspense\\" of the novel. I agree that the book wasn't really what you might call suspense, but it was just as good if not better. I became attached to the characters and I actually cared about what would happen to them on an almost personal level. Not many books I have read have made me feel the same way as The Last Juror. I commend Grisham for this and I recommend the book for anyone who likes reading books for more than just a heartpounding, suspense, thriller."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It reminded me of A Time to Kill and A Painted House combined. You had a horrific crime committed at the beginning of the book alas A Time to Kill. Then the outrage felt by the town. Then you have a journey of the main character like A Painted House.I reccommend this book to fans of John Grisham. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"And it really merits more like 4.5 stars. Skipping the summary (which you probably read above) let's get to the meat. Those readers who met John Grisham and fell in love with his novels starting with The Firm will be pleased to see the man get back into legal thrills. Unfortunately, they will possibly be disappointed that the legal thriller aspects are few and far between. As many Grisham readers know, he has recently taken to writing more sentimental, personal, poignant novels (A Painted House and Bleachers), and with this novel he does the same. He has fairly successfully married the two approaches and styles with this novel. Unfortunately, the lovingly painted southern town life is too loving and long. Grisham needed to restrain himself and 'revise down' as my writing coach often said. About fifty to 100 less pages would have been far more appropriate to the actual story told.Some might disagree and say that our modern media audience is too distractable, but the fact is that the actual story that Grisham tells is pretty simple and small.Less words and faster pace would have polished this novel to a five star shine."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Although the first part of the book as the third part are really thrilling, you can skip almost all the second part, what happened when Danny was in jail is a waste of time except two or three things that could be written in two pages, the only message of this book is that in Mississippi there were no laws, and the few that existed you could break them if you had enough money to bribe the correct person."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"\\"The Last Juror\\" is a bit of anomaly. There are many times when I have read non-fiction and found it hard to believe that the story is TRUE. While reading \\"The Last Juror\\" I had to keep reminding myself that it was in fact fiction. Such is the charm of Grisham's novel... it is warm, chraming and, at times, thrilling.The actual story is fairly predictable and at points, brutally slow. Another slight annoyance is Grisham's portrayal of northern Mississippi. I feel that he has focused more on the stereotyopes of the region and less on actual day-to-day life (I have lived in NE Mississippi for the last 5 years).I think Grisham found a nice balance of legal thrillers with his more human interest type stories. I would suggest \\"The Last Juror\\" to anyone who enjoyed \\"Midnight in The Garden of Good And Evil\\". I definitely suggest it as a nice quick read, especially if you happen to be at the beach!"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Before I started reading, The Last Juror sounded exciting. However, once I picked it up it was disappointing. The beginning of the book was good, but after the first 50 pages it was just frustrating. Grisham spends 60 pages telling us how Willie visits every church in his county, and how everyone is mad that Bargain City is coming to town. Almost half of the book was wasted on useless information, so I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a slow, uneventful read."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I guess I always compare a new Grisham book to The Firm, which was my first exposure to him and one of the best books I've read. The Last Juror is written in a nice, first person, very conversational style. It is believable. It has a positive social message. There is some clever humor woven into the tale. Those are the good things. The bad things are not so much bad as just a bit dull. The book is definitely not a page-turner. There are no surprises or twists to the story at all. The characterization is as unremarkable as the plot. Still, I read the whole book, so it wasn't THAT dull. If you are a die-hard-read-everything-Grisham-writes person, you'll want to get this and read it. But if you are looking for the kind of writing you'd find in Mystic River by Lehane, for example, you will be disappointed in this book's lack of it."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"This is one of his better books, and I was sad to see it end...it definitely needs a sequel. It has been a while since he wrote a book where you truly cared about the characters. This is a must read for Grisham devotees."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"In my experience, Grisham either writes excellent books (The Chamber, The Runaway Jury) or very mediocre ones (The Client, which is possibly the most pointless thing I have read in years.) The blurb of The Last Juror - which tells of a small Southern town, a rape and murder trial, a defendant send down despite threatening revenge if the jurors convict him, and a \\"retribution\\" 9 years later upon his release - makes it sound a very promising thriller, and I was expecting to read what might be Grisham's best book. However, the blurb is slightly misleading in its focus and its suggestion of time. Indeed, the trial doesn't happen until about halfway through, and the release not until about the final 50 pages. As I realised this, I changed my expectation to disappointment. Big but: I was very wrong. Because, in spite of that, this is STILL probably Grisham's finest novel.While it is partly about the trial and conviction of local boy Danny Padgitt, The Last Juror is actually about the town as a whole and how it changes over time, through desegregation and other social shifts. It's about it's eclectic residents and how they cope with the changes and crimes in the community, as seen through the eyes of the dubiously-named Willie Traynor, one of Grisham's most engaging narrators in years, a 23 year-old journalist who has recently acquired ownership of the Ford Count Times, and gradually turns its fortunes around as he writes with endearing passion about the town, and anger at the corruption in its justice system. The journey Grisham takes us on, through the panorama of 9 years in the history of this town in the seventies, is a wonderful, touching, and also thrilling, and The Last Juror is a wonderful, touching and thrilling book.There is an inexplicable tendency, even among fans of the crime genre, to look down on Grisham and other huge populists, and it is a tendency which is denying lots of people some great reading experiences. His books aren't particularly challenging, no, but he is a brilliant and instinctive storyteller. His prose is so easy and languid, so polished, that it flows past the eyes and invites one simply to be carried along with the ease of the experience. It is remarkable prose, unlike anyone else's. Thus, his books don't require much effort to read, but the rewards of a captivating, entertaining story are copious and potent for the fact that his books asks so little - apart from a little emotional investment in his characters - and give, comparatively, so much.Grisham's books tend to be very plot driven, but this one also puts a bit more focus on characters; a quirky and warming bunch. The town colourful inhabitants are drawn, on the surface, wonderfully, even if there is no real depth to some of them. They are an unthreatening, entirely innocuous group, a personification, almost, of Grisham's approach to his books. It's sometimes remarkable to think that in the gratuitous world of crime writing, Grisham's books are never ever brutal, and in all his back-catalogue he's only ever \\"murdered\\" about 7 people.In the end, this is a great legal thriller with some nice twists, but more than that it is a compelling meditation on the life of a small American town in the 70's. In the very moving final chapter, Grisham's message seems to be that the only person who sits in on our final judgement, our own last juror, is ourselves. Or God, depending upon what you believe, I suppose."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"This novel weaves a tale of race relations and the social anatomy in the South in a very \\"Faulkner-esque\\" way, finally giving Grisham the ability to move up from the status of a lawyer who writes legal thrillers to a true novelist who has obviously studied the human condition. It's the story of the relationship between Willie, who is considered a YANKY though he's from Memphis, and Callie, a black woman who raised 8 children, several of whom got their doctorate degrees. Callie, though not herself college-educated, has the adorable habit of noting grammatical errors and typos in the local newspaper that Willie owns, and she befriends Willie and even tries to disuade him from his \\"heathenistic\\" ways by dragging him off to her church, which he finds he actually enjoys. Their relationship is one to be applauded and truly gives the reader a picture of what it must have been like to live in the Deep South in the 1970s in a way that makes one think.Though this novel doesn't have as much suspense as The Firm, A Time to Killer, or Runaway Jury, it's a novel worthy of many accolades and definitely worth the reader's time!BRAVO, MR. GRISHAM! HOPE TO READ MORE THOUGHT-PROVOKING TALES LIKE THIS!Lynne LoganAuthor of The Crime Chronicles of Decker Zane"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Up until \\"The Chamber\\" I had a signed collection of all of Grisham's books. After \\"The Chamber\\" I just couldn't stick with him any more, though I tried.Now comes this little gem, and because it is on audio CD and I can listen to it without spending any time on it, I have \\"read\\" another of John Grisham's novels. But this one is good.It is a story teller's book. The reader has the affectations and accents of the old Southern story tellers -- sounds just like a friend of mine telling half truths mixed with facts. Grisham has captured the personalities and dialogue. Together they paint a picture of Anytown, Mississippi, that should have universal appeal because so much that affected Mississippi in the 1970's affected everyone, from desegregation, to anti feminist attitudes, to elections, to Vietnam.Grisham builds the stories that form this book upon a cynical, humorous look at ourselves through the eyes of a reporter instead of those of a lawyer, politician or criminal. The newspaper \\"prints all of the letters to the editor\\" and hopes to hear from both sides.So many things in this book are SOOOO small town -- hand delivered letters under the door, people who have \\"family money\\" instead of wealth, and an assortment of characters right out of Faulkner as well as those resembling some from earlier Grisham novels.I liked it, and was happy to see Grisham do some good story telling."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"A writer's maxim: \\"Write what you know.\\" I enjoy Grisham's pure legal thrillers mostly as good page-turners with inside dope on the law. He apparently didn't spend that much of his life being a lawyer, and it's not what he knows best. Small-town Southern life is.\\"The Last Juror\\" returns to the scene of my favorite Grisham, his first, \\"A Time To Kill.\\" I like Grisham better when he colors in his books with Southern life, as he does with these and \\"A Painted House\\", than in his relatively two-dimensional legal thrillers.Other critics here fault this book for meandering. I don't see it that way. What's fine here is his portrayal of life in Clanton, Mississippi, with its eccentric characters, peculiar ways and intense, insular community life. You can taste it and smell it. The central plot element, a brutal rape and murder committed by a scion of an insular local crime family, serves to tie it all together, but at the end of the day, is secondary. This is really a coming-of-age tale about a college dropout, Willie Traynor, who finds himself and grows up after borrowing money from his rich grandmother to buy a failing local weekly.True, some elements never get neatly tied up. At the end you realize the plot wasn't really the star.Traynor, like most Grisham protagonists, has little family. But we never really find out much about the eccentric father from whom he is estranged, nor does anything develop there. We never find out who murders a key witness in the trial. Traynor never finds true love, despite musing about it constantly. And a tense subplot involving a black teenager on the run after dallying with the wife of a white cop is resolved in an offhand manner.What's good here is the character development. You watch Traynor learn newspapering on the fly, grappling with desegregation, local justice, corruption and Vietnam. Traynor develops a friendship with an older black woman, the mother of seven PhDs and the sort of \\"credit to her race\\" needed to anchor the newspaper's first feature stories on black people. Through her eyes he develops a fuller understanding of the town. The lunches they eat constitute an assault of mouthwatering Southern cooking armed by her inexhaustible garden and flanked by desserts of innumerable kinds of cake and pie.Grisham's sense of small-town newspapering is reasonably strong. A small town editor may run a one-man show, personally cranking out a dozen or two stories each week just to fill the paper. He churns the lightest fluff to do so. In a small town, folks love the fluff, as it's about themselves and their friends. (Or enemies.)The ending fails to surprise. The twist was so obvious I thought a second twist would lie beneath it. But this book isn't about neatly tying up one particular crime, even one which concatenates through a decade of the town's life. It's a slice of time and place - a town which changes as good ole boys start growing pot and other good ole boys start smoking it; where the sons of patriotic veterans sour on a seemingly endless war; where a corrupt family begins losing its century-old grip; where schools begin to desegregate; where big-box stores erode downtown business and town-square life; where racial issues aren't solved in a minute but neither devolve into lynchings or cross burnings. Clanton begins easing into the future, as Traynor himself does. Unlike Grisham's many disillusioned young lawyers, Traynor doesn't hate what he does by book's end nor toss it into the dust Gary Cooper-style. He doesn't open a secret bank account in the Cayman Islands. He's just ready to move on.It has the feel of real life, ending when this phase of Traynor's life ends, not when every mystery gets solved. Life's mysteries rarely do."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Only John Grisham could write a crime thriller in which you could become so attached to the characters, and he's managed to pull it off here.In 1970s Mississippi, Will Traynor moves to Ford County, and with some financial assistance from a relative, the 23 year-old purchases 'The Clanton Times', managing to turn it from a dead newspaper into a thriving publication with his editorials and community involvement. Sales are soon helped by the papers intense reporting of a horrible rape and murder, an uncommonly brutal crime in the small town, which is committed by a member of the community's infamous criminal family. Ignoring the intimidation and fear created by the family, Traynor pursues the story, detailling every step of the way to the killers conviction.After being sentenced to life in prison for his crime by a jury, everyone becomes shocked and dismayed when he is released early. Soon after the release, the jurors too become the next victims, with all eyes pointing to the newly released criminal.More than just a criminal thriller, 'The Last Juror' follows Will Traynors reluctant acceptance into the community, as he too learns to accept it and his new lifestyle. This book draws you in to the characters' lives and relationships and will keep you desperately turning the pages till the end. Another gripping classic!"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"The Last Juror, by John Grisham is a fast-paced thriller that depicts the editorial terrors and legal adversities in the small town of Clayton, Mississippi. Set in the 1970's this novel reflects on a broad array of social issues of this time. Both racism and municipal corruption are major aspects, and through this novel, we see how corrupt the government can be. The Last Juror reflects upon the remarkable difference integrity can make, and the horrible aspect that money can provide. The Last Juror is a intense, unnerving story of lies, greed, hate, and wrath. It is a descriptive novel of personal beliefs and change.Willie Traynor just graduated from college, and recently moved to the small town of Clayton, Mississippi. He seeks an editorial career, and looks forward to a prosperous future in a newspaper company of his own. Luckily, his ambition becomes reality with little effort. With the help of a rich grandmother, when the counties newspaper goes bankrupt, Willie's finds himself owner of an entire newspaper company. Without much hesitation, BeBe, Willie's grandmother, purchases the Times for his benefit. With a fairly prosperous business under his control, Traynor finds himself in charge of what he believes is an industrial empire. As the weeks pass, the Times increases popularity, and Willie Traynor finds himself in possession of more money than he ever imagined.The recent murder of a young mother changes life for Willie Traynor in a variety of ways. Not only will Willie have the editorial opportunity of a lifetime, but he will be forced to make a variety of enemies and friends. Willie Traynor's coverage of the murder proves to be the basis of this novel, as it undermines the rest of the story and provides for an interesting influence to the plot. With Willie's coverage of the murder, Clayton Mississippi discovers wraths and friendships it never knew it had. Clayton is a city of corruption. Money has bought many elections, and the people of Clayton discover that they are being led by unjust officials. It is up to Willie to help save Clayton, and through this novel, we see how one honest soul can save the fate of an entire village.Willie's actions throughout this novel are the centerpiece in this mystery. Willie is the protagonist of this novel, and although he does not save everyone's lives, he manages to unravel a murderous ploy. Willie, influenced by many socio-economic issues of the 1940's, makes many difficult decisions as editor of the Ford County Times. For example, Willie chooses to run a set of front page articles on an African American family. This agitates the community because the majority of white \\"freemen\\" have not yet accepted racial integration. After hearing about the possible murder of one of the family members in his \\"front page article\\", Willie goes to all extent to avoid having any bloodshed over segregation. Willie Traynor is a noble, honest character. Throughout the novel, we discover his humble, open-minded characteristics and respect his decisions.Josh Grisham's ease with words makes The Last Juror an all around fantastic read. Although every aspect of this novel is fascinating, my favorite scene in this book occurred when Willie Traynor ate lunch with Miss Callie Ruffin for the first time. This scene was especially vivid. Grisham eloquently described the feast that Miss Callie prepared for Willie and the ensuing amazement on his part. The clashing cultures of Miss Callie and Willie proved to be very fascinating. More of the frenzied, stressed, work type, Willie was not used to a relaxed, \\"all you can eat\\" banquet. Miss Callie on the other hand, shocked by Willie's infatuation with the food, pushed Willie into eating more, stuffing him beyond consciousness. I enjoyed this scene because as a reader, I was able to experience Willie and Miss Callie's very opposite styles and observed their adaptations to each other. It is fascinating how such different human beings can be so drawn to each other. The friendship grown from this first meeting amazed me. Human nature is remarkable.The Last Juror is an action packed masterpiece of lust and hate. Although it may not be a critical thinking novel, it teaches many valuable lessons to its readers. The Last Juror is reflective of our present day society and the stubbornness of our press, media, and especially our politicians. This novel describes to what extent an organization can go to reach their purpose. This book shows how a careless public can fail to notice minor quirks and changes in government policy. These \\"minor changes\\" can be the difference of a few million dollars and a corrupt government for the next four years. The Last Juror most directly asks us to notice our surroundings and take nothing for granted. Money is the primary force of our present day world, and we must be wary of its powers.The Last Juror is a fantastic book. Although it may not rattle your brain cells and trigger your creative senses, it is entertaining and enticing. This novel is fast paced and will keep you on your feet until the final page. Through the persona of Willie Traynor, Grisham's readers are taken on a journey of truth, justice, and happiness. The Last Juror is a wonderfully crafted novel. I would definitely recommend this book to any \\"action-hungry\\" individuals with a taste for law and justice. The Last Juror is the \\"Law and Order of the mid twentieth century. In it, you will find murder, mystery, and love, the perfect combination for a thriller."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"In \\"The Last Juror\\" Grisham returns to Clanton Mississippi, the setting for \\"A Time To Kill.\\" When a young widdow is brutally raped and murdered, she names her assailant with her last dying breath: Danny Padgitt, a son of the dangerous and powerful crime family that seems to own Clanton. Willie Traynor, the young reporter who buys the local newspaper when it falls into bankrupcy, covers the case in the paper and befriends Miss Callie, the matriarch of the amazing Ruffin family and the first black woman juror in Ford County. Danny is tried and found guilty, but he receives life imprisonment instead of the death penalty. When he is released on parole after only nine years and returns to Clanton, the jurors who convicted him begin to die one by one, and the remaining jurors fear for their lives.This novel features not only the setting of Grisham's earliest novel, but also the reappearance of its lawyers Lucien Wilbanks and Harry Rex Vonner. It covers some of the same issues of race and criminal justice. But if you are expecting this story to be similar to its predecessor, you might be disappointed. For one thing, the protagonist here is Willie Traynor rather than a lawyer. The story does contain some tense courtroom drama, but that comprises only part of the novel. Instead we see the gentler and softer-hearted Grisham as represented in some of his latest works such as \\"Bleachers\\" and \\"Skipping Christmas.\\" After the fast-paced trial and while Danny is in prison, the story changes direction to indulge in some good old-fashioned Southern storytelling.Through the voice of newspaper owner Traynor, a northerner who views the town with the eyes of an outsider but who comes to care for its inhabitants, Grisham shows his affection for Southern small town life in which he grew up in. The story has some humor and folk wisdom sperradically appear when you wouldn't expect any humor at all. This style of writing is the reason I love to read Grisham's novels. The ending is really sad, but satisfying. I strongly recommend this novel for readers who appreciate both the old and newer type styles of writing in which Grisham is famous for!"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"In John Grisham's The Last Juror, he gives us a break from his usual fast paced, conspiracy laden legal thrillers. Instead, he offers an old fashioned, Southern-style tale best told on a lazy hot day sitting on a veranda with a tall glass of sweet tea.The main character is Willie Traynor. Willie shows up in small town Clanton Mississippi to work for a dying family-owned weekly newspaper. Willie isn't particularly ambitious, and his rich grandmother has pulled the plug on his college education after 5 years at Syracuse with no degree. Through a series of unforeseen events, Willie ends up purchasing the newspaper and turning it around. Southerners are slow to accept outsiders, but Willie ends up being a \\"character,\\" which charms most of his fellow neighbors. He starts dressing in seersucker suits and bow ties, purchases and restores an older home, visits every church in the county (but refuses to join any of them) and befriends people on both sides of the color line (this is back in the early 1970's when things were still very segregated). He quickly befriends Callie Ruffin, a self-educated black woman who speaks perfect English. They meet when Willie wants to write a human interest story about her remarkable family (seven of her eight children are college professors with doctorates). Miss Ruffin also serves as friend, mentor and mother-figure to young Will.Things in quiet Clanton change dramatically when a woman is brutally murdered. She knows her killer, and gives his name to a neighbor before she dies. The killer's family has political clout, and a guilty verdict isn't always a foregone conclusion. The defendant also threatens the jury that he will get them if he is convicted. Miss Callie is the first black woman to be picked for a jury in Clanton, and actually holds the position of The Last Juror.Grisham has used Clanton for two previous books, and some of the characters make repeat appearances. The best of the bunch is lawyer Harry Rex. But Grisham does a fine job fleshing out the characters for this book, the likes of which could only be found in a Southern town. The plot isn't as action-packed as his previous books, but he still manages to deal with important issues including integration, changes to penal codes, local politics and political corruption.My only complaint about The Last Juror is that I saw the end coming a mile away (and I don't usually figure out the villain in a mystery). Otherwise, I thought The Last Juror was a fine book and a fun read. After some weaker efforts, Grisham has managed to come through with a fairly big hit."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"The Last Juror did not have the usual flair that Grisham's books have but still a nice read. I would recommend it to anyone that enjoyed A Painted House."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I was getting bored with Grisham so approached this one warily...and got really hooked. The characters are really well described and you care about what is happening to them. A real time capsule of what it was like in the South in the 70's. Don't miss this one!"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Not one of Grisham's best, but it was OK. The Thursday lunches at Miss Callies kept me hungry enough to read more. It is a good read, but doesn't compare to Grisham's earlier work."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I've read all the novels John Grisham has written. I have liked some better better than others, but THE LAST JUROR reeled me in from the beginning. The protaganist is believable, and it is neat to watch him find his voice as he interacts with the residents in a small town. Grisham is meddling in &quot;social history&quot;--he hits class issues, civil rights, gun control, the buying habits of small town USA, and on and on.He has a disclaimer about certain Mississippi/Ford county laws with which he took liberty, but on page 114, he has the first Italians in Ford county loaded into 1904 Ford Model T's at the railroad station. Oops. The first Model T's were built in 1908.I'm glad that John, like Willie, has made lots of money doing what he likes to do. Now he has the resources to do a little experimenting. In my opinion, Grisham is never a dull read!"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Grisham weaves a book that is comfortable to read but which provides no suspense and no mystery. If you've ever wondered whast it would be like to live in a small Mississippi town in the 1970s (sitting on the porch, sipping sweet tea after a home-cooked meal) then you'd appreciate this book. It doesn't get much more exciting except for a snippet here and there."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"This book is a great one. A really interesting read. As a boy who was born in 83, it's really interesting to dive into the segregated world of the early 70's and see life on both sides of the track.This book is more or less about corruption. Corruption of politics, corruption of justice, corruption of the mind. Every character seems to have enough depth to have an entire book written about just them. With this in mind, trying to predict how the book will end will drive you nuts. The suprise ending had me, litterally, gasp out loud. When the moment clicks in your mind, you'll look back on the book and wonder how you didn't figure it out earlier.All in all, this is a fun read. I was able to crank this bad boy out in just under a week; i just couldn't seem to let the book sit on the table.I must say, I'm a huge John Grisham fan to begin with, so my review may be a bit biased. Buut anyone who doesn't feal their heart strings tug at the end of this book must be made of ice. Don't expect the thrilling, chapter after chapter of suspense. This book is a great story and, for lack of a better way to describe it, just feels real.In short, i loved it, you should buy it."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"This book was a great fast read -- I wanted it to go on longer."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Thanks goes out to John Grisham for a great book. I've read all of his books before, and of lately they have been only so so. Grisham wrote a great book after what I consider to be a slump. THE LAST JUROR is a good read, a page-turner, and the John Grisham book we all love. I suggest buying and reading this book."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Grisham's The Last Juror is a perfect example of a book that means well, but eventually and completely loses its way. The climax and really only truly effective scene in the book is the murder scene which grabs the reader in the opening pages. The rest of the book is so anti-climatic that we often wonder exactly where it is all going. This is not a book I vehemently disliked, but a book that really never served any purpose to me. It was like a rehash of better, earlier ideas from other stories that you could read about anywhere.The book, as I mentioned earlier, opens with a devastating murder scene. A young woman is raped and murdered in front of her two children. The suspect is quickly apprehended and awaits trial. The murderer's name is Danny Padgitt. His family is very influential in the underground crime business. The murder occurs in the small town of Clayton, Mississippi. Padgitt is sentenced to a life sentence by a jury and as he leaves the courtroom swearing that someday he will enact his revenge on them.This sequence occurs in the first third of the novel, but by the way it is marketed, you would swear that this is supposed to be the main plot line. It isn't. The story is told first person by Willie Traynor, a normal, long haired young kid who buys the local newspaper in Clayton at the age of only twenty three.The thick of the story is about him and his success and failures in writing for the newspaper. The story takes place in the sixties and seventies, and we are given yet another clich&eacute;d journey through history that really gives no added freshness concerning everything we already know and have read. Traynor develops a friendship with a black woman named Callie and for some reason the story ends with her. He meets many other characters as well, but we never really get to know them well and it seems they are thrown in more for show than for substance.Later in the story, Padgitt is from prison for good behavior. Not soon after, a juror is suddenly found dead, followed by another one. The town is in an uproar and believes that Padgitt must be enacting his revenge on the jurors who sentenced him ten years prior. There is a slight twist at the end, but then again the book is such an ode to the anti-climax that it does not feel like much of a surprise or a revelation when it comes. By that point we, as a reader, are daydreaming about the next book we want to read.I think the main problem, and there are many, with The Last Juror is that the story is written in such a way that we don't really care about it. The characters are all severely underdeveloped because it seems as if Grisham is trying to do too much here. And it doesn't work. There are numerous clich&eacute;s in here as well. Every lawyer and small town clich&eacute; you can think of, in fact.The Last Juror generates no suspense. It's funny because it is marketed as a thriller, but with the exception of the first scene, it is dryly told with a level of such mediocrity. This is unusual for a writer as talented as Grisham. Where was the suspense of The Firm, the intrigue of The Pelican Brief, or the power of A Time to Kill? It feels like The Last Juror was quickly processed and the Grisham was on auto-pilot when he wrote it and more importantly he puts the reader on auto-pilot as they read it. It would have been nice if some emotion was stirred up inside of me, but sadly, nothing came. It was like listening to a tired history lecture from a teacher about events that already knew too well and didn't care much about.The book did nothing to anger me, it wasn't even particularly boring. It was just a meandering mess that couldn't find anywhere to go....and when it did find something interesting; it would quickly switch paths to another tired clich&eacute;. The Last Juror never could find where it wanted to go and what it wanted to say, so it decided to say everything and nothing through nearly 500 pages (the story could have been told in less than 300). If you haven't read anything by Grisham, this isn't the place to start, or you might never pick up anything written by him again.Grade: C"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"What has happenned to the author of such thrillers as The Firm, and Runaway Jury ? With The Last Juror Grisham seems to be continuing his journey to who knows where ( but obviously the trip includes the bank ).I really wanted to like this book, but didn't. Whoever wrote the NY Times reivew on the cover, \\" One of his best: a thouughtful and atmospheric thirller\\" clearly did not read the book. It might be atmospheric, but a thriller it isn't. Also, it seems real preachy, ie hard working loveable black mother raises a bunch of PhD's and charms the young newspaper editor with food and stories about how hard it was back in the dark old days in Mississippi. Been there and got the t-shirt many times.This book is in the category of Grisham's The Testament for which he should have been prosecuted for writing.Save your money."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Parts of this book were hard to read - I definitely wouldn't call this light reading! Details of the crime committed were hard to read - I cried a little while reading it!This book really is about the white/black relationships in the deep south a few decades ago, as well as the story of the trial.I found the details interesting - I was very involved in the story, and really cared about the characters. Unlike \\"The Jury\\", this book is much more emotionally intense - much more about the characters, and less suspenseful.The plot was interesting - I had no idea how it was going to turn out, which is pretty typical for me when reading a Grisham novel.This is one of my favorite books by him."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I absurdly enjoyed this JG novel. Agree do I with many of the other reviewers, insomuch as this is a quasi-change from his (JG's) earlier novels. That said, however, the characters in _TLJ_ are what moves the story, not so much the plot (rednecks vs. city folk), which is kind of tepid at best. Nonetheless, this, in my opinion, would be a great beach/trip read: easy to follow plot, hysterical characters (antagonists), and the obligatory \\"alcohol hobby\\" of several more...all make for a relaxing read.Buy it in paperback.Cheers."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I adored this book. The narration by Michael Beck was terrific. I loved the descriptions and eccentricities of the small town characters. I can somewhat understand why Grisham readers are a little disappointed, as it is not his usual legal thriller, but I just loved it anyway. It was charming and funny, and, again, the narration was great."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I enjoyed this book, it's a good interesting read as you're waiting to see what the twist is going to be! I keep turing the pages so in all a worthwhile book!"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I enjoyed this book a lot. I get bogged down in the legal details of many of Grisham's books; this one got rid of all of that and just focused on the characters. It was a nailbiter without being too scary, and it kept me up late reading it. I recommend it."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"The reader could tell by the writing that John Grisham spent a long time writing this story. While trying to drag out the climax of the story in a complex plot, he just made the book a lot longer and slower than it could have been. Most of the details of the story do not follow the plot but are just extra or \\"filler\\". That the story was well written and had a few surprises did not matter once the reader looses intrest. The one thing I did love in the story was the awsome ability that Grisham has to create live characters like the Pidgets, one of the more well written character bases."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"If you pick up The Last Juror looking for a legal thriller, you will find something that you did not expect. The book is a first-person account of small-town Mississippi in the early 1970's and is about as real as it gets. Grisham has captured my home state as no one else can, showing both the beauty and the ugliness that is our history.As a native of North Mississippi, I was eager to read The Last Juror, set in the fictional town of Clanton. Many of the references are real--the newspapers in Memphis, Jackson, and Tupelo, the honky-tonks on the state line, \\"dry\\" Tishomingo County. The characters feel real too, especially Miss Callie. The book reminded me of many people from my Clanton-ish hometown. I enjoyed the way Grisham brought back Harry Rex and Lucius, pre-A Time To Kill. Harry Rex's directions to his cabin are a hoot!"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"You would think by now John Grisham would have \\"worn out his welcome\\" but he never does. I fell in love with the characters in this book from the first page - there is someone in the book that nearly everyone can relate to. While saddened at the end, the storyline, plot and outcome were all extremely well written and flowed easily through the entirity of the book. Thank you again for another great read!"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I say that The Last Juror is better than the last two novels he came out with. Now The Last Juror is not another Grisham novel with a young lawyer in trouble or knows a secret he knows and takes the money and run to a nice island to Grand Cayman Islands. The Last Juror takes place in the 70's in Ford County; Grisham returns to Ford County since the release A Time To Kill. Now this time, instead of a lawyer, a newspaper writer gets into the murder and trial for the murder of Rhonda by Danny Padgett who Rhonda didn't accept a dance from him, so he murdered her in front of her children. Now, Wiley (the owner of Ford County Times) grabs the trial and is there from the beginning to the end. Danny is eventually sent to prison in life; in the 70's life only meant 8 years, during the post-trial, Wiley keeps reporting the local stories, hangs out with a couple of Vietnam Vets who love poker, yet they always invite Wiley to play since he always loses. It is then that Danny is released from prison, and goes on a killing spree when he told the jury that sentenced him to life, three juror's are killed, and immediately Danny is fingered for the killings of the jurors. At first the book starts out slow, slow like A Painted House slow, but Grisham lets the story simmer and the last 50 pages I thought were the best he has ever written. If you are looking for a good book that is slow, but yet suspensul? Get this book!"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I've read A Painted House and Skipping Christmas by John Grisham so realize that he's been moving toward a different style from his previous books, which I enjoyed. Unfortunately, I feel he hasn't mastered this 'new' voice. I found The Last Juror, as with Painted House, to be wordy and confusing, as if Mr. Grisham was thinking on paper without the benefit of a strong editor giving shape to the story. The storyline meandered, then jumped around and overall failed to catch my interest or my emotions. While the premise was intriguing, I had to struggle through part one and part two but ended up skimming part three, never what an author wants to happen to his story. I'm still not sure what story he was trying to tell with this book. I don't think I'll be buying a John Grisham book until he has a stronger grip on this new 'voice' he's working on."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"This isn't a typical Grisham book. There was plenty of action and movement, but there were also well-developed relationships and characters to really attach to. Some of the plot is outlandish, but I didn't find myself questioning it at all. The writing was good. It was just something I enjoyed and really wanted to keep reading."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"A solid story from John Grisham with an easy, enjoyable pace. Although its billed as an action adventure--who's killing the jury?--this is more of a character study set in a small, southern town circa 1970.Young Willy Trainer becomes the owner of a newspaper that coverages everything from the obits to the garden club meetings to an infamous murder trial. Along the way, we meet the local eccentrics, all whom Grisham creates to perfection. The main event is the murder trial of a young widow killed by a member of the local drug-dealing, bad-guy family. After conviction, there is a threat against the jurors who participated in the trial. Ten years later, some of those jurors start dying.I am a Grisham fan. I like his gentle, predictable characters. The good guy always win, most often walking away into a tropical paradise with a boatload of money. In my mind, that is always a suitable ending."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I liked the changes that took place in the south in ten years. I liked learning about the day to day goings on at a newspaper. I listened to it in one day. But the black characters felt cliched and one dimensional."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I find what distinguishes the best authors from the ordinary is character development. Along with interpersonal dynamics, this book demonstrates it well. The characterization of the Mississippi town and its denizens is very well-wrought.On the down side, the plot is nothing special. And I am tired of women throwing themselves at the hero. Does he always have to be a Sam Spade playboy? Is it too cynical to think that with the narrator screwing the murdered woman's sister a couple of times the author is just covering all his bases?"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"It's weird, but during this book I suffered through various feelings of like and dislike. When I started reading it, I actually liked it quite a lot, but then it sort of seemed to drag on.The inside flap of The Last Juror states that it's about how Danny Padgitt murdered a woman and while he was on the stand, threatened to harm the jury if they convicted him. But really only about the first 50 pages and the last 100 pages actually dealt with the trial and Padgitt's threat. My main gripe with this is that it deviated so much from what it seemed the actual book was about. When I started reading this, I thought that it would be suspenseful with this sort of agonizing tension starting from the trial to Danny Padgitt's threat to the picking of the jurors one by one, but it wasn't like that.Another thing that annoyed me was the actual ending. It seemed very anticlimatic and it seemed like it came out of left field. I found myself thinking \\"That's very, very implausible\\" and also \\"How would no one know?.\\" The ending was also very abrupt.I guess some of the book was interesting and I did care about some of the characters. It was also nice how he had characters from A Time To Kill appear briefly in The Last Juror. Although, I really didn't think Lucien Wilbanks was such a bastard in A Time to Kill, but I thoroughly disliked him in this one.I've only read one other Grisham book and that was A Time To Kill. That one was fabulous. This one...not so much. I'm still planning on picking up some of his other books (especially since I own like six others) and am hoping the brilliance that was behind A Time to Kill, shines brighter on one of the others."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Its human nature to assume and I assumed this tale by John Grisham was going to be a legal thriller. There were many scenes in and around a courtroom. There were thrilling scenes and a mystery. There was a vilain or two. This however was just a solid piece of fiction about small town Mississippi and its inhabitants as seen through the eyes of the main character. It was a really enjoyable read. Great stuff."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"This was a great book! Although very different than Grisham's other novels, it was a terrific, quick and insightful read that I highly recommend."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Danny PadgittThe Goring CollectionWilliam, Willie, Traynor grew up in an affluent Memphis family, studied journalism at Syracuse University for five years. Willie returned to Memphis when his education funds ran out and almost by default inherited a Mississippi weekly newspaper at the age of 23.Willie's first edition of The Ford County Times, located in Clanton, Mississippi featured a front-page photograph of the entire staff. One of Willie's first changes was to include Ford County blacks on the obituary page.The paper was almost bankrupt and Willie figured it would take at least a year of hard work to turn things around, and that was counting on help from his rich grandmother.However, The Ford County Times fortunes changed with a violent murder in a rural setting some twelve miles north of Clanton.The rape and murder of Rhoda Kassellaw took place with her two young children looking on. The rapist killer was quickly identified as Danny Padgitt, the youngest son of a wealthy, clannish family that lived on an isolated and protected island.Willie Traynor followed the investigation of the murder case with the fervor of a Tabloid reporter.The introduction of Callie and Esau Ruffin and their children came just as the court hearings got under way. And at that point the story begins to espouse civil rights causes and Miss Callie became the first black person to be seated on a jury in Ford County and the last juror seated in the Kassellaw murder case.The court case took several weeks to play out and with an overwhelming amount of physical evidence along with eyewitnesses Danny Padgitt was found guilty.In the sentencing phase of the trial the jury deadlocked on the death penalty and as a consequence Padgitt was awarded a life sentence.Following the judges' life sentence announcement Danny Padgitt made an awful scene where he threatened every member of the juryJohn Grisham's story line and pace were somewhat erratic but even so, he uses the twists and turns in the plot to bring the story to a satisfactory conclusion. Not his best effort, yet good enough to recommend.Tom Barnes www.tombarnes39.com"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I usually adore Grisham. To me, he's the king of plot. But this one is a bit disappointing. The rhythm is sometimes painfully slow --even if we are in a small town here-- and the writing almost static. The fact that the book is presented as a thriller is not helping. Whoever handles the promotion of this novel, please don't try to full the reader! Grisham readers are not stupid, and this is a far cry from a thriller. The chronicles of a small town would be a better definition. Any small town. I live in a Northern small town, Clarion, which in many ways resembles Grisham's Southern Clanton --and not just for all the letters the two towns have in common. There is no better background to describe the human condition, which Grisham attempts to do. I do appreciate the Balzacian efforts, but all along the reading, I felt that Grisham was not totally comfortable in this territory. Still, he's the author of A PAINTED HOUSE, a brilliant novel in my view. So what went wrong here?"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"This is a great book. I haven't read in years, so I was surprised when I was so into it. At times you feel like you are in Ford County, Mississippi with the characters, thinking you know what's coming next when the story takes a turn. It's a good book by Grisham."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"If you crossed &quot;The Painted House&quot; with &quot;The Firm&quot;, you'd get a book like this one. I thought it was one of Grisham's best ever. I haven't cared for Grisham's latest mysteries - they've merely been vehicles for his heavy-handed and probably recently-discovered social conscience. Only the newly-saved get that preachy. I surprised myself by enjoying 'Painted House', though it's not the kind of book I read for pleasure very often.I'm fully aware of how grim reality is and tend to look for entertainment that let's me escape from the brutality &amp; tragedy of real life. In movies, if it has explosions, I'll probably like it. Now you know where I'm coming from.&quot;Last Juror&quot; had just enough literary &quot;merit&quot; to make the characters come alive. But, it still had good guys and bad guys and action and all the other stuff that make it a fun read. And, it kept me up late, on the edge of my seat."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Mississippi's Ford County local weekly newspaper hangs on the edge of bankruptcy and Willie Traynor, a rather shiftless ne'er do well college dropout, hears from a chum that a publication like the Ford County Times would be a veritable license to print money if it were properly run. With the help of a $50,000 loan from his doting grandmother, Willie assumes the ownership of the newspaper and begins the process of pulling the newspaper from its deep hole. Things are definitely looking up and readership is given an enormous boost with his lurid, sensational coverage of the trial of local bad boy, Danny Padgitt, for the brutal rape and murder of Rhoda Kasselaw, a reclusive young widow. With the assistance of a shocking in court threat of revenge against the members of the jury if he is convicted, Padgitt is sent to prison for life and Ford County resumes the role of a sleepy-eyed southern town living its languid 1970 life.As I read the entire middle half of the book, I found it quite easy to forget that Grisham made his name as an author writing legal thrillers. Grisham treats us to an extended commentary on life in a typical southern community during the decade of the 70s. He deals with racial prejudice, hatred, fear and the legal issues of bussing and de-segregation in a calm, straight up and quite fearless almost documentary approach. His very human characters of Calia and Esau Ruffin, a black couple that live on the wrong side of the tracks, allow us to see and acknowledge the historical wrongs and injustices that were visited upon the black population in the Deep South without standing up on an annoying soap box and yelling about it. The stereotypical white old boy's network is represented by the notorious Padgitt family, Lucien Willbanks, their extraordinarily slimy lawyer and Mackey Don Coley, the sheriff who has made a career of ignoring the Padgitt family's wrongdoings. Nixon's politics, the struggles the US faced attempting to extricate itself from the Vietnam debacle, conscientious objectors and returning veterans all make an appearance. Clearly, this fine piece of writing was also a metaphor for the time that Padgitt was in prison. Padgitt and the brutal murder simply vanish from the collective psyche of Ford County. As we read this story, we are SUPPOSED to forget about him just as the community did until we are shocked to discover he has been released on parole after only nine years and the jurors who sent him to prison begin to die.At the risk of sounding like a literary snob, I'd like to suggest that Grisham has moved up a very large notch. With The Last Juror, he has proven his ability to write compelling human drama that doesn't rely upon simple chills and thrills to make the reader turn the pages. I believe this is the finest effort from an author who already has a pretty commendable body of work to his credit!Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"What probably throws most people off with this book (and I'm speaking of Grisham fans here) is that it isn't like anything else he's written. &quot;A Painted House&quot; probably comes the closest, but even that's not a good comparison.The wonderful thing about Grisham is that he's constantly growing and changing--refusing to get tied down to one style or get in some kind of a rut. The problem with this is that his devoted readers want him to always be the same. Tough situation.But regardless of his style changes, he does remain constant in one way: his books are all done well. The characters are all believable and human, and his prose is finely crafted. The story in &quot;The Last Juror&quot; isn't that shocking, but this is Grisham's attempt to blend his courtroom thrillers with his more &quot;literary&quot; attempts, and it works wonderfully.Also recommended: McCrae's &quot;Bark of the Dogwood&quot; and Conroy's &quot;Prince of Tides.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I kept waiting for this book to get going, but it never did. After wading through much politically correct mumbo-jumbo of the main character, it became obvious that I was in the midst of reading one of the worst books ever written. I had never written a review before, but this book was so bad, that I just had to go online and see if anyone else thought the same as me. Don't waste your time!"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Using a small Mississippi town during the 1970s as a backdrop, John Grisham renders, what I believe, is his finest novel.Unforgettable characters, traumatic events, unforeseen twists and a life-like conclusion combine to create this fast-paced read. Too many of Grisham's books, in my opinion, conclude with forced endings. It is almost as if the author is worn-out by the plot and his characters so he forces the story into an unreal finish.That is not the case with this book. Set in the south during desegregation, the end of the Viet Nam War and the beginning of suburban and rural sprawl, Grisham characters are believable. They reflect the times in which they live. They live; they die. They enjoy success; they struggle with life's dilemmas.This is not your typical Grisham novel. I, for one, am grateful for that. Novelists should grow with experience. With this book, Grisham leaps from the category of \\"popular novelist\\" to \\"great writer.\\""},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"This book is one of John Grisham's best books. The plot is interesting although one flaw I would like to address is that he tries to open up too many issues within the book. At times the reader forgets the whole point of the book. But most of the time it was very entertaining and is a good read for anyone who likes thrillers.Another strong point of the book are the characters. Danny Padgitt, the rapist, part of a sleazy bootlegging family, is quite believable as you might find such characters in rural areas. Willie Traynor, a college dropout who persuades his rich aunt to loanhim enough money to buy the local newspaper. Callie, the mild-mannered African American woman Willie befriends while in Missippi. And also a sleazy lawyer bent upon getting his client, Danny Padgitt out of jail. These kinds of characters make the book enjoyable because these are people you possibly know or can imagine existing.The plot addresses many different issues. Although many people say that some issues are irrelevant to the topic, the fact is his \\"page fillers\\" are quite interesting in itself. The Last Juror is not a hardcore courtroom book. Although some of the setting is in the courtroom, we don't see that much of it like we do in other Grisham books. Those of you looking for a hardcore book that has it's setting 70-80% in the courtroom are going to be disappointed. Although some of his books, namely, Skipping Christmas and Bleachers drift away from what Grisham does best, The Last Juror still has the Grisham signature on it and any fan looking for a good Grisham book should enjoy it immenselyThe conclusion of book manages to be both expected and surprising at the same time, it doesn't end up to be a depressing book nor is it everybody-lives-happily-ever-after book. It has the right blend to make it satisfying to the reader after he has turned the last page. Overall, this Grisham book is one of his best books, it has a few loose strings, but other than that it was a very interesting book as it keeps you hooked on it through different methods."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Prior to this book I had not been thrilled with anything by Grisham in a while. Not only do I love this book compared to his others but it is on my favorite books of all time list. I think it's fantastic and I thoroughly enjoyed every page. Like several others have said it's not really a mystery per se although a murder does take place. I highly recommend anyone who hasn't gotten around to reading it do so asap."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I've read most of Grisham's books and found them to be enjoyable, but nothing spectacular. This book absolutely took my breath away. I'm not very good with words, so I can't relay the pure unadulterated joy this book has brought me. It is insightful, touching, hilarious, historic, tragic, and gripping all at once. There are no other superlatives that I can think of that does justice for this book. It is, by far, his best effort to date.Most authors start pumping out almost a book a year after they become accomplished because of their contracted commitment to their publishers. When a writer is under a time restriction, he or she is unable to put forth the type of careful effort the craft of great authoring requires. I could tell Grisham really put his heart and soul into this piece, and you can suspect it is somewhat autobiographical in nature. After I read it, I found out he put almost 15 years of his life into this book, which came as no surprise to me. This is one that really stays with you for a long time, especially the characters. I really, really hate to place labels onto anything, but I believe this is the first Great American Novel of this decade."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I was a little suspect when I read the reviews but had to read it since I have read all the others. I was pleasantly surprised. It has good courtroom drama, some good suspense, and some real life personalities. Growing up in the South myself I could identify with the characters. The part about the big chain store coming in and gobbling up all the small mom and pop merchants is what we saw in the \`80s with Wal Mart through out the south in many smaller towns. The ending was a bit disappointing; I wish he had gone on about the main character's life after the funeral instead of leaving it to our imaginations. But I enjoyed it, it's a good relaxing read."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Finally!! After reading The Pelican Brief years ago, I dove into the world of Grisham. I read The Street Lawyer, The Partner, The Chamber, The Testament, The Rainmaker, The Runaway Jury, The Firm, and then I started in on the newer ones. Was I ever disappointed! I wanted the Grisham I enjoyed so much from before. Where was he? What is this stuff he was putting out? It was not the Grisham I enjoyed. So, I gave up on him.My wife picked this up at a garage sale for 50 cents, so I gave it a whirl. Finally, back to the classic Grisham. Not his best work, but it is a start back in the right direction. I enjoyed the book, the characters, the story, the familiar town. A good story of people and life in the ever changing south in the 70's.If you want a dose of classic Grisham, give this a try and we'll all hope he continues back to what we all loved him for in the beginning."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"My favorite Grisham novels are, in this order: THE FIRM, SKIPPING CHRISTMAS, and this one, THE LAST JUROR. As you can see, I'm somewhat eclectic in my tastes, and this may be the reason for liking three completely different books by the same author. But what I like is not so much Grisham's plots, but his writing style, for even when he changes, there's something there that rings true--some Grishamness that comes to the surface. Perhaps it's excellent writing, perhaps it the way his characters move through his landscapes of not only geography, but the mind. For whatever reason I liked this book. My advice? Get past the fact that not everything will be a thriller on the level of THE FIRM, and read this book for what it is: a well-crafted piece of fiction.Also recommended: BARK OF THE DOGWOOD"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"\\"The Last Juror\\" is neither \\"The Firm\\" nor \\"the Pelican Brief\\", nor is it similar to \\"A Time for Killing\\" which shares &quot;Juror's&quot; Ford County, Mississippi, setting. But it is a powerful novel in its own right, combining the elements of classic Grisham courtroom drama with a nostalgic study of life in rural Mississippi. The main story is of the brutal rape and murder of a young widow. The alleged murderer, Danny Padgitt, is the youngest son of the wealthy but reclusive local gentry. Protagonist Willie Traynor, Memphis-born and Syracuse-educated, migrates to Clanton and, with the help of a rich aunt, buys the dying local newspaper. So while the story is ostensibly one of the crime and subsequent retribution, it is also a poignant tale of the decade-long relationship that develops between Traynor and \\"Miss\\" Callie Ruffin, matriarch of a poor but proud black family of Clanton. Just as the Big Brown River and its creeks and sloughs wind through the meadows of Ford County, Grisham's prose meanders through sub-plots, anecdotes and banalities of the small-town south. Grisham is in no hurry to get to the climax - indeed the recipe for Miss Callie's pot roast is hardly a page-turner. But the pace of the prose is a conscious and necessary element of the author's message, and seemingly unconnected events eventually tie together to complete the portrait of Grisham's South. And if the weighty topics of civil rights and Viet Nam are axes Grisham chooses to grind, he treats them with sensitivity and respect, and is neither heavy-handed nor judgmental in his delivery.The reader looking for a thriller along the lines of Grisham's fine earlier works may be disappointed, but it would be vastly unfair to dismiss this novel. \\"The Last Juror\\" is thoughtful and thought provoking literature; an example of a fine American story teller broadening his scope and delving deeper into familiar topics."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"As an aspiring journalist I love the way Grisham wrote &quot;The Last Juror&quot; from the point of view of a young, green newspaper editor! It was a refreshing turn from his usual main characters, the lawyers. The suspense of the trial and the ensuing events were not the focus of the story as it implies on the cover (a mistake that was no doubt made by the copywriters and not Grisham himself), so do not get your hopes up for a real thriller like &quot;A Time to Kill.&quot; However, the emotional pull between Willie Traynor and Miss Callie more than make up for the mishap of the cover teaser.I am severely disheartened by the fact that so many people are giving this novel poor reviews. In my opinion, &quot;The Last Juror&quot; is one of the freshest novels I have read in a long time and the choice to approach the legal system from a different point of view was a magnificent choice on the part of John Grisham!I couldn't put it down!!!"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I have read all of John Grisham's books. Some I loved (The Pelican Brief) and some I hated (A Painted House, The Chamber), but all were well written. The Last Juror is no exception.Like more recent of Grisham's books, this is more a narrative than a classic who done it. It is a fast paced, easy read (I finished it in four days).The climax appears to occur about half way through the story, leaving the reader to wonder what is in store for the last 100 pages or so. The author doesn't dissapoint, offering an all too real account of life in a small town in the South, adding a small twist at the end wich makes for a fun read.While this book lacks the complexity and intrigue of The Pelican Brief, it is a good read. Anyone who grew up in a small town will find the story compelling. You will identify with the characters.I liked it better than The King of Torts, the Bretheren and Run Away Jury which I thought were average efforts for John Grisham.If you like John Grisham, you'll like this one as well."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"THE LAST JUROR reads like a cross between some of Grisham's more famous courtroom thrillers and two of his other novels: A PAINTED HOUSE and BLEACHERS. This is not necessarily a bad thing, for what seems to have happend is this--he's developed his writing styles and ideas into one finely-tuned work of fiction with a compelling story, great characters, and all the color and tension of the South.There are too many elements to this book to mention here, but one of the more intriguing aspects is that of the old south vs. the new. Add to this the eccentric townspeople that Grisham parades before us, throw in some humidity and racial tension, a few unpainted storefronts, a great plot, wonderful pacing and dialogue, and you've got THE LAST JUROR.Of all of Grisham's work, this one is by far his best. Don't miss it.Also recommended: THE FIRM, McCrae's BARK OF THE DOGWOOD, POMPEII, GIRL WITHE THE PEARL EARRING"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"The Last Juror begins with humor and ends with pathos. In between, its author paints a detailed panorama of the life of a small Mississippi town called Clanton in the 1970's, when Brown v. Board of Education had not been implemented, few blacks succeeded in registering to vote, and the legal system was corrupt. We watch the town's center of gravity shift from downtown to the suburbs as genuine interracial friendships are formed in an era of token toleration. The plot is painstakingly and plausibly constructed; the characters from both races are fully developed; the ethnic and religious stereotypes that characterize some of Grisham's earlier novels are refreshingly absent; and the writing is flawless. The most sympathetically portrayed woman is a dignified, well-spoken black matron, whose large, successful family is daringly portrayed in a two-part article appearing on the front page of the local newspaper, which is owned by the protagonist. The most respected merchant, owner of a clothing store, is a Hungarian immigrant. The importance of religion to both races is emphasized in a detailed description of scores of local churches, their congregations, and their ministers. Grisham seems to have mellowed and matured to the point that speculation about his rumored interest in entering politics appears warranted."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"The more novels John Grisham writes, the more he evolves as a storyteller. &quot;The Last Juror&quot; leans more toward current works such as &quot;Bleachers&quot; rather than his older, thriller-type works such as &quot;A Time To Kill&quot; or &quot;The Firm&quot;, so if you are looking for a pulse-racing thriller, this may not be for you. While the plot was a little predictable, it is still an enjoyable ride. One of my favorite aspects of this novel is how Grisham weaves characters from previous works that were set in the same town into the story, such as: Lucien Wilbanks, Harry Rex Vonner, Judge Noose, and there is even a brief mentioning of Judge Atlee (from The Summons). A delight for Grisham fans, but if you have never read Grisham before, I would suggest starting with &quot;The Runaway Jury&quot; or &quot;A Time To Kill&quot;."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"this book reminds me of Pat Conroys \\"The Prince of Tides\\". which I consider Conroy's best. Grisham's humor and wit are delightful. I may be a little prejudiced (born and reared in the south). I have known people like the characters in \\"The Last Juror\\",especially Miss Callie. Some white people were like that too. One being my mother, who is no longer with us. I have no doubt where she is, if there is truly a hereafter. One never went to my mothers house and left hungry. Also, I and my brothers and sisters were never allowed to go to the \\"show\\" or play cards on Sunday. I found it amusing that Miss Callie might administer the death penalty for adultry as easily as she might for murder. My dating days with warnings about how my mother felt about premartial sex would be a good analogy for me.Our lives have changed so much since her death but I fondly recall her love for us and her many friends. This book awakened many wonderful feelings."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"There are so many riviting aspects to this latest Grisham novel that it's hard to know where to begin. First, there is the old vs. the new with regards to the south--how it has changed, is changing, and will change. That in itself is enough for a book and reminds me of other writers who have tackled that slippery slope: McCrae in his Bark of the Dogwood and Conroy in Prince of Tides. But the most intriguing aspect of this Grisham book is his characters. Then again, that's always the most intriguing aspect of his work. In any other writer's hands, the character of Danny Padgitt (how's that for a white trash name?) would be a cardboard cut-out. But in Grisham's he's flesh-and-blood. And Danny literally &quot;gives&quot; the newspaper in the town new life when he commits a murder. As with all media, they love sensationalism, and the Ford County Times--the paper that Willie Traynor now owns--is no exception. Seizing the opportunity, Traynor splashes the gory details all over &quot;the Times&quot; and the result is that he an instant celebrity and also a marked man. Padgitt finally gets his, but not full-out. His life sentence is evidently not quite as &quot;lifelong&quot; as everyone thought, and as soon as he's released, the killing starts. This, all because of his statement to the jury on his way out that he will have his revenge on the jurors. Lovely. Especially if you're one of them. All through this excellent plot, Grisham weaves the lives (or lackthereof) of the colorful characters in the town--yet another aspect of southern writing (again, McCrae or Conroy), and it's really these people that create the landscape and backdrop for this book. The entire novel reads like a well-done combination of Grisham's legal thrillers, his homage to Mississippi (A Painted House), and his foray into small town Southern America. Without a doubt this is his best effort to date."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I am glad I have not read him in years. Very exciting beginning, but quickly fades to dull and uninteresting. By the middle of the book, I could not wait for the end, not because I was interested in how it turned out, but instead I was no longer enjoying it.Lovely Bones is considerably better."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Grisham is off on another political tirade. He starts off developing a decent plot and then abandons it. He gets off on an anti-Vietnam crusade extolling the virtues of running off to Canada. He focuses on his relationship with a matriarch which, again, diverts from the story line. He treats the solving of final crimes as an afterthought. Grisham has clearly lost it. Where he once wove a tale that meshed from beginning to end, he now appears on an ego trip to stuff his political predjuces down the readers throat at the expense of whatever plot he initiated. I was also disappointed with The King Of Torts for many of the same reasons. This was the last book by him that I shall read."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I found the storyline of this book to be very interesting, but it kept deviating away from the story and introduced way too many characters, that in my opinion, had little or nothing to do with the story. It's almost as if this was a short story stretched into novel length. Either that or the author was under a deadline to crank the next book out and this is the result. Still overall it wasn't terrible, but still not one of his best works, that's for certain."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"After reading a number of other booklovers' reviews, I get the distinct impression that Grisham had durn well better write a thriller, or his biggest fans will be disappointed.Not me. I think the non-thriller-lawyer books he writes are better than the others. There's just so many times you can bring out that tired old attorney-in-trouble recipe and make it work (see Clancy, King, Cornwell, etc., for examples of going to the well once too often).If his books such as &quot;Skipping Christmas,&quot; &quot;Bleachers,&quot; and &quot;A Painted House&quot; had been released under another name, it would have kept his diehard fans happy."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"The jacket cover write-up of this book leads one to believe it is a courtroom thriller, like other Grisham novels. In fact it is not. It is a very slow-paced story of a newspaper in a sleepy little town. If Grisham really had faith in this story he should have hyped it for what it is and drawn an audience with its eyes open, rather than using deceit to lure unsuspecting readers to their 400 page, excruciatingly tiny-printed doom."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Grisham is one of best the authors i've ever read, but the Last Juror is a great deception. It's a very well written book, but it don't have that \\"impossible to put down\\" thing the others do.When you are not impacient to know the closing of a case slow carried by the pages of the book, it indicates that something is very wrong with the plot. It's realy diferent from the other 11 books i've read from the author."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"The Last Juror is not John Grisham's finest work. Missing are the compelling contemporary issues, high throttled suspense, and all around passions that pervade early novels such as A Time to Kill, The Chamber, The Firm, or even The Runaway Jury. The Last Juror is at least 100 pages too long for its plotline, and its ending is evident long before the final pages.The book starts fast: the story of a grisly rape and murder, and subsequent trial make for some page-turning. A jury is presented with the classic question: life in prison or the death sentence? Hardly suspenseful, for the deliberations (not at all sketched by Grisham) come only halfway through the novel, and the book jacket has all but given the ensuing plot away anyway. So the reader trudges through the next decade of the novel's storyline, year by boring year. Ostensibly, the narrator, owner of the local newspaper in the small Mississippi town (same setting as A Time to Kill) must fill us in on every detail of life that happens between this first trial and the ultimate (hey, no surprise here at all...) parole of the threatening killer. Every column, obituary, advertisement ever published by narrator's paper, The Ford County Times, is chronicled. Grisham drags us through the young man's haberdashery conversion, his social life (quite dull), his religious research (gee, there are a lot of enthusiastic Christian churches in the Bible Belt, no kidding?), and his eating and sleeping habits. By the time the protagonist has built up his business, we feel we, too, have earned shares in the venture.We don't really delve back into any real action until the final sixty pages of the book. OK, again no surprises (it's on the book jacket): someone is killing the jurors who originally convicted our parolee. Even then, there is little suspense. We have the list of jurors, we are waiting for the killings and final resolution.Grisham could have done much better with the topic of parole injustice, and he certainly missed the boat on this one. This book should have been released during the Willie Horton days of Dukakis v. Bush. It might have held more interest."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Grisham has definitely lost his edge! Where is the suspense? Where are the page turners we so eagerly awaited since &quot;The King of Torts&quot;? We're sick of reading about racism in the South in the 1970's, we want a book that's a gripping read like his earlier books. Quite a disappointment."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Don't waste your money buying this book. It plodded along with no plot that I could find. Some reviews made it sound like the old John Grisham but this book failed miserably."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"First 2 Grisham books great. The rest, pardon me, stink. I have tried and tried and tried - loyal to a fault. But none of them are anywhere close to A Time to Kill and The Firm.How sad.Finally thought it time to try again and picked up The Last Juror. Another mistake.This book is average at best and full of hoo-hum drama. If you must read it, pick it up and the library. Not worth, frankly, your time or money."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I had expected this to be yet another good-lawyer vs bad-lawyer/law but though it was about the law, it was more, at least for what I enjoyed, about the characters.Grisham's Novels seem to have such colorful participants in them and this book, does not disappoint or detract from that. Yes, this is a different type of book from what has been published in the past, but it is none the less, a very entertaining addition to his body of work."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"With the exception of the beginning of this book describing the young women being attacked and the occasional vulgarity, I enjoyed the story of this book.I found it interesting how the author weaves characters into this book from his other books."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"My favorite Grisham novels:1. A Painted House2. The Last Juror3. A Time to Kill"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Not since The Firm has Grisham managed to reach the same level of intensity. The Last Juror is awkward, predictable, and at times awfully dull. The Client and The Partner were close, but it seems to me that Grisham has succumbed to his fame and perhaps thinks people will like anything he writes. A Painted House, Bleachers, Skipping Christmas; yuck. I knew who the killer in this book was long before he was supposed to be, or should have been, exposed. If you feel you must buy this book simply because the author is Grisham, do yourself a favor and wait for the paperback."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I have read most of Grisham's books and was quite excited when this one came out. However, after reading it, I was disappointed. Sure, the books starts off with a very interesting plot, but 1/3rd of the way through the book, the trial has ended and the rest of the time is spent following Willie around town. I wish Grisham would go back to the writing style that got him here in the first place."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Not your typical Grisham novel. It lacked quite a bit of the detail you normally expect from him. He spent quite a bit of time weaving characters and events into the story that never really added anything. It just seems to meander. I'll buy his next book and hope he wakes up in time before he becomes another James Patterson."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"This is the by far the worst book I have ever purchased. I would love to have my money back. What was John Grisham thinking about, when he wrote this? Obviously, he wasn't thinking. I have read everyone of his books, and if the rest of them are going to be like this, I will have to pass. I am an avid reader of John's; I am the one that can't wait until his next book comes out. I will have to wait next time, because I won't ever read another one like this!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"In &quot;The Last Juror&quot; Grisham returns to Clanton Mississippi, the setting for &quot;A Time To Kill.&quot; When a young widow is brutally raped and murdered, she names her assailant with her last dying breath: Danny Padgitt, a son of the dangerous and powerful crime family that seems to own Clanton. Willie Traynor, the young reporter who buys the local newspaper when it falls into bankrupcy, covers the case in the paper and befriends Miss Callie, the matriarch of the amazing Ruffin family and the first black woman juror in Ford County. Danny is tried and found guilty, but he receives life imprisonment instead of the death penalty. When he is released on parole after only nine years and returns to Clanton, the jurors who convicted him begin to die one by one, and the remaining jurors fear for their lives.This novel features not only the setting of Grisham's earliest novel, but also the reappearance of its lawyers Lucien Wilbanks and Harry Rex Vonner. It covers some of the same issues of race and criminal justice. But if you are expecting this story to be similar to its predecessor, you might be disappointed. For one thing, the protagonist here is Willie Traynor rather than a lawyer. The story does contain some tense courtroom drama, but that comprises only part of the novel. Instead we see the gentler and softer-hearted Grisham as represented in some of his latest works such as &quot;Bleachers&quot; and &quot;Skipping Christmas.&quot; After the fast-paced trial and while Danny is in prison, the story changes direction to indulge in some good old-fashioned Southern storytelling.Through the voice of newspaper owner Traynor, a northerner who views the town with the eyes of an outsider but who comes to care for its inhabitants, Grisham shows his affection for Southern small town life. Grisham's descriptions and characterizations are so lovingly crafted that I felt I had attended a goat barbecue, sampled some powerful moonshine, sat on the balcony above the town square gossiping with and about the locals, played poker in the backwoods, visited every church in the county, and had lunch on Miss Callie's porch. The story is peppered with humor and folk wisdom. The ending, although sad, is satisfying. I strongly recommend this novel for readers who appreciate both the vintage and newer Grisham works.Eileen Rieback"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I believe John Grisham is truly one of America,s greatest writers , not only one of the most popular. He spoiled me with &quot; King of Torts&quot; , which I believe to be his best and one of the best books I,ve ever read. Bleachers followed and was excellent illustrating how we idolize coaches and team that are successful and overlooking that this same were not always hero,s to their children and friends. The Last Juror is an very good read bringing Grisham back to his boyhood Mississippi. There are a lot of little stories along with the main theme. This is almost the differance between just eating and dining. It,s Good."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I have been increasingly disappointed in John Grisham's work over the last several years, and this book was no exception. After reading the book description, I thoroughly expected a murder/mystery/thriller story line. Though Grisham's story begins with a bang, the book loses heart in the middle and drags the reader down with a &quot;historical biography&quot; feel. For those expecting to read about Danny Padgitt and his vow of retribution, Grisham focuses more on the life of Willy Traynor and the Clanton community in the South during the 1970s. Of course, since Grisham is a master of legal proceedings, the trial of Danny Padgitt consumes Part I of the book, and he is finally sentenced to prison on Page 168. Danny Padgitt is not paroled and released until Page 291 and the book ends on Page 355! Just as Grisham begins to hit his stride and captivate the reader, the book comes to a startling end. If you are looking for a murder/mystery/thriller book, please try Patricia Cornwell."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I bought this book before a transatlantic flight and hoped to spend a few enjoyable, thrilling hours as I usually do with Grisham books. No such luck.The Last Juror is tedious, slow-paced, and - not like Grisham - predictable. The reason I am giving it 3 stars and not a lower rating is that, despite all, Grisham is a gifted writer and creates lively characters who are easy to sympathise with, and there is the occasional spark of humor. The end of the story somewhat lifts the overall impression (sorry, no spoiler here...) but I got to it already tired and frustrated, so the overall aftertaste is not what I am used to feel after good old Grisham books."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I've read most of John Grisham's books and have always enjoyed his storyteller voice and style. This book carries a very different tone and style -- it's much more cliched and predictable, and much less of a page-turner (in fact, many times it borders on boring). My biggest complaint is that he is sloppy in his storytelling, and inconsistencies, contradictions, and loose ends abound. It's nothing like his early legal thrillers, and is not even as good as his recent books like Bleachers and The Broker. If you plan to skip a Grisham book, this should be the one."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I do believe that Grisham captures the mood and times of the Deep South. I do believe that he constructed a suspenseful plot, but had trouble staying on track. I also believe that this is not a high-tension legal thriller, and that the focus of the story isn't primarily on the legal case. The story is more about racism and the growth of a newspaper editor, then a trial. This is a heartwarming story about a young adult friendship with the last juror, which is exactly why I don't like it. The title implies that the book will be a suspenseful mystery thriller. Well, the story did not live up to the title.Grisham seems to divert the readers attention away from the plot far too often by going into lengthy descriptions of food, when he should be following the path he already paved by describing the trial, the jurors who are showing up dead, and the Padgitt family. You should read this book if you want to read about southern cooking, perhaps if you are looking for ideas for thanksgiving dinner, but not if you are looking for a good high-tension legal thriller. Grisham is a very well respected author of thriller novels, and I am very disappointed in him in the aspect that he would mislead the reader into thinking that this was another one of his mystery novels. Grisham's \\"mystery legal thriller\\" novel eventually turns into a documentary about oppressed African Americans in 1970s and a documentary of Miss Callie's recipes. Maybe John Grisham was hungry while writing this novel?"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"This was the first book by Grisham that I read and it was a great book book for me to get a taste of how good a writer Grisham is. The story was not full of suspense, but part three was the point where I found the book hard to put down, even if I was becoming too tired to read more for the night.Overall, I really enjoyed the story. Grisham does a great job of building up the plot and in a few cases, just when you think you know what's about to happen, you realize you have been fooled again. It's not until the very end of the book do you realize what really happened and what the title means."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"After reading bestsellers such as Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons, I expected every single book on the bestseller list to be just plain fantastic. I knew John Grisham was an acclaimed author and knowing that his work included Runaway Jury (I saw the movie), I was eager to read one of his expansive novels.I walked into the book store (Waldenbooks) and immediatly went to his (fiction) part of the store where I saw an array of 400 something page books with the same font by Grisham. I was eager to read his latest (The Broker) but it was in hardcover and I did not have that type of money, so I went for the next one, The Last Juror.I must say that the \\"synopsis\\" and image on the front cover are EXTREMELY misleading. It said that Willie Traynor (the main character) was \\"thrust\\" into the center of the scandel (the murder). The book did not turn out that way it all really. I began reading that book on a Monday and by Wednesday, I was one fourth the way there, completely absorbed in the courtroom drama. After what seemed to be the climax, the book begans to come back to normal and talk about life in Ford County, MS.Although it deals with controversial topics of the time like desegregation, death penalties, rape, murder, narcotics (marijauna use), and religion, it still has time to teach us about the true meaning of life with exotic characters as Calia Ruffin (an Italian speaking African American) and Lucien Wilbanks (a despised cussin' lawyer). I enjoyed the fiestiness of the main character, Willie Traynor as the fearless leader for free speech.I have a conflicting sense when I think of this book. I was disappointed about how they claimed it was \\"thriller\\" and how the pace was rather slow. I enjoyed it because of the time period (1970s, a rather unused one) with actual historical events occuring in the background like the reaction to the Vietnam War, the integration of schools (black/white), and revival of a religious time.I would highly recommend this book to anyone who has some spare time and time to waste and who enjoys a heartwarming feeling at the end. Do I regret spending $8.64 (7.99+tax) on it? Sort of, I just wish I got it half off like how I felt shortcomed by the deceiving \\"summary\\" on the back but no doubt, I did like it."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I have read and enjoyed all of John Grisham's books, but I reserve a special place in my heart for the ones that give me not only a good story, but also a good belly laugh. This one was good for not one gut-buster, but two! I haven't laughed this hard since the boathouse scene in \\"The Client\\". Tears were literally falling to the page. Call me warped, but I find at least one scene in every Grisham book to be extremely funny. To find two was indeed a pleasure. Read this if you are already a Grisham fan, or if you simply want to be entertained by a good story with memorable characters. Enjoy !"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"With Grisham's latest works he has clearly attempted to get away from the legalistic style that defined his first dozen novels.As a Grisham reader since the age of about 10(I'm, currently 21)I had long since become fed up with his works by age 18.However, with that said this is by far his best \\"hybrid work\\", in which he intertwines some legitimate aspects of the law with an endearing town and colorful people. We all noticed the change in JG's style around the time of \\"The Testament\\" and I feel it was an entirely necessary one.While this novel is chronological it is anything but typical. The main characters accounts on many different subjects shows how he literally matures from 23 at the beginning of the novel to his early 30's at the end. The subject matter was diverse and at some point I wondered if it all kept the plot tightly together, but after finishing it I realized that JG's aim was certainly not to write a simple formulaic suspense plot. Instead, he provided us with insights into the changes in the south regarding race relations, urbanization, school desegration, the press and primarily acts (an act) of (criminal) justice in a small town.The Ruffin family is indeed a remarkable one and many of other characters will be familar to fellow Grisham fanatics. While Grisham has changed a lot in the past 15 years, he still maintains an ability to force us to empathize, ponder and think unlike few authors of our generation."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Just when you think that John Grisham is not so hot, he comes out with a good book that reminds you why he became successful in the first place. The Last Juror is Grisham's best effort in many a year.A back-of-the-book summary is rather misleading: according to this description, the story is principally about a murderer who gets out of prison and starts killing the jurors who convicted him. Actually, that is only a small part of the book, and these deaths don't even start till around the last quarter of the book. What this novel really follows is Willie Traynor, who develops from an aimless part-time reporter to the owner of a small-town paper.Traynor - who is also the narrator - is typically more of an observer of events than a participant. What he observes are the last secluded days of a small southern town before it becomes a part of the larger world. When Traynor first comes to Clanton around 1970, it is still segregated and filled with typical small-town corruption; a family of moonshiners still are the local crime gang and Vietnam is a distant thought. When one of the crime family rapes and kills a woman, there is some question if justice will be done. Although a conviction does follow, the sentence winds up being relatively minimal. Over the course of a decade, the town changes: desegregation and Vietnam become controversial subjects and the small-town businesses yield to fast-food franchises and superstores. And along with these changes, the killer is granted parole and people start dying.There is a little of a twist at the end, but an experienced mystery reader will have things figured out long before the actual revelation. That's okay, because in the end, this is not really a thriller or a mystery, but rather a mainstream novel. And in avoiding his typical story materials, Grisham has written his best book in a long time."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"The Last Juror is a tough one to rate. I enjoyed it, but what was described on the back cover did not portray what is really inside the book. I expected a series of murders in the Mississippi town of Clanton in which a serial killer wipes almost the entire jury that convicted him. Only about 75% through the book does this plot start to really develop only to reach resolution with a screeching thud. In fact the entire ending is like a curtain being suddenly pulled down. This part of the book gets one star. However, the vast majority of the book is a very enjoyable and informative (for this Yankee) portrayal of life in Mississippi told from the perspective of a sympathetic, but wary outsider. This outsider is a recent college graduate who buys the local weekly newspaper and then explores his new environment in order to get stories for the newspaper. He also seems to a friendly and caring, but slightly arrogant and aloof type who is often the main character in Grisham's books. His vocation becomes a vehicle for meeting and describing the local characters, customs, social mores, good works, corruption, and vices. Along the way, he meets a lot of fascinating people (and eats a lot mouth- watering meals). Grisham's great gift is making the day-to-day experiences of life interesting and heart-warming with human failings not left out. The characters are far from angels, but this is not \\"Mississippi Burning\\" either. Those who liked The Painted House will enjoy this one too. At the end of this day, I strongly recommend this book and am glad it did not turn into the extreme mass mayhem to the legal system that the title implies."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I'd given up on Grisham for many years because of past disappointments. His first book, \\"A Time to Kill\\" was, in my opinion, his very best. But his talents have eroded with the years and his politics seem to encroach upon his story telling. Pat Conroy takes a backseat to no one in his leftist leanings but still manages to tell a wonderful well written story.Grisham, few would argue, has the talent of a Pat Conroy, but one would hope he could at least provide an engaging read. This story starts out OK - just OK, but then wanders inexplicable into not particularly well told completely unrelated stories. I would guess that about 2/3 of the book is not directly related the legal \\"thriller.\\"I will never again pick up a Grisham novel unless it is highly recommended by someone I respect. My advice, find something more worthwhile, engaging and interesting to read."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"This was a simplistic novel. The characters lacked credibility and their personalities were stereotypical. The plot was unwielding and unsatisfying. It was difficult to figure out who the ultimate killer was because it was totally unrealistic. Grisham's novels always have a feel good aspect to them (i.e. lawyer finds his way; justice prevails) and I think that is what hooks the reader. The quality of the book is secondary. There are so many better writers out there ( Elizabeth George, Laura Lippman, Peter Robinson). I suggest readers give these authors a chance. You won't be sorry."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"The story is engaging in the beginning, but it then moves into several unrelated characters. A large chunk of this book looked like page fillers to me, especially pages full of information about the black woman, having lunch with her every Thursday, etc. I believed all along that Mr. Grisham would somehow connect all the information towards the end and it would make sense then .. but alas that didnt happen.The story line is good though and it would have been great if he had packed this up into a fast-paced 200-250 page something instead of tonning it up with extraneous information that really didnt add up with the way the conclusion came about.I suggest that one should read this book with lots of patience and if you feel somewhere along the middle of the book that there is lot of information that doesnt seem central to the book, dont worry .. it doesnt matter even at the end.To be frank, Mr. Grisham gave me the impression that he was the bored editor of the newspaper like Mr. Willie Traynor."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"While the on-the-surface synopsis of The Last Juror may indicate it to be just another in a long line of murder mystery and courtroom thriller, it is anything but. And...this is a good thing. While certain elements of the novel tend to be formulaic, there exists, however, a refreshing vibrancy that emanates from the wistful idealism of our hero protagonist Willie Traynor and his anything but unlikable friend and confidant Miss Callie. For Grisham fans, it is a return to the idyllic fictional Mississippi town of Clanton in Ford County set in the 1970s -- last visited in A Time To Kill. Also reprising their roles are the enigmatic divorce lawyer Harry Rex and the slimy and slippery Lucien Wilbanks.What makes this book unique and refreshing is that it is not a mere &quot;legal thriller&quot; recounting a courtroom drama ad nauseam. Told from a callow journalist's point of view, it serves to break the mold of sorts. We are taken along for the bumpy, yet highly enjoyable ride as Willie Traynor opines with admirable conviction in his editorials for his newly acquired Clanton Times on topics ranging from Vietnam, Bargain Center, the Padgitt trial, etc.Traynor's idealism and courage of conviction are contagious and make the book worth reading alone. Grisham's well-placed humor, able characterization, &amp; seemingly effortless insertion of multidimensional supporting characters such as Sam, Lucien, Margaret, &amp; Baggy also add to the story immensely. Good stuff."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I am such a JG nutt! He is one of the few writers I read in this genre. I usually read romance novels but every once in awhile I enjoy a good mystery and when I feel like a good mystery I go in search of a JG novel. I loved this story, thought it was thrilling! I know you will agree. Buy the book and see for yourself!"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"This is a page-turner and I was happy to read a Grisham novel where the action had moved somewhat away from the courtroom for which he is famous. Finally the outcome is kept a secret until the last page and that makes this novel as fantastic as his first. Strongly recommend reading &quot;the last juror&quot;, then you love Grisham. He has done it again."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"THE LAST JUROR blends Grisham's slice of life style in PAINTED HOUSE with his traditional potboilers, making it more real and not so fantastic as past works.The first person narrator, Willie Traynor, takes over a small town paper, The Times, in 1971, about the time local punk, Danny Padgitt, rapes and murders a young woman in front of her children. As owner/editor of the Times, Traynor gets to know many of the local characters, not least of which is a black woman from the wrong side of the racially divided tracks, named Callie Ruffin.Callie is THE LAST JUROR referred to in the title, as the novel is more about the relationship between her and Traynor than it is about the criminal, Danny Padgitt. Grisham does not disappoint the reader, as by the end of his trial Padgitt threatens the jurors, that if they find him guilty he will &quot;get&quot; every one of them. They find him guilty anyway.Though sentenced to two &quot;life&quot; sentences in the Mississippi penal system, Padgitt ends up serving about 10 years. And then jurors start getting murdered.The meat of the book is devoted to Traynor and Callie and her remarkable family who have managed to educate themselves out of their racist little town. Callie has broken barriers throughout her life, and being the first black to sit on a Ford County jury (and the last juror seated on the jury) was just one of her many accomplishments. The lunches cooked by Callie for Traynor are mouthwatering to read.Over all, the story and wonderful prose are very compelling. With a twist ending that comes as a welcome surprise I felt this was Grisham's best work yet and I highly recommend it to Grisham fans and first time readers."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"The Last Juror was a sad disappointment. I had heard great things about John Grisham but had never read any of his books. I chose to read this for a book club, and had it not been my responsibility to finish it, I probably would have never finished it. It was moderately suspenseful in the beginning, and then it just died off. Danny went to jail, and that was it. All of a sudden I was smothered with meaningless details about Willie's life and acceptance in Mississippi. At that point, I didn't care if Danny was guilty or not. I didn't care how the story ended. But as I said, I had to read it, so I skipped through a few pages of blabber, and made my way through the painfully boring ending. It was a sad excuse for a suspense novel."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I have to say that of all the books Grisham has written, this is my favorite. A young man finds his way to a small time town and purchases the local paper.I enjoyed how the main character, observes, reflects and interprets the events of the community.With the proper twists and unexpected events Grisham gives his readers another master piece"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"The good thing about this book is that it is a light-hearted story to read. It is a fast-paced book. I consider it to be one of Grisham's best. Grisham returned to legal thriller with style after his most recent books (Bleachers, Painted House, etc.). The Juror is presented through the eyes of the local newspaper editor. Like all Grisham books, it comes to a very sudden and abrupt ending, but for a change, it doesn't deviate from the story .In this novel John Grisham has created an intense, fascinating and revealing study of a small southern town, and created lively characters that developed with the story. His details are plentiful. Before reading this, I read Disciples of Fortune, another historical fiction; so for now, this genre that was not at the top of my list has a place there now. I like lovely historical fictions that stir the adrenaline flow."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I loved this book for its insights into southern humor,culture,food,history,and human nature. Watching Willy grow up and mature was pure pleasure and I expect I'll return to read this story again and again. I have a friend from the North who \\"married Southern\\",and he has developed the most delightful accent. His humor and excellent storytelling skills are identical to Clanton's town characters, and it was not a far stretch at all for me to relax in their presence. Sometimes I laughed out loud, stayed up till dawn, gasped, and was once afraid to read the next page! I did not want to leave..."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I am a small town lawyer and perhaps that is why I have always enjoyed Grisham's work. But when he trades in his lawyer narrator role for that of a small town newspaper editor, he really hit home with me. This is a great book, perhaps the best book of my lifetime. One review compared it to To Kill a Mockingbird. That is fair and were Gregory Peck cast to play the hero in the movie, the story might be as memorable. I am here because I recommended the book to a friend. Reading the reviews, I realize that I have forgotten just enough that I can have that wonderful treasure of reading this book again, for the fourth time."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Set in Clanton, Mississippi in 1970, \\"The Last Juror\\" has the characteristic southern flavor of a John Grisham novel. The plot is centered on Willie Traynor, who moves to Clanton for a journalism internship at the county's only newspaper and seizes an opportunity to buy it when the owner dies. While Willie is adjusting to his new surroundings and profession, a heinous rape and murder occurs putting Willie in the spotlight due to his newspaper's juicy expose of the crime. During the trial, Willie's reports earn him a lot of friends, as well as enemies, for revealing facts about the accused killer's guilt. Near the end of the trial, the accused threatens to kill the jurors if they convict him, but he is still convicted and sentenced to life in prison. The plot shifts away from the murder and into the changes Willie makes at the newspaper, around town and in himself. Then the man convicted of the rape and murder gets out on parole after only nine years in prison, and suspense begins as someone starts murdering the jurors from the trial.The novel has many divisions in its plot. There is the crime and the killer's rich and powerful family whose interaction with the rest of the town reveals elements of southern culture. There is also Willie's newspaper that he transforms from a small daily with low readership to a top-quality and lucrative paper worth $1.5 million. Then, there is Willie's coming of age story involving his development from an immature 23-year-old college dropout to a successful and prominent businessman. While researching for an article, Willie befriends a black woman, who is the juror named in the title. The friendship between a white man and a black woman is taboo for a southern town at the time and is one of the many quirks that makes Willie stand out in Clanton.Aside from an interesting plot, there is a lull in the reading after the killer is sent to prison. It got so slow that I began to wonder if the rest of the book would be a play-by-play of Willie's life in Clanton, from the new bowtie he buys in town to how he feels about all 88 churches in Ford County. While the details of the everyday life in Clanton are fascinating for a while, it loses steam and is a drag until the murder mystery action resumes towards the end of the novel.\\"Grisham deserves a winning verdict for [his] latest literary thriller.\\" - Boston GlobeWith all due respect to the Boston Globe, the only thrilling feature of this novel is that it has random thrilling surges because the movement of the murder mystery is often paused for multiple short stories of life in Clanton. These epic pauses away from the active plot prevented it from sucking me in from cover to cover as many of his other novels have. If you are looking for a story about southern Mississippi culture sustained by a murder-revenge plot, then you won't be disappointed. However, I think that the portrayal of everyday life in Clanton out-weighs any possibility of labeling this novel an exciting thriller. While this book has the southern roots of any great John Grisham novel, it lacks his usual twisting, can't-put-it-down drama like \\"A Time to Kill\\", \\"The Client,\\" and others."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I think Mr. Grisham might have titled this novel before he wrote it, because the jury storyline is only a small part of the book. So, even though you're waiting for the jacket synopsis to come to pass all the way through this book, it's still an entertaining read."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"It's been a while since I had read my last Grisham novel so I rather enjoyed this one. I was a little surprised that this novel was not so much a courtroom thriller than it was about a 23-year old newspaperman, Willie Traynor, who covers a horrific murder trail involving of the town's more unsavory citizens. Therein, most of the storyline takes place outside of the courthouse.While I didn't find \\"The Last Juror\\" to be as tautly written (suspense-wise or action-wise) as some of Grisham's earlier works I did find that it still had much of elements that made me a follower of his works. His intriguing storyline, his wry humor and his endearing treatment of his characters were still evident. Grisham fans should not be disappointed by \\"The Last Juror.\\" It will provide a quick, enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Drivel and more Drivel....Grisham has lost his touch. You can't write good suspense novels using Harlequin Romance Techniques, filling the pages with unsubstantial filler. If you liked &quot;The Pelican Brief&quot;, and was unsatisfied with &quot;The Bleachers&quot;, then you and I will agree on this one."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"For the most part, I found this entertaining. I was troubled by one thing, though:The killer sneaked into the victim's house and hid in her closet, surprising her when she opened the closet door. He blindfolded her with a scarf, and cut her panties off with a knife before raping her at knifepoint. He made enough noise to awaken her small children, who came to see what was wrong. When the killer realizes the kids are there, he reacts, and the victim calls out the the kids to run. They run to the next-door neighbor. In the meantime, the killer has been recognized, and he slashes the victim's throat and flees. The neighbor goes to investigate and finds the victim, who has tried to follow the kids and collapsed. Before she dies, she tells him the name of the killer. The children are in shock and are eventually taken to live with realtives. They are too small to testify.Now, some of this, like the scarf, the closet, cutting the panties could have been discovered during the investigation. But, when the DA cross-examined the killer, he knew things that only the killer, the victim and the children would have known, like that the victim had called to the children to run. The killer was, of course, denying that he was even there. The victim died before she could say more than who did it. The children were too traumatized to tell what they had see. So how, exactly, did the DA know?"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Nice book but not up to his previous work. Didn't bother to finish his work. Must have been in a hurry, under pressure from publisher. Would not recommend."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Grisham writes some of the smoothest books around, and thatis not a negative comment. His works are so easy-going andreadable, and once started, they are difficult to put down.This one is also good, but it doesn't seem to have the focusof the better-known Grisham novels. It is almost like a storytold by an old-timer, where you find it interesting, but youknow if he lost his threat of thought, you wouldn't miss much.This is the story of a young guy who drifted through college,and never graduated because his grandmother cut off his money,and who ended up working as a reporter on a small Mississippiweekly. But he has barely gotten his feet wet when the old-timeowner/editor comes to an end to his career, and the young guyget the idea he would like to make something of this small failing paper, and maybe have some fun himself; so he talks hisgrandmother into putting up the money to buy the paper,and hegoes to work. Not only does he work, but he begins to try toease himself into the small-town society.He is working hard, and the paper shows promise, when the mosthorrible crime in anyone's memory occurs, and he finds himselfin the middle of a very exciting and dangerous time.A young attractive widow is suddenly attacked, raped and murdered, apparently in front of her two small children, andthe town explodes in hatred toward the obvious culprit.A very nasty trial takes place, and Grisham describes the juryproceedings, and it's impact on the small town, as no othercan. The killer is found guilty, but he is spared the deathpenalty in a controversal decision by the jury, but after heis sent off to Parchman prison, the real mystery begins.The pace is good, and the characters are, for the most part,readable and interesting."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"This is ellen in atlanta and A Time to Kill was my favorite Grisham book--until now. He's back to his excellent writing and beautiful character studies. Some authors am giving up on, but Grisham, write about what you want--keep your heart in Ford County!"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I absolutely loved The Summons, The King of Torts and The Partner, but this book was not like the others. It's not a legal thriller but a history lesson about the South. If you are interested in foods of the South and the Civil Rights movement, then this book is for you. If you are expecting a legal thriller like previous John Grisham novels, look elsewhere-- you will be disappointed like I was!"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Grisham tries to mix his two styles here. He made his start with the fast-paced thrillers and has spent his last few novels telling stories (A Painted House, Bleachers).In &quot;The Last Juror&quot;, Grisham tells the story of Willie Traynor and his exploits as the young owner of a newspaper in Clanton in the 1970's. He mixes in a little thriller spice when a murderer gets paroled and the members of the jury that convicted him start getting murdered as well.It was a decent read, but not what I was expecting. If you want a fast-paced thriller, pick another book. If you liked &quot;A Painted House&quot; or &quot;Bleachers&quot; this is a worthwhile book to read."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"John Grisham spins great tales from the South. I grew up in Hernando Mississippi. John's books are believable because the details behind the stories are REAL. I remember sitting on the same lawn that John writes in his book waiting for local election results. I remember the team of lawyers that seemed to drink to much and broke down every nugget of gossip in the town.The story is entirely believable and a great absorption into the ways of the South during the late 60's and 70's. I think it is one of his best works yet."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"John G. has done a good job in this novel in the descriptions of the characters and area that places you right into the story. The wit and plot twists keep you laughing to yourself & guessing what is coming next.I read this on a cross country flight & the time just flew by.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I have trouble forming words for this review because the book just didn't leave me with much. It was mediocre at best. The main character, Willie Traynor, moves to Ford County, Mississippi to work for a small weekly newspaper. When the owner goes bankrupt he buys the paper and thus begins his future in Clanton. The main focus on the legal thriller side of the book is a murder and rape of a widow that is witnessed by her two small children. The perpetrator is a member of a powerful family that is into nothing legal. The flip side of the book is the wide range of characters that Willie encounters in Clanton. This, by far, is the more interesting portion of the novel. However it is not until the reader is completely bored and disappointed with the murder trial that we realize that the book has something to offer. The characters turn out to be highly sympathetic and entertaining, but too late in the book. I do not know why I continue to buy Grisham's books because they have been so disappointing for so long. At least this one had some redeeming qualities, but not many."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Loved it! Grisham's back! Not since Bailey's \\"Cries of the Orchids\\" have I been so captivated, quite literally on the edge of my seat. Can't wait for the next!"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Having moved myself from a large city to a very small town, I thought Grisham's portrayal the characters you get to know when living in a more intimate setting was right on. I enjoyed \\"living in this book.\\" I was a Grisham fan when he first got started, but was subsequently disappointed in some of his books and stopped reading him. In The Last Juror he seemed back in stride again."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"\\"The Last Juror\\" is a great novel. It has a ton of suspense throughout the entire story. Also, there is a lot of mystery in the story too. In fact, I never knew what was going to happen next, what was going to be said, and what new major event would arise. The great amount of mystery and suspense in this novel will keep you guessing the entire time. Overall, I think the novel was pretty well rounded. It has its problems, but yet all novels do. The main problem that I found with the novel was that there was just to many pages filled with information that was not that essential to the story. Many of the pages could have been taken out or at least been replaced by something that relates to the main topic better. I love the characters though. They were awesome. John Grisham did such a great job creating them and connecting them to the real world. Throughout the entire novel, I felt that I could really connect to the characters and relate to what they were going through, because they seemed to be so real. It is like everything in the book actually happened and is real because everything and everybody in the story is so life like. The parts of the story that deal with legal matter are really exciting and attention grabbing. I found myself reading faster and faster through these parts. Parts like these just make you want to keep reading until the end. Even though the story has parts that are prolonged to much and are not that relevant to the main idea, I still give \\"The Last Juror\\" two thumbs up. Who knows, maybe John Grisham made all of the extra information on purpose to serve as the thing that separates this novel of his from the rest."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I thought that this was one on Grisham's most creative novels. an interisting thing about the book is that there are two distinct yet intertwined storylines. One is the relation of the narrator and protagonist Willie with the older, \\"festivly plump\\" black woman Miss. Callie Ruffin. The other prominent storyline is that of the murder/rapist Danny Padgitt, given that the title of the book is \\"The Last Juror\\" you would expect it to be more about the trial and the jury, however the bulk of the book is about the relationship that Miss. Callie and Willie share. Not as suspensfull as some of his earlier works yet just as easily able to make you fall in love with one charcter and absolutly despise another. One of his most engrosing books."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I think that the book ought not to have been advertised like a thriller or suspense novel. It was entirely too slow moving and had too much detail to be one. It was a good novel about life in a small town in the south in the past, but definitely not a Grisham thriller. I thought that the cover and the back description were both misleading. They did not really tell what the book was actually about. I thought that the plot \\"twist\\" was way to obvious."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"that this book probably deserves closer to 3.5 stars. The story centers around young Willie Traynor who becomes the owner of a small town Southern newspaper. As with all small towns, news travels fast and when a horific murder is committed, the news spreads like wildfire. Justice is demanded and small town grievances and bullies are all the talk of the town. The last juror is really someone who Willie befriends during the course of the novel. Less about law and more about small town life in the deep South. The law that is referenced is obviously well reserached and the author makes note of what he cites as intentional discrepancies. I happen to like the thrill of Grisham's earlier novels better than this one. It reminded me too much of A Time to Kill really. I'd recommend taking this out of the library and would suggest it as a good in flight read in lieu of a movie."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"This book did not seem like it was over 400 pages long because it was so easy to quickly read. The characters are so well developed and you feel like you know them personally by the end of the book. This was my first JG book and I am looking forwards to reading much more of his work."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Just can't beat John Grisham books and The Last Juror was an A+. I had this downloaded to my Kindle so that I could stay up late and read without disturbing my husband. It is hard to put this one down. My husband wonders why I am so sleepy in the morning. He doesn't know I have been enjoying excitement with John instead of sleeping!!"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"John Grisham has created another great thriller, complete with his usualhumor and sensitivity. It is a good book to curl up with on a wintry day, and will definitely keep you reading and anticipating the next page.If you have not read any of John Grisham's books, I recommend that youtry other titles also.Amazon.com is a very good place to get your best sellers."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Ive read some complaints that this book was marketed wrong and that the book was not what people expected. I can see how that might bother some people but in the end all I care about is that its a John Grisham book. Some of his books havent been the greatest but the moajority of the time they are SO GOOD. This book is no exception.I loved the small town intimate story and enjoyed reading about all the different subtleties in all the characters. I totally believe that this sort of situation could happen in the small town in the deep south. I love stories that invlove a character that gets caught up in something larger than themselves and cant turn their back on what's right. Willie is just that kind of character. LOVED THIS BOOK!!!"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"A gripping novel from page one to the last page .Typical Grisham thriller.Have now been motivated to buy The Runaway Jury.1"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I find the story slow moving at times. I guess in Mississippi life was a whole lot slower. But it was fast enough to keep me interested. This was more of a human interest story between Willie Traynor &Callie Ruffin."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"One of Grisham's best I'd say. The author capitalized on what he does best, that's the legal part, then added a lot of heart to it. It combines the thrill and drama of the scenes in the courtroom with the heart and soul and lives of its many colorful characters.The story spans a decade, the 70's, a period of transformation and awakening, especially in the deep south. It talks about taking risks, commitment, growing up. It demonstrates the power of the written word. It relates how true friendship can break barriers. All of these, Mr. Grisham cooked up, and peppered it with the legal excitement that he's become a master of, and the result is just very tasteful."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"What a great story. I have owned this audio book for a few years now, and have returned to it perhaps five times. Why? Well, the storyline itself is really good (classic Grisham). In this book, however, Grisham seems to outdo himself in describing the fictional town of Clanton, Mississippi in the 1970's (the place, people and happenings), through the eyes of relative outsider Willie Trainor. After hearing the audio book even for the first time, I could see Clanton in my mind's eye. After a few go-arounds, though, it is all the clearer. And, the story holds up nicely through repeated (audio) re-reads. The characters are well-developed, with believable virtues and faults. This is well exemplified through character Harry Rex Vonner. A scoundrel, and not always a lovable one, but a complex man with some redeeming value. Grisham makes good use of this character , apparently resisting any opportunity to make him into the type of character that we as a society seem to crave: a scoundrel who repents by the end of the book/movie,to save the day. Finally, kudos to the narrator, Michael Beck, who tells the story smoothly, in different voices, without sounding hokey."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I really enjoyed this book. The author developed the characters splendidly and interestingly. The major characters were there and the minor characters moved thru the story with ease. The major plots were well woven and the sub plots popped up when we least expected them.The story is well told from a first person narrative, in a time when many of us came of age. The mid sixties and early seventies were turbulent times with the Vietnam War and segregation, especially in the South. But this is where the story lives and grows and blooms.I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to get in a quiet place with a glass of ice tea and let themselves drift away to another time - not so far away."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"This was a very smooth read. I haven't read Grisham in a long time; Time to Kill is an all time favorite.This was a good story. It took awhile to get to the mystery of things and I ended up skimming the last couple of chapters, because by then the plot was over. I guess I expected it to be more suspenceful and less everyday happenings.But, over all I did like the book."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"This was one of the weaker Grisham books. It literally took me four months to finish, picking it up here and there again, reading a couple of chapters, then going on to do something else. The reason I finished it is because it was a good look into Southern culture during the desegregation era. I liked much of the social commentary, particularly that on corruption, the legal system, and segregation. But it is not suspenseful, and nothing like books such as A Time to Kill, which is what got me started on Grisham (even though both books take place in the same setting). Also, the ending was very disappointing - with a relatively minor character gaining the spotlight suddenly in the last forty or so pages. The killing of jurors sparked my interest, but I was expecting some sort of twisted ending - like Callie Ruffin being the mastermind of everything or something along those lines. Also, I find the writing style in this book somewhat lacking. In earlier Grisham books it was as though you could see exactly what he was describing. Here you have to labour through paragraphs and re-read them because it is unclear what kind of picture he is painting. The first-person writing style, I find, exacerbates this problem (although it worked somewhat in \\"The Rainmaker\\".)"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I haven't read any of Grisham's books since The Rainmaker, but my girlfriend convinced me to read this one because she really liked it. I found myself absorbed into the story and turned the pages until the end. Well-written, and a good read even for those folks who don't get into courtroom drama (like myself). The only dissapointment for me was a somewhat abrupt ending."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"This book gets of to a very slow start but picks up quik for the last 3 quarters of the book. This is alot like a much better version of To Kill A Mocking Nird"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"&quot;The Last Juror&quot; may be John Grisham's best work since &quot;A Time to Kill.&quot; If there is anything Grisham understands it is the small town south and the lawyers and judges who inhabit them. Here, he adds a three-dimensional 23 year old newspaperman, Willie Traynor, into the mix. Willie is an interesting fellow, whom we see grow from a callow youth with a rich grandmother into a mature and responsible -- not to mention highly successful -- newspaper publisher. The story turns on the threat to the jury that convicts him by a vicious rapist and murderer, Danny Padgitt, and the subsequent deaths of several of those jurors - shortly after Padgitt's parole from prison after only nine years. Grisham gives us a clever, exciting story that is very different from what you might expect, in more ways than one."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I have ALL of John Grisham's novels and this is the second one written about Clanton Mississippi! Murder(and mayhem) are the topics in two of his novels. I was familiar with one character in this novel, lawyer Harry Rex Vonner, also from &quot;A Time to Kill&quot;. The other characters in this book were well fleshed-out. This book was written from the point of view of a young newspaper publisher, not a lawyer, so it was &quot;different&quot; from the usually brilliant Grisham legal books.If only John's ATTEMPT at writing this book had been as wonderful as his descriptions of &quot;Miss Callie's cooking&quot;, I'd give him 4 stars!I was really looking forward to another 'legal thriller' (as alluded to on the book jacket) but this book did NOT deliver."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"In this book, John Grisham returns to his southern small town roots such as in &quot;A Time to Kill&quot;. This book shows what life is truly like in many small towns in the rural South. I could see many characters that I grew up with incorporated into this story. I think it is one of his best ones lately. John Grisham is an excellent auther and can hold his own with any mystery writer anywhere!"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"This plot and the fully-realized characters bring back the basics of good storytelling at which Grisham excelled in his earlier work. An example of the reason we all flocked to buy his work once upon a time. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"This book is fantastic. I loved everything about this book, and it reminds me of one of Grisham's first book. The characters were so real and well-developed. There were really two plots going on in this book, and Grisham does a remarkable job of weaving these two plot lines together.The author's sense of humor is sharper than ever. The author here in true form doing what he does best, and you get the sense of an author who has all the confidence in the world. There are few contemporary authors in pop literature to compare to this author."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"John Grisham returns and shows us why he's the most popular American writer ever with \\"The Last Juror.\\" The book is filled with colorful people from fictional Ford County Mississippi; learning more about each one is a delight. After three less than exceptional books that left me a little disheartened, Grisham returns to the place where his books started, the setting of the great \\"A Time to Kill.\\" In this book, though, the main character Willie Traynor befriends a sixty-year-old black mother of eight in 1970. That year, the town was rocked by the brutal death of Rhoda Kasselaw; and Traynor, as newspaper editor, was set to benefit from the sensational details.Grisham is highly adept at character development and keeps the reader interested in and caring for each colorful character. Don't miss the ending! Welcome back, John."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"There are a number of negative reviews on this site about The Last Juror, primarily because readers of the novel are expecting it to be something different than what it is. This is not a legal thriller in the spirit of Grishmam's early novels. The Last Juror has as much in common with a novel like \\"Snow on Falling Cedars\\" (although not nearly as good)as it does with \\"A Time to Kill\\".There is a murder and there is a trial (and they are central to the story) but Grisham appears more interested in exploring small town life in the rural south in the 1970's than he is in building action and suspense.Grisham compromises in The Last Juror and tries to have it both ways but unfortunately he falls short on both counts. Suspense fans will find that the novel lacks the page turning tension they want in a legal thriller and readers looking for a novel rich in character and setting will be disappointed by an ending that feels \`tacked on', as if Grisham were trying to appease suspense fans with an action packed ending.Grisham is an unquestionably good story teller but The Last Juror suffers from an identity crisis. Grisham inserts a legal thriller into a character driven story about a young man who moves to rural Mississippi and takes the helm of a small town newspaper. The result is uneven and overall, a little unsatisfying."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Make no mistake, Grisham has a smooth, almost machine-like capcacity to move a story along. He has an ear for dialog and an eye for funny anecdotes, or at least humorous, colorful slants on southern life as most outsiders have come to know the \\"Bible belt\\".In \\"Juror\\", Grisham uses almost every stereotype and prototypical hero he can find, from the black family of PhDs to the boozy journalist, gun-totin' lawyers, simple-mided janitor, corrupt sheriff, eccentric old folks, gorgeous widow, family of moonshiners and monsters, and the mournful sister of the deceased. There are elements of many of Grisham's previous books, especially \\"A time to kill,\\" and some of the characters are pretty worn out from overuse.Our narrator, Willie, the entrepreneurial college drop out who is able to manage, write and edit a disaster of a paper into a smart newspaper, stumbles into the proverbial gold mine, taking a $50,000 bankruptcy purchase into a $1.5 million sale nine years later. Along the way, Willie (hit with a southern version of his name at introduction, it really sticks) takes on powerful forces, beds the sister of the widow, learns how to dress like Tom Wolfe, refurnishes a rambling old house in a five-year project, and builds a newspaper that everyone wants to read, only to sell out in the end.Underlying all of this is his relationship with the black matron, mother of all those PhDs and one runaway son, through the turbulence of the 1970s in southern America. Willie gets to be a redneck in training, a master of integration, and the tree-hugging war protestor, embraced and admired by the entire community. The last third of the book winds down with a transparent subterfuge by Grisham, who lets the surface suspect take all of the heat while an even casual reader can figure out who really is behind the murders of the jurors.It all is a little too trite, too sweet, too stereotyped to make the experience worthwhile or memorable. Like cotton candy, it is sweet without the substance, satisfying one base craving for a story while yielding little real satisfaction."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"In his last two books &quot;Bleachers&quot; and &quot;The king of Torts&quot;, Grisham explored other genres of writing. The former evolves around reminiscences of a high school football team and the latter has to do with big shot lawyers (this is closer to a legal thriller, but not quite there). Neither of these novels was very good, and it seems that the author understood that he should go back to what he does best, writing legal thrillers. &quot;The Last juror&quot; would have been great if he had stuck to this approach. After a very interesting and fast-paced Part One, in which he describes the trial vividly grabbing the reader's attention without letting go, the quality of the novel declines abruptly in Part Two and only recovers somewhat in the last part.The storyteller, Willie Frayner, is a journalist that starts an internship at The Ford County Times after his studies are cut short by his grandmother's decision of stopping the flow of money she was providing. The paper soon gets into financial trouble, goes bankrupt, and Willie convinces his grandma to give him $50,000 to buy it. At about this time Danny Padgitt rapes and kills Rhoda Kassellaw, mother of two little children, and there are enough witnesses and evidence to build a clear-cut case. Nevertheless, the killer belongs to one of the most powerful families in the area; family feared by many because of the way they had disposed of their &quot;problems&quot; in the past. The Times, under Willie's lead, sets out in an uncompromising and daring coverage of the trial and every aspect of the case that shows the &quot;special treatment&quot; the accused receives. This creates a dangerous situation for Willie, who is clearly playing with fire.As it usually happens in Grisham books, the story presents the reader with a shocking view of the social and racial inequalities that existed in Mississippi in 1970, which from my point of view gives a significant added value to the book. In this environment, Willie establishes a very special relationship with a black woman that has an extraordinary family; seven out of eight siblings are college professors in a time in which inequalities are abundant. Even the eighth one is on its way to achieve similar feats, but he has found some added difficulties in his past. Of course, the events regarding this family will be intertwined with the main story.As a final comment, I would recommend you not to read the description provided in the dust jacket, which in my opinion contains a huge plot spoiler. It would be better to find out what happens in the trial and afterwards by yourself."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I have read every John Grisham book out there... and just when you think he won't be able to come up with a story as good as the last book... he comes out with \\"the last juror\\". In this case, yes it's about a lawyer and a law suit, but so much more at the same time! This book will definitly make you think, make you fear and make you cry... you'll LOVE IT!!"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"A John Grisham novel, where the courtroom drama is minimal - it ends in the first few pages itself. It is so different from \\"The Client\\" or the \\"Runaway Jury\\". The author has managed to sprinkle humor at several places - jus to quote - the Ivy league \\"Syracuse\\" and Will being rechristened as Willie.There are times when the story wanders off and it is difficult to understand what the author wants to convey thro those narrations.The story is a nail-biter. However, it is so not because you wanna know \\"What happens next ?\\" but want to know \\"what the author is taking you with this ?\\".I read this on my loooong flight from San Jose to Cincinnati. It was a worthy read !"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Although I have read far worse books than this one, I had a definite feeling of disappointment after finishing it. The expected story line comprised only a fairly small percentage of the book. This in itself need not be fatal. The same thing could be said about the much-loved \\"To Kill a Mockingbird.\\"In this case, however, the \\"filler\\" around the plot just was not strong enough to carry the story. The characters were fairly interesting and fairly compelling but (again) not strong enough to carry the story. The \\"Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil\\" characters, for example, did a better job in a similar situation.The narrator of the story became less and interesting during the course of the book. He confessed to be, after running a small town newspaper for ten years, \\"tired of writing.\\" The more tired of writing he became, the more tired I became of reading what he had to say.Finally, several of the \\"mystery\\" elements of the story had loose ends that were not resolved or even mentioned.I gave the book two stars because I believe it would have to have been at least a little worse to rank only one star. But if it would have to have been much better in the areas mentioned to have been rated four or five stars."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Although John Grisham has followed the likes of James Patterson and David Baldacci in recent years, and successfully moved away from the formula that made him rich, it wasn't until I'd read 50 pages or so of \\"The Last Juror\\" that I finally got the joke. Although sold as a legal thriller -- the front cover illustration on the paperback edition is a jury deliberation room -- this book does not have a lawyer as a protagonist. And there is no $30 million at stake, driving the characters' motivation. This is new ground for Grisham: a legal thriller, without the lawyers.What follows in this book will test your devotion to the Grisham legal thriller formula. He is not interested in plot this time around: although the back cover sells the book as the story of a jury being killed off, member by member, nine years after their deliberation in a sensational Southern murder trial, you will have read 400 of the book's first 475 pages before any juror actually dies. And while the various Clanton, Mississippi characters will be familiar from older Grisham novels (slovenly divorce lawyer Harry Rex Vonner -- the soul of Joe Don Baker in the body of Oliver Platt -- shows up for at least his third Grisham outing), the main character is a Northern journalist who accidentally finds himself publishing a small town weekly. The novel's title character is an older black woman who unwittingly winds up as the keystone figure in Clanton's long-overdue integration.That's really all you need to know about \\"The Last Juror\\". You already know that a lot of space will be devoted to descriptions of Southern food and religious practices. Grisham writes with his usual flurry of self-contained chapters, so that you can finish the book in literally a few hours if you have a mind to. He doesn't mind digressing -- the action stops dead about 50 pages before the end, when our journalist hero tries to block Wal-Mart from colonizing Clanton. And you'll also be able to figure out who done it long before the author tells you.The bottom line is standard fare for Grisham, but with a twist. The blurb for his forthcoming hardcover also appears to advertise a book without a lawyer protagonist. However, you need not be afraid that Grisham is losing his touch with what made him famous: \\"The Last Juror\\" is still classic Grisham, even without the lawyers and the guns and the money."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"The writing by Grisham on The Last Juror I thought were some of his best writing since it took him 15 years to write The Last Juror. So I am happy to say that The Last Juror is a must for any Grisham fan. The Last Juror is not about a young hot-shot lawyer or any lawyers at all, instead it takes place in the 70's in Ford County Mississippi where A Time To Kill took place, but now a murder is committed by a local named Danny Padgett; troublemaker, and who's family is known for drug running, and other petty crime. So now as the case goes to trial, a young man named Wileyw who buys the Ford County Times, then covers the case as Danny is tried for murder of Rhonda where she met Danny at a local club on the state line, but gave him the cold shoulder because she would not accept his dance. So he killed her. Now Danny got life, but in the 70's, life does not mean life, it just means eight years. So now as Wiley gets used to the Southern life, and with the meetings of three Vietnam vetrans who love to play poker but Wiley always loses when he plays them. Then once Danny gets out of prison for parole, three murders happen to three juror's from the Danny trial just eight years ago. Now the finger is pointed at Danny. The last 50 pages are the best Grisham has ever written, this book is well written, it is slow at first, but the suspense builds with every page that is read. This is a great book, and not to be missed."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I read this book and found that it is a little bland. I think that Grisham is just throwing books together now and not taking the time to make a great book. Still think his best book to date is a &quot;A Time TO Kill&quot;"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"As usual, a good storyteller will always deliver something. My problem was the shift between thriller and small town character analysis. The storyline continually switched back and forth. It made for two really good tales, but neither added up to one excellent one."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"This books takes the reader to the very edge of suspense but never produces the thrill. I kept hoping, until the very last page, to be awarded with the twist or big payoff at the end of the story. I am a huge fan and normally read a Grisham book in 2 days, this one took me 3 weeks. I forced myself to finish it because I had woven a web in my mind and wanted to see if I was right. It turned out my ending was better than the one in the book. The account of life in a small southern town during the 70's was a pleasant read but not enough to make up for the missing plot and average story."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I'll admit I'm hot and cold when it comes to Grisham, but &quot;The Last Juror&quot; really works for me. Never did it feel the author ran out of time to finish his story (a feeling I've had in several of his books). Furthermore, his depiction of the place and period are extremely accurate. The human story lines - both main and secondary characters - are very real and genuine, filled with honest emotion. Say what you will about Grisham, but this book is most authentic in its depiction of how these events would (and probably did in the past) unfold - he nailed it. The &quot;feel&quot; of the book reminds me of the strength he demonstrated in &quot;Painted House&quot; (an example of one of his books in which it appears the ending just stops abruptly without closure) in which I can still feel the swealtering heat of and Arkansas summer to this day.Overall, I fiind this one of the better books I've read this season. A good read."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"This book is like a donut, it doesn't have a middle. What it does have are the kinds of characters you have come to expect from a Grisham novel set in the south: hard drinking lawyers, corrupt cops and bad guys.The plot is pretty basic. A horrible rape and murder takes place. The bad guy is apprehended and sent away for a couple of years, then he gets out and jury members start dropping over dead. The problem is the ten years in between. Grisham fills this void with his social commentary on the Vietnam War, race relations and the rest.Willie, the main character and accidental newspaper editor comes of age during the time. The story moves along like a rudderless ship on a calm sea.Most of us buy his books hoping to read another Rainmaker or the Firm or the Testament.This book was probably an effort to write. It certainly was an effort to read."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"There's little left of small-town life and constructive local newspapers in most of America now. Clearly, John Grisham regrets that and writes nostalgically about Clanton, Mississippi, as seen through the eyes of its one outsider, Willie Traynor, the new owner of the local newspaper. He even makes the drunks charming while smoothing out much of the pain of racism, segregation, the Vietnam War and economic woes. Mr. Grisham is so rosy that he sees the glass as overfilled with goodness. His narrator even visits every local church to report on their services.So if you like books that portray startling action, baffling mysteries or heart-pounding suspense, this is not the book you are looking for.While the jacket copy and advertising for the book focus on the trial of obviously guilty Danny Padgitt who raped and murdered a woman while her young children watched, that's just one story among many in the book. The novel builds around a series of short stories about the microcosm of Clanton as it reflected the pressures in the rest of the world. The main focus of the story development is around the growing friendship between young Willie Traynor and Ms. Callie Ruffin, a black mother who has raised an astonishing set of children (all but one of whom have Ph.D.'s). Ms. Ruffin is affected by the murder, having been selected as the last juror for that case.Although the principles that Mr. Grisham supports are ones that I agree with, his book is so prettied up and simplified that I found much of what he wrote about to be unappealing. There's an Aesop's Fables aspect to the story that makes it feel like it's aimed at children rather than adults. Human errors happen, but they are the exception to the reality. Corruption occurs . . . but it doesn't seem to harm anyone very much. Hatred exists . . . but the harm is mostly in creating homesickness.Inevitably, anyone who writes about small town Mississippi will be compared to William Faulkner. To compare this book to Mr. Faulkner's work would demean Mr. Faulkner. Stick to the original!"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Story teller John Grisham spins us another yard of life in rural Mississippi thru the eyes of a newspaper owner/editor. We are again taken to Clanton, Mississippi and meet familiar characters like Harry Rex and Lucien Willbanks.Grisham spins a tale with his usual ingredients; someone has done a dastardly deed (rape and murder in this case) and was sentenced to life in prison. However, in 1970's Mississippi, a life sentence translates to about 10 years. Now the jurors are being killed off, one by one.The ending is a surprise and the astute reader will figure out &quot;who dun it&quot; but it is a fast read and a good read."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Slower paced than his legal thrillers, with writing on the same level as McCrae's &quot;Bark of the Dogwood&quot; and a plot worthy of &quot;King of Torts,&quot; this latest Grisham novel does NOT disappoint. It's understandable that hard-core Grisham fans want another &quot;The Firm,&quot; but the guy has moved on, combining his &quot;Painted House&quot; style with his other genres to create his best effort yet. Please give this book a chance!"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"The book had a good, typical Grisham start however, midway through it became boring and lost the earlier developed crispness. It would not hurt the author to seriously think about having his books reviewed by readers and not friends and specialists. This way he would get the best suggestions. However, the element of surprise may be lost in there. Overall an average book which will sell well because of author's previous reputation."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I, too, was taken in by the Book Description. That is, &quot;He returned to Ford County and the retribution began.&quot; The book was mildly entertaining, but I was disappointed that it wasn't what I expected."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"For me, just one reader, The Last Juror, stands out among all of John Grisham's novels as his very finest work.With The Last Juror, Grisham shows himself to be an author who has arrived at a point where he is able to pull it all together in a carefully developed, richly written story. The characters are introduced with great attention to detail and as a reader I was quickly drawn into the story and it's setting. The plot is strongly constructed and stays solid through the story's end. Each character is unusual and interesting enough to grow quickly interested in them; some even begin to feel like old friends by the end. The setting is nicely depicted and Grisham's prose really comes across with a sense of what it might be like to be in Clanton, Mississippi during the events of this story.At one level, The Last Juror is a story that revolves around the brutal rape and murder of one of Clanton, Mississippi's widows and the trial of the man accused. Yet, moreover, this is a story of a town, its history and traditions, its newspaper and of some of the local citizenry. Narrated by Willie Traynor, the young new owner (and outsider) of the town's newspaper, Grisham conveys some touching stories of Traynor's own development from a lackluster college dropout to a highly moral newspaper publisher. He weaves in some of the historical and present day tension between the black and the communities of Clanton, tells some of the story of the town's efforts to muddle through integration and richly communicates the story of one tremendously influential African American role model in the community. And, he does all this without being ponderous. The Last Juror while dealing with a sad incident has a real sense of personality and even a bit of comedy about it.From my perspective The Last Juror has some of the same rich feel of a novel I have long had great appreciation for, Staggerford, written by Jon Hassler. While Hassler wasn't a mystery writer, and his setting was Northern Minnesota and not the Deep South, the rich and complex writing about one town and it's goings on, has much the same feel.Kudos to Grisham on this one!Highly Recommended!Daniel J. MaloneySaint Paul, Minnesota USA"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I read some of the other reviews raving about this book. I have to ask myself if we were reading the same book. This was a 50 page book written on 350 pages. Very little actual plot. Actually, it reminded me, at times, of a poorly edited movie. I hope Grisham hasn't lost it. I enjoyed the King of Torts immensely, but this one was a real dud."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"This novel is sort of a combination of a two different novels, one about a trial, and nine years later. It is definitely typical of later Grisham. Predictable, short, but readable.Grisham describes the life of a young man who moves to the south and buys a small county newspaper. The first part deals with a trial of a gruesome murder. The second part deals with a mysterious killer (though who the real killer is insultingly obvious). Along with it, Grisham uses this story to weave in other stories about racial integration, southern style, and families.There is nothing wrong with this book except for the fact that it tries to be all in one and doesn't go into any great depth. Is it a thriller, a social commentary piece, or a law book? It tries to be all three and the result is very ho hum.Definitely better than \\"The Street Lawyer\\" or \\"King of Torts\\". Doesn't reach the heights of \\"The Chamber\\" or \\"A Painted House.\\"It's a decent read, but very mundane."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I loved this book! Thought it was one of Grisham's best. The charaters are so real I could picture them in my mind (and I must admit I was imagining who could play them in the movie).The development of J.William Traynor to Willie Traynor is believeable and interesting. The friendship between Willie and Miss Callie is sweet. I wonder how much of it was based on Willie never having a mother. I cried a little at the end which I don't remember doing while reading any of Mr.Grisham's other books."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I'm a Grisham fan as well and of his books my favorite is his first: &quot;A Time to Kill&quot;. I liked that this book takes place in the same town as the first: Clanton, Mississippi. But was disappointed that it isn't as good a read as the first. I think Grisham's earlier books were without a doubt his best. Still, it's an entertaining book and it was interesting to read the transformation that takes place with Willie Traynor."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Grisham has a unique talent to write about small, Southern towns and make them a place you want to live. He uncovers the good and the bad but he also makes you think. Miss Callie is a woman I would have loved to have known, for her strength, courage and commitment to her Lord and Savior &amp; her family. Sure this book isn't a taut legal thriller, but it has it's moments. This book is more a character study which Grisham has a way with, especially when it comes to Southerners. Read it and enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"The 1st part of this book is really good, good characters, murder, mystery, legal courtroom drama and journalism. The 2nd part was not very interesting to me, although the ending was good. Looks like Grisham is giving us a 1/2 legal(Runaway Jury) and 1/2 human interest(Painted House) story. Overall an enjoyable read for me. I prefer the author's legal thrillers."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"The Last Juror is a wonderful story about the decade between the late '60's and late '70's, tangentially covering social and political issues from Vietnam, Civil Rights, and the youth movement. The characters are real people you will care about. The story is well paced and grabbing. If anyone has been harboring doubts about the status of Grisham in the Pantheon of great American writers this novel will easily dispel them. This is a rich Southern Novel that will stand beside all others."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"With 'The Last Juror', John Grisham has delivered a novel that will please fans of both his courtroom dramas and his other more literary works. While a slower-moving story than some of his other legal thrillers, I found the combination of the courtroom scenes juxtaposed with the snapshots of Clanton life circa the 'Old South/New South' era to be very effective. You really feel as if you get to know (and care for) the main characters...especially Willie Traynor and Callie.Pick this one up and give it a try...you shouldn't be disappointed!!"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I am a John Grisham fan and have liked all of his books. The Last Juror was one of my favorites because of all of the different themes that are developed in the book. The main character is a &quot;wet behind the ears&quot; northerner who moves to a southern town and buys the local small town newspaper. The book addresses racism, politics, religion, small town life, family, friendship and much more. It's not just entertaining - it gives you something to think about."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I thought this was Grisham's best book in years. He captured the spirit of the 70s in the deep south while giving the darker aspects those difficult times a light touch. His quirky characters (one of the things he does best)were well written. And, for those of us who loved &quot;A Time to Kill,&quot; it was interesting to compare characters in this loose &quot;prequel.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"Each February, a Grisham novel hits the stores and immediately scores a place at the top of the bestseller list. What ensures this success? Some of it has to do with predictability; some with unpredictability. Cracking the spine of a Grisham thriller, readers know they find themselves submerged in a legal battle. The characters that will be encountered and the social issues that might be addressed are unpredictable. This combined with the effects of law and the legal system on everyman --- and just plain good storytelling --- makes Grisham's books intriguing adventures. THE LAST JUROR does not disappoint at any of these levels.Many readers think Grisham's first book was THE FIRM, but that book was not Grisham's first publication. A TIME TO KILL was his first shot at courtroom fiction. Fifteen years ago, with a press run of 5,000, a small Southern publisher published A TIME TO KILL in Grisham's home state. The book received little notoriety until the popularity of THE FIRM and Grisham's second blockbuster, THE PELICAN BRIEF. After its re-release, A TIME TO KILL reached not only the bestseller list but was also a popular movieTHE LAST JUROR is set in the fictitious town of Clanton, Mississippi, in Ford County, which readers may recall was the setting for A TIME TO KILL, Grisham's first book. The events that are the narrative of THE LAST JUROR are recounted through the eyes of Willie Traynor, a Memphis-born and eastern-educated journalist. He comes to Clanton because one of his fellow journalism students advised him that a small local newspaper was in fact a gold mine; in addition to printing newspapers, his presses would make him fast money. After a short-term internship for the Ford County Times, the paper is forced into bankruptcy. Fortunately, Willie has what every young entrepreneur needs to start a business: a wealthy relative. With $50,000 borrowed from his grandmother, Willie rescues the paper from bankruptcy and begins his career as editor, publisher and reporter for the Ford County Times.Potential readers need not fear that Grisham has written a tale of journalists and the woes of publishing a weekly tabloid. Be assured that the Grisham formula of crime, courtrooms and attorneys is still a cornerstone of this novel. In fact, savvy Grisham readers will note that several of the attorneys who they previously met in A TIME TO KILL also are characters in this novel.The crime that forms the foundation of THE LAST JUROR is a brutal rape and murder committed by Danny Padgitt, scion of a powerful outlaw Ford County family. Residents fear Padgitt will use his power and influence to escape punishment for his crime. The trial occupies a substantial portion of the book and reaches an ugly climax when the defendant, upon completing his testimony and leaving the witness stand, turns to the jury and announces, &quot;You convict me and I'll get every damned one of you.&quot;One of the jurors threatened is Miss Callie Ruffin. Willie meets Miss Callie as he is writing a local interest article about her unique family. All of Callie's children, save one, have overcome the segregated life of Mississippi in the 1960s to become college professors. Like many blacks in that era, they left the South to accomplish their goals. Traynor goes to Miss Callie's house in order to write about this remarkable woman and the rest, as they say, is fate. Miss Callie is selected to be the first African American to serve on a jury in Ford County. She is the last juror selected in the trial of Danny Padgitt.There is something loving and stirring when John Grisham writes about his native Mississippi. His affection for his home state shows, as he describes not only the people of the South but the lifestyle they have cultivated. As Grisham describes the region during the tumultuous time frame of the Civil Rights era and the Vietnam War, he is honest enough to acknowledge both the good and bad of the region. Reading Grisham, the reader is struck by the fact that the South is not as evil as most Northerners often portray, but also not as noble as most Southerners would like to believe.In addition to the historical ruminations about his beloved South, Grisham delivers the twisting and turning conclusion that his readers have grown to expect. THE LAST JUROR may be the best of his recent novels. Just like Miss Callie's comforting home cooking, it is pleasant to have another John Grisham novel on the reading table --- and it's as satisfying to complete this as it is to finish a fine meal of Southern cuisine.--- Reviewed by Stuart Shiffman"},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"A Syracuse U. dropout buys a small town newspaper in Clanton, Mississippi and wakes the townspeople up! Grisham captures the atmosphere and attitudes of this town as if he'd lived there most of his life. Beautiful character profiles and enough action to give the story punch involving a brutal rape/murder, a trial and a promise for revenge. But the &quot;last juror&quot; is Mrs. Callie, a black mother of seven PHD offspring whose inspiration (and great cooking) is the glue that gives an immature, 23 year old the guidance and stability to persevere and eventually, after 10 gritty years, to make his mark. Grisham in a 5 star effort."},{"Title":"The Last Juror","review":"I loved everything about this book, and it reminds me of one of Grisham's first books, A TIME TO KILL. The characters were so real and well-developed. His books are always so full of rich detail that I just sink into the words and almost become a participant in the plot. There were really two plots going on in this book. The first one was the murder and rape of a young mother in the small town of Clanton, Mississippi and the subsequent arrest and trial of Danny Padgitt. The second plot was the friendship between Willie Traynor, the newspaper owner,and Callie Ruffin, the last juror. Grisham does a remarkable job of weaving these two plot lines together and having them mesh at the end. The result was just so good that I savored every word. I really hope that all book-lovers will get a chance to read this wonderful story."},{"Title":"Mindstore for Personal Development","review":"I have to disagree with the previous reviewer who gave this book only one star. While self-help books are not for everyone (I'm not usually the sort that would read one either) this one I did find particularly inspiring. You can take what you like from it - believe it all, or take away a few good techniques to take control of you thoughts. The mind is a very powerful thing, and highly open to suggestion, and if you can learn to control your negative thoughts, you can make a difference in your life.This book, while perhaps more on the side of pop-psychology, nevertheless has some sound psychological techniques in it, even if it does go about them in a more unusual way than you may expect. In fact, these techniques may be easier for many people to work with than the dry and clinical way one would be told by a psychologist at an appointment, even though they'd have the same end result no doubt.I found it quite inspiring, although I am not \\"evangelical\\" about it as the previous reviewer implies I must be. I would recommend this to anyone feeling a bit down, or under motivated, or perhaps just needing a boost in life and some inspiration.

My life is my own.If you are of the suggestive nature this book will work for you, self help manuals are either good ie Tony Robins or just a lot of assertive words that program your mind to think positively, think of a council estate psychologist seminar and you are halfway there.Anyone who states that coffee and tea effect your mental balance and have to put themselves into 'foundation' (a sort of trance readers and staff of Mindstore adhere to daily to re-energise and align their chi) for 10-15 minutes today really need their heads looked at.The author contradicts himself as well, he offers the times 'we' should eat at properly, which according to Doctor's and the Health Foundation are completely wrong - skip breakfast? eat late at night?I don't know how he does it but people either a) read this and thow it away or b) treat it like the Second Coming (see Blues Brothers above) - it has turned into a cult of some sort and not a healthy one.After reading this I decided to go by chips and beer and not waste another moment. I would rather go to the pearly gates and tell God that I lived life to the full and not by some psuedo prophet self help guru with delusions of granduerI urge you to not buy this book. Waste your money on something productive like tabs, beer, porn etc etc etc"},{"Title":"The boy apprenticed to an enchanter","review":"This is an original tale by the wonderful Padraic Colum, poet. It recounts the adventures of a boy, taken from his home to learn from a rather sinister enchanter, and his attempts to escape from his apprenticeship. Babylon and its fall, Hermes Tristemagus and Merlin and the Western Isles are just some of the people and places he visits on his way.I am pleased to see that Colum's lovely \\"King of Ireland's Son\\" is still in print and attracting young fans. It is a pity that this book is not so widely available. Darker in tone and simpler in structure than \\"King of Ireland's Son\\" this book draws on the traditions of many lands to weave its spell. If you or your child enjoyed Colum's other books, then I can recommend this one without reservation. It is, in its own odd way, a kind of \\"Harry Potter\\" of an earlier generation, with its theme of a lad learning magic. Similarities end there, of course: the wizard is a malign figure, and the \\"boy\\" is nearly full grown. But when I was 10, I thought this book one of the best there was, and I think it can provide others with fun and excitement. And what other purpose does a tale have?"},{"Title":"Postmodern Philosophy and Law","review":"This is important social observation and commentary. Litowitz has done major research for this project, and it shows. The book is 230 pages, but only 177 of that is his discussion, the rest is in chapter notes and index, important if you're doing research for another book, as I am. Much of the change in our society over the past generation is because of the postmodern influence on the legal profession. It's the lawyers, courts, judges, and legislators who've changed the rules for everyone else. Whether it's medicine (my area), manufacturing, human relations, or small business, life is different because of Nietzsche, Marx, Lyotard, and Faucault.Remember the movie Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid? Butch (Paul Newman) and some other outlaw, who's about twice his size, are about to have a fight to the death to decide who will lead the outlaw band. Butch says, &quot;Let's get the rules straight,&quot; the other guy says, &quot;No rules in a knife fight!&quot; Butch kicks him in the balls. That's the postmodern influence on the legal profession, no rules."},{"Title":"Maigret and the Loner","review":"One of the last of about 400 novels by Georges Simenon, \\"Maigret et l'homme tout seul\\" (published in 1971, set in 1965) is one of the more complicated Chief Inspector Maigret cases. The body of fastidiously coiffured man who has been shot is found amidst a vast accumulation of junk in a house slated for demolition one muggy Paris summer day. There are no clues about who the dead man is, so before trying to find out who killed him and why, Maigret must first figure out who he was and how he came to be where he was shot.There is a very bitter wife (a recurrent figure in Simenon fiction, especially \\"The Cat\\") and some long-ago passions, and a long-ago (just after WWII) unsolved murder case that Maigret reopens in his quest to understand why (as much or more than who) killed the derelict. The investigation involves Maigret going to the Mediterranean coast in a quite humorous sortie. As usual, he eats well, though he was curbing his intake of beer on his physician's orders in this top-notch police procedural novel."},{"Title":"Maigret and the Loner","review":"I bought this book used from Amazon, and inside it was stamped, \\"Discarded from the Public Library of...\\" Amazing to me that anyone would part with it. I at least will keep Maigret and the Loner in my permanent collection.Maigret tries to moderate his drinking in the course of the narrative, but he cannot moderate his sadness at the misery people make for themselves.The story is set in August, when half the inspectors at the Quai des Orf&egrave;vres are on holiday. Crime is rare in this dead season; nonetheless a corpse turns up.A vagrant living in an abandoned building has been shot to death in his bed. Although dressed in rags, he's very clean and beautifully groomed - a fine physical specimen with the noble head of an Old Testament patriarch. Maigret is intrigued, as he often is by mysterious vagrants who've given up on the world. The victim's beautifully trimmed beard gives Maigret his only lead.In other books Maigret often announces, \\"I never think.\\" But in this story Maigret's imaginative intellect gives him little rest. His perplexities are very visible to Madame Maigret. She cooks his favorite dishes, and he hardly knows what he's eating.Maigret's journey to the truth is a series of quirky hunches, lucky breaks and impulsive researches.A thoroughly enjoyable mystery, strangely enhanced by the muggy Paris weather."},{"Title":"Maigret and the Loner","review":"Maigret and the Loner was first published as Maigret et l'homme tout seul in 1971, and translated into English by Eileen Ellenbogen. A down and outer has been found murdered in an abandoned building. Why would anyone want to murder a vagrant? Yet the man had been tracked down and shot in cold blood. Slowly, almost ploddingly, Maigret identifies the man and reconstructs his past and his associates. Along the way he uncovers a love affair of 20 years ago, and the smouldering resentments that have lasted to the present. Here is a tale that combines character study, police procedural and Maigret's intuition in a story that is never less than entertaining. As often, I was a little let down by the \`solution', which seemed a little bit pat (there are no solutions in real life) yet that very disappointment is a sign of how solid Simenon's characterisation is. The book is peopled by a host of tramps, small shopkeepers, apartment dwellers and police officials, all on stage for just a paragraph or two, all vividly realised, with enough background sketched in to make a dozen novels by most other writers, here merely local colour for a detective story."},{"Title":"Maigret and the Loner","review":"This is really one of the best Maigret books. Our hero must solve the nearly unsolvable, the murder of an unknown tramp. Once his name was known, Maigret had to go back 20 years to an unsolved case and find the needed clues. Going back two decades finally led Maigret to the surprising solution of the tramp's murder and the older case at the same time. I don't want to give away too much for those that aren't familiar with the story and I'll leave it there.[...]At any rate, if you're a Maigret fan, don't miss this book. The same if you love good police investigations as this murder within a murder is one of the best."},{"Title":"Peter Simple,","review":"Frederick Marryat was a sea captain who served under the famous Lord Cochrane. This book was an inspiration to such later writers as Patrick O'Brian and C.S. Forster. It is a little like Tom Jones in that it episodic, even picaresque. It is very funny in parts, in a way that O'Brian is not--you get the sense that Marryatt is weaving in incidents and characters from his own naval career. It certainly helps to have read O'Brian for a deep understanding of the culture, but with Marryat you feel at times that you are in touch with the real thing."},{"Title":"Peter Simple,","review":"Another good book in the Heart of Oak series. This novel was quite the opposite of the last one in the series I read, &quot;The Black Ship&quot;. I think both novels give good pictures of how life was on the British sailing ships but in &quot;Peter Simple&quot; the crew seems to have a lot of fun and good times as well as taking their work very seriously. They are able to joke around a good bit and enjoy life. This seems much more realistic to me based on my own experiences at sea. &quot;Peter Simple&quot; is written by an actual man of war captain from the Napoleanic era and so probably portrays a much more accurate picture of life on a British man of war than any of the other similar novels. I really liked the novel. Although some of the coincidences and the ending especially are a little too much like a &quot;ladies romance novel&quot; I still think O'Brian fans would enjoy this novel too. The sea battles and ship maneuvers are every bit as good as O'Brian."},{"Title":"Peter Simple,","review":"I loved this book when I was 14. Since I could not read English, I did read it in Spanish.

Nowhere have I found such elaborate and distinct naval terminology ever since. Captain Marryat is, as far as I know the only author who described a club-hauling of a man-of-war in full detail. His naval experiences make this novel a documentary novel also concerning life-style and other details. Such as the vivid description of France and other countries Marryat has been to. I still enjoy reading it very much. POB's books are different but as fine a pleasure to read as Marryat's Peter Simple."},{"Title":"Peter Simple,","review":"Peter Simple is the tale of a young British midshipman seeking his fame and fortune on the high seas. Set during the Napoleonic wars, it offers comedy and adventure in an old-school style.Originally released in serialized form, Peter Simple is a fun, straight-forward adventure novel. It was a best-seller in it's time (1833) and holds up beautifully. I think this will appeal to anyone who ever thrilled to the works of Rafael Sabatini, Bernard Cornwell, or Orczy's Scarlet Pimpernel. It's an easy read and great fun !"},{"Title":"Peter Simple,","review":"For those who have enjoyed the Patrick O'Brian stories about lucky Jack Aubrey should enjoy this story. Yes, it's fiction but the author sailed with the original source of the O'brian stories, Thomas Cochrane, 10th Lord Duncannon. It's fiction but based on real life in the Royal Navy."},{"Title":"Peter Simple,","review":"Peter Simple is an early novel by Captain Frederick Marryat, he who actually served during the Napoleonic Wars and under the redoubtable Lord Cochrane to boot. As such, Marryat's sea novels are replete with details of life as actually experienced by the men and officers of the time. However, Marryat's a humorist, and his goal is to tell an entertaining tale, and with Peter Simple he succeeds admirably. Fans of Patrick O'Brian will discover source material in Marryat later adapted by POB in his Aubrey/Maturin novels.The plot of Peter Simple is rather thin; it concerns the training of a young midshipman, Peter Simple, 'the greatest fool in his family,' and how he is cheated out of his inheritance, only to eventually regain it. Along the way he meets a cast of engaging characters who tell their own stories. The results is highly discursive, but the characters are so sympathetic and their tales are so amusing that you don't mind that these digressions are not actually forwarding the plot. Chief amongst them is master's mate O'Brien who befriends the foolish young midshipman and they become bosom friends who share many adventures. Case in point, at one point they are captured by the French, escape from a French prison, then disguised as a pair of stilt-walkers, stilt-walk across France to gain their freedom. Peter, being the younger and prettier of the two, is obliged to wear the female costume. In this guise he comes face to face with the French girl he adores much to his chagrin. Readers of Aubrey/Maturin will recollect their escape across France with Jack disguised as a dancing bear. Marryat is funnier.The adventures in Peter Simple are not impossible, merely improbable, and that's all part of the fun. Marryat has a fertile imagination that can wed a nautical adventure tale with all sorts of comic and sentimental happenings -- and I mean 'sentimental' in a good way. Marryat believes in true love and honor and happily ever after; Peter Simple is a sort of nautical fairy tale. It was my good fortune to read it immediately after Voltaire's Candide, and there is much in common between the two. Both Candide and Peter Simple are fools: naive, kind, good, generous, and woefully taken advantage of by the unscrupulous people around him, but are helped by various colorful friends who undergo adventures of their own. Candide's Dr. Pangloss was hanged by the Spanish Inquisition; Peter's friend O'Brien was murdered by brigands and buried in the sand. Pangloss owes his survival to the assistance of the doctor that intended to perform an autopsy on him; O'Brien survives thanks to having his nose trod on by a pretty girl who then digs him out.Although there is a great deal of improbability in Peter Simple, it all derives from elements that are entirely believable in themselves. For example, when the brand new Mr Midshipman Simple reports on board, the other middies take advantage of him by charging tarts to his account. When he discovers the bill, he pays it because he's such an honorable young man that he refuses to deprive the bumboat woman of her money. He never manages to collect from the other middies, but he learns a hard lesson -- never run into debt and don't buy on credit. This tale of the tarts actually has a great many more chapters to it, with a detour through pastry shops and cheating at church, resulting in the wayward middies wearing tarts on their heads while on the quarterdeck. You may wonder how it is even possible to cheat while attending worship, but let me assure you, our middies are clever enough to figure it out.A rambling tale, it is not the well-organized bit of literature we dignify with the name of 'novel,' which is why I gave it only four stars, but it's well worth a few hours of your time. Reading Peter Simple is like drinking in a tavern with old salts who never let the facts get in the way of a good story.~review by M.

It probably would not be safe to travel now with the way things are going in much of Africa.Hudson's point is the African people are wonderfully kind to strangers, even those from the West. His experiences prove that once you are off the beaten track for tourists, the people are friendly and helpful to the stranger from another land. Hudson experiences no discrimination. He lives and travels like Africans, and gets their viewpoint. He even understands the corruption common in everyday African life.

I greatly enjoyed this book, not the least because it reminded me of Parnell Hall's discussion of his own experience with writing a film, which was very similar to what Stanley dealt with only without the dead bodies. It was nice to see Sergeant Clark again; he might not be Stanley's favorite police officer but I like him, and I like reading about his interactions with both Stanley and Sergeant MacAulluiff.This novel was a Shamus Award nominee for Best Private Eye Novel, and a Lefty Award nominee for Funniest Mystery Novel."},{"Title":"Movie (A Stanley Hastings Mystery Novel)","review":"Another good story.

Sidney Garfellow, a documentary director people have actually heard of, has hired him to write the screenplay for his first 'regular' movie. Stanley dreams of leaving his less-than-rewarding career as an investigator for a personal injury lawyer for the Silver Screen. What stands in the way of this? Well, Sidney Garfellow, who keeps changing his mind about what he wants, forcing Stanley to rewrite and rewrite again. Then there's the film's star, who ignores Stanley's golden prose in favor of more 'natural' lines he's written himself. Oh, and there's people getting killed on the set. Just a little problem there...Hall draws heavily on his own experiences when writing Stanley Hastings: he has worked on the stage, in films, and, at one time, as a detective himself. He writes hilarious songs, often about the foibles of being an author. It is no surprise that he has some experience with screenwriting himself: he wrote the screenplay for C.H.U.D. At least Stanley gets to write a movie with \\"four hot babes\\" in it.I've read several of the Hastings novels, and I always enjoy the verbal humor in them. This novel is no exception. Stanley gives us his unvarnished and aggrieved opinions of the director, the actor, and Murty the sound man. He exchanges marvelous barbs with his boss, who visits the set, and Sergeant McAuliff, a series regular who is hired as a consultant. After the deaths begin, Detective Clark is brought in to investigate. Stanley doesn't like Clark: in a previous novel, Stanley was his prime suspect. The cops are smart, especially Clark, who is far from the closed-minded nabob mystery authors so often employ. The plot is good, and there's enough twists to keep the reader guessing.The drawback: in some scenes, Stanley and the police detectives spend a lot of time talking about who was where at what times. I tend to speedbump over those sections, but you might want to take the time to read it: the solution just might be hiding in there."},{"Title":"Movie (A Stanley Hastings Mystery Novel)","review":"This is one in a series starring Stanley Hastings as a reluctant PI who is a writer !

And as usual, he bends over backward to be fair to everybody. He gives patient, exhaustive treatments of all arguments and claims, even the most idiotic, showing their inadequacies. But people who put forth idiotic arguments do not do so because they are stupid but because they are committed, and committed people do not respond to reason, however patient and thorough. Still, there is much thought-provoking material here, and the book should be read by all readers interested in the personal and social effects of literature. Booth is weakest when dealing with philosophical issues (because he is not a philosopher). His confusions about subjectivism and relativism are cases in point. For a competent discussion of these and the other ethical (i.e. value-theoretic) issues, readers would be better advised to get A Book Worth Reading. But as a compendium of arguments \\"clearing away the dead wood\\" and for his many thought-provoking discussions, Booth is impossible to beat."},{"Title":"STUDIES IN THE SERMON ON THE MOUNT","review":"This incredible little book opens the door to the Sermon on the Mount. Chambers emphasizes that Christ's teachings are not just good words to live by - but a radical view of life that goes against our natural way of doing things. He makes that point throughout that the only way to live the life Jesus outlines is by knowing Him and through the power of the Holy Spirit. Chambers takes of the religious trappings of this teaching and covers it in a way that makes it real and meaningful."},{"Title":"STUDIES IN THE SERMON ON THE MOUNT","review":"Among all the doctrine, parables, and lessons of the Bible, none is as difficult to walk in as The Sermon on the Mount. Jesus' teachings, captured in Matthew 5, challenge and convict all thoughtful believers.Oswald Chambers offers radical insights into those difficult-to-live-out principles. For example:\\"The Sermon on the the Mount produces despair in the heart of the natural man, and that is the very thing Jesus means it to do.\\" p.10 and,\\"[Jesus] did not come to teach us only: He came to make us what He teaches we should be.\\" p.10Even the most mature believer will be challenged by Chambers as he gets infinitely close to our tender spots: \\"Most of us are pagans in a crisis; we think and act like pagans.\\" p.57Oswald Chambers, best known for his no-nonsense, plain speaking about the most difficult truths in the Christian experience hits the mark time and time again in this special book.This is real meat for the hungry soul."},{"Title":"STUDIES IN THE SERMON ON THE MOUNT","review":"First I would like to point out that the dark cover shown in the first photo for this product is not the one the publisher is shipping. Oswald Chambers highlights the ability of God in contrast to our inability. And then he challenges you directly to wholly lean on God for your strength to obey God. He emphasizes that the Holy Spirit will come through to help you obey. He's very direct without fancy illustrations. However his typical word picture or illustration usually packs a whale of a punch, driving home the point with a spiritual weightiness not found in many books. I love this guy and highly recommend this particular book. It's worth every penny. An illustration of this is how he couches the idea that you are the salt of the earth against the idea that God has not called us as some seem to believe to be the sugar of the earth. In a few sentences he demolishes what was a very popular view of how Christians should be. He then examines the effects of salt in a few situations (wound dressing for one example) to show that we must impact those around us even if it doesn't feel good for them initially.He doesn't waste your time with long stories that feel good but don't have a lot of power in them.

I've enjoyed it myself for years (still receive it daily in my email), and have copies in the original printing and also a copy in contemporary language by James Reimann; very good stuff. It was my experience and enjoyment of this devotional classic that prompted my purchase of Studies in the Sermon on the Mount: God's Character and the Believer's Conduct also by Oswald Chambers. I have one word for you that describes my impressions; magnificent. There.I am one of the group of people that believe Jesus was describing his kingdom followers on this earth when he spoke the words and teaching of the Sermon on the Mount. It is for this reason that I take such a particular fondness to this work by Oswald Chambers. Rest assured, this little book is not for the faint of heart. If you are familiar with the devotional works of My Utmost for His Highest, you'll already be used to the no-holds-barred delivery of Chambers. He certainly doesn't pull any punches. I love it. In a day and age where many would rather explain away the teaching of Jesus or reduce it to winsome metaphors, Oswald yanks our heads out of the clouds and plants us firmly back on the ground with a \\"He means what He speaks, people\\" call to arms. Check this:\\"Beware of placing our Lord as Teacher first instead of Savior. That tendency is prevalent today, and it is a dangerous tendency. We must know Him first as Savior before His teaching can have any meaning for us or before it can have any meaning other than that of an ideal that leads to despair.\\"If you've got the moxy and a heart to really take in the teaching of Jesus, I suggest giving this little book a good read.

I have devoted 15 years to researching and writing about the Biblical roots and influences in early A.A.'s Christian Fellowship. And no one can fully grasp the story of early A.A., its cures, and its principles and practices without understanding the importance that the pioneers attached to the sermon on the mount (Matthew 5 to 7). Sadly, a number of AAs have settled for the belief that Emmet Fox's Sermon on the Mount was the cornerstone of A.A.'s sermon emphasis. No so! The fact is that both A.A. co-founders Dr. Bob and Bill W. stated that the sermon itself contained the underlying philosophy of A.A. And my title The James Club: The Original A.A. Program's Absolute Essentials (http://www.dickb.com/JamesClub.com) contains a verse by verse study of the three parts of the Bible AAs considered essential--the sermon, the book of James, and 1 Corinthians 13. Hence it is with the Bible itself that A.A. students of spirituality should start. Next, however, they need to know how broad was the supplementary reading. And that is where Oswald Chambers comes in. Dr. Bob and his wife stressed the importance of the sermon, and they read it in their groups and in the early meetings. But Dr. Bob also accumulated, read, studied, and circulated the background sermon books. And I found these among his library (that came into the hands of his son and daughter). I encountered Oswald Chambers's Studies in the Sermon on the Mount, E. Stanley Jones's The Christ of the Mount, Emmet Fox's The Sermon on the Mount, several books by Robert E. Speer that covered parts of the subject, a number of books by Rev. Sam Shoemaker to the same end, several titles by Harry Emerson Fosdick such as The Manhood of the Master, and a number of books by Glenn Clark. And all of these presented a broad field of interpretive writings on Jesus's sermon that enhanced the early pioneers' understanding. And if one takes Chambers's title and sets it alongside Jones's title, he will see that these two writers were, in effect, contending that the gift of the holy spirit without the sermon on the mount in practice was as inadequate as the sermon on the mount in practice without the power of the holy spirit.I have written two titles, Dr. Bob and His Library, and The Books Early AAs Read for Spiritual Growth. Both include Chambers and his studies as favorites. And people who want to get the full depth of the early A.A. Christian believing will profit immensely by looking at this Chambers book.As an aside, when I contacted Mrs. W. Irving Harris, widow of Rev. Sam Shoemaker's assistant minister, she provided me with a complete set of the Oswald Chambers books indicating these were part of Sam's favorite books. The set has now been donated to the Griffith Library in East Dorset, Vermont; and one can gain a good understanding of the importance of Chambers to the thinking of the New York A.A. ideas taught by Rev. Sam Shoemaker to Bill Wilson and to the Akron fellowship's focus as led by Dr. Bob.God Bless, Richard G. Burns, J.D.Incidentally, it would appear that Amazon has erroneously listed my colleague Terry Dunford as the writer of this review, but it is I who makes the review and recommendations."},{"Title":"STUDIES IN THE SERMON ON THE MOUNT","review":"If this is as good as his other materials, It will be a blessing to you!

Writing in a simple and straightforward manner, he describes the process of \\"cutting it straight,\\" a term he borrows from Paul's message to Timothy in 2 Timothy 2:15. Though the passage is most often translated \\"handling accurately the word of truth\\" the literal sense is \\"cutting it straight.\\" This book is thus divided into three sections. The first deals with how to make straight cuts, the second with avoiding crooked cuts, and the third with living out your cuts.In the first several chapters Mayhue lays out the proper methods for studying Scripture. He speaks about presuppositions, methodology and rules for interpretation. A significant portion of the section is devoted to recommended study tools - concordances, dictionaries, commentaries and so on.The bulk of the book contains rules to avoid making poor cuts. In other words, the author discusses many of the common errors in interpretation. The list of errors is extensive, but a few of the topics are: spiritualizing, embellishing, culturalizing, anglicizing and experientializing. They may seem like difficult terms, but they are all explained in sufficient detail and with plenty of examples.The final chapter provides four pointers for translating straight cuts into a life. Interpreting Scripture properly is just the first step in allowing the Words of God to penetrate and change our lives.What I most appreciated about this book is that the author provides examples for everything he writes about. When he discusses rules for interpretation, for example, he exposits Psalm 13, showing how he would go about interpreting this passage. He shows the questions that should arise when discussing it and how he would answer each of them. Another strength in this book is the questions at the end of each chapter. So often I find that the questions authors put in their books add little to the subject, but in this case they truly ensure that the reader has read carefully and understood the content of the chapter.The only shortcoming I found is that the author sometimes does not go into quite enough detail about regular Bible study habits. I would have appreciated some suggestions on how to begin a regular pattern of inductive Bible study.Despite that small shortcoming, this book is an excellent introduction to the principles of Biblical interpretation and I heartily recommend it. I would suggest that it might be well complemented by a book that specifically covers the inductive method of Bible study, such as Kay Arthur's \\"How To Study Your Bible.\\""},{"Title":"How to Interpret the Bible for Yourself (Leaders Guide)","review":"I ordered this book for students in an introductory Bible Interpretation class I teach at the church I pastor. I selected it because of its simplicity and readability. It has chapters on proper tools for Bible study, and many chapters on avoiding common errors in Bible interpretation. The author writes from his own experience, citing practical examples of how he has seen others misinterpret the Bible. For more depth, detail, and scholarship, I would recommend How To Read The Bible For All Its Worth, By Gordon Fee."},{"Title":"Garden Designs","review":"I love gardening but am not the best at designing gardens, so I frequently look for books to give me ideas about designs. This one has quite a few nice designs will full plant lists, but unfortunately, it was lacking on designs for my area or zone. Only one garden in the entire book fit my zone, which is 28. I would suggest that in the future each garden design includes substitutions for plants to make it fit in other areas or zones."},{"Title":"Garden Designs","review":"I am studying to become a Landscape Designer and this book has alota fabulous ideas in it! I highly recommend adding it to your library."},{"Title":"Garden Designs","review":"I like this book because it gives gardeners lots of ideas for various garden designs, in all shapes and sizes. There are designs for narrow walkways, curved entrances, large yards, small yards, front yards, back yards, boulevards, and with varying themes: by colour; by function (e.g. to attract butterflies or hummingbirds); by plant types (e.g. all shrubs, herbs, cutting flowers, fragrant plants). While not every design is suitable for every Zone, there is a good selection for each Zone, and where possible the authors provide substitutions to expand the applicable zones for a design. The book also includes botanical as well as common names for all plants listed in the coloured watercolour drawings. All in all, this is a very well written and useful book, for gardeners of all levels."},{"Title":"Garden Designs","review":"Somehow I missed the fact that all the designs were illustrations (watercolor paintings?), not photographs. I get inspired by looking at photos of existing gardens that someone actually created. Looking at paintings just doesn't do it for me. Besides, as the other reviewer said, these gardens are for zones all over the US, not necessarily for my zone, so not all the ideas work for me.The other thing that is missing in this book is at least a small photo of each of the plants/flowers on a page. Sure, I can look them up in another book. I'm familiar with quite a few of the flowers and their Latin/common names, but a beginning gardener wouldn't be. This is definitely not a book for beginners, and even as a more advanced gardener, it was disappointing."},{"Title":"How to Start a Consulting Service","review":"I was disappointed in this CD compilation because the advice is too generic and not focused on the consulting business. There was advice relevant to restaurants, and choosing a personal computer which I in my opinion is outside the intended scope of this book. I for one certainly didn't purchase this audio book to get pointers on which PC to buy. The data CD is useful if you have nothing else, but there are way better programs out there for making forms, contracts, business plans etc. The last CD, a compilation of short stories of successful entrepreneurs was ok, but nothing to get too exited about. Each story is shorter than two minutes, so there is not enough time for you to identify with any of these stories.

Married in 1855, they moved to Minnesota. When Minnesota became a state in 1857 Donnelly was elected lieutenant governor. In 1862 he was elected to Congress for three terms. He campaigned for Greenback policies and served in the state senate. Donnelly wrote \\"Atlantis\\" and \\"Ragnarok\\" which became sensational best sellers and made him wealthy. \\"The Great Cryptogram\\" analyzed Shakespeare's plays to prove they were written by Francis Bacon. Two novels dealt with a fascist takeover of America \\"Caesar's Column\\", and racial intolerance \\"Dr. Huguet\\". In 1887 he became a founder of the Populist Party, and was nominated for Vice-President in 1898. He died in Minneapolis on 1/1/1901. His politics, oratory, and literature marked his originality and talents; his writings are now out of fashion.Donnelly studied the legends and mythologies of Hindus, Persians, Britons, Chinese, Greeks, Scandinavians, the North, Central, and South American Indians, Arabians, Babylonians, and Egyptians that told of disaster by fire, hail, frost, darkness, changes in climates, and tales of dragons and other monsters. Donnelly claimed these reflected a visit from a giant comet, and the proof lay in The Drift of unstratified deposits which came from a cometic collision rather than glacial movement. Donnelly suggested a comet could have caused Old Testament events such as the destruction of the wicked cities, the sun standing still, and stones falling from the heavens. Ragnarok, the Twilight of the Gods (or Rain of Rocks), commanded the interest of general readers, and the admiration (if not credence) of the scientific world. Donnelly, a good lawyer, argued his case well with all the evidence available to him at the time. Decades later Immanuel Velikovsky would publish his version of this theory.The surface of our planet consists of layers of sand, clay, and gravel (over stratified rock). It contains no trace of fossils. The pre-glacial world saw tropical plants growing near the Arctic Circle in Miocene times. Herds of elephants and other animals lived in Europe. Donnelly says a sudden cataclysm brought severe cold, and left deposits of sand, clay, and gravel; fissures were created in earth's crust. He explains why this was caused by a comet striking earth, the heat vaporizing the seas to create clouds, rain, and snow. Rocks on the surface would be smashed and crushed. This collision was preserved in the legends of mankind. The Great Lakes suggest points of impact. Vast clouds, and debris in the sky, would create a \\"nuclear winter\\".Donnelly says myths and legends are ultimately based on some fact. Finding the same legends among different nations suggests a common experience in prehistoric times. These myths of a cataclysm imply the existence of mankind; they are in accord with the facts known to science and from deep excavations. The legends coincide in this: a monster in the air; the heat; the fire; the cave-life; the darkness; the return of light. Donnelly respectfully suggests the Book of Job is the oldest in the Bible, and gives a new viewpoint to the beginning of Genesis.Donnelly answers objections in Part IV Chapter IV. The position of certain constellations in Job estimates this time as 30,000 years ago. Donnelly suggests the fire that seemed to drop out of the heavens and set a number of fires in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Illinois on October 8, 1871 was the result of Bielas' comet. There is a universal feeling that regards comets with fear; Revelation (chapter xii, v.3) is a symbol of a comet brushing the earth. Why would God permit such a calamity? Perhaps what was destroyed was not worth preserving? It could be God's plan to punish the wicked of this world, says Donnelly."},{"Title":"Ragnarok: the age of fire and gravel","review":"This is a facsimile edition of Donnelly's 1883 Ragnarok, a book that pioneered the notion that a comet struck Earth in ancient times. It followed his sensational 1882 book on Atlantis. Unlike much 19th century scientific writing, this is entertaining reading, blending the geology of the day with legends of many peoples. In doing so he created a pattern followed by many later speculative writers and pseudo-scientists. A must-read for anyone interested in how theories with very little real supporting evidence capture the public imagination. The 12-page introduction to this 1970 edition (first by University Books, Inc.) discusses Donnelly within the literary and scientific context of his era. 452 pages, indexed, with a number of charts and etchings of artifacts."},{"Title":"Ragnarok: the age of fire and gravel","review":"if you're any kind of perfectionist. i have no idea how this can happen, but this seems to be one of those print-on-demand books. i guess they took the text file of the paperback edition and did not bother to set margins that would match the paperback, so you get footnotes that are in the middle of pages instead of at the bottom of the page, where they should be and where they are in the paperback. then we have...and this escapes me as to how exactly it was done...sentences that endand then begin again..........with the double space gap and sometimes an indent.absolutely amazing.then, where there should apparently be illustrations...there aren't!!! that is particularly annoying. now i'll have to buy a different edition and, hopefully, i'll be able to get the pics.ok, i'm done with my rant about that. being someone who spent a large part of my life word processing, this kind of thing just irks me no end. how can someone NOT see what's going on?i enjoyed the book, though. having just finished \\"worlds in collision\\", this was a great follow-up, although i probably should've read it first. both books have great theories as to what's been going on on Earth and, if you're not one of those people who are all hung up on what \\"science\\" says is truth, you will be reading this book 'til well into the night. i love speculation and alternate theories, and who really are we to say what is \\"truth\\"?"},{"Title":"Ragnarok: the age of fire and gravel","review":"This is a highly recommended sequel to \\"Atlantis\\" by the same author.

It took a great deal of Chutzpah for Herman Wouk to write this book where he discusses and then dismisses Reform and Conservative Judaism in a chapter. Without rancor or overt criticism he discusses these movements within Judaism but he doesn't accept them as Judaism.That said, this is an excellent book on what Judaism means in regards to marriage, history, Israel, prayer, observance, Torah, Talmud, kashrut and study. He writes in a clear concise style concerning the daily life of an observant Jew as well as the history that went into it. Many times he argues for the education of young Jewish children in Judaism (taking issue with the refrain &quot;they can choose it when they grow up&quot; since it is easy to reject what you've learned but hard to learn something you should have learned when you were a child.) and against the rising tide of assimilation. He tells personal stories about studying Talmud with his grandfather and his time fighting in World War II. One particularly amusing one is how he was disappointed to learn that &quot;an eye for an eye&quot; meant compensatory damage payments as it was one of his best arguments for rejecting observance altogether at age 14 when he would have rather gone to Saturday afternoon movies.A caveat in that if you are an observant Jew, you will probably not learn much from this book. This is the book that rabbis have conversion candidates read in order to make sure that everyone has a good idea as to what is going to happen if the conversion goes through. This is a great book for non-observant Jews and Jews who consider themselves Reform or Conservative, as Wouk has a talent for saying potentially explosive perspectives with enough humility and candor that you aren't personally insulted if you disagree. This is also a good book for non-Jews wanting to know what Judaism is all about.What makes this book exceptional is that Herman Wouk's perspective is becoming a rare voice in Orthodoxy. Orthodox Judaism is increasingly moving to the right partly as a reaction to the intermarriage and assimilation of the liberal movements within Judaism, partly as a sign of formerly non-observant Jews becoming observant and finding distaste in their old lives.Wouk's perspective was probably a standard voice in 1950s Judaism, but it is one that is not heard often enough in today's Judaism that finds itself pulled between the stark limiting observance of the Haredi and the &quot;whatever-you-think-is-right-is-right&quot; lassez faire of the Reform (including the Renewelists and Reconstructionists). It is easy to condemn. It takes effort to reach out without rancor or snap judgement as Wouk does in this book. This is what makes Wouk's book valuable to people who already know the material"},{"Title":"This is my God","review":"Herman Wouk blends Jewish history, Jewish practice, and personal experience in a wonderful tour for Judaism, appropriate for nonJews, Jews, and even those who think they know it all.While his discussions of Shabbat, Hanukah, and other observances are fine reading, Wouk reaches his peak when discussing his own and his family's experiences--his grandfather, whom he obviously admired a great deal, his father, who spent an immense sum of money (for the times) to buy the honor of reading the book of Jonah on Yom Kippur afternoon. Wonderful images of a time in Judaism gone by.I do not find it limiting that Wouk writes from an Orthodox perspective (he assumes, for example, that only a man would wear a tallit, which is the Orthodox practice, but not the Conservative). Wouk was what he was, and I do not think he should have modified his book to an egalitarian perspective to satisfy the wolves of political correctness.Well worth an annual read and a place on your shelf."},{"Title":"This is my God","review":"A formidable book, written for everyone, from the pious Chassidim who seems to know all about Judaism to the secular Wall Street Jewish Banker who is far from his faith but feels every now and then the sweet but stern internal calling of his demanding heritageThe best chapters,in my opinion, are related to the experiences related to the secular Jewish people when they got involved in the Jewish religious rituals at the synagogue or at home during childhood, \\"one feels like he is telling ones own experiences when he was a Jewish kid, so unexplained and uneasy situations at that time become hilariousGenerally speaking, Wouk, who is observant, tried to be very open avoiding dogma and intended to convey to the Jewish reader the precious value of his 4000 years heritage and a way to learn how to feel proud about it.Wouk did not forget the non-Jewish reader either, he wrote this book with simple concepts and language so anyone interested about Judaism can get a good basic introduction through these pages"},{"Title":"This is my God","review":"As a Christian who is very curious to learn about Judaism, this book served as a fine introductory lesson. Herman Wouk researched this field exhaustively and relied on the expert knowledge of ordained rabbis on matters of religious law, and I think he tried to avoid overwhelming or intimidating a newcomer to this field of study with excessive details or exposition. In its directness and lucidity it has the same qualities as his other works, and after having read The Winds of War &amp; War and Remembrance twice each, I could not resist the opportunity to delve into this book. As Wouk noted, many top quality writers have almost a conversational style - and he certainly does. Wouk's dry sense of humor is very effective. This is worthwhile not only to read through in a few sittings, but also for reference on specific topics. I also appreciated the author's attempts to explain his methods of transliteration from Hebrew, and suggestions on their English pronounciation.I hope to use this book in doing further study. Recommended."},{"Title":"This is my God","review":"A must read for all Jews and those considering becoming Jews.Wouk gives, among other things, an understanding of why it is important to observe the Jewish dietary laws and why improvised prayer has meaning.The result is that I am now incorporating more observances into my daily life. For the first time, I see their importance. This book has changed my life."},{"Title":"This is my God","review":"I was interested to understand the Jewish life to understandBuber better. This book is a great help, for a good introduction toJewish life. Terms like Torah, Kosher are made clear here. The section &quot; Chosen People&quot; was an eye opener to me. I was under the wrong impression about the concept of &quot;Jews&quot; as chosen people. I will repeat his words &quot; But this idea of salvation limited to one group never had place in the Jewish faith and has no place in it today. In Judaism right conduct is the path to God. This path lies open to Jews and non-Jews&quot;."},{"Title":"This is my God","review":"The great advantage of this book has, is the readablity of it. It almost reads like a novel.

It includes every topic you'd want in an introduction: the Sabbath, the High Holy Days, kosher rules, the Torah, the Talmud, Hasidism, Israel, and so forth. Wouk's obvious love of Judaism is contagious, even to non-Jewish readers like me.One warning: When I read this book for a class on Judaism at a Christian seminary, some of the students had trouble with the extravagantly non-gender-inclusive language. I personally can deal with masculine language for all humanity in books more than a few decades old (this was first published in 1957), but when Wouk assumes that the reader is male, as when he refers to the reader's beard (I'm female)--well, it's almost too funny to be offensive.In any case, I highly recommend it.P.S. (eight years later): I assigned this book as the main text on Judaism (along with the Bible) in a college class on Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, and the students really liked it."},{"Title":"This is my God","review":"This Is My GodHerman WoukThis is the perfect starting point for anyone-Jew or Christian -who wants to learn about Judaism. It is thoughtful, insightful, entertaining and sensitively explains Judaism to a broad readershipThis is not simply a guide to the Jewish religion .Herman Wouk-a well known novelist and playwright - is clearly a man of the world but is also an observant JewHe speaks about his own illuminating insights and experiencesWritten in 1959 it is still equally relevant today as then . He points out the contradiction of leftwing secularists who claim that their rejection of religion is a result of the conformity in inherent therein , when their own entire ways of life and thought processes are based on conformityHe explains a conversation he had with a radical young student thus:\`She had been reading sociology and was full of terms like anomy , other-directedness , acculturation and similar jaw-breakers which she got off with athletic ease. The burden of her tale was that Judaism meant ritualism , and ritualism meant conformity which was a great evil.\`The interesting thing about my charming enlightener while she delivered her polemic against conformity , was dressed in a garb as ceremonious as a bishop's from the correct wrinkles in her sweater sleeves to the prescribed smudge on her saddle shoes. She spoke her piece for autonomy in a vocabulary of the teens as rigid , as circumscribed , as repetitious , as marked in intonation , as a litany'His social commentary is one of observation rather than of judgement and he states for example that while his preference is for Orthodox Judaism he is unable to join the wringing chorus of denunciation of Reform and Conservative Judaism of some fellow Orthodox Jews.He also refuses to pass judgement on the 'assimilators' while fully voicing his grave concerns about the threat of assimilation to JudaismHe also points out the common roots of Christianity and Judaism and in a discussion .A good example is his discussion of the Jewish Festival of Lights : Hanukkah , which falls in the same month as Christmas and is often celebrated so that Jewish children do not have to feel that they are missing out on the Christmas enjoyed by their Christian peersHanukkah is observed in remembrance of the defeat by the Israelites of the Greek and Syrian overlords led by Antiochus who aimed to obliterate the Jewish faith.Wouk reminds us what the real point of contact between the two festivals is :' Had Antiochus succeeded in obliterating Jewry a century and a half before the birth of Jesus , there would have been no Christmas .The feast of Nativity rests on the victory of Hanukkah'Overall this is an explanation of the religion for anyone interested to learn whatever their faith or orientation."},{"Title":"This is my God","review":"A heartfelt and personal discussion of Judaism. Herman Wouk is the master of the historical novel. His guidebook to Judaism is written with love and respect."},{"Title":"This is my God","review":"I read this book upon considering conversion to Judaism. The information presented here is very basic and easy to follow. Herman Wouk was a very gifted writer and his talent helps this work flow very smoothly from cover to cover. He presents Judaism's history, traditions, religious practices, and worldview.What is presented here is a basic guide for understanding Judaism from an Orthodox perspective. While quick glances are given to Reform and Conservative movements, Mr. Wouk practiced Orthodox Judaism and so the majority of the information concerns that movement. While I can recommend this as a good place to start for converts or non-practicing Jews looking to reconnect, anyone who's had any exposure to Jewish practice is probably above the information presented.As a person in the midst of conversion this got me pointed in the right direction. If nothing else it made me realize that I had a whole lot of learning left to do. I ordered this along with \\"Jewish Literacy\\". While \\"This Is My God\\" offers the basics, that one gets a lot deeper and is highly recommended as a companion reference to this work."},{"Title":"This is my God","review":"I've studied the Christian religion with some intensity as a layman. Having attended a Synagog with my Jewish friends I still couldn't get a handle on what it was the Jewish religion taught their members about God or what it meant to be a Jew who was part of a Jewish nation. Mr. Wouk explained it to me in his wonderful prose and powerful intellect. His representation of the schisms within Judaism is very helpful and not polemic. When I finished, I couldn't help but chuckle and wonder if the American State Department has read this book. With the Hassidim becoming a strong political force in secular Israel, after the American government has given billions of dollars to Israel, we could end up supporting a nation that discriminates against women. What's wrong with that picture. This book is now part of my top 25 that I recommend my children and grandchildren read."},{"Title":"This is my God","review":"Herman Wouk examines Judaism in a modest manner that informs without preaching. Wouk looks at his religion from his Orthodox practice, but with easy-reading prose made for all audiences (Jews, Christians, etc.). Readers learn about the Sabbath, Torah, holidays, rituals, feasts, and other vital traditions in this, the world's oldest monotheistic religion. We also learn about Judaism's three main branches (Orthodox, Conservative, Reform), plus pious and non-practicing Jews. Additionally, Wouk examines his own perspective. The result is an informative and personal look at Judaism, particularly in the USA.Some note that Judaism has changed somewhat since this book arrived in the late 1950's; today there's more ultra-Orthodox, non-practicing, even messianic Jews. Still, this is an informative, valuable book. Readers might also enjoy Wouk's popular novels, including THE CAINE MUTINY and WINDS OF WAR."},{"Title":"This is my God","review":"This is my God has become a classic on Jewish Thought and Culture. If you are just beginning or are a seasoned scholar, This is my God has something for you.I totally recommend this book. You will enjoy immensely. Read it with a highlighter, you are going to want to quote it later."},{"Title":"This is my God","review":"This work is a wonderful introduction to and survey of Orthodox Judaism. This book stands out from the pack of other works on the same topic in that This Is My God was written by a master novelist (Wouk gave us Winds of War, War and Remembrance, The Caine Mutiny, et al). Herman Wouk is passionate and candid in what he writes here.The tone is conversational, unconfrontational and uncondescending. Although packed with factual information, Wouk keeps it personal and interesting by moving back and forth between the mechanics of Orthodox Judaism, and his own personal experience - especially his formative years under the hand of his beloved, learned and pious grandfather. Considering the scope, it is brief, by the author's own admission.Wouk explains the basic approaches marking Orthodox, and to a lesser extent Conservative and Reform, Judaism. He discusses the practice . . . dietary laws, tallit, the Sabbath, the Feasts, etc. He sketches history and historical figures (I especially appreciated his sorting out of the great sages and each of their places in Judaical history). He describes the source texts - Torah and Talmud. Also, Wouk easily could have - but did not - bury the reader with Hebrew phraseology.This book is unique and well worth the time for an interested truth seeker of ANY faith to invest. I could continue with the praises of this work, but I would just be repeating what other reviewers have already written.I will add a couple of critical comments. This book, published in 1959 (written while the State of Israel was only 10 years old, how remarkable!), has become a bit dated. (Obviously no fault of Wouk's here). Orthodox Judaism has evolved increasingly into what people call \\"Ultra-Orthodox\\" and has become largely identified with Hasidic dress and practices. In today's world an observant Orthodox author, out of reverence, may well have refrained from penning the title \\"God\\", preferring rather \\"G_d\\" (interesting since the diety's personal Name is not actually God . . . a gentile word having rather pagan roots). Orthodox vs Conservative vs Reform have all changed a bit over the years. I was disappointed that Wouk did not even mention the phenomenon of Messianic Judaism, which has grown greatly since the book was authored. Wouk also more or less wrote off the Karaites as an extinct sect . . . but that movement has also grown greatly since the book was authored. But of course Wouk's passion is Orthodoxy, and my point is that there has been much change even in the brief historical period since 1959. This is a minor criticism and hardly detracts from the value of the book.Secondly, although I was drawn to this book by its enticing title, it would have been more accurately titled, \\"This Is My Religion\\". Orthodox Judaism wholly embraces the the Talmud. Unlike the Torah, the Talmud is arguably the work of great men, but not necessarily of God. There is wide and heated disagreement on this point. But in Wouk's book, any insight as to the nature of God will have to be inferred from the general discussion.But again, any truth-seeker, and especially followers of the God of Israel, should have this information. An observant and learned Orthodox Jew will likely find no new information here, but may enjoy Wouk's personal perspectives."},{"Title":"This is my God","review":"I'm atheist, however I enjoy religion like a human activity.

This work focuses on Herman's experiences with Judaism as a young adult, through his middle aged years in the late 1950s (with updates in the back of the book from the 60s and 80s, coupled with annotated updates when necessary, throughout the work). If you are an aspiring convert, or you practice Judaism of any sort, and you want an experiential view on the subject from another's perspective, this book is for you."},{"Title":"This is my God","review":"I was pleased to find a hard cover copy of this book in stock.

Saadawi is a psychiatrist by training and is in her mid 70s. She expounds on such topics as the rise of fundamentalism and its backlash against women and the negative effects of globalization. For example she points out that back when she was in medical school, in the early 50s, none of the women in her class wore the veil. She includes a very touching vignette about one of her patient, a young woman who goes crazy from isolation imposed by her distant fundamentalist father. While I don't necessarily agree with all of Dr. Saadawi's views they are certainly enlightening and thought provoking. Dr. Saadawi has also suffered imprisonment under Sadat's presidency and death threats from fundamentalists for her opinions."},{"Title":"The Nawal El Saadawi Reader","review":"I am very pleased with this book.

It had quite a bit of panty history - starting with the Old School Glamour where panties were thicker, higher, and made of silk; followed by some of the more modern favorites, such as Thongs, G-Strings, Classic Cotton and Sports Briefs; and finishing, where else (?) but with the panties of Celebrities (the Rich & Famous).Several of the chapters begin by briefly highlighting some of the most successful underwear makers in the world (companies I had never heard of) - names like Rigby & Peller, Bonds, Sloggi, and Cosabella.The most interesting chapter -- also with the best pictures - is the one that covers Thongs! Warning - if a woman's rear view is a favorite of yours - then you'll probably find this section to be quite enjoyable!Of the color photos scattered throughout the book - my personal favorites include a rear upskirt view of a Dallas Cowboy Cheerleader as she's bending over during a game; a view from behind of a Victoria's Secret angel wearing a V-String on stage; all of the pictures of thongs; a posterior view of a cute contestant in the Lingerie Bowl held in Los Angeles; a frontal flying-skirt view of Serena Williams hitting a forehand (which was hot!); and a provocative print ad for Elle MacPherson's lingerie (which was censored in her native Australia) which shows a voyeur's through-a-peephole view of a woman removing her knickers - with her deeply inserted thumb leading the way!Other celebrities who offer lingerie include Kylie Minogue (singer) with her LoveKylie line; Heidi Fleiss (of prostitution fame) with her HeidiWear label; a series of items by Jenifer Lopez (singer, actress); and lastly, even some underwear from Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen (actresses).As an interesting fact - the author claims that crotchless panties were originally developed to provide greater ventilation (and not for easier access). Yeah, right!As my final observation, this book is also surprisingly up-to-date -- especially as it describes how thongs, which reigned supreme for an entire generation of girls - have finally started to wane in their appeal.Because of the text's seriousness - this is a volume I can leave out on my nightstand - where my husband might \`discover' it!The photos aren't so scandalous that they'd make me jealous if he looked. But hopefully they are titillating enough - to get his attention!In short, \`Panties: a brief history' by Sarah Tomczak and Rachel Pask - is a book that's SERIOUS enough for HER - while also being SEXY enough for HIM! I found it to be just delightful!"},{"Title":"Panties","review":"This book is a small on, it is pack with lots of info. I love lingeie and collect some pieces.

They still talk about it, so therefore I ordered one for each of them as they are now having children."},{"Title":"The thirty-six dramatic situations","review":"Legend has it that Georges Polti heard that there were 36 possible plots, and set about creating a list of plots to match the 36. He claims that this number isn't special, and there may be other classifications a bit higher, or a bit lower. He also says that these correspond to the 36 basic emotions people have, which I honestly don't see.Some of the dramatic situations seem to be stretched a bit thin where several of them have similar parts but in sleightly different context.For example: Twentieth Situation: Self-Sacrifice for an Ideal, Twenty First Situation: Self-Sacrifice for Kindred.If someone proposed that there are only 36 plots (someone who the author holds in high recard) I would be tempted to say that with such a number as 36 - divisible by 1, 2, 3, 4 and all higher multiples thereof, that really what he meant was variations on a handful of plots. For example the 3 basic plots of Person v. Person, Person v. Nature (God), Person v. Herself. If I could think of 3 permutations on each of those, and 4 variations of each, then I too would have 36 plots.Here it seems that Polti just started listing plots until he got to 36. I do recommend this book, along with Games People Play by Eric Berne (which falls under the psychology/self help section) as a good resource for when you're stuck for an idea. Eric Berne was a psychologist, concerned with figuring out what the basic transactions between people are (games) and what are reasons are for playing them. The difference here is that Eric Berne acknowledges that his list is a work in progress, and more games will be recognized as time goes on.As far as more classical plotting, Aristotle's Poetics, The Art of Dramatic Writing by Lajos Egri (see my review), and The Hero With A Thousand Faces by Joseph Campbell are great resources. I'd also add The Hero by Lord Raglan (available in In Quest of the Hero by Otto Rank). These books make up the canonical library every writer should have.Aristotle laid down the fundamentals of drama over 2,000 years ago, and they are followed to this day. Probably his closest modern rival is Lajos Egri, and you'll see that many of the writing software packages out there are either Aristotle, Egri, or Campbell based.Another reviewer mentioned Star Wars. George Lucas was highly influenced by Joseph Campbell, and the famed Bill Moyers interviews were conducted on Skywalker Ranch. I think analyzing Star Wars from the point of view of The 36 Dramatic Situations is like analyzing soup from the point of view of it's ingredients: &quot;I noticed Celery, and Potatoes, and...&quot; without getting a feel for the arc of the story, or that the soup is a Stew. Star Wars is a myth, and follows the basic mythic structure.Lord Raglan identifies 22 common traits of heros, such as: His father is a king, he is raised by foster parents, we're told nothing of his childhood, etc. Everyone from Oedipus to Moses to King Arthur to Jesus to Luke Skywalker to Robin Hood to Neo follow this scale to one degree or another, and he gives examples of each.I'd also encourage the curious to learn more about the Hollywood formula, 7 point plots, and the all important turnaround."},{"Title":"The thirty-six dramatic situations","review":"This text comes highly recommended as a classic by far too many creative writing and screenwriting teachers.Want to know if this book is for you?

If it doesn't, you'll need to look elsewhere."},{"Title":"The thirty-six dramatic situations","review":"George Polti's book tells you about the inner workings of the thirty-six dramatic situations he claims to have found. According to him, the possible plots can be reduced to one of these situations or to a variation on them. Additionally, he offers specific sub-types to each one of the plots, so that it is easier to precise which elements will make a distinct kind of plot. At the end of the book, you will also find useful information on how every element of a plot can vary. The classical avenger archetypical figure, for example, can be split into several characters for a different effect; the object of a passion can be a man or a woman, but it can be an addiction too! A book that would-be writers should not miss, &quot;The Thirty-six Dramatic Situations&quot; will make a good reading even for those only interested in getting a better grasp of the plot of, say, a movie they have seen. It is, simply, a work of art."},{"Title":"The thirty-six dramatic situations","review":"The elevated language of this nearly 100-year-old reference book makes the writing disconcerting to read at first, but as you leaf through situations (&quot;Supplication,&quot; &quot;Enmity of Kinsmen,&quot; &quot;Vengance Taken for Kindred Upon Kindred&quot;), you'll find yourself thinking of modern examples. An example: how many of these named plot devices are in the first &quot;Star Wars&quot; film? Well, for starters, there's Pursuit, Deliverance, Disaster, Revolt, Daring Enterprise, The Enigma (&quot;Use the Force, Luke!&quot; -- &quot;Luke, I am your father!&quot;) and probably a few more that I didn't see. So if you're stumped for plots and conflict, this book will give you a good kick-start."},{"Title":"The thirty-six dramatic situations","review":"This book is famous mostly among people who have only heard of it. People who have actually read it are less gushy with their praise.Most folks think of this as a book of all the different plots and their variations. But personally, I prefer to look at the title itself, which speaks not of \\"plots\\" but of \\"dramatic situations\\".Picture a story as if it were a play. When the curtain rises, the actors are all on stage and frozen in a tableau that displays their roles and inter-relationships. It is Polti's contention that these tableaus, or \\"dramatic situations\\", amount to no more than 36 in number.How does this differ from 36 plots? Well, there may be only a limited number of relationships among the characters when the curtain first rises, but there are a zillion different ways in which those relationships can play themselves out. In Polti's sub-headings he goes through a wide range of different variations.So if you're looking for a one-size-fits-all set of plotlines so that you can write your blockbuster, forget it. If you want a densely written analysis of the 36 Dramatic Situations, this is your book. The book will help writers think about their craft, but it's still not as simple as people make it sound when they describe the book over a beer.One problem that I ran into was Polti's era and nationality. He was a Frenchman writing almost a hundred years ago. As a result, his voluminous notations describing a plethora of literary examples was mainly lost on me. Unless you're an expert on 19th Century French theatre, you may find yourself in the same boat.My bottom line: this is a good book. I'm glad I've got it and I occasionaslly pull it off the shelf and re-read sections. But is it a masterpiece, the Holy Grail of plot-writers? No."},{"Title":"The thirty-six dramatic situations","review":"I found Polti's \\"Les trente-six situations dramatiques\\" with another classic of his, \\"L'art d'inventer les personnages\\" reprinted by &Eacute;ditions d'aujourd'hui in a serie called \\"Les introuvables\\" and I can assure you that both books are very difficult to find as genuine originals. Now Lucille Ray has made a tour de force and Thirty-Six Dramatic Situations is available to English speaking readers. Polti claims that all dramatic situations boil down to only 36 basic situations. You can believe him or not but much what he says makes sense and he supports his claim by giving examples from classic literature. He also refers to novels and stories which may be difficult to find but the point is that somebody has used the dramatic situation in question and there may be others. This is the true value of Polti, if you truly want to offer your readers something new and don't want to copy your ideas from published novels. The other side of the coin is that certain dramatic situations can be safely used over and over again because the public wants you to play the same old song again and again. I like to read Polti's ideas just for fun and only regret that many of the books he refers to are difficult to find. Some of them are also available only in French. There must be some well-read amateur who could write an English version of Polti's book and give examples based on English texts. I guarantee a huge success. The same goes for The Art Of Inventing Characters. Anybody for the money and fame? OK, what about the moneyThe Thirty-Six Dramatic Situations?"},{"Title":"The thirty-six dramatic situations","review":"An explanation of each dramatic situation would have been helpful.

It made little sense to me. Nevertheless, I do see it as a useful reference for writers stuck for ideas.

Estleman and Martin Cruz Smith).This novel, Killing Plain, is typical for Mr. Cotton, in that it is a page turner and wildly entertaining. I have read about six of Cotton's series of novels featuring Ranger Sam Burrack, and have yet to come close to disappointment.I have noticed a thread through all the novels of certain strengths Cotton has as a writer. Here they are:1. His story ideas are always very creative and interesting. After all, it all hinges on a good story, right?2. He describes action scenes in a way that will make you feel them on a pulse-raising level.3. His novels are always full of very distinct and interesting characters, characters that stick in your mind (like for instance in this novel gunman Stone Eddie Deaks is a fabulous creation - completely memorable and unique - all cool, regal flash). Cotton brings to complete life the briefest of characters as well as the main character.4. His main character, Ranger Burrack, manages an old-school sense of honor and heroism without ever feeling false or preachy.5. There is a true element of humor in Cotton's work - not slapstick funny (the kind that tries to be funny) but \\"human\\" funny, that will have you chuckling.6. And lastly, I don't think any writer working today handles female characters any better than Cotton. They all feel like real people - sometimes heartbreakingly real - and never a token \\"strong independent woman\\" character.Finally, I must stress the incredible pure entertainment value of Cotton's writing. I can't think of any writer I have ever read, with the possible exception of Charles Dickens (an odd comparison, I am aware), that better forces you through the strength of storytelling to turn the page.I prefer Ralph Cotton to Larry Mcmurtry, and for entertainment value I can't think of higher praise than that.Highest recommendation - Mykal Banta"},{"Title":"Killing Plain","review":"For the first time in his career, Ranger Sam Burrack has a partner in young Hadley Jones.

In the town of Barstow, Lonzo and his hardsases have managed to take over the town after Sheriff Goins is gunned down by his scattergun wielding deputy Forrest Bidson who throws in with the Black Moon's. A judge dismisses the charges against Stone Eddie and he is set free. Ranger Burrack had not seen the last of Deaks. Out on the trail, Sam is ambushed and believed to be dead. An old hermit, hearing the gunfire, finds Burrack and takes him back to his cavern to recover. Jones meets up with Sam and the two lawmen continue their persuit of the Black Moon's. Deaks and Lamb also hook up out on the trail and ride on together to join up with Lonzo. Outside of Vista Luna, a small village in an old shack, Lonzo and his bunch have three sisters captive. It is here where the Rangers and Black Moon's have their fatal showdown. Not all the the men taking part in this shootout will walk away alive. KILLING PLAIN is filled with action and gunfire as the body count mounts. You do not want to miss this 5 STAR WESTERN ACTION. Another OUTSTANDING BOOK from Ralph Cotton."},{"Title":"The New Commonwealth, 1877-1890 (The New American Nation Series)","review":"Continuing my march across the ages of American history, the next stop was The New Commonwealth by John A. Garraty. Garraty's book covers the United States of America after the period of Reconstruction and before the Imperialist Age of the 1890s. It was a time where the Industrial Revolution had come into full bloom in America. A new nation was emerging that was turning away from the Jeffersonian ideals--while still singing his praises--and embracing the ideals of Alexander Hamilton. It was during this time period the giant corporations were to plant their big feet into the heart of American politics.Garraty breaks his book up into eight simple chapters that explore the different aspects of this particular time period. The books chapters cover industrialization, urbanization, workers, and many other aspects of American society. I found the chapter covering the political system and the political events of the industrial America to be the most interesting part of book. Garraty, when discussing the presidency of Rutherford B. Hayes, made a comparison between President Hayes and the other presidents during this period to that of King George III. Like the last American monarch, these presidents had come into office where their powers had been reduced by precedent due to the actions of their predecessors. An interesting observation but I disagree with Garraty about President Grant.The most incredible change was the industrialization of the United States. For most of this nation's history, the country had been an agricultural nation. Even the earlier phases of industrialization did not change that, but America began to embrace this new way of doing things and the face of the nation complexly changed.\\"Truly, American industrial technology was the wonder of the world, far in advance of Europe's in most fields, despite the fact that Europeans made most of the key scientific discoveries on which it was based. The relatively high cost of labor provides a partial explanation of American technological leadership, for it encouraged manufactures to invest their capital and energy in mechanizing their operations to reduce labor costs. The rapidity of American expansion also simulated technological innovation. So, in many subtle ways, did the structure of society. Americans, far less bound than most Europeans by a respect for tradition, adopted new methods more willing. Workingmen saw the relationship between productivity and wages more clearly than their European counterparts, and manufacturers were less reluctant to share the results of increased productivity with their workers.\\"(p.89)There was also the dark side of this era. The end of Reconstruction was a betrayal to those who had been enslaved. African-Americans saw their rights take a huge plunge backward. Garraty pointed out strongly that African-Americans were held back not just by those who hated them, but were also facing racial prejudice from those who might have felt no ill will towards them.\\"Even the shabby treatment afforded American Negroes after the end of Reconstruction was not entirely a product of prejudice and selfishness. The best-intentioned white citizens, trying to evaluate the potential of Negroes in the climate of those times, found it hard to avoid the conclusion that they were inherently inferior to Caucasians. Interpreting lack of achievement as lack of ability, confusing effect with cause, he saw in their poverty, ignorance, and degradation evidence of inherent stupidity and moral laxity. If he turned to authority for enlightenment, his conclusions were only reinforced. The superficial knowledge of African history available to an anthropologically nave generation suggested that Negroes, when left to their own devices, would remain in a state of savagery. Highly regarded 'scientific experts' insisted that the Negro and Caucasian were of separate origin, the former inferior in native ability to the latter. Professor Louis Agassiz of Harvard, for example, although opposed to slavery and to legal discriminations against Negroes, stated flatly that the race was 'indolent' and 'submissive' and 'imitative' by nature. He considered it 'mock philanthropy' to treat them as equal to whites. Agassiz was the leading American critic of Darwin's theory of evolution, but in the 1870's and 1880's many Darwinians also believed that the Negroes were an inferior race.\\" (p.21)John Garraty opens a window into a very important, but at the same time, forgotten time period. Surrounded by the American Civil War and Reconstruction on one end, and the restless 1890s followed by the presidency of Theodore Roosevelt on the other, this period is understandably overlooked. It nevertheless was an important phase in the development of the modern nation."},{"Title":"The New Commonwealth, 1877-1890 (The New American Nation Series)","review":"I do not recommend this book to people looking for light, entertaining reading, unless you really love the Gilded Age. Even if you do want to read about this period of history, I do not find this the most easily read book. (America in the Gilded Age by Sean Dennis Cashman is slightly more accessible.) However, it does provide a good deal of information about what was happening in the United States from 1877-1890 (the presidencies, industrialism, labor movements, immigration, Populism, etc.). If you're looking for info for your American history class (as most people reading this review probably are), this book is worth checking out."},{"Title":"A Season of Inquiry: The Senate Intelligence Investigation","review":"&quot;You see, the way a free government works, there's got to be a housecleaning every now and then.&quot; Harry Truman, as cited on the first page of the book. Well, in the U.S. Government, before you get a real housecleaning, it appears you have to build the vacuum cleaner from scratch every few years, and even then you only get the big dirt on the margins. This book is a very important book with all the more value today as we finally get serious about intelligence reform. Loch's professional and extraordinarily detailed account of the entire Church Committee investigation, its findings, White House attempts to avoid reform, and the rather bland outcomes that finally resulted, should be considered the key to understanding where we are today and why we so desperately need legislation to achieve substantive reform. Had Senator Church been chosen by Jimmy Carter as Vice President (Church was favored by the convention, with Mondale and Stevenson tied behind him), who knows what good might have come of his White House service."},{"Title":"The Bob Book","review":"THE BOB BOOK is a totally fact-based humorous sociology of mennamed Bob.

Randy's books have elevated my already strong interest in local history, and they make us aware of what we've lost to the wrecking ball or mother nature, as well as what we must preserve. Because these books focus mainly on history through the lenses of photographers, they concentrate their chronological scope to the late- 19th and early-/mid-20th centuries. They are also heavy on jaw-dropping, glorious, and often lost mansions and architecture which graced our area. Like \\"Lost New York,\\" which is the classic photo chronicle of New York City's vanished architectural treasures, Mr. Gabrielan's books often remind us of how quick we (Americans in particular) are to toss the past away, only to miss it when it's a distant memory or reborn for us in one of Randy's books."},{"Title":"When All the World Was Young: A Memoir","review":"Nostalgically deep yet painfully honest account of a young girl who never quite fit in set in the halcion days of America's golden age."},{"Title":"When All the World Was Young: A Memoir","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the book.

C. She could have been here in hillbilly country for all the non-sophistication she and her sister had in their formative years.\\"From 1801, when John and Abigal Adams moved into the half-finished White House, until the mid-1950s, when air conditioners started appearing in homes, not just movie theaters, (movies were called \\"the oases of air conditioning\\" back then), summers in D. C. were sweltering and generally miserable because of the humidity. From 1951-57 (only six years but it felt like a lifetime), I spent my summers in the suburbs of Maryland, not far from D. C. and, to a little girl from Tennessee, it was a grand adventure to ride the train back and forth (an overnight trip) no matter how hot it felt.She relates how Camp Shangri-La in Maryland was changed to Camp David by then-President Eisenhower (who was not very literate). Life during McCarthy's \\"great witch hunt\\" of the '50s was scary there but not as bad as out in Hollywood. Her grandmother was a history and civics teacher who refused to take the loyalty oath to continue teaching and quit when she reached the age to retire.If this is a \\"childhood as it used to be,\\" I'm glad I was spared the sexual molesting and fear of being called a Communist she found normal and everyday occurrences. She tells it the way she experienced it, \\"not necessarily the way it was in rurals areas.\\" Perhaps it was worse, but we in the Bible Belt had our churches for guidance. My sister, Evelyn, who was a young lady when I was still a child (eleven years difference in age) endured some of the shame Ms. Holland thought was normal. And now I understand why Aunt Gertie had so many children! Back then, that is all women were good for, according to this writer.Her cover photo with that cigarette reminded me of the girls in the YWCA in 1958, but no doubt that was her photo taken ten years earlier. Her mother illustrated children's books when she was young. She wrote fourteen previously published books including WHY LIFE ISN'T AS GOOD AS IT USED TO BE, ENDANGERED PLEASURES, REFLECTIONS ON LIVING ALONE, IN PRIVATE LIFE and SECRETS OF THE CAT."},{"Title":"When All the World Was Young: A Memoir","review":"\\"Growing up is the process of learning how many things you can't do and how many people you can't be. When you've winnowed them out, what's left is you.\\" - Barbara HollandI've said before of author/essayist Barbara Holland that she has a remarkable talent for perceiving the small details of life and living. Or rather, a talent for remembering what she perceives and subsequently bringing it to the attention of the lumpish rest of us.In mid-2006, Holland wrote a piece for the magazine AARP, \\"Being 70: The View from Up Here.\\" So, published in 2005, WHEN ALL THE WORLD WAS YOUNG can perhaps be taken as Barbara's final word on the subject of her formative years. Somehow, I don't expect a sequel.This volume is Holland's episodic narrative of her life from shortly before the beginning of World War II, at which time she was about six, to her first job in the display department of the Hecht Company in her (apparently) very early twenties. Measured against the comparatively happy memoirs of other female writers - Laura Shaine Cunningham (Sleeping Arrangements) and Doris Kearns Goodwin (Wait Till Next Year: A Memoir) come to mind - WHEN ALL THE WORLD WAS YOUNG is surprisingly bittersweet. The author is not reticent about her sternly authoritative stepfather, a self-absorbed mother disengaged from maternalism, her shoplifting phase, her high school abortion, and her wretched first marriage.As in all of Holland's books that I've read to date, her wry, iconoclastic humor is a joy. She relates how, in the fourth grade, she was given the assignment of reading a passage from the Bible to the class every morning.\\"I read my classmates a psalm a day, looking for the most rousing ones to hold my audience. ('Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies, that I might destroy them that hate me. They cried, but there was none to save them: even unto the Lord, but he answered them not. Then did I beat them small as dust before the wind. I did cast them out as dirt in the streets.' Psalm 18, perfect for the playground.)\\"Because of her talent for perception, she comes across with unorthodox snippets of insight, such as: \\"Peculiar relatives make good stories in later life, but to a child they're a wobbly rudder.\\" Or this: \\"Down below the grownup eye level, even the best-kept suburb seethed with action.\\"I wished WHEN ALL THE WORLD WAS YOUNG was two, three, four times as long. As a child, Barbara was an awkward loner who found companionship with only one or two really close friends, and who otherwise found escape in books. I soon realized that she and I, when growing up, were much alike. And my affection for her has grown accordingly."},{"Title":"When All the World Was Young: A Memoir","review":"A misfit, bookish, lonely child beset by terrors and bewilderment, Barbara Holland grew up to look back on her pre-mid-century childhood with wicked hilarity and affectionate humor, but not a shred of sentimentality. Growing up in the Washington DC suburbs during World War II, graduating high school in 1950, Holland, author of 14 non-fiction books, reanimates a bygone world when \\"the Father's chair\\" was sacrosanct and mothers never sat at all but fussed endlessly over their families. Except for her mother, who belonged in a category all her own: \\"Mothers and my mother.\\"Holland's mother is brilliant, attractive, talented, and about as unmaternal as a mother of five can be. A skilled carpenter and artist who believes her place is in the milieu she's least suited to - the home - she emerges as a complex, sympathetic character with dozens of quirks (not all of them endearing), who shuns housekeeping for murder mysteries.Holland's stepfather, on the other hand, receives no such complex attention. He's a monster with only two dimensions, cold and brutal, and at long last Holland has her revenge on him. She calls him \\" \`Carl,' since that wasn't his name.\\" \\"Just thinking his name brings him back too vividly and I can even remember his smell, not noxious but sharp and distinct like a whiff of danger in the forest.\\" Her real father was lost to divorce early on and nobody explained things to children in those days. Lucky for her, her grandmother anchored her childhood, a constant, if undemonstrative presence, with whom she spent most of her weekends.Holland, writing as an adult, with an adult's horror and sympathy, appears comfortable with the elasticity and vagaries of memory. She conveys the immediacy of the child's world - the acuteness of perception, vulnerabilities and emotion - and accepts the large blurry patches from which islands of vividness emerge, inking the spaces with evocations of the daily round. Her chapter headings evoke the past with Dickensian humor, beginning with: \\"In Which the Chairs & Domestic Habits of Fathers Are Explored, & Nick Is Born.\\"She was five when Nick, her younger brother, appeared. \\"I was horrified....He howled when Carl was trying to read his paper; he howled at night when Carl needed his sleep. He fouled his diapers and made outrageous demands on Mother's time and attention, even during dinner. He was totally ignorant of the danger he was in; how could he know? He just got here.\\" It was her job to save them both from being cast out of the house into the street. \\"Apparently Mother didn't understand the danger either. She had, as I said, a great capacity for refusing to notice.\\"School was the bane of Holland's existence, second only to Carl: \\"School & I Struggle with Each Other, Plus Hard Times with the Old Testament.\\" The social maneuvering baffled her, numbers were a threatening mystery, each day was a looming dread. Reading, however, was a miracle, and she read voraciously, \\"shucking the self gladly like a shirt full of fleas.\\"In elementary school she was called on to read the Bible to her class each morning. A methodical child, unfamiliar with the Bible, she prepared herself by starting at the beginning. The \\"sheer meanness of God\\" shocked her. She cried hardest at the fate of Lot's wife: \\"Struck down for a moment's homesickness.\\" \\"I wanted no more of God. He was Carl on a cosmic scale. When He put His foot down, everyone died.\\"Then came war, a time of change. A girl from California came to class wearing Bermuda shorts, a Northern family descended with a white housekeeper, Republicans moved into the neighborhood. Food deteriorated but children, just as they had before the war, \\"ate what was put in front of them, without comment, and barely noticed.\\" Mother went to work. \\"Fathers, by definition, came home from the day's work exhausted and surly. Mother came home sparkling all over as if from a light fall of snow.\\"In school there were air raid drills and in Florida, where she spent summers, German submarines prowled the waters, sinking oil tankers, and fighter planes practiced offshore. \\"In Washington the war, though great fun, was largely imaginary; on Florida's east coast it was actually happening.\\"After the war there was Joe McCarthy and the House Un-American Activities Committee, which put the fear of State into many of their friends and neighbors, though not Holland's socialist grandmother, who resigned from teaching rather than sign the loyalty oath. There was also polio and the nuclear threat, which progressed from backyard shelters to evacuation to the end of life on earth.\\"The Long Dark Night of Junior High School,\\" ended with the blossoming of a wonderful, intense friendship, her first with a soul mate, and high school brought a succession of bad-boy boyfriends, then after graduation she fell into a stultifying depression. But Holland leaves us on a high note, \\"In Which I Am Saved Again & Live Happily Ever After:\\" saved by a job - nothing special about it, except the independence of a paycheck, no small thing, then or now.Holland draws us into a time when big families were the norm, mothers stayed home and had black household help, children roamed at will, and people ate creamed chicken and pineapple upside down cake. In school history was male, girls weren't expected to do math or allowed to take shop and Latin was still offered. Funny, poignant, even savage, Holland's memoir will inspire you to seek out her other books, which cover a wide range of subjects from the irreverent presidential short takes of \\"Hail to the Chiefs,\\" to \\"They Went Whistling,\\" a wry and lively account of history's forgotten females, and \\"Gentleman's Blood,\\" a sharp-witted history of dueling."},{"Title":"When All the World Was Young: A Memoir","review":"An absolutely delightful book that brings back so many memories. I've often wondered how any of us survived child hood. I had about as much trouble with school as she did, as she called it \\"The Long, Dark Night of Junior High School.\\" We didn't have a junior high school, but I certainly thought high school was a bitch.I was struck by her story of wanting to ride on the back seat of a bus. She was in the South at the time, and this forced the African American women to stand. But she didn't know. There weren't any signs, just 'everyone' knew. Where I lived there were signs. I remember riding on a bus with our \\"negro\\" (the word at the time) baby sitter. She sat behind the sign, my brother sat just in front of her, with the sign in the middle. My brother and I played with the sign until the ultimate authority in the world, the bus driver came back and said, \\"leave the sign alone kid.\\" We sat perfectly still for the rest of the trip.This book is not a typical autobiography. It's a series of little stories from a time when the world was different. It wasn't as easy a world as one would have liked, but she made it through.My life was much the same, I wish I could write like she does."},{"Title":"When All the World Was Young: A Memoir","review":"I wish it hadn't ended -- but it ends, just the way it begins, with the perfect sentence. OH my gosh, where to begin. I can only say that I adore Barbara Holland's phrases and analogies. This is memorable stuff, turning me right into an annoying cheerleader along the lines of \\"You HAVE to read this book!\\" I feel it's my duty, as a friend and relative, to recommend it to others, especially my three sisters. We were born in Washington, D.C. (post-war), raised in the Virginia suburbs, and frequently visited our aunts in Maryland, in what's now a neighborhood more dangerous than Fallujah, so \\"When All the World Was Young\\" has the added allure of familiar nostalgia. But mainly, it's just a perfect memoir: rich, comic, dark, fearlessly honest, revealing, highly comforting. With two children in public high school in the much-touted Fairfax County School System, I feel great heaps of despair over the whole shebang (for lack of ability to better describe our personal education woes and utter lack of \\"school spirit\\"). Just reading Ms. Holland's reminiscences about school has bucked me up enormously, really more than anything else ever has. For this alone, I owe her much gratitude, but I'm also thankful for laughing my head off over subjects like the 1950 government's instructions on dealing with nuclear attack. I don't want to give anything else away; incidentally, be forewarned about reading Lynn Harnett's review because she basically gives the whole book away - yikes! For me, \\"When All The World Was Young\\" is right up there with Betty MacDonald's memoirs and Cornelia Otis Skinner's \\"Our Hearts Were Young and Gay\\", and that's high praise. Highly recommended; thank you, Barbara Holland! (Please keep writing)"},{"Title":"When All the World Was Young: A Memoir","review":"Unlike many autobiographies, this one avoided two frequent mistakes. First, it did not read like a boring recitation of events which plaques so much nonfiction. Barbara Holland is a gifted and interesting writer. But more importantly, she does not make excuses for, sugercoat, or gloss over her sometimes none too stellar behavior. She avoids the mistake of portraying herself as a heroine, always right, at the mercy of the mistakes of others. Her hobby of shop lifting as a young child is described and explained forthright, not excused. Even at the end of the book as life whirls out of control, she never whines. She always accepts responsibility for her behavior. Although she explains why she was misunderstood or why she was just plain acting badly, she never (like so many autobiograhers) blames anyone and everyone else for her troubles. This is an insightful look into the disturbed life of a sometimes happy, but mostly unhappy childhood, and a brilliant portrayal of the times. Growing up in the late fourties and fifties myself, this book jogged my memory over and over. It truly was a time like no other, an atmophere in American that our children and grandchildren, unfortunately, can never experience. Kids went out to play without supervision and had free rein of the neighborhood. We did not wear bike helmets and knee pads and globs of suntan lotion, and we certainly didn't carry music and cellphones.

So many children are happy until they start school. I guess it's a major awakening when the world intrudes into our lives for the first time.

It seems to be missing a lot of words. Looking words up feels more frustrating, because they are often missing, and because this dictionary follows the practice of putting \\"ch-\\" after \\"co-\\" and the other C words. It's hard to explain. I just don't love the New World the way I love my Chicago.The Chicago English-Spanish / Espa&ntilde;ol-Ingl&eacute;s was recommended by my highschool Spanish teacher -- I don't regret buying it. Classmates who bought other ditionaries (such as the Oxford, I think it was) often needed to borrow mine. It simply has more of the words we needed to look up and is fun to use and browse through. For example, the New World has the verb reference section in the middle of the dictionary, but the Chicago has it in front, where it's quicker to locate."},{"Title":"NEW WORLD 96 SPANISH/ENGLISH DICTIONARY SOFTBOUND","review":"I've been using this dictionary since I began learning to speak Spanish in the early 1990s, and since then it has found a permanent position on my desk.An important thing to remember with a language-to-language dictionary is that you're not looking up definitions, but rather synonyms in another language. For this reason the accuracy and completeness is important. This dictionary does a good job of accounting for mulitple definitions and uses of individual words in both languanges, and goes some of the way in outlining phrases.The layout is easy on the eyes, and there is also a very useful section in the middle between the Spanish and English sides on Spanish grammar."},{"Title":"NEW WORLD 96 SPANISH/ENGLISH DICTIONARY SOFTBOUND","review":"I am a high school ESL teacher for new immigrants to the U.S. Our school buys the Merriam-Webster English-Spanish in bulk so each student has one that is easy to carry around, and because they are cheaper.

I find The New World easier to read and easier to use. For example, when looking at multiple meaning words such as plot or setting, it is easier to pick out the language arts/literary definition in The New World dictionary. It also offers more in the way of support for people learning English or Spanish -- for example the section that helps Spanish speakers understand English prefix/root/suffix is very useful to ESL students and teachers in a high school setting. This year we are going to buy several for each classroom that has ESL students in it."},{"Title":"NEW WORLD 96 SPANISH/ENGLISH DICTIONARY SOFTBOUND","review":"There may be better dictionaries to keep on the desk in your study, but they are impractical, because of their bulk, to bring with you when traveling. On the other hand, the so-called 'phrase books' put out by Berlitz and others are little more than worthless. This dictionary is the ideal compromise. It is small enough to fit into a tote bag, carryon, or backpack, yet inclusive enough to have just about any word you might need (except vulgar or 'dirty' words--those you'll have to learn from the locals). Of course, you'll need to know the basics of Spanish grammar, but this dictionary eliminates the need to rack your brain searching for a word.

By her name, and her profession, she is assumed to be African-American. But she is Caucasian.Her published work has led to many invitations to speak on race relations.But, when they meet her, in person, and see that she is not African-American, things change.And she had to put in a tremendous amount of time, to show that she is here to stay, despite the resistence of others.In the end, this professor taught her students that the thickness of your skin, and not its color is a useful measure for success.This is a professor whose mission lives on through her students.I invite everyone male or female, of all races to read this book, as you think of yourself as a fly on the wall.You will grow, beyond your wildest dreams."},{"Title":"Skin Deep: Black Women and White Women Write About Race.","review":"As we begin to approach the next century, race is still an important issue that should not be ignored or denied. As we live in a multiracial society, it is important to take time out and listen to ourselves and others. This is a provocative book that should be read by all women who take the time to intellectually consider themselves and their role as women and mothers, sisters, neigbors, and lovers. How will we teach our children and eachother to consider race? These essays bring forth some harsh realizations of the boundaries that truly separate black and white women and what must be overcome if we truly want to unite. It is a good dose of reality that many of us would benefit from not only reading, but thinking about and discussing. The truth is awfully hard to swallow."},{"Title":"Skin Deep: Black Women and White Women Write About Race.","review":"This book is the product of what happens when we can tell the truth.

These men helped make America what she is today."},{"Title":"Beyond Glory: Medal of Honor Heroes in Their Own Words","review":"The subject is great and the men deserve our respect.

It would appear that the author just typed exactly what was said."},{"Title":"Beyond Glory: Medal of Honor Heroes in Their Own Words","review":"Smith has interviewed twenty-three recipients of the Medal of Honor, and coupled the edited interviews with brief scene-setting passages describing the war and the individual's circumstances. Official citations are appended. Acts for which the Medal was awarded occurred in WWII, Korea, and Vietnam. Some of the names are familiar-Senators James Stockdale, Daniel Inouye, and Bob Kerry. Most are little-known. They are of varied races, education, and background. Some are eloquent, as is Sen. Kerry on patriotism, guilt and redemption; others are blunt and inarticulate. The one common thread is that they generally consider themselves to be ordinary men who rose to an occasion they did not seek. Several make the point that they are not \\"winners,\\" since in no sense did they compete for the Medal: they prefer to refer to themselves as recipients of an award. Smith was an editor of Parade Magazine, and his analysis never rises above that level, but the stories of the recipients are powerful in themselves."},{"Title":"Beyond Glory: Medal of Honor Heroes in Their Own Words","review":"This is an extraordinary book. Larry Smith has done a masterful job in getting Medal of Honor recipients to open up and share their incredible stories. What you get are their thoughts, feelings, and memories, honest and unvarnished. The understatement and the humility make their bravery and achievements all the more powerful. Smith doesn't embellish or over-write. Instead, he lets each man have a voice. The result is gripping, page-turning, and will often bring tears to your eyes. Without Stephen Ambrose to do justice to those who fight our wars, we should be even more grateful to have Larry Smith."},{"Title":"Beyond Glory: Medal of Honor Heroes in Their Own Words","review":"It's so refreshing in these turbulent times to read about these heroes.Unlike other medal of honor books, which just offer the citations or summaries of the citations, this book offers unique looks into the heroes by way of interviews with them. They each have amazing stories and incredibly interesting lives.Buy this book!"},{"Title":"Beyond Glory: Medal of Honor Heroes in Their Own Words","review":"Larry Smith's book brings you the reality of true heroes in their own words, just ordinary folks doing their jobs. Actor/writer/director Stephen Lang's theatrical production of &quot;Beyond Glory&quot; may bring you to tears as you join these men &quot;just doing their jobs&quot; in a most extraordinary way. Lang's transition from character to character is as fascinating as each character's endearing story. The play is currently running in Arlington, VA, at the Women's Memorial Theater now, but Lang hopes to take it on the road to colleges and community theaters across the country."},{"Title":"Beyond Glory: Medal of Honor Heroes in Their Own Words","review":"Beyond Glory is a book full of the memoirs of Veterans. The Veterans are Medal of Honor recipients who are telling their stories from WWII to Vietnam. This is a book for anyone interested in war related things. Since I like that sort of thing, I found this book to be excellent and worthwhile. The genre of this book is Non- fiction since it is real stories from real people. The author, Larry Smith, went to many living recipients and personally interviewed them to get their stories literally in their own words. That is another thing that makes this book so good. He also used great detail and seemed like he was really there telling you the story. I thought this book was excellently written and very interesting. I would rate it 5 stars out of 5 stars. This, in truth, was one of the best books I have ever read and recommend it to everyone, especially if you are a history buff and like to read about War."},{"Title":"Beyond Glory: Medal of Honor Heroes in Their Own Words","review":"The interviews are ace and remarkable in their clarity and insight. These are let down by the lack of context as to the battle within the wider campaign and a map or two would have enabled the reader to see the landscape and the positions, both would have added to the understanding of the action taken by each of the medal winners. Another example is the cover photo, listed as US Army coming ashore on Tinian Island in the Pacific Islands, which is sort of correct but Tinian is one of the northern Mariana islands (next to Sapian which was a major Marine victory) and was the home of the 509th Bomb Group which lead the atomic raids on Japan, a small detail yet one that would context this good book even better."},{"Title":"Beyond Glory: Medal of Honor Heroes in Their Own Words","review":"This book was enjoyed by a 30 yr.

If you ever wondered what kind of men they were, this is the book for you. Each man's life is profiled, up to and beyond the event that defined their military life. The book ends with the actual words used when they were presented with the Medal. If you don't shed a few tears while reading this book, you don't have an ounce of patriotism.I thought it couldn't get better than the Medic who wouldn't bear arms, yet saved over 100 men single handedly in WWII, then I read the stories of ordinary men and real foul ups, who showed moments of profound bravery in the frozen Chosin Reservoir in Korea. I read the story of the longest held prisoner of war in Vietnam, horribly tortured, and of his wife, who led the crusade to finally get the men released. This is just an awesome book.

The majority of people taking this course are non-traditionals who are very aware that there is a difference between school and work. Also, considering that the subject matter is communications, there are an inordinate number of grammatical and typographical errors.

Presenting the mind and thoughts of a middle-aged gangster in Tokyo's multilayered underworld, Ashes depicts yakuza (Japanese mafia) life with a unique understanding and edge-of-your seat reality. Highly recommended reading for mystery/suspense enthusiasts, Ashes clearly documents Kenzo Kitakata as a world class literary talent."},{"Title":"Ashes","review":"Picture yourself in Japan, in Kyoto on a downtown sidewalk flooded with pedestrians and your eye catches two men, slipping through the crowd, walking with the uptempo of L.A. crack dealers, one having a pompadour \\"do,\\" the other, you notice, missing a knuckle on one of his fingers. These are yakuza, a Far Eastern edition of The Sopranos, or SiCi mafiosi with soy sauce. ASHES by Kenzo Kitakata takes us into the world of yakuza Tanaka-san, a forty-ish mobster, who is either in a mid-life crisis or about to realize his life's ambitions.Author Kitakata, known primarily as a mystery novelist (he's a past president of the Japan Mystery Writers Association) has stepped outside genre fiction to write this absorbing character study, part Spillane, part Dostoevsky, but always hard-boiled.A big risk Kitakata takes in this novel is dividing the book into two parts: \\"The Man Within\\" and \\"Within the Man,\\" and telling the story in two voices. The first part is authorial third person, with expressionistic revelation of character in scene details reminiscent of good Hemingway. For example, sitting on a park bench, yakuza Tanaka shows us beyond-redemption cruelty by plucking feathers out of a live pigeon he's grabbed.In the second part, we've jumped inside the mind of Tanaka with first-person narrative piling up the rest of a compelling portrait of our outlaw anti-hero. Somehow the jump from exterior to interior point-of-view--in that order--works because the gangster we get to know, while not without repulsive traits (the sexist observation, All women are the same once you've had them, is typical), also has an appealing samurai-like code. For example, real yakuza do not go to a doctor for knife wounds. With needle and thread, Tanaka stitches bleeding wounds closed himself.Moreover, ASHES is anything but a stop-and-drop action yarn. As might be expected in formal Japan, the yakuza have their share of well-observed rituals too (Pico Iyer has pointed out even yakuza carry calling cards). Much of the drama in Tanaka-san's struggle has to do with the Boss's decision to allow Tanaka to splinter off from the main clan and start his own gang. Relations among gang members--who may address the other as \\"Brother,\\" who deserves to be called \\"Uncle,\\" and other niceties give this novel texture. That's yakuza honor--on the surface. That Tanaka is a survivor owes quite a bit to his manipulative skill at bluff and exaggeration as he gets the better of his fellow gangsters.Tanaka comes across as tough to love, not capable of compassion for women, in particular, or helpless animals (pigeons and goldfish fare badly here). So in a bit of a surprise, Tanaka shows emotion crying in the presence of the ailing Boss of the main clan. As if Tanaka can only respond emotionally to the father figure, who would have to do, in this life.While ASHES doesn't measure up to that master of the hard-boiled, American James M. Cain (who in turn influenced French Albert Camus), this is also not genre fiction one finds in supermarket or airport fiction racks. No, it makes for a compelling portrait of a rogue, nihon-style, living out a few twisted premises."},{"Title":"Ashes","review":"I read about this novel in the Village Voice and bought it expecting a regular crime story, only set in Japan. It was a little confusing at the beginning, but by the end I thought it was the most literary crime novel I've ever read. Tanaka, the hero, is cool; he had my attention from beginning to end. Although he's somewhat misogynistic, one of the women in the novel is so wacky that I think there's more to it than just sexism. It's a trip and I recommend it."},{"Title":"Ashes","review":"I've read a lot of crime novels from around the world, including several from Japan: Miyuke Miyabe's \\"All She Was Worth\\", Natsuo Kirino's \\"Out\\", Akimitsu Takagi's \\"The Informer\\", and Seicho Matsumoto's \\"Inspector Imanishi Investigates\\". And it has to be said that this slim, terse book from the man considered the grandmaster of Japanese hard-boiled is a disappointment. Originally published in 1990 and turned into the film \\"Like A Rolling Stone\\" (unavailable in the U.S.), it's a virtually plotless character study of an ambivalent mid-level yakuza named Tanaka. Kitakata's framework is somewhat unusual, the first half of the book, Tanaka is observed from the third-person, and the second half of the book is written from Tanaka's first-person perspective. Despite the different perspectives, the prose remains flat and dry, stylized to the point where it has no life whatsoever. This may also be an issue of poor translation, either way, it's not particularly engaging.In any event, Kitakata seems to be trying to draw parallels between the life of a yakuza and the life of a typical Japanese salaryman. Tanaka is in the midst of a classic mid-life crisis, he's worked for the same boss for twenty years (including eight lost years in jail), and lives an emotional vacuum, has no home life, and has devoted his adult life to professional advancement. And like many men is such situations, he spends a great deal of time in a haze, questioning himself: \\"Sometimes I wonder why I've stayed in [the yakuza] world for so long.... There's a part of me that resists being a real yakuza. . .Why did I become a yakuza? Maybe I'd had no choice.\\"Amidst all this angst, there's a bare bones plot involving the boss ordering Tanaka to branch off from the main clan and run a little crew on his own. We see Tanaka being violent, cruel, manipulative, and scheming as he plots his way into becoming the next boss. It's pretty standard issue yakuza stuff, with the attention to ritual and brand names one expects.But without any action to move the story along, the book merely seems like an impressionistic collection of related vignettes. As a character study, it's just far to elliptical to have any power. A much, much better Japanese book about the inner life of an outsider is Akira Yoshimura's \\"On Parole.\\""},{"Title":"Ashes","review":"A great piece of introspective hardboiled Japanese fiction. Instead of a detective as so many writers of hardboiled fiction are apt to fall back on (likely and rightly in attempts to follow the success of Raymond Chandler et al), it tells a story centered in yakuza politics - played close enough to the chest not to give too much away, but enough that the personal experience of a middle-aged yakuza is very real to the reader. The first half is written in the third person with fairly little clues as to who the man we're watching might be, but it doesn't suffer any for it. It gives you the sort of feeling you get when you sit in a room and listen to the conversations other people are having - eyeing your own glass, pretending to mind your own business, but secretly clueing in on the business of others. A fly on the wall. For some I'm sure it will annoy, but because I'm secretly the sort of person who loves to do that, it felt comfortable to me.The second half is written in the first person, the man from the beginning - called just \\"Tanaka\\" or \\"Brother\\" by his yakuza brethren. I can't say that I enjoyed it as much as I enjoyed the first half, but that could be my affinity for the style of the beginning talking more than the actual quality of either part. There is a particularly wonderful passage in this half about the death of Tanaka's goldfish - not for the faint of heart, but it illustrates that despite the usual failings and repetitive nature of many translations of Japanese literature, no metaphor is lost in Ashes.I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys hardboiled fiction or is interested in looking into hardboiled fiction beyond the scope of perhaps Hammett and Chandler. It is decidedly not the detective vein so familiar to fans of the genre, but it is worth every page."},{"Title":"Ashes","review":"I keep waiting for a new Kenzo Kitakata novel to get translated, because I can't read Japanese and yet this is one of my favorite crime writers, and one of the top noir novelists in the world. I don't just read his books -- I study them. He is a master of the slow, quiet build up to a violent climax in which the build up is as aesthetically satisfying as the climax, so the reader doesn't hurry but sinks into a kind of hyper-detailed daydream or trance. ASHES is about the daily life of a yakuza gangster. I wonder if Takeshi Kitano read Kitakata before makingSonatineThis novel gets inside the yakuza life-world -- the mood is existential, the brutal violence sudden and casual. Matter of fact.

Using this book has helped me understand how Dreamweaver works with CSS as well.It takes longer than 10 minutes to even read some of the chapters, so I'm not sure how they came up with the title; pretty catchy though. This is one useful tool for learning CSS, and works well in conjunction with others; not a stand-alone though."},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself CSS in 10 Minutes","review":"I recently found a need to do a little CSS programming on a website. When I went looking for books what I found were any number of two to six hundred page texts. Then I found this little gem. It fitted my purposes perfectly as it explained the basics of CSS with examples for things I was trying to accomplish.I will say that I have to agree with the other reviewers that the repetition of code was unnecessary and was the major reason that I didn't give five stars. The important things is that it provided a basis for me to experiment with the examples, accomplish what I needed to do, and allowed me to gain enough knowledge in a few short evenings that I'll be able to get another book on the subject without being totally lost from the first page. That is all I can ask from a cheap book."},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself CSS in 10 Minutes","review":"If you know nothing about CSS and you can find an inexpensive copy, this book will get you started, but there have to be better \\"get started\\" books. Probably good if someone needs a lot of simple, explicit examples though. The one place I had high hopes for the book was near the end where it dealt with using CSS to format \\"printer friendly\\" pages. I'm sure the code was OK, but there was no example of how to link a page formatted for the screen to one formatted for the printer. I was expecting some example of loading a second Style Sheet using the same page code."},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself CSS in 10 Minutes","review":"I respectfully disagree with the reviewer who thought this book was repetitious and needed more editing.My technique when I need to learn something is to find two good books on the subject: one a really simple one that will give me a good overview of the subject and make me feel like an \\"expert\\". Then the second one I use to find out all the little details (which makes me feel like less of an expert but certainly more knowledgeable).Anyway, in this instance, I read a lot of reviews here and went down to Borders and flipped through all the books on CSS. The two books I selected were this one as my first book and CSS Mastery by Andy Budd as the second. Both I think have proved to be excellent choices.I didn't find any editing errors at all in this book (not that I was looking for them, but they certainly didn't pop up). And as for being repetitious, that is partly true, but I would rather have an author repeat him/herself than to be told, \\"As we showed on page 39...\\" and have to keep flipping back. What the author is repeating is why each line of CSS is written the way it is, and I found it helpful.Anyway, after a couple of hours with this book, I feel like I have good understanding for CSS and can work with it."},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself CSS in 10 Minutes","review":"This is probably the most boring, most uninspiring book I ever bought.

Online he gave quite a few examples of different layouts you could use and explained how they worked. When I found this book by him at Amazon I thought I should give it a try. This is great little book and I learned quite a bit from reading it and trying some of the example he explains in the chapters. Due to the size of the book it is not an in depth analysis of CSS, so you might want to pick up another book for this task. The one I am currently reading is \\"Stylin with CSS\\" by Charles Wyke-Smith."},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself CSS in 10 Minutes","review":"I got my hands on a old copy of SAMS Teach yourself CSS in 10 minutes. For those in a time crunch, its 22 ~10 minute lessons. Some of them take five minutes, some take an hour. The book claims each takes 10 minutes, I assure you they do not. In addition the book assumes you know a bit of programming and where to put text in the body, style, div, etc. In that regard the book is unforgiving. Its saving grace was that the book has a free link to download all the example code. After fumbling through the first quarter of the book I eventually got what the book meant to say by reviewing the code. Still even with the code sometimes the exercises do not work as intended or match the picture. Also it uses highlighting to show you what to add, but often has none-highlighted code that also needs adding to continue. If anything the one thing this book will teach you by hitting you in the head, over and over again is error checking. That is a great thing to develop, but unfortunately they did not intend this to be the lesson and its a byproduct of a poorly produced book. Still in the end I stuck with it through the end, and as such I feel the book is worth two stars."},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself CSS in 10 Minutes","review":"(The following comments pertain to the Sixth printing: June 2009 copy of the book)As noted by other reviewers, this version is riddled with numerous (and, in some cases, serious) errors that severely affect the overall worth of the book.

A lot easier to understand than most other texts I've seen.

While I could already write a little CSS to get by, this book was good to show things that I hadn't learned yet. However, the book was a bit repetitive. It repeated code over and over in each section and only added a few lines of new code. While that's not completely terrible, I felt it was wasted space on the page!"},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself CSS in 10 Minutes","review":"This is hard to write a review for, considering the topic in question was much more limited than I anticipated.First off, the book itself, had a lot of repetition in it... I think formating types of text was covered about 30 times.Second, I think it would've been more helpful to the reader if the samples weren't finished and downloadable. People would probably grasp the info much better if the example grafics were supplied, and then forced the reader to write the code themselves. But since it's already done for ya, then a person pretty much reads the book and clicks through pages to see what they look like... not actually doing anything.On a lighter note, I would say that if you were like me (not knowing one single thing about css), then this really isn't a bad book. You can grasp onto it's purpose really quick, examples are easy to follow, and there are some reference tables.The only thing that bothers me is... it just seems like there should be much more. At the time of this writing, I'm wondering if thats all there is to css, or if there is much more advanced stuff out there. The author makes no mention of further recomended reading... so one assumes that this is all there is. And if thats the case, W3C has completely wasted everyone's time and money. I read the whole thing in less than a day, and at first glance, it appears that css is nothing more than a fancy way of formating text, and making boxes without tables (which honestly, in the end, the user will not notice an increase in download speed... the bulk code of a table is made up for in the new fancy css file you made)"},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself CSS in 10 Minutes","review":"I was so disappointed with this book. The sad fact is that with better editing, it could have been not only a great introduction to CSS, but a handy reference volume as well. Unfortunately that was not realized and the book fails greatly.The examples are poorly written, with un-necessary duplication of examples. The description of CSS elements, descriptors, etc could have been made much more clearly with some careful editing. Alas no such editing was done.I cannot recommend this book to a beginner as the content is not complete enough nor clear enough for learning. I can't really recommend this book to anyone for that matter because someone with more CSS experience would be better off with an O'Reilly book on the subject."},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself CSS in 10 Minutes","review":"This book is an excellent starting point for those making the leap from styling with html to css. Not only does it break down core principles into easy to digest chunks of information it also teaches some practical methods and techniques you'll actually put into practice.The thing I like best about it though is that it's organized really well and contains a wealth of information so even after you've learned and mastered the basics of CSS you'll be able to come back to this book later on and it will be a great reference book for things you need quick refreshers on."},{"Title":"How to Bring Them to Christ","review":"I was not prepared for the convicting of the Holy Spirit I received when I read just the first two chapters of this small book.

If you read a story and you don't know what's going on, even reading the notes and finding out that the story is based on rhetorical arguments of the day (which were very popular) and how it's a parody isn't going to make the story anymore enjoyable. YOu will get the jokes but only after they've been explained.This is a rather depressing prospect considering that it means that there's a shelf life onSimpsons World The Ultimate Episode Guide: Seasons 1-20.Still, several aspects do come down to us in the modern world without too much translation. Jokes about people passing gas have always been amusing. This is why The Miller's Tale is so funny and even if you don't know the tropes of Courtly Love being parodied. Other stories take effort but are worth it. Some are very influential in their ghastly and grisly methodology (The Pardoner's Tale is a fake morality tale that serves as a horror story).And some stories do just fall flat and serve only to bore the reader.Still it's worth a read.

I just had fun reading it and taking it for face value. I feel somewhat obliged to write something about this book. Some of the tales (the Knight's and the Sergeant-at-Law's) were very long, and normally I would be screaming at the fact that I had chosen to read such a lengthy novel, but once I got into it, length really wasn't a real issue, but I don't know if this is something that was in the original manuscript, or in the translation, but to me, Chaucer seemed to jump around and some of the tales didn't seem to flow as well as others."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"this boke sux. its a bunch of midevil poetry. it is so retarded and dum. i dont like it al all.Initially published in the Journal of Literary Criticism, 24(1)."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"I enjoyed reading the Canterbury Tales from a language lovers point of view.

The group of travellers include men and women of different types and different occupations, so produces quite a few amusing and interesting moments throughout."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"This modern translation is for those who struggle with Chaucer's original language. Coghill's melodious verse captures the timely flow of the original text, thus preventing the reading from becoming a slow and erudite undertaking. Chaucer's Tales were not designed for sluggish meditation, but to be read aloud in an engaging manner, which is what makes this translation an ideal buy for those who wish to experience the Tales for their original charm.The immortal Canterbury Tales is a must for all lovers of great literature. What we can witness in this noble poem \\"is the concise portrait of an entire nation: high and low, old and young, male and female, rogue and righteous, land and sea, town and country\\", as Nevill Coghill describes in his introduction to this translation. The past has become magical to us through the great works of Epic poetry; where the Greeks had Homer, and the Roman's Virgil; the English have none other than Geoffrey Chaucer.It is only infrequently that we can find classic ideas that have captured readers throughout the ages, be it Pickwick's proposed adventure to study his fellow men, Dante's quest for his beloved Beatrice, or indeed Chaucer's undying Pilgrimage; The Canterbury Tales manifests its own unique appeal in an immortal journey through the Tales of many different voices.On the Eve of a Pilgrimage from a London Cheapside Inn to St Thomas a Becket's shrine in Canterbury, a group of thirty pilgrims are challenged by the inn's Host to a competition: to while away their morrow's journey by each telling a tale; on returning to London their Host will then decided the best storyteller: and their reward? a luxurious meal on behalf of that Pilgrim's fellows. What follows are many tales, of many varieties: those of courtly love, bawdy comedy, fresh wit, menacing macabre, didactic fables, in short, to use John Dryden's words \\"God's plenty\\".But it is the prologue to Chaucer's great collection of tales that marks its individuality from the Likes of Ovid, Petrarch and Boccaccio - of whom some of the tales are largely indebted to. The translator of this edition advocates that \\"in all literature there is nothing that touches or resembles the prologue\\". And this is by all means a cogent argument: what we witness at the beginning of Tales is patchwork quilt of Medieval England, a Tapestry of Chaucer's times, or if you like: a doorway into a world long faded away.The prologue simply follows the task of introducing the diverse tellers of the Tales, and yet in doing so it records a valuable sample of history. William Blake faithfully promulgates the Prologue's vitality by declaring that: \\"Chaucer is himself the great poetical observer of men, who in every age is born to record and eternize its acts\\". The Pilgrims are not only well presented characters, they are also true embodiments of normality. What we see in the Tales is not just a snap-shot of Olde England, but something indeed far bigger: a blueprint of our own society's individuals - \\"the perennial progeny of men and women\\". What Chaucer portrays to us in his Canterbury Tales is nothing greater than our very selves."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"Chaucer wrote the Canterbury Tales in \\"Middle English\\" (not quite like Beowulf and what's written today but in between) and this version is fairly easier to read because it's written in modern language. If you want the challenge read the Norton edition, but this is good for beginners and people that really don't want to spend time reading the Middle English with all those footnotes. However, even with the Modern English, it's a lot easier to read but perhaps not as easy to understnad and decipher the tales.Now for the book, historically, the novel outlines the importance of the Church on the country and how in England, the church had become something that was seeking material wealth and status instead of any spiritual growth. Also, it shows the harsh feudal system that ruled the era. Chaucer explains that fourteenth century England was filled with people in pursuit of wealth and power, and that this was also the cause of the problems of his society. It is told as different tale's of pilgrims venturing together on a pilgrimage. The tales are important in understanding the time and culture, basically that's why it's a classic and it's also the first work of poetry written in the English language; so pretty important."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"The Bantam edition (ISBN 0-553-21082-3), edited, introduced and translated by Peter G. Beidler, is inexpensive but readable. I like having the original on one side and a translation on the other because it enables me to make an attempt at reading the original and then check my comprehension with the translation. The introduction and notes are informative but not intrusive. It's true that only ten of the tales are included but there is enough to keep you busy for awhile. I recommend this if you are looking for an inexpensive and portable edition."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"Although it does not include ALL the tales, most of which were never completed, this is a wonderful edition because:1. the Middle English orginal text is on the left hand side.2. the translation is on the right hand side.3. each tale has a summary preceding it.4. all explanatory notes follow the summary to each tale.5. excellent translation of each.6. essays at the beginning set the stage and include Chaucer's bio, setting of religion, why the pilgramage to Canterbury was being made, and so forth.7. incredible low price for such an edition.I found that picking up the tempo and pronounciation of Middle English was rather easy.

I didn't realize (my fault--it's in the Publisher's Weekly review) that this was a child's version of the classic. The illustrations are nice, and, quite frankly, I haven't read the author's interpretation, but I wanted to make it clear to folks that it's not the original text, nor even an unabridged translation."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"If you, reader, are willing to put a little time---not that much, really---this is your \\"Canterbury Tales.\\" The editors have kept most of the Middle English, with modern typography and some modern spellings, and have put the glossary, those needed words, to the side of the line of verse. I found this helpful. I could reach the Middle English and glance to the margin for help here and there. The introduction has help on pronunciation. In the end, I was reading aloud to myself in middle English and found the text no more slow-going than other English-language poetry, easier to reach and understand than John Donne.I discovered that the work is, in Middle English, funnier than the translations let on. The rhymes themselves are humorous. The poem also is earthier than the translators suggest. Why don't you memorize and recite the opening in Middle English. Amaze your friends. Be the life of the party. Come on, what else were you going to do with your time?"},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"Chaucer is an author with unusual staying power. Sure we read classical writing and appreciate it but it doesn't seem to have the impact that Chaucer's Canterbury tales still have on us. We can see ourselves and our foibles in the pilgrims he writes about and the stories he attributes to them. To think that this was written in a time period we relegate as a time period of ignorance and religion! We can imagine that even in a time where superstition ruled there were still people that that saw the world quite similarly as we do today and certainly Chaucer was among that group.This version is incredibly well translated and provides a succinct introduction including a nice brief biography of the author. Also the notes are pretty good - I just wish they were footnoted rather than all in the notes section.So if you if you think reading a work that is six hundred years old might be a little boring start in out of sequence and go right to the second tale - The Millers Tale. Like something straight out of a Jerry Springer show if this story doesn't give reason to laugh than I don't know what will. The only hang up you may have is reading in the metered format that the tales are written in. I will say that it is not difficult to get the rhythm o the words and before long you won't even notice. The book is relatively thick but it is fast reading so don't be discouraged by that - its well worth it. Reading Chaucer gives a glimpse of how the secular mind worked in the middle ages. He provides straightforward writing that isnt simple but yet isnt overly complex verbose. Without being totally austere he can tell interesting stories quickly and, since (as we all know) brevity is the essence of wit, be remarkably funny.If you are reading this for school you should be excited to know that not only are you reading a seminal work of secular English writing that is referenced throughout our culture. Also it is actually fun to read. If you are thinking about reading this just for fun you are doing the right thing I waited too long to pick this book up and but I am really glad I did it is thoroughly enjoyable and while while a little historical background may help I doubt you will need a degree in history to appreciate this one.-- Ted Murena"},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"Geoffrey Chaucer's Canterbury Tales is perhaps the best literary work of the Middle Ages. He paints a lucid picture of life during this time period and his familiarity with every social class, as well as his vivid and comical descriptions of his unique characters, makes this poetic book charming. Chaucer embraces several genres, some of which include romance, satire, and fabliau. He uses the voice of a naive narrator. However, one should not conclude that the point of view expressed is his entirely because this may very well be literary trickery. Canterbury Tales is as modern and entertaining today as it was six hundred years ago, with themes such as the corruption of the church, which ironically is still prevalent today."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"The wife Bath Tale opens up with a Prologue.

There's nothing in the way of analysis or notes; after a brief introduction that lays out who Chaucer was and where the tales come from, he lets it rip.The tales themselves are deserving of their fame because of the way that they manage to be maintain a literary value and yet still appeal to the masses. While each tale stands alone (and some of them stand alone very well indeed), the device of a group of disparate strangers stuck together that comprises the frame is exceptionally captivating. There's something very neat and pat about the concept: two tales each on the way, and two tales each on the way back.Even though this was obviously never accomplished, we still get fun interaction between the principles, and get a feel for what the entire project would have looked like (like a thicker book, I suppose, but I digress).That Chaucer used this unifying element to bring together stories from other sources is to his credit, because the variety of sources adds to the concept, by creating starkly different tales that ably bear out the voices of their various tellers.If you have any sort of interest at all in the classics, or have enjoyed the stories to be found in traditional folklore and the greek myths, I urge you to give this edition a shot when trying Chaucer."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"If you haven't read the Canterbury Tales in their native language than you are missing out.

I was looking for a fuller picture of the tales, yet the translaters picked the tales that they fealt were the most important and I did enjoy it very much. For any of you out there that want to read the full Canterbury Tales in Middle-English I would suggest the Norton Anthology of Middle English Literature.

Like many poets he uses and wrote for the specific contexts within which he lived. His works are like a mirrror to his time. During this time there were many medieval and courtly romances to pursue one another to a direct point. Being a engrossed student and an avid reader Chaucer knows just what his feelings are and expresses them quite frequently throughout his work. The Canerbury Tales, is a story of pilgrims that come together and set off on a pilgrimage to the shrine of St. Thomas. Chaucer made his groups of pilgrims into a picture of the society of his time of which the like is not to be found elsewhere. In the journey there are men of a variety including a squire, physic, a man of law, carpenter ,and a knight to name a few. Also a wife of bath who tries greatlty to show her defense of being married five times. This is a story that Chaucer puts together brillantly to show the effects upon life during his time. The contrast between apperence and reality are use of the general prologue and Chaucer's great power of vivid description. The Canterbury Tales still remain, to a larger extent, a measure of the English society of the 14th century as it covers a cross-section of the society of that time era."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"G.

David Wright deserves just credit for making this available to the general readership.I will not review any of the stories because I think it wise to read them yourself and understand the truly effective use of irony in English writing."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"Early this year, I took a trip to the Huntington library in Los Angeles where I saw a copy of an early manuscript of the \\"Canterbury Tales\\" and a little voice told me it was time I read this classic I had heard about most of my life but had never touched, not in high school or college.I knew nothing about the \\"Canterbury Tales\\" other than it was very old and written by Geoffrey Chaucer. I only vaguely knew it wasn't written in modern day English. I knew that I wanted to read the book in middle English because of a quaint notion that I needed to hear Chaucer's voice speak to me over the centuries. I might not understand much of it but at least I would have the experience, like with Shakespeare of a kind of intimacy was the text.The first attempt at the \\"Tales\\" was a Norton critical edition but I purchased it before realizing it only contained nine of the tales. So then I searched for a more expansive edition that contained all of them, even the fragments and the often discarded, Parson's tale. That lead me to this one edited by A.C. Cawley. It cost me $3 dollars and was published in 1975 which gave the book itself a ye olde flavor. Add to that the musty smell and I felt very comfortable with my book.Cawley doesn't over do the glosses and annotations to Chaucer's tales but he select the seemingly right word or phrase to offer up in modern English that helped my comprehension. I should admit that I used two other aids, Peter Ackroyd's retelling and also an Oxford guides to the Canterbury Tales. They were useful and I will review them separately.So what to make of the classic itself? My overarching feeling was that Geoffrey Chaucer must have had a devilish glint in his eye. That for all the piety, the religious sentiments and moral teaching contained in the tales, I came away with the sense that he didn't take any aspect of humanity too seriously. He saw in himself and others the absurdist, contradictory, peevish, sinful, humorous makeup of humanity. I relate to him because of that. Other thoughts are that it sucked to be female during those times as women had no autonomy, being forever tethered to a husband or father or cast aside as a widow or nun. And yet men feared women's sexuality to such an extent that it could cut short a woman's life through no fault of her own. The other thought is about how a religious world view was front and center and commerce was a minor matter. Yes, people wanted to be rich and powerful but only if it didn't jeopardize ones standing with God. And many occupations were somehow connected to the church, it was the corporate state in its day."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"The Canterbury Tales by Geoffrey ChaucerThis ebook is probably the best place to start with Chaucer, father of English poetry and the originator of comedy in the English language."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"This is a good translation.

The Canterbury Tales, as mentioned in most of the review prior to mine, recounts the soujourn of twenty-nine pilgrams to Canterbury. Chaucer had original intended, or so it would seem, to write four tales for each pilgrim--two to be told going to Canterbury and two to be told on the return from Canterbury. It is very likely that Chaucer omitted the twenty-five or so tales that he did for a stoutly religious reason--that once you meet God in your life (which was the intent of a pilgramage) there is no returning. This is why the pilgrims are never seen leaving Canterbury. In all, the tales tell a very strong moral tale. Nearly every line of this wonderful work can be interpreted with a religious overtone and it is no doubt that Chaucer intended for it to be this way. In closing I would like to make reference to a review I read on this page. The short story for in no way came out of this work. The development of the short story can only be attributed Edgar Allan Poe. To suggest that the short story evolved from this would be a grave error. That aside this is a wonderful tale on the surface level and a morally deep tale if you chose to read into it."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"This translation allows you to read the stories, which often are in poetry, with pleasure. I found the stories to be earthy, funny, but sometimes sad."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"These tales, in any translation, are a great example of 14th century English folktales and stories. They are actually more enjoyable if read in the old English language, although it is a bit difficult to understand. These tales were penned as poetry by Geoffrey Chaucer sometime between 1380 and 1390. Chaucer is extremely funny if crude, and each of these twenty-four tales is a gem in it's own right. He has based his format on 24 mythical pilgrims that are travelling together to get to a religious shrine. This type of religious pilgrimage was extremely popular in Chaucer's day. Anyway, they help to pass the time of their travels by each telling a tale. These individual tales enable the reader to get a very clear glimpse of the personality of each of the storytellers. The tales are all different and range from bawdy to religious sermons, but they are highly entertaining. I have read these tales numerous times and I never grow tired of rereading them."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"It's easy to forget how enchanting and how modern Chaucer was.

Nothing of course is better than the real thing, but I suggest this always as a happy second."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"What would it be like if you had to make a very long journey on horse back? Pretty boring, right? But what if someone had the brilliant idea of telling stories on the way there? That would make the trip go a lot faster. This is the premise of the Canterbury Tales. There are a lot of people who all want to go to the shrine of St. Thomas a Becket at Canterbury Cathedral. They all met at a pub when the pub owner said that they should all tell one story on the way there and one on the way back. The version of the Canterbury tales only consists of four of the one hundred twenty eight that were told.The first story that is told by the Nun's priest. This story is about a poor widow who lives on a farm. As you get further in this story it starts retelling the story of a chicken and a hen. This chicken had many wonderful hens around him. \\"This noble rooster ruled over seven hens, whose work it was to please him. They were his sisters and his wives.\\" (pg. 20) But there was one hen named Lady Pertelote that he liked the most. One night he had a dream about a fox eating him. The next morning he told Lady Pertelote and she thought it didn't mean anything. A couple of days later a fox tricked him to shut his eyes and then the fox snuck up behind him and snatched him in his mouth. He was saved by the widow.The next person to tell was the pardoner. His story was about greed. There were three people who were searching for death because they heard of all the horrible things he had done and wanted to kill him. While on their way they met an old man who told the men, \\"If you're so anxious to find Death, turn up this crooked road. I left him in that grove, under a tree and there he'll stay.\\" (pg. 41) So that's what they did. When they got there they saw a sack full of gold and decided not to chase after Death but take the gold by night. They decided for one of them to go into the city and get wine to celebrate. The person that went was the youngest of them all. While he was gone the two thought up a plan to kill the third one so that they only had to split the money between them. The third boy wanted the money all to himself so he poisoned two of the bottles of wine and left one free of poison for himself. As he got the tree the two men killed him and they celebrated by drinking the wine and they died too. In the end they all got there wish. They met Death.Those two were my favorite and the next two are by the Wife of Bath and the Franklin. The wife of Bath is about a man who threatens the life of another if they don't tell him what women want. The franklin's tale is about women who loved a man who left her and she was very sad. Nothing could make her feel better. If you want to know what happens at the end of these stories you'll have to read the book.Historically this book is very good. It is based in the year of 1386. It show the life style of people who lived in the middle ages. It taught me that not all people were rich back then. It is historically spot on but the thing about this book is because it was written in the middle ages all the living conditions are right but it's very whimsical. Chickens can't talk, and Death isn't a person. In a way it shows how people thought back then. It tells us that some people might have wanted to meet death. Maybe in a physical way because they wanted to die or they just wanted to see someone death took away from them.The reason I liked this book was because of the old English. I like taking in the metaphors and deciphering it. If you like Shakespeare then you'll most likely like this book. It is very whimsical and magical. It shows the people in the middle ages in a very metaphorical way. This book shows how life can be mystical and great even when you don't except it."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"Over some period I have read several translations of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. My first experience, selections in a high school text, was not promising. (Perhaps, I was not yet ready for Chaucer.) Translating poetry from one language to another is difficult and often unsuccessful. Translating Chaucer from Middle English is not much easier. English has changed dramatically in the last 600 years, to the point that Middle English is nearly indecipherable. For example, we read Chaucer's description of the Knight's appearance:Of fustian he wered a gipoun (Of coarse cloth he wore a doublet)Al bismotered with his habergeoun (All rust-spotted by his coat-of-mail)A glossary, diligence, and time are required for reading the original Chaucer. If you choose to do so, the Riverside Chaucer edition (edited by L. Benson) and the Norton Critical Edition (edited by Olson and Kolve) are highly recommended. The Signet Classic paperback edited by D. R. Howard modernizes the spelling a bit, but largely adheres to the original Chaucer and is an easier introduction to Middle English.Although in most cases the instructor assigns a particular version of Canterbury Tales, it can be exceedingly helpful to pick-up an additional version or two. A slightly different translation may entirely surprise you, even resonate with you, making Chaucer much more enjoyable. I suggest that you look for these versions:Selected Canterbury Tales, Dover Thrift edition - provides a poetic, rather than literal interpretation, and is quite readable. The collection of tales is fairly small, however.Canterbury Tales, Penguin edition, translated by Nevill Coghill, is an excellent poetic translation. It is a complete collection, arranged by Group A thru H, and also includes The Parson's Prologue, The Parson's Tale in synopsis, and Chaucer's Retractions. Coghill's translation remains my favorite.The Canterbury Tales, Bantam Classic paperback edited by Hieatt, uses the \\"facing page\\" format with the original Chaucer on the left and a modern literal translation on the right page. I found the literal translation a little wooden, but this edition can be quite helpful if you need some help with Middle English. (A guide to phonetics, grammar, spellings, and a glossary is provided.)Chaucer's Canterbury Tales (Barrons Educational Series) uses an \\"Interlinear Translation\\" format in which each line of Middle English is followed by a modern translation (literal to make the comparison easier). I rather like this approach.Canterbury Tales, John Murray Publishers, London is hard to find, but provides a partial translation to modern English, maintaining as much as possible of the Middle English. This rather clever approach is somewhat risky, but the translator H. L. Hitchins pulls it off. With some effort I could follow the text without continually referring to a glossary and in a limited way I was \\"reading Middle English\\".Canterbury Tales, Pocket Books, prose translation by R. M. Lumiansky, is easy to read, but while this prose format adheres to the storyline, it is only a shadow of the poetic Chaucer. It might prove useful if you are not comfortable with poetry.Good luck. Reading Chaucer is really worth the extra effort."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"The question is not whether to read the Canterbury Tales, but whether to read them in this translation -- or whether to go for the Middle English with all its difficulties.I'm a purist. As a Chaucer teacher myself, I'd say read the tales in the Riverside Chaucer or in the Norton Critcal editon with lots of footnotes. But, yes, that is harder, and I'd rather see readers get some experience than none.So, if you are going to compromise, Nevill Coghill's poetic translation is really as good a place to go as any. You will get the basic sense of Chaucer's verse; you'll get the basic rhymes and rhythms too. This is the translation that's used in most high school classes, and in many college survey classes that don't read the text in the original. It's really a fine compromise -- not only a good place to start, but also a decent trot if you are struggling with the Middle English.You can find some closer translations of some of the tales online if you look up Michael Murphy's websites. But for all their virtues, they don't have the smoothness of Coghill's renditions; Murphy's translations are not the complete Tales; and it's clunky to print them out. This economical edition is probably still the best place to start with Chaucer, father of English poetry and the originator of comedy in the English language."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"The version of this classic I read was a translation into modern English by Nevill Coghill. As you can see above, I awarded Chaucer (and the translation) five stars; but I do have a criticism. This translation (and many other publications of Chaucer) do not contain the two prose tales (&quot;The Tale of Melibee&quot; and &quot;The Parson's Tale&quot;). These are rarely read and I understand the publisher's and the translator's desire to keep the book to a managable size. Still, that should be the readers decision and no one else's. I had to go to the University library and get a complete copy in order to read those sections. As I mentioned, this copy is a translation into modern English. However, I do recommend that readers take a look at the Middle English version, at least of the Prologue. Many years ago, when I was in high school, my teacher had the entire class memorize the first part of the Prologue in the original Middle English. Almost forty years later, I still know it. I am always stunned at how beautiful, fluid, and melodic the poetry is, even if you don't understand the words. Twenty-nine pilgrims meet in the Tabard Inn in Southwark on their way to Canterbury. The host suggests that the pilgrims tell four stories each in order to shorten the trip (the work is incomplete in that only twenty-four stories are told). The tales are linked by narrative exchanges and each tale is presented in the manner and style of the character providing the story. This book was a major influence on literature. In fact, the development of the &quot;short story&quot; format owes much to these tales. All of the elements needed in a successful short story are present: flow of diction and freedom from artifice, faultless technical details and lightness of touch, and a graphic style which propels the story. In poetry, Chaucer introduced into English what will become known as rime royal (seven-line stanza riming ababbcc), the eight-line stanza (riming ababbcbc), and the heroic couplet. His poetry is noted for being melodious and fluid and has influenced a great many later poets. He has a remarkable talent for imagery and description. With respect to humor, which often receives the most negative responses from a certain group of readers (as witnessed by some of the comments below), there are at least three types: good humor which produces a laugh and is unexpected and unpredictable (for example, the description of the Prioress in the Prologue), satire (for example, the Wife of Bath's confession in the Prologue to her tale), and course humor, which is always meant to keep with the salty character of the teller of the tale or with the gross character of the tale itself. I am really stunned at the comments of the reviewer from London (of June 21, 1999). He/she clearly has no idea of the influence of the work nor on the reasons why Chaucer chose to present the humor the way he has. T. Keene of May 17 gave the work only three stars, presumably because it was once banned in Lake City, Florida. (Does that mean it would get fewer stars if it hadn't been banned?) Perhaps our London reviewer will be more comfortable moving to Lake City! Another reviewer suggested that &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot; was only a classic because it had been around a long time. No! Chaucer's own contemporaries (for example, Gower, Lydgate, and Hoccleve) acknowledged his genius. My goodness, even science fiction books acknowledge the Tales (for example, Dan Simmons' &quot;Hyperion,&quot; which won the 1990 Hugo Award for best science fiction novel of the year, is based on the Tales). These brief entries are too short to review all of the tales. Let me just descibe the first two. Other readers might consider reviewing the other tales in later responses. In &quot;The Knight's Tale,&quot; the Theban cousins Palamon and Arcite, while prisoners of the King of Athens (Theseus), fall in love with Emelyn, sister of Hippolyta and sister-in-law to Theseus. Their rivalry for Emelyn destroys their friendship. They compete for her in a tournament with different Greek gods supporting the two combatants. Arcite, supported by Mars, wins but soon dies from a fall from his horse (due to the intervention of Venus and Saturn). Both Palamon and Emelyn mourn Arcite, after which they are united. It is the basis of &quot;The Two Noble Kinsmen&quot; by Fletcher and Shakespeare. &quot;The Miller's Tale&quot; is a ribald tale about a husband, the carpenter John, who is deceived by the scholar Nicholas and the carpenter's wife Alison that a second flood is due. In this tale, a prospective lover is deceived into kissing a lady in an unusual location. And, recalling the response from our reviewer from London, apparently this Tale should not be read by people from London (or Lake City)!"},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"Over the years, this book has been banned upways, sideways, and down.

Entire sections and tales were cut out, for PC and conservative reasons both. I reread it in an unabridged edition, and while even a truncated Chaucer is beautiful, I see how much I missed.Yes, the Tales may be anti-semitic and sexist and Chaucer probably killed puppies just to see their expressions. It's still a beautiful example of writing. Rather than limit himself to portraying the upper classes and more refined manners, Chaucer elected to portray &quot;low&quot; manners and tastes as well, giving a more complete picture of life as he saw it.

Since most of us are more comfortable with modern English, a good translation makes all the difference, and Nevill Coghill's excellent translation does full version to Chaucer's book. Reading this version takes the work out of it and makes \\"The Canterbury Tales\\" a pure pleasure.Chaucer writes about everyman and his stories represent one of the motliest crews in English literature: the Wife of Bath who has put away five husbands and is looking for a sixth; the pardoner, the reeve, the clerk, the knight, and a host of others from all walks of life. There is something in here for everyone; my three favorite stories are the Pardoner's Tale; the Miller's Tale (reading this in Coghill's translation, I could see why it has been excised from the bowdlerized versions used in high school English classes; it's rude, crude and downright lewd, but it's so hysterical they had to sew my sides up again when I finally stopped laughing), and the Franklin's tale of the knight, the squire and the magician who outdo each other in chivalry.Antisemitism was commonplace in medieval Europe and Chaucer is no more free of it than anyone else of his time; but to say that The Canterbury Tales is not worth reading because Chaucer was true to his time is overstatement. One must accept that Chaucer was as human and imperfect as most of his peers; without compromising the fact that Chaucer was a literary genius who had a profound effect on English language and English literature.Judy Lind"},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"CHAUCER : THE CANTERBURY TALES. Translated into Modern English by Nevill Coghill. 504 pp. Penguin Classics. ISBN : 0140440224 (pbk.)Nevill Coghill's brilliant modern English translation of Chaucer's masterpiece, 'The Canterbury Tales,' has always been a bestseller and it's easy to understand why. Chaucer was an intensely human writer and a great comic artist, but besides the ribaldry and sheer good fun of tales such as 'The Miller's Tale,' we also know he was capable of other things. His range was wide, and the striking thing about Coghill's translation is how amazingly faithful it is to the spirit of the original - at times bawdy and hilariously funny, at other times more serious and moving when Chaucer shifts to a more poignant mode.But despite the brilliance of Coghill's translation, a translation so effective that it was even made into a successful musical, and despite the fact that it remains the best possible introduction to Chaucer for those who don't know Middle English, those who restrict themselves to Coghill are going to miss a lot - such readers are certainly going to get the stories, but they're going to lose much of the beauty those stories have in the original language. The difference is as great as that between a black-and-white movie and technicolor.Chaucer's Middle English _looks_ difficult to many, and I think I know why. It _looks_ difficult because that in fact is what people are doing, they are _looking_ at it, they are reading silently and trying to take it in through the eye. This is a recipe for instant frustration and failure. But fortunately there is a quick and easy remedy.So much of Chaucer's power is in the sheer music of his lines, and in their energy and thrust. He was writing when English was at its most masculine and vigorous. And his writings were intended, as was the common practice in the Middle Ages when silent reading was considered a freakish phenomenon, to be read aloud. Those new to Chaucer would therefore be well advised, after reading and enjoying Nevill Coghill's rendering, to learn how to read Middle English _aloud_ as soon as possible by listening to one of the many excellent recordings (one of the best is by Robert Ross on Caedmon).Coghill certainly captures the spirit of Chaucer, but modern English cannot really convey the full flavor and intensity of the original. Learn how to roll a few of Chaucer's Middle English lines around on your tongue and you'll soon hear what I mean. You'll also find that it isn't nearly so difficult as it _looks_, and your pleasure in Chaucer will be magnified enormously."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"The Canterbury Tales were almost ruined for me by my freshman English Lit class. They insisted on making us read it from The Norton Anthology of Literature, which of course is untranslated. This is pointless. Unless one is a specialist or going for a doctorate there is no point in reading The Canterbury Tales in Middle English with all those endless footnotes. It takes one of the greatest books in English Literature - or World Literature, for that matter - and makes it torture. I have no need of \\"thilke\\" or \\"willhem\\" or \\"clepen.\\" That is why Nevill Coghill's translation is such a boon. Now we can enjoy it in our own language the way the fourteenth-century English did (in truth, it is not that hard to translate as many of the words stay the same). I have taken to reading it, not as a novel, but as a collection of short stories - skipping around as I please. I think it is agreed that the best parts art the Miller's Tale, The Pardoner's Tale, and The Wife of Bath (and the Prologue, of course) which makes for excellent starting points."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"\\"Brilliant\\" is the right word for Chaucer, I think. Not \\"magnificent\\" - it sounds too authoritative, and authority was one thing Chaucer had little regard for. I mean this not in the sense that he devoted himself to passionately tearing down authority - simply that his ultimate motivation was to parody, sometimes to satirize, and just generally to poke fun. The mood of the work as a whole is one of a game, interspersed with various asides from both Chaucer and his various characters beseeching the readers not to take what they say too seriously and to maintain a general spirit of fun.The backstory to the telling of the titular Tales (alliteration!) is that of thirty pilgrims, each given their own unique introduction in the prologue (though some, such as several priests, are lumped together), travelling to Canterbury to the site where Thomas a Becket was killed by Henry II - of England, of course. The host of the Tabard Inn, Harry Bailey, suggests that they make a wager where they each tell two tales on the way to Canterbury and two on the way back, and whoever tells the best tales gets a dinner to be paid for by the rest of the party. But this is fairly unimportant - what is important is the characters, the tales, and Chaucer himself's relationship to both.The tales snowball off one another in such a way that, while it is certainly possible to read them non-chronologically, the best understanding of the work as a whole is achieved by just reading straight through - and then once more after that, as some earlier stories reference characters not fully given a chance to shine until later in the work. For example, during the Knight's tale of courtly love, he himself pokes some very subtle fun at the typical absurd purity of his Medieval romantic characters, which prompts the Miller to tell a fabliau tale in which similar high romantic rhetoric is used simply for the purposes of hot, dirty, extramarital sex at the expense of a poor, old, foolish carpenter, prompting the Reeve (himself a carpenter) to revenge himself on the Miller by telling a tale in which a cruel, stupid, thieving Miller's daughter and wife are both raped by young students whom the Miller has tricked. The cycle of degradation of the romance finally ends when the Cook begins a tale of a prostitute, Chaucer trailing off the tale without ending it, presumably because he has already made his point - namely, the dichotomy between ideal views of romance in the eyes of higher, aristocratic figures, and the realities of romance (or, rather, lust) in the eyes of the common figures of the day. And yet, despite this, the dirty, crude, ribald fabliaux of the Miller, Reeve, and Cook actually reinforce aristocratic feeling of superiority.I could quite easily go on, and on, but I will not. Suffice it to say that this is perhaps the greatest (in terms of sheer worth, not puffed-up self-importance), most entertaining, most rewarding work in all English literature. I intend to read the untranslated version as soon as I can. Speaking of which - Coghill's translation is quite excellent, with smooth-flowing rhymes and handy footnotes (although sometimes their placement did seem a bit arbitrary - why did he feel it necessary to explain what a Summoner was, but not what a Manciple was?) My one criticism was that he decided not to translate the prose tales of the Parson and Chaucer's Tale of Melibee, giving a self-written summary in their stead. While the summaries were fine, and perfectly informative, I want Chaucer, dammit! But all in all, a fine job, Mr. Coghill."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"This version will appeal most to those who have read and studied The Canterbury Tales and enjoyed them.The Canterbury Tales are best heard aloud.

The tales also exemplify all the major story forms in use during the Middle Ages.The book's structure is unbelievable subtle and complex, providing the opportunity to peel the onion down to its core, one layer at a time. Modern anthologies look awfully weak by comparison.Although the material is old, the ideas are not. You will also be impressed by how much closer God was to the lives of these people than He is today. The renunciation at the end comes as a mighty jolt, as a result.My favorites are by the miller, wife of Bath, pardoner, and nun's priest.Where do you see the opportunity to give and share spiritual and worldly love? How can you give and receive more love?"},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"Chaucer has the talent of telling a good story, and if you read a Modern English version, the tales are enjoyable, but so much is lost. Chaucer uses words that can give a story many different meanings. If you really want to get into Chaucer, look at the words that he uses...they can tell a story of their own or just give insight into the deeper meaning (and there is always a deeper meaning). You may want to read a Modern English translation first, just to understand what the overall message is, but I recommend reading the Middle English version to discover the deeper meaning that Chaucer is trying to get across."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"Listening to the Canterbury Tales as an audio book is probably the best way to fully appreciate them, as they were certainly conceived to be listened to and not read silently for oneself. The narrators are varied and talented; they certainly succeed in bringing out the most from each tale. Also, the excellent translation makes the work perfectly accessible and easy to understand.This unabridged version makes one realize however that this work was never finished or has been incompletely transmitted to us. For instance, the first tales such as the miller's and the reeve's are cleverly linked to one another. Sadly, soon enough afterwards, no structure is perceptible and tales simply follow one another with no apparent logic.In addition, the unabridged version includes lesser known tales, some of which are dismally boring, such as the Tale of Melibee or the Parson's Tale, both in prose. They are closer to a long series of quotations than an actual narrative. Was Chaucer being ironic in including them? Or else, are they later additions that Chaucer did not write himself?Overall, listening to the Canterbury Tales is a unique experience that is highly recommended to all, for sheer delight but also to realize how much, and how little, our culture has evolved since medieval times."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"At the Tabard Inn, thirty travelers from a diversity of classes and occupations are planning to make the annual pilgrimage to Becket's shrine at Canterbury. It is agreed that each traveler will tell four tales to help pass the time, and the host of the inn will reward the best storyteller with a free supper when they return. The Canterbury Tales is a sometimes bawdy, sometimes spiritual classic, skillfully translated into modern English and presented in an unabridged audiobook format. Read by Martin Jarvis and a full cast, The Canterbury Tales reveals the trials and travails of daily life in late fourteenth-century England through stories, conversations, jokes and arguments between travelers. Truly the most memorable way to experience this literary classic, The Canterbury Tales is especially recommended for public library collections. 17 CDs, 21 hours, tracks every 3 minutes for easy bookmarking."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"In order to understand English litterature and the English language, many have read, or at least tried to read, Chaucers \\"Canterbury Tales\\". I too did begin (and sort of finished) the work in Middle English, which is not as hard as one might be lead to think, but is quite labourious and painstakingly slow at times. With this version, a great compromise has been found, translating it as true to the original as possible yet in modern English. I know that every time you make a rewrite or translation, things are lost, but sometimes it is necessary, or just quite convenient. This is one of those times.It is great fun reading the Canterbury Tales. The structure of the work makes it very accesible and easy to pick up after some time away. You could treat it as a whole entity or as a collection of short stories centered around a group of persons on a pilgrimage. One of the books that any decent home library shouldn't be without."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"If you were force fed this in school and didn't appreciate it at the time I invite you to revisit this and see what we may have missed the first time around.

Well worth picking up again if you're at all curious."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"I got this version of \\"The Canterbury Tales\\" over my spring break (Partialy because that is the time of year the story takes place.) and a instant obsession was sparked between me and the fine black ink printed on the paper. I remember getting up before the sun rised just so I could sit in the quiet and take in every word the book had to offer.It is so poetic its like a smooth flowing song, often you forget you are reading and drift off. Dozens of memorable lines fill the book, especially the first couple paragraphs in the General Prologe. Characters like the Knight and The Wife of Bath really become memorable, and almost 700 years later you can almost still relate to the stories they tell. I cannot stop praising this book. I highly recomend it."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"The Canterbury Tales by Geoffrey Chaucer inform us of what is was like to live in the Middle Ages and experience a real pilgrimage. This does not read like a novel, rather it is a frame-story that includes a collection of short stories for each character. A Knight's Tale is the classic court romance with chivalry and contempt, although a bit long, it is one of the better tales in this compilation. Chaucer emits his satire exceedingly well through the tale of the Pardoner, sure to entertain the witty reader. Other tales consist of just plain humor, as in the Carpenter's Tale and Reeve's Tale. Do not let the Middle English prohibit you from reading this, for this edition includes both the Middle English, which not exceedinly difficult to read once you get into the rhythm, and modern English. The Canterbury Tales is an absolutely wonderful collection of stories that has something to offer each reader."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"Essentially every other version of Chaucer is either in the original Middle English, which is very hard, or in a modern translation, which hardly seems worth the bother. This edition reaches a happy middle: the original language is maintained, word for word, but spelling is modernized. (This is incidentally, how ALL general versions of Shakespeare are edited-of course, Shakespeare's English is a lot closer to our own, but his work would still be much more difficult to read if you had to decipher the original spelling.) Of course, a few commonly used words and a greater number of rare words have not survived into modern English, and the reader needs to learn these; a list is provided. But that is much easier than having to also decipher virtually every word because its spelling is not recognizable.Naturally, pronunciation changes over time, as does spelling, so some of the rhythm and rhyme doesn't quite work. But it's more than passable, and in any case reconstructions of Middle English pronunciation are all hypothetical, with scholarly disagreements.There is nothing wrong with the Middle English editions for those with the time and inclination to tackle them. But after discovering Murphy's edition, I felt almost like I had been hoodwinked into believing that Middle English was much further from Modern English than it really is."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"While this is one of the better translations of The Tales I've seen, it's still unfortunately a translation. Even with a perfect translation, much of the rhyming and character of the original is lost. On the other hand, you can also lose much of the essence of the story by reading the Middle English text simply because the vocabulary can be so different (even though most of the time you can guess the meaning). Your best bet is to buy a copy of The Tales that keeps the original text but adds a line-by-line translation. The book may be twice as thick, but this way you can both read it the way Chaucer intended it to be, and read the translation right under the original words in case you're completely baffled by the vocabulary. I recently found a copy like that at a garage sale for 50 cents. It was the best 50 cents I've spent in a long time."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"I find it very unfortunate that I wasted my money on this book when I could have read the entire story on the Internet.

They are written in \\"old English\\", however, and read like a foreign language for most of us. Barbara Cohen's adapted translation gives us four of the tales in contemporary English and therefore provides an excellent introduction to Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. Cohen's tales retain Chaucer's colorful insight into fourteenth century England including life as a knight, the horror of the plague, and the religous hypocrisy of the age. The illustrations by Trina Schart Hyman are vivid and tell a story all by themselves. I use Cohen's book as a supplement to teaching medieval history and literature to 7th and 8th graders."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"Chaucer's original Canterbury Tale's written in Middle English was rather difficult a read.

I know I was. If you're like me, you're picking up The Canterbury Tales because it's one of those classics that you eventually have to read to be one of the \\"literati.\\" Or, and actually more likely, you're being forced to read it by some professor somewhere. As such, you're ready for a dry and dusty tome, struggling for every page. But that's not what's here.The Canterbury Tales is much more entertaining, much more visceral and much more fanciful than many of the works that have followed it (and most of the classics). It is a collection of short stories that runs the gamut, from precious religious narrative to bawdy toilet-humor. Most all of it is in verse (usually couplets) and the reading is fast and fun. My personal favorite comes first in the Knight's Tale, but the whole is filled with surprises and engrossing stories. Reading the Tales, you'll also have an interesting perspective into a society many hundreds of years past--a society that turns out to be not far different from our own.I'd also like to take this opportunity to recommend a modern fantasy/sci-fi novel that is kind of a take on the Tales entitled Hyperion by Dan Simmons.So, to conclude, if you are sitting up in your dorm room, staring at the Tales, trying to figure out how to approach: just start. It'll do the work for you."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"This is a wonderful, hilarious book! Granted, it is not an easy read, but if you are a good reader or don't mind working through the old language, you will find this to be a very funny book. It also takes some understanding of the period it was written in. Without that understanding and the aforementioned traits, you may find this book to be &quot;a waste of time&quot;. Rent the movie A Knight's Tale to see appearances by Chaucer, the Summoner, and the Prior. This movie, despite being somewhat fluffy and anachronistic, does have some elements of The Canterbury Tales which, after reading the book, you may notice."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"In Chaucer's work, 'The Canterbury Tales', perhaps the greatest of English literary works from the period of the language known as Middle English, there is one particular piece that have always stood out for me.'A Clerk ther was of Oxenford also,'This is perhaps my favourite character, as when I first read it, it seemed to epitomise what I hoped for in my own life.'That unto logik hadde longe y-go.....For him was lever have at his beddes heedTwenty bokes, clad in blak or reed,Of Aristotle and his philosophye,Than robes riche, of fithele, or gay sautrye,But al be that he was a philosophre,Yet hadde he but litel gold in cofre,But al that he mighte of his freendes hente,On bokes and on lerninge he it spente,and bisily gan for the soules preyeOf hem that yaf him wherwith to scoleye........gladly wolde he lerne, and gladly teche.'Every now and then I cannot help but re-read this part of the Prologue, for a reminder of what I'm aiming for in my own life.Chaucer was son of a wine merchant, something near and dear to my heart. Chaucer was well-read, well-phrased, well-mannered, industrious in literary and legal/administrative pursuits, as I trust I will become, if not already so qualified.As one can see from the above examples, English has changed much over the past 600 years, but not so much as to make these passages unrecognisable. Compare for yourself with a modern translation such as this, and see how much you can decipher.Chaucer is one of the first great English authors of name; most (but not all) literary output in English prior to this time was anonymous. Living in the 1300s, he held administrative posts of importance under Kings from the time of Edward III to Henry IV. Never one to shrink from spending too much money (he had to reapply for pensions and ask for advances several times in his life) or shying away from controversy (he fell out of and came back into favour several times). When he died, he was laid to rest in Westminster Abbey, in a section on the south side that has since become Poet's Corner, largely due to Chaucer, the first great English poet, having been buried there.In addition to his magnus opus, 'The Canterbury Tales', a collection of stories with prologue told by pilgrims on their journey to Canterbury (car radios and in-flight movies were rare in those days), Chaucer wrote minor poems to suit various occasions (his first record as poet comes from having written a poem as elegy on the death of John of Gaunt's first wife, Blanche, in 1369), and the major work for which he was noted for 'Troilus and Criseyde', which showed his sense of humour, power of observation and attention to detail, and keen dramatic skills in language. This work is often compared to Dante and Boccaccio, perhaps the most famous poets of the day. 'The Canterbury Tales' is actually intended to be much longer - 120 tales told by 30 pilgrims (two each on the way to Canterbury, and two each returning). As it is, there are only 24 tales plus a prologue - had it been completed, it would be by far the longest poem in the English language.There is a strong, practical side to Chaucer's writing, sophisticated yet not aloof and removed from the affairs of the world, cultured yet in tune with the better (and more interesting) aspects of the common people, too.This edition by Nevill Coghill is designed for those who only want the Canterbury Tales, not the other writings of Chaucer, but want a set of the complete tales and prologue from standard texts. This is a fairly standard version that is useful for students - the Penguin classics have long been a staple for undergraduate and general readership, and this volume fits the bill nicely.For those who want the Canterbury Tales in good form, this is a good volume to get."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"Have you ever sat amongst friends, or maybe even strangers, and swapped stories with each person attempting to make their tale appear to be the most impelling. This is in essence the design of Geoffrey Chauncer's &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot;, a collection of stories told by a group of travelers on a pilgrimage to Canterbury Cathedral. Of these stories the most noted are &quot;The Knight's Tale&quot;, &quot;The Wife of Bath's Tale&quot;, &quot;The Miller's Tale&quot;, &quot;The Reeve's Tale&quot;, and &quot;The Parson's Tale&quot;. Chaucer, born in the early 1340s (the exact date is unknown), lived a most notable life and had a profound impact on English literature. Much of his works are influenced by love and his distain for the Church in the form of satirical humor. The latter due impart to the corruption within the clergy and the condition of the people from their suffering of drought, famine, and disease.

If you must read a translation I would suggest the translation by Nevill Coghill, it is quite good. However I must reiterate that to get the full effect of this masterpiece of the English language you must read it in its original tongue.

The stories range from serious tales about chivalry and love (knight) to the disgusting and perverse (summoner). Apparently Chaucer planned to have each member of the party tell two tales, but I suppose he didn't get around to finishing the collection. Also, I think 1 or 2 of the stories are not complete, but that's in every edition you can buy."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"The annotation style if this edition ruins it.

If you don't know what it's about, the Canterbury Tales is a collection of stories told by a group of pilgrims on their way to Canterbury Cathedral. The tales are told as a way to entertain each other on their journey and the one who tells the best tale will earn a fine meal paid for by the other travelers. This is actually an incomplete work as Chaucer died before completing it, but it is a fine example of early English literature and one of the most important pieces of the English Canon.The tales here vary in length and content as to the prologues and epilogues containing the goings on of the party members. Chaucer writes with a great sense of humor and, since he is writing in the language of the common folk, the content contains many lewd and bawdy jokes and events. It is a very entertaining read and if one wants more than just entertainment, there is a lot of social commentary about life in medieval England that can be gleaned throughout the text.I was a little unsure what to expect when I read this and don't be turned off by the introductory prologue in which our narrator introduces all of the characters. It can be a little long and dry in parts, but it helps to give a clear picture of the characters in the party as they interact with one another and tell their respective tales.Added note: I had to read this again for another class and this time we read it in the original Middle English. Having read the Canterbury Tales earlier, I appreciated the fact that I already had a handle on the general storyline of the tales and could instead concentrate on the nuances of the language and the beauty of the rhyme scheme.

This volume includes a critical introduction and a helpful glossary written by the editors.The text is arranged in a format utilizing a facing-page translation.Chaucer spoke and wrote in the London dialect of Middle English which was popular during his time. In THE CANTERBURY TALES he used the device of having a diverse group of people tell two tales each while traveling together on a pilgrimage from London to Canterbury, the location of the Shrine of St. Thomas A' Becket.Almost every social type of the fourteenth century is represented among the pilgrims such as a knight, lawyer, doctor, cook, miller, nun, merchant, monk, priest, squire and several others. Chaucer is also one of the pilgrims. Readers will recognize many of the characters as being reminiscent of their twenty-first century contemporaries. The physician, for instance, loves gold and makes a lot of money during times of pestilence.

Being a Medevial book of litererary renown written in poetic language, and a book about people on, well, a holy piligramage, I expected it to be more nurturing to the soul.If you ask me, it is no better than a late-night television cartoon written in a deceptively intelligent language and given a medevial setting There is nothing really noteworthy about the plot, and while its characters were colorful at times (in the case of, say, the Wife of Bath) they were the most assembled from stereotypical moulds (for instance, the Knight.) Many of the stories were choppily done, in fact, a few of them were left half-way unfinished, which was highly annoying. There is no sense of real momentum at all, as it is merely a bunch of randomly assorted short stories that have no connection to eachother and rarely possess deep meanings, and most of the stories are morally disgusting.Really, the book has little purpose other than to give the occasional thrill if you ask me, though I suppose it does achieve something in introducing the unlearned to more vile and double-dealing aspects of human nature (wether or not that is necessary is arguable.) Even the Nun's story had stupid thing against it- the Jews connive to kill a little boy, and in the end \\"are all put in jail.\\" I'm not even talking about Jewish characters, the author just put \\"The Jews.\\" The only truly inspiring story I could think of is the Second Nun's, or perhaps the Knight's. For the most part, it wasn't highly intelligent or spiritual reading at all.The Rainbow Side:It was highly entertaining to read, for the most part. A lot of the stories have a interesting details and storylines (such as the lavish Knight's tale and the expressively ridiculous Wive's tale). By saying that the book had little plot, I meant the book as a whole. Quite of a few of the stories did have good twists and turns. A great deal of their entertainment value, of course, came from their lack of morality. They are replete with who men who switch beds with other men's wives and old men who marry young girls who deceive the old men and lay with younger men.

Though I have read my Everyman's Library version so many times I can repeat many sections word for word, I also own Nevill Coghill's translation and it is delightful. It is one of the best translations of the book which I have read. I, of course, would suggest reading it in Middle English, but if you are frusturated or confused by the language then I would recommend this translation. It sticks closely to the feeling that you get from Chaucer's original text. I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because the Middle English version will always hold the number one spot in my heart."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"In the Nun's Priease Tale, Chaucer utters the most startingly 4 words constructed: Beware of the sycophant!

Chaucer was set with the task of creating tales told by \\"nine and twenty\\" people, and although these tales were never completed, the edition we do have is quite enjoyable. These twenty-nine characters, from the knight to the pardoner, describe everyday occupations during the medieval period. Chaucer uses sharp wit and occasional dirty humor to emphasize the moral lessons each tale teaches. Not only do the tales themselves teach us, but the characters that tell them. Chaucer has been brilliant to create the exalted knight, gentle prioress, rowdy miller, lively squire, and more! If you want to experience such an absorbing classic you must read it yourself!"},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"I enjoy the translation. I think it's ideal for the classroom.

I look forward to reading the other tales independently. For all who like to have people raise their eyebrows as they see you reading such a prestigious sounding book (which, unlike Shakespeare, requires little explanation if you are familiar with the times) you should look into this work. Chaucer does an excellent job hiding sub-plots within the compelling tales. This is a classic which I will read without being forced to by my own will for a 4.0 GPA :-). Its clever rhyming scheme keeps interest during the slower spots (which are few and far between). All of the pilgrims can be easily related to and represent real problems in society during Chaucer's time.

Then, when you finally figured it out, it was something maybe KIND OF funny, in a satirical yet also juvenile way.

In The Wife of Bath, the portrayal of women is extremely controversial. The question of whether Chaucer was a misogynist or supported women's liberation is a passionately discussed topic. Based upon Chaucer's various portrayals of women, he was not a male chauvinist who desired superiority over women. Chaucer portrayed women through his opinion as an Englishman in Medieval England, where the common view was that women were subordinate to men. This is seen in the Wife of Bath's contradictory personality as well as the characters of her tale.To understand the importance of feminist criticism, it is important to know what it is and stands for. Feminist literary criticism is the term for analyzing literary works through the examination of female points of view, concerns, and values in comparison with the time period and culture. In Mary Wollenstonecraft's A Vindication of the Rights Women, she asserts the observation \\"Women, I argue from analogy, are degraded by the same propensity to enjoy the present moment; and, at last, despise the freedom which they have not sufficient virtue to struggle to attain.\\" One of the primary purposes of feminist literary criticism is concerned with \\"uncovering the contingencies of gender\\" as a cultural, social, and political system and instrument of domination. (Jehlen) Meaning, that their goal is uncover any iniquities placed upon women due to cultural setting, political standpoints, or social foundations.Although there are immutable biological differences between men and women, these differences create various social differences in different societies. One society may be completely different than another, at least in their treatment of the separation of gender. Also, in a patriarchal society, such as England in Chaucer's time, the separation of gender involves more than just social differences, but also the idea that sexual differences are the same as sexual inequality (. Rigby) It is inequitable to be judgmental of Chaucer and his views of women, as anti-feministic as they are, because Chaucer was from a completely different social construct and historical time period.Through Chaucer's Wife of Bath, as well as the characters in her tale, he portrays various views of women within Chaucer's time. He represents women as unchaste and unruly in the Wife of Bath, Dame Alice. He also depicts women as helpless and overlooked in the raped maiden of The Wife of Bath's Tale. The queen within the tale is shown as gracious. However, the women questioned by the knight portray a sense of only worldly desire. The old woman shows the wisdom of women, although it seems that she is submitting herself to her husband, she has control over him.His portrayal of Dame Alice is the antithesis of the stereotype for women in Chaucer's time. She was not pure an innocent, as she confessed that \\"I won't remain altogether chaste\\" Alice was not submissive to each of her husbands, she chose to rule over them. She strikes fear into the town and its parish to the point where she gets and does whatever she wants. The fear and respect the town has for her is seen in lines 459-463 of the General Prologue: \\"In all the parish not a dame dared stir, Towards the altar steps in front of her, And if indeed they did, so wrath was she as to be quite put out of charity\\" The Wife becomes such a powerful feministic force, at times, by being able to masquerade around town with the qualities and luxuries of being a man and appears to be so happy not following the typical and stereotypical roles set for women at her time and throughout most of history. The Wife of Bath is a zealous woman who freely admits to all the lust, the conniving and the egocentricity that defines her. Dame Alice has radical views about women and their position within a marriage, especially for a time when women were expected to be passive within a marriage. This direct opposition to previously set roles for women is what defines her character.However, the Wife of Bath, while seemingly an example of feminism in all of her qualities, is actually inconsistent with herself.. She is, instead, a mockery of herself. The Wife of Bath is inconsistent in her belief structure. While, at times, she claims to be able to beguile her husbands into doing whatever she wants, creating a view of herself as strong and independent, she often gave into what her husband would want. She freely admits that men are far more intelligent than women appear to be in lines 440-442 of her Prologue \\"One of us two must give in, without a doubt; / And since a man is more reasonable/ than woman is, youmust be patient \\"Nevertheless, since I know your pleasure I'll satisfy your physical pleasure\\". In this quote the Wife of Bath not only concedes that men are more reasonable than women, but also that a good woman and wife will do and give up whatever is necessary for her husband to be satisfied. If the Wife had really been what she appeared to be externally, she would not have admitted that men, in a general stereotype, could contain more reason and intelligence than women could. This quotation leaves an unanswered contradiction about the Wife of Bath. Chaucer easily contradicts the Wife of Bath by showing and telling more personal sides of the Wife of Bath and thus proves her to be much more of a hypocrite and much less of a archaic feminist then originally thought. The Wife also diminishes herself, and all women, by explaining that all women can be bought, in lines 413-417 of her Prologue. \\"And Therefore I tell every man this truth,/ Let whoever can, win, for everything is for sale,/ With an empty hand men cannot lure hawks,/ For a price I would endure his lust,/ And make myself a pretend appetite\\" The other travelers within The Canterbury Tales also accept her as a rebellion of women's position. The Pardoner requests that the Wife teach them. This also defies biblical and cultural standings on women's positions, as teachers, that they are not to teach over them, as explained in 1 Timothy 2:11-12 of the Judeo-Christian Bible.The Wife of Bath also reverses the roles of Husband and Wife in some of her descriptions of her marriage, as in lines 154-159 of the Wife's Prologue:\\"A Husband I will have, I will not desist, / Who shall be both my debtor and my slave, / And have his troubles along with it/ Upon his flesh while I am his wife, / I have the authority all my life/ Over his body and not he\\"She is dictating that she will have total control over herself, her husband, and their household, contradictorily to cultural and biblical standards, as discussed by C.S. Lewis in his work \`Mere Christianity', \\"The function of the husband is to see that this natural preference if hers is not giving its head. He has the last word to protect the other people from the intense family patriotism of the wife\\" The Wife sees the relationship between men and women as a battle in which it is crucial to gain the upper hand. She uses tactics, which were seen as the only stereotypical form of defense for women: sexuality, duplicity, and vulnerability. Her armor was indeed necessary. Medieval England presented women as second class citizens, viewed as goods and chattels, with no financial independence. They were often beaten, and it is clearly in the Wife's nature to protect herself. She uses weapons like her sexuality and her youth to make her husbands suffer, so much so that they feel impotent. This weapon was highly effective with first three husbands who she managed to dominate, \`But since I had them completely in my hand' and they handed over all of his land and property as she withheld sex in order to get her own way with them.The Wife also used a weapon of deceit and she claims that women have this weapon from birth. She tells her audience that she would deliberately pickarguments and accuse her husbands of the very sins she herself is guilty of, because she admits that attack is the best form of defense. The Wife claims that all the other wives are better treated than herself, and commonly uses her weapon of nagging. She accuses her husbands of being cheap, complaining about extravagance of the neighboring women. She easily attains power over her first three husbands in this way, as they usually submitted for the sake of peace, as she notes, \`They were most happy when I spoke fairly to them,/ For God knows I nagged them spitefully./ The Wife ruled over her husbands.The maid in The Wife of Bath was a small character role, and yet her fleeting moment in the story is extremely important. The characteristics of this woman seem to have the ability to go to all women. She is vulnerable and innocent, as she is still a maiden. The only thing known about this woman is that she was overpowered by the knight and severely taken advantage of. \\"From which maid at once, in spite of her protests,/ By sheer force he stole her maidenhood\\" This example of male domination within a tale is not atypical. Chaucer shows women's weakness in her.In the Queen, Chaucer shows the graciousness of women, as fickle as it might appear. Despite the fact that the Queen knows of the wrongdoing of this man, she begs for his life. It is ironic that she, a woman, is fighting for this man's life after what he had done to another woman.The various women that the knight questioned provide insight as to what Chaucer thought about women. The majority of the answers that the knight acquired were monetary or tangible, such as money, fine clothes, lust, or beauty. Once the idea that women \\"take we great delight/ in being considered dependable and trustworthy. / and able to hold steadfastly to one purpose, / and not betray things men tell us\\" However, this idea, which was the only virtuous answer was quickly dismissed because it was allegedly \\"not worth a rake handle\\" It was not plausible for a woman to be considered virtuous, which is ironic, since being virtuous was the feminine stereotype.The old woman, which gave the knight the correct answer, shows the wisdom of women. She required the knight to pledge his honor to her before she revealed the answer. This was wise of her; it caused the knight to base his later decisions on everything he stood for. She was foul and haggard in appearance. The knight was excruciatingly upset at the fact that he needed to marry her due to her appearance, age, and class.Women were portrayed in various different ways, through the Wife of Bath as well as the characters of her tale. Chaucer did not hold any animosity against women or strongly desire to subdue them, he merely believed what he knew, which was female subordination within his society."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"Why did I think this rendition of The Cantebury Tales was translated into modern English? It is the second of three items purchased from Amazon, and a second disappointment. Perhaps I should not shop online.

Interesting thoughts though."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"Disclaimer: This refers to the print version of the product in original middle English, with occasional margin translations. There seems to have been a product crossover between this and a modern English tape.Having read the Canterbury Tales I think Shakespeare, the \\"canonical\\" classic English writer, does not compare to Chaucer. The Canterbury Tales are so extensive, whimsical and vibrant that I they should overturn Shakespeare as the celebrated English texts.Chaucer presents us with an entire universe - the England of his time. Over a dozen people from all walks of life tell their tales, women and men, rich and poor, criminal and saintly. Reading the Tales is like reading a textbook on medieval England, but one that's come to life and had been soaked with the warmth of Chaucer. He mocks any and all aspects of society and is not above toilet humour - but for me this hardly detracted from the work, instead making it more real and unelitist. In fact it is largely due to Chaucer and his unelitist use of the vernacular English that the movement of using the language of the people for literature started.Of course there are difficulties. The work is in Middle English. But please please please don't read a \\"translation\\" into Modern English! The original is so musical, so understandable that the extra effort in decoding does not compare to how it appears. I'd imagine a translation to be very flat unless the translator was almost divinely inspired. Chaucer's language is not that difficult, just read aloud and phonetically and follow the rhythm and rhyme of the verse. This will make most words easy to understand.Some tales (esp. the 2 prose tales) have been considered boring by many readers. Still, get an edition like this that includes them all. In Chaucer's overview of England, you won't find everything interesting. You won't laugh at all the jokes, some of the humour will be lost on us all through the 6+ centuries separating us and him. Sometimes he will be overbearing, pompous, dogmatic. But as a whole, the work still does an amazing job at describing medieval life: in terms of satire, language, poetry and meaning."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"I read Chaucer's \\"Canterbury Tales\\" in Middle English in college. I also read them in a paperback version that \\"updated\\" the language. Both versions were a lot of fun to read -- I say \\"fun\\" even though reading such a long tale from so long ago in poetic form isn't easy. Still, I was very impressed with the way Chaucer told his story. I confess I was awed that a writer from 700 years ago could frame his tale around a long journey and people it with specific characters, each of them very, very real, from how they looked to how they spoke. On top of that, I was impressed with the way each traveler's chosen tale revealed something about that particular traveler: the Miller's Tale could not be told by the Prioress, for example, or vice versa. Each tale said something about the values of each teller.I don't know how the versions I read relate to this particular \\"translation.\\" My review is really about \\"The Canterbury Tales\\" themselves, not about this particular edition.

I will say that they did bring the stories to life, and I have vivid images from listening to their renditions.Recording: Not great. This is the fourth audio CD I've gotten from Naxos, and usually their quality is terrific. This one, however, is so soft, and the levels vary so much, that it was almost impossible for me to listen to it in the car--which was the reason I got it. If you're buying audio recordings for a commute, sadly, I can't recommend this one. The readers would sometimes drop to whispers, and the recording engineers couldn't/didn't adjust, making some of the dialogue absolutely inaudible.

I highly recommend it!*****"},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"I recieved this book on time and in excellent condition. I'd definitely recommend this seller."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"Had wanted to read this for about 15 years, but it's funny how more books are published and then you have to read them? How 'bout that? This book has been out six centuries, so I guessed another 15 years would not hurt me. Chaucer's facility with language, his ability to rhyme, his familiarity with the human condition, and his ability to link the human conditions to elements of people's trades and careers at this time truly make this book one which paved the way for many other satires, multi-person narratives, and rich, nuanced tales of particular events at particular times.This book is endlessly satisfying. I found Chaucer's poetry to be very intelligent, with allusions to the work of the day, to cultural references, to fashion, to religious beliefs, to prominent figures in the world at that time, and most of all, to allowing his imagination not to be limited by expectations on the limits of his writing. The stories in the book come via the relating of experiences told by travelers on their way to Canterbury. At times, the stories are considered too dry or too preposterous or perhaps they are too derivative. But Chaucer imbues the multiple characters, the minister's wife, the metalworker, the barrister, the civil servant, with characters who respond as mentioned to stories, if the stories are not seen to be up to scratch. Many of the stories concern sexual hijinx. Some concern convoluted family relations, some concern work concerns. Chaucer's currency with the lives and ways of many in 14th century England make the book rich and satisfying. He was a master poet and it seemed that Chaucer enjoyed spinning these tales for the more privileged who would have read this book at first. It is not surprising, however, that the book has remained current. The interests, themes, and topics from which Chaucer very ably spins his tales remain relevant today."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"The Canterbury Tales is so appealing due to it's diverseness. Chaucer was involved with every level of society during his time. This is shown with how the characters are so well-rounded. The short, but insightful description of the travelers is also helpful in picturing this group riding on thier way to the shrine of Becket. A great book everyone should read, but one of those you have to be in the mood for.

A storytelling contest between pilgrims on their way to Canterbury. This is probably the best translation I have read. It does have some downfalls the author excluded some of the tales including the Parson's tale which is actually meant to be a conclusion(Chaucer died before he could finish the tales). Other than that the book is very good. It does break some myths and sterotypes we have about people of that time and some of the stroies are rather humorous and could still be considered humorous in todays society."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"This version of the Canterbury Tales (Everyman) contains all of the tales (including the rather tedious prose tales), and is in the original language. As anyone planning to read the Tales will be aware, old English is not easy! This book takes a lot of time to read. Is it worth it?Yes. But a qualified yes. As an insight into life during this time in history, and particularly as a demonstration of how little humans have changed over the centuries, this book is very useful. Many of the tales are quite amusing and interesting. On the other hand, many tales are filled with rather drawn out, tedious sections, and a couple are just plain boring.For a person who wishes to read most of the major English classics, this book must be read, and I think the only way to really appreciate it is in its original form, not in modernised English. For this purpose, the Everyman version is excellent, as it features convenient gloss on each page, so looking up difficult words can be done at a glance, which disturbs the flow a lot less. I would highly recommend trying to read the book in as short a space of time as possible, though, because you do get used to the grammar and vocabulary, and while it is fresh in your mind, it allows you to read the rest of the book with a lot less glossing.Be aware that I read this book for personal interest, not as part of any particular course, so I am reviewing from the point of view of a general reader, not a literary scholar."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"I strongly commend the Hieatts' excellent contemporary translation of Chaucer's greatest contribution to English literature. It is coupled with a copy of the original Middle English text. I found all the tales quite engrossing; it's hard for me to say which I liked best. I concur with previous reviewers who have said Chaucer should be read by all. Truly if one wishes to understand how English became an important literary language, then the best place to start is by reading Chaucer's &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot;."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"In the General Prologue of The Canterbury Tales, the descriptions of religious characters resemble some of Boccaccio's characters, in the sense that a pious title and appearance does not make a pious person. The characters with holy occupations run the full spectrum of good and evil. The Prioress and the Monk are benign characters, with mostly harmless vices and tendencies. The Prioress attempts to be dainty and \\"to counterfeit a courtly kind of grace\\" (6). The Monk is described as a \\"fat and personable priest\\" who enjoys hunting and eating to the scholarly life in cloister (8).The first corrupt pilgrim we meet is the Friar, who \\"knew the taverns well in every town / And every inkeeper and barmaid too / Better than lepers, beggars, and that crew\\" (9). For a fee, the Friar grants confessions. He avoids the downtrodden in favor of the wealthy and \\"anywhere a profit might accrue\\" (9).Unlike the Friar, the Parson is the ideal country priest, living by example. He is poor \\"Yet he was rich in holy thought and work\\" (16). \\"Holy and virtuous was he, but then / Never contemptuous of sinful men\\" (17). Along with the Parson rides his brother, the Plowman, also an honest worker who lives by the Gospel: \\"he would help the poor / For love of Christ and never take a penny\\" (17).The Summoner rides with the Pardoner, and neither is described as a good man. With a pustular face, the Summoner scares children. He is \\"hot and lecherous as a sparrow\\" (20). His job gives him power over the diocese, since he summons people for excommunication. The Pardoner carries relics with him, and makes his money by selling \\"Our Lady's Veil\\" and a \\"gobbet of the sail\\" of St. Peter's boat (22). A salesman and a charlatan, the Pardoner reminds us of Brother Cipolla in Boccaccio's sixth day, tenth story.The pilgrims rationalize their weaknesses with their beliefs. The Wife of Bath says that Jesus \\"spoke to those that would live perfectly, / And by your leave, my lords, that's not for me\\" (261). Controlled by passion, she \\"never used discretion when in love / But ever followed on my appetite\\" (275). She quotes Paul's teaching to justify her many marriages.The Wife of Bath is not the only one grappling with the scripture to justify her behavior. Even Chaucer at the end makes a retraction of the text, possibly because of his personal faith or to prevent a backlash. In the final page, he prays \\"that Christ have mercy on me and forgive me my sins\\" (489). His retraction contains similarities to the \\"Author's Conclusion\\" in The Decameron. If his readers enjoy the tales, Chaucer urges them to praise God. If they were displeased with the tales, he invites them to blame his ability as a writer. He lists his body of work, retracting it all. However, as clever as Chaucer proves to be in the previous 480 pages, this list seems more like an advertisement than a renouncement."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"This is a very enjoyable reading of The Canterbury Tales, rendered into modern English verse.

Please note that this version is Chaucer in the original Middle English, with easily accessible side notes and foot notes. This version is actually preferable to the Riverside Chaucer and the Norton Critical edition for simply reading and enjoying Chaucer in his original language. The Everyman's library edition is NOT a translation, and includes ALL the tales (unlike the Norton ed.). It's worthwhile reading Chaucer in the original Middle English, despite the difficulty for a modern reader, because of the beauty of the poetry, which can't be translated. The Everyman's edition is the easiest to use, as all the footnotes and glosses are complete and easily accessible on the same page with the text, not in back as with other editions. This edition is hardbound yet affordable and will last several lifetimes.If there were ever a \\"desert island book,\\" Chaucer's Canterbury Tales is it. His story-telling ability is without parallel, and his poetry is magnificent, even better than Shakespeare, which, of course, is not a completely fair comparison, since Middle English is a more musical language than Modern English. Compare, for example, the sound of Italian to the sound of modern English, and you'll know what I'm talking about. Check out, for starters, the Pardoner's Prologue and Tale (the basis for Bogart's Treasure of the Sierra Madre), the Nun's Priest's Tale, and the incomparable Wife of Bath's Prologue and Tale. Chaucer's Tales cover a wide tonal range, from hilarious farce, to mock-heroic, satirical, bawdy, to horrific, autobiographical, to High Chivalric and so on. Together they form a literary encyclopedia of Medieval life, history, and culture.Note: Amazon rather confusingly lumps together all the Canterbury Tales reviews for translations, partial editions, and etc."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"This version of the Canterbury Tales in modern English is brilliant. Nonetheless I was deeply disappointed in finding that the Parson's Tale was omitted completely, the reason being that &quot;it does not interest the general public&quot;. I disagree with such a sweeping statement."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"The paperback version has the original text of the tales on the left hand page and the modern translation on the right. The publisher does not provide any cues in formatting of the Kindle edition to show difference between the original text and the modern. The two texts run together making reading almost impossible."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"Most people probably associate \\"The Canterbury Tales\\" with stuffy hoary old English professors and musty craggy libraries. It doesn't help that many english classes assign the Middle English text to students. Though the original language of the Tales doesn't present insurmountable difficulties for the modern English reader, many may find the task daunting nonetheless and completely miss out on all of the good stuff. This edition presents the tales in modern verse (while still maintaining the rhyming couplet form of the original). Numerous footnotes also illuminate the vocabulary of Chaucer's time (he worked on the tales from around 1387 up to his death in 1400).The tales trace the path of a group of pilgrims from the \\"The Tabard\\" Inn in Southwark, England to just outside the town of Canterbury. A host of interesting 14th century characters all agree to ride to the shrine of the martyr together. The host of the Inn decides to join them and makes things interesting with a contest: the person that tells the best tale along the way gets a free supper upon their return. The rest of the book then consists of twenty-four tales (Chaucer had planned over two hundred, but never finished the project) each told by a specific person linked by comments of the company. Thanks to his position as a foreign diplomat, Chaucer probably found inspiration from Bocaccio's \\"Decameron\\" (written around 1350) in the structure of this work.In the tales themselves, the culture of 14th century England comes alive. Not only that, great stories unfold. The Knight's tale, one of the longest, explores painful medieval love. Two brothers, Arcite and Palamon, in ancient Greece spot a beautiful woman, Emily, from their jail cell. They both declare their undying love for her, and vouch their lives to winning her hand. And since both men want her the two of course turn from loyal brothers into mortal enemies. With some strange luck and the help of the gods, one of them eventually triumphs.Some of the pilgrims don't get along too well. The Miller and the Reeve almost attack each other after hurling insults back and forth. The Miller tells a hilarious tale about Nicholas the Gallant who wants to sleep with an old carpeter's young gorgeous wife. He convinces the old man that another flood (akin to Noah's) is pending, and that he should sleep in a bathtub on top of his house. The old man buys the story, and Nicholas sets to his task. Another wooer of the young woman disrupts the couple, and ends up a victim of flatulence (but the giver of the stink ends up even worse). Since the carpenter was depicted as a fool in the tale, and the Reeve is a carpenter, he counter attacks with a tale about a stupid miller.The tales weave incredibly diverse stories. Some end in tragedy (e.g., the Physician's Tale in which a noble Knight must choose between turning his beautiful virtuous daughter over to a corrupt and lecherous judge or killing her out of respect for her honor), some in comedy. Others relate miracles or demonstrate a simple moral point. Yet others show the prejudices of the time, (the Prioress' Tale contains some nasty anti-semitism) or the fashions of the time (the Canon's Yeoman's Tale declares alchemy a fraud). At least one has a surprising feminist bent (The Wife of Bath's Tale, although 14th century values ultimately win out). Some of the more comical characters are the wards of the 14th century Church: the Pardoner, the Summoner, the Friar, and the Monk. All of them get depicted as hopelessly corrupt and hypocritical (in that they don't practice what they preach while having scruples about profiting from their church offices; corruption in the church was a fiery issue of the day).Two of the original prose tales, Chaucer's tale of Melibee and the Parson's tale, only appear in summary here. Chaucer's first tale gets rudely interrupted by the host who complains that \\"Your dreary rhyming isn't worth a turd!\\" Whether the character called \\"Chaucer\\" (the narrator in many sections) actually represented Chaucer himself remains controversial. The Parson's tale, the last in this book, reflects on the Seven Deadly Sins. Chaucer's \\"Retraction\\" appears directly afterwards. In this he excuses himself for any sin he may have committed in this book. So are the Canturbury tales supposed to be meditations on the sinful and sinless life? Since Chaucer didn't complete the project such questions remain somewhat speculatory (also, Chaucer didn't actually write most of the tales himself - this is a collection of tales mosty from other sources in the manner popular at the time - but he did rewrite them with his own vision in mind). What the Canterbury Tales ended up as, nonetheless, is a collection of romantic, baudy, raucous, tragic, and vastly entertaining stories that gorgeously reflect and effectively evoke Chaucer's times. This, maybe more than anything, helps explain why the book has seen continual publication since the fifteenth century."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"Every English-speaker should read Chaucer. As Dante did for Italian, Chaucer did for English - making the English vernacular an accepted language to write literature with, standardizing usages by inspiring imitation, and making up or adopting literally hundreds upon hundreds of words into the language. Chaucer is where old English ends and Middle English begins.This translated version is okay if you just want to get the story out of the tales, but if you find you like Chaucer even the smallest bit I would strongly urge you to try reading the original Middle English. It honestly is not all that hard if you give it any effort at all and you will be richly rewarded - Chaucer's poetry is simply breathtaking. This translation is decent, but know that you are missing half the show."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"If you've ever considered reading this quintessential Chaucer classic in the original Middle English, don't. Read this version instead (unless you just happen to be really into Middle English). Neville Coghill does a masterful job of bringing the text into a form that is easily absorbed by the modern reader. The narrative flows smoothly in an inobtrusive meter, yet retains all the charm of the original version and enough of the old vocabulary to lose none of Chaucer's intended flavor. Helpful endnotes are sprinkled throughout to offer explanations of some of the more obscure allusions.As to the substance of the text itself, what can one say? The story is straightforward: a motley band of unforgettable characters from every walk of English society, brought together on pilgrimage, and entertaining themselves along the way with a friendly contest about who can spin the most rousing tale. Their offerings range from the noble to the cynical, the bawdy to the pious, and all shades in between. If you've never experienced the richness of The Canterbury Tales, this translation is an excellent choice. Heck, it's an excellent choice even if you have read it before. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"Having tried to wade through a \\"non-modern english\\" version of The Canterbury Tales, I appreciate this book. It brings out Chaucer's playful language in a way that's more entertaining, because it's easier to understand. Re-reading some of the stories in this book, I was surprised by beautiful statements, amusing turns of phrase, and the sheer bawdiness of his writing.However, I gave this book three stars first becuase I don't put Chaucer on a level with Spenser or Malory, and second because this is a standard Penguin book, which means it's more stripped down than I like. I prefer footnotes to explain references that I might not be able to take in context. In something as heavily alligorical as Chaucer's work, I believe this is very important."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"Alle that I can saye Is that these booke hath Mayde my daye Goode! Verye verye goode!"},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"Beware of editions by General Books LLCThey produce books by scanning (OCR) copyright-free material, but without any editing.There are so many errors though that the result may be unusable.Usability probably depends on subject matter, but the many OCR-errors make even prose an annoying read.Especially mathematical and technical texts and texts with notes can become completely garbled.See the review of J.M. Keynes' \\"A treatise on probability\\" on this site which I bought but is useless, and similar comments by other buyers (on \\"Vanity Fair\\" by Thackeray; on \\"The Italian\\" by Radcliffe)"},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"In Chaucer's work, 'The Canterbury Tales', perhaps the greatest of English literary works from the period of the language known as Middle English, there is one particular piece that have always stood out for me.'A Clerk ther was of Oxenford also,'This is perhaps my favourite character, as when I first read it, it seemed to epitomise what I hoped for in my own life.'That unto logik hadde longe y-go.....For him was lever have at his beddes heedTwenty bokes, clad in blak or reed,Of Aristotle and his philosophye,Than robes riche, of fithele, or gay sautrye,But al be that he was a philosophre,Yet hadde he but litel gold in cofre,But al that he mighte of his freendes hente,On bokes and on lerninge he it spente,and bisily gan for the soules preyeOf hem that yaf him wherwith to scoleye........gladly wolde he lerne, and gladly teche.'Every now and then I cannot help but re-read this part of the Prologue, for a reminder of what I'm aiming for in my own life.Chaucer was son of a wine merchant, something near and dear to my heart. Chaucer was well-read, well-phrased, well-mannered, industrious in literary and legal/administrative pursuits, as I trust I will become, if not already so qualified.As one can see from the above examples, English has changed much over the past 600 years, but not so much as to make these passages unrecognisable. Compare for yourself with a modern translation, and see how much you can decipher.Chaucer is one of the first great English authors of name; most (but not all) literary output in English prior to this time was anonymous. Living in the 1300s, he held administrative posts of importance under Kings from the time of Edward III to Henry IV. Never one to shrink from spending too much money (he had to reapply for pensions and ask for advances several times in his life) or shying away from controversy (he fell out of and came back into favour several times). When he died, he was laid to rest in Westminster Abbey, in a section on the south side that has since become Poet's Corner, largely due to Chaucer, the first great English poet, having been buried there.In addition to his magnus opus, 'The Canterbury Tales', a collection of stories with prologue told by pilgrims on their journey to Canterbury (car radios and in-flight movies were rare in those days), Chaucer wrote minor poems to suit various occasions (his first record as poet comes from having written a poem as elegy on the death of John of Gaunt's first wife, Blanche, in 1369), and the major work for which he was noted for 'Troilus and Criseyde', which showed his sense of humour, power of observation and attention to detail, and keen dramatic skills in language. This work is often compared to Dante and Boccaccio, perhaps the most famous poets of the day. 'The Canterbury Tales' is actually intended to be much longer - 120 tales told by 30 pilgrims (two each on the way to Canterbury, and two each returning). As it is, there are only 24 tales plus a prologue - had it been completed, it would be by far the longest poem in the English language.There is a strong, practical side to Chaucer's writing, sophisticated yet not aloof and removed from the affairs of the world, cultured yet in tune with the better (and more interesting) aspects of the common people, too.This edition by A. Kent Hieatt and Constance Hieatt is designed for those who want the major portions of the Canterbury Tales. Be advised, this is not a complete or annotated set, and the translations from Middle English to modern idiom, while good, do not come with notes to explain possible choices and phrases. This is a book to give the flavour of the major stories, and is designed for readers who want the story rather than the details. As a Bantam book, it is designed for the undergraduate or general reader, and serves this audience well.For those who want the Canterbury Tales in basic form, this might well be the volume to get."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"...combines reviews. One person reviews the CD version of the book, while another reviews a modern interpretation of the middle english. I am here to review the book at hand, which is \\"Canterbury Tales\\" by Geoffrey Chaucer, published by Everyman's library.First off, the book is complete, and rendered in middle English, so it is not for the faint of heart. Notes are given in the margins, although these generally seem useless (if you read the book aloud, you will understand most of the phrases they \\"translate\\", even though your eyes won't believe what your mouth just spoke). Of far greater value are the footnotes to many of the lines, which render in a modern sense some of the more obscure greetings, curses, idioms, etc. the reader is likely to find. Unfortunately, looking down at the footnotes will break your rhythm, and it can be difficult to find your place again, with so many unfamiliar words staring at you. I wish the editors(presenters?) would have put THESE footnotes in the margins, instead of the simpler fare found there (however, I understand that some people may not read the book as easily as I did).The work itself seems complete, however, although I am no scholar of Chaucer. Even the Parson's Tale is found here (it is deleted in many works, since it is little more than a maudlin sermon), although I would skip it if I were you. The poetry is incredibly pleasing to the ear, if offensive to the eye; I cannot stress enough that one should read the book aloud to hear its greatness.I won't review the work, since I feel I have no right to criticise Chaucer. However, the presentation here is good, with the exception of the footnote problem. While this edition is not for the faint of heart (it takes real work to read), I would recommend it to anyone who wants to actually hear the words Chaucer heard in his own head as he wrote this."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"This is not easy to read in Kindle format. In paperback, it has two translations: one in Middle English, the other in Modern English. These are displayed side by side, with the earlier English on the left, Modern on the right. When it comes to the Kindle edition, there are no breaks between these translations. It switches back and forth without any notice, making it really difficult to follow. It would be alright if we could view it page by page (in it's original format), but without that option it's harder to understand. (Yes, it's obvious which part is which, but finding where it stops and starts takes away from the reading experience. It's too choppy.)In short, buy the paperback or perhaps a different Kindle edition. The format makes this a challenge to read."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"Wonderful to hear the characters in this great work of literature. The voices are just right for the essence of each story to come through. Having the particular tale written on the disc would be helpful."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"Obviously intended for first time readers of Chaucer, there are only four tales and their prologues. But the selections are winning, and Barbara Cohen's telling, which reduces Chaucer's Middle English to charming fairytale language is well done.Equally effective are the color illustrations by Trina Schart Hyman.Not having seen William Blake's 1809 illustration of Canterbury Tales, I was surprised and disappointed to see he only did one illustration (the pilgrims leaving the Tabard Tavern for their journey to Canterbury), and Ms Hyman has him beat a mile. She even makes some of the implicit elements of the stories refreshingly clear.Take, for example, the illustration in the Pardoner's Tale of the three rogues discovering gold coins under the tree. They had left an alehouse in search of Death, who had just killed a friend of theirs, and had met a withered old man on the road. With great insolence, they insulted, accused, and threatened him if he would not tell they where they could find Death. The old man directs them to a tree in a grove.Ms Hyman, in her illustration, shows the old man was really Death in disguise. He is now the frightening figure behind the tree, with the skull face and his walking stick now the grim reaper's scythe. A brilliant touch!"},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"I love the Canterbury Tales. Normally, I'd just leave it at that, but I can't this time. I love the Tales' crudeness, their humor, crass, sleaze, love, pain, morals and sheer entertainment value. This is one of the best translations from Middle English I've read. I particularly liked the bit of history and guide to reading Middle English presented in the introduction."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"It makes me sad that Oprah's books have a billion reviews ... and this one has 15. What is this world coming to?Bah, anyway, this book is fantastic. In every sense of the word. I laughed, I scoffed, I yelled, I mused. Every story was different and fun. Every story kept me wanting more. I never imagined I would enjoy this book as much as I did. Great writing and great translation."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales","review":"Although the original version is somewhat difficult reading given that it was a poetic narrative in middle english this version is accessible to the average reader.The book is a collection of tales told by a group of travellers on their way to Canterbury. Each tale has some moral underpinning and develops themes of courtly love, morality and corruption of the religious establishments.The book is rife with symbolism especially in the description of garments facial features and scenery.Some of the tales are so tawdry that Danielle Steele would blush.Regardless, the book was very amusing and explored problems many of us face daily."},{"Title":"Divine Things: Seeking the Sacred in a Secular Age","review":"Robert Kirschner has done a wonderful job with this collection of essays that focus on the Divine Things that exist in our everyday lives. His enthusiastic writing style is reminiscent of Heschel, this is one of those books that you just can't put down.Kirschner is a wonderful storyteller, his examples are sentimental, without being over-the-top, they speak to your heart and make you think. Reading this book is akin to having a conversation with a loved grandparent, these are wonderful stories with deep meaning that give your soul comfort.Every day we are surrounded by Divine Things, we just need to open our eyes to see them. Reading Robert Kirschner's book would be an excellent way to start. It is simply superb."},{"Title":"Divine Things: Seeking the Sacred in a Secular Age","review":"I approached the reading of Divine Things with a degree of trepidation because I tend to avoid \\"religious\\" topics when choosing reading material. The other reviews of this book were spot on, I am so glad I got this bookPart of my coming of age included the reading of \\"The Prophet\\" by Kahlil Gibran. Of course, it spoke to me at the time and I felt improved for having read it. However, the impact of that book pales in comparison to the impact that Kirschner's book has had on me. I can't stop thinking about it, I want everyone to read it.The essay format is a perfect vehicle for Kirschner's elegant prose which is wonderfully punctuated with historic and Biblical detail. Each chapter deals with a subject which writers of lesser skill have used as a platform from which to proselytize, judge, or dispatch a lot of \\"you shoulds\\". None of that here. Kirschner is humble yet willing to take a stand, always softly, on the tough questions. I found myself admiring him for having the temerity to contemplate the perennial issues, evaluate them thoroughly and deliver to us readily digestible morsels of food for thought.You will be glad that you read this book---it is truly a gift that keeps on giving."},{"Title":"Divine Things: Seeking the Sacred in a Secular Age","review":"I agree that this is a terrific book. Each chapter of the book is just a few pages long. That's long enough for Kirschner to tell the story well, but short enough to keep the message simple and straightforward. The chapters aren't sermons -- they don't tell you what you should do. They are more like short inspirational messages. Kirschner paints a picture and lets you think about it. I have given this book as a gift to a number of friends who are not religious but appreciate the spiritual aspect of life. I highly recommend it for its content and its wonderful, elegant writing style."},{"Title":"How to Write a Research Report, Grades 3-6","review":"If you have no idea how to write research report, read this book and you will have a basic concept how to start.

There was little selection remaining. It was a 5 dollar a bagfull of books deal. I tossed this book in just for kicks.Its a very easy &amp; short book, 110 small pages to be exact. I believe in the oneness of religion. I believe in &quot;christianity&quot; but do not limit myself to that. I have come to realize this through the Baha'i faith. The founders of other religions have been just as true manifestations of God.I know alot about religions, but I barely knew anything about Hinduism other than a few basics. I suspected it would be a harder one to reconcile or complement with Judeo-Christian-Muslim concepts. But from what has been revealed to me in this brief handy book was completely parallel to my beliefs and Baha'i type beliefs, that is I could see the unity of its god with the western god, which i believe is the same god.One point they made where this was evident, which I agree on is, in the Christian religion, is Jesus claimed to be the son of God and to be coming from the Kingdom of God to reclaim conditioned souls. As followers of Baghavadgita, they admit this claim to be true. Krishna is to Hinduism what Jesus is to Christianity, I recognized this reflection of Baha'i principles.Also, just as the New Testament stressed, he enforces spirit over material body. Eternal over the temporal. Granted, there are some differences. They emphasize many births until you reach Krishna consciousness, what we know as reincarnation. But this is all really still up for interpretation, did not Jesus say that to enter the kingdom one needed to be &quot;born again?&quot;One other connection to Jesus I made, do you remember when he said worry not about what to eat, drink, and wear for the birds do not do this but the Father provides for them? The author illustrates what we have become through materialism that our animal-friends have not lost. If we threw grain on the street, pigeons may come and eat a few crumbs, then fly away leaving the rest. If we were to place bags of flour on the street someone would come and take 10 or 15 and leave no others, they would take much more than they actually needed whereas all the birds would be fed by the same grain. God provides us with these things indeed, if we could only distribute them.But upon reading this I am able to unite Hinduism with the oneness of other beliefs. This served as an easy but wonderful introduction to Hinduism for me. I can see my belief through comparing this books message and the ones I had learned previously...The Lord is manifested to different people at different times to give the appropriate message in the given setting.If this has never become evident to you, please read this book. A book that I got for almost free on a whim that I thought I might possibly never read has been so very satisfying to me that I thought I would share it and hope you consider it"},{"Title":"Voyages Through Time: In the Beginning","review":"Peter Ackroyd's The Beginning is an informed and informative nonfiction resource for young adults which superbly organizes and presents our latest scientific understanding of how the Earth was formed, how life evolved, and showcasing an era when humans were at the mercy of the elements and their environment.

The first few chapters have been titled and themed in such a way that it bring to mind the creation story found in the Bible. Granted, that's not what this book is about and I don't believe the story of creation found in the pages of Genesis is meant to be taken as literal scientific fact, however, I appreciate the sense of wonder and significance the framing gives to the beginning of time (even though, taken as is, it's not as if the beginning of our universe was lacking in wonder). Still, by borrowing a bit from the structure of the Genesis story, I think Ackroyd gives a bit of familiarity to the history and science he's sharing. Ackroyd weaves together science, a storytellers skill, easy page layout, and fascinating pictures and illustrations for a good overview of the very beginning of our planet to the final emergence of Homo sapiens."},{"Title":"The life of Jesus critically examined","review":"I read this after downloading it from online and I'm less than impressed. The introduction to this book admits that Bible studies have gone beyond what Strauss says but tries to claim that its value comes from its expression of the thoughts of the age, at a time when science had advanced so far that no Christian could avoid dealing with it in conscious evaluations of their religion. But it's also true that the thoughts of the age were not so far advanced that Strauss didn't repeat conventionalities which have no basis in fact.So for example as early as section 5 of his introduction, Strauss subscribes to the canard that Christianity finished off Judaism. What an odd thing to write in 1833, the time of the Rothschilds and the Montefiores! What an odd thing to retain up through the 4th edition of 1902, the time of the Bilu and Hovevey Zion immigrations to what is now Israel! So even at first blush, Strauss' book is myopic and insular and fails to incorporate information about real Judaism. It becomes all the more ironic now when Chabad and Daf Yomi have turned more Jews than ever to study of their birthright and its practice.Another example in the same section shows that Strauss believed in the worth of everything Christianity does, when he devalues the same activity in other cultures including Judaism. That's not logic, or even intelligence, that's apologetics. If allegory, as he says, is a way to explain oneself to outsiders or to the tyros of one's own culture, why is it bad for Jews to use that tactic? Again, he regards the birth, growth, and life activities of the pagan gods as mythical and that these features are important in considering the value of their myths as nonhistorical, but unimportant to the historicity of Jesus who not only was born as the begotten son of God but who also died physically. The only difference is that Origen's allegories support Christianity and that Jesus was its founder, and Strauss cannot conceal that from others as he apparently does from himself.Strauss goes on a wild goose chase with the genealogies in Matthew and Luke. In showing that there is a historical basis for them, he falls into a common but mistaken concept that an interpretation is inherent in a text and not imposed on it. Thus he first discusses various people born to old parents such as Isaac to Abraham and Sarah, and announced by angels. Later he turns this around to divine participation in the conception which he equates to the status of Jesus. He's trying to show that Jesus really was the son of Joseph and thus inherited David's kingship, but that Christians of the time considered Jesus divine resulting in the verses that call him God's son. In fact Judaism never has and never will consider a divine annunciation the same as divine participation in conception. Strauss shares his mistaken attitude toward interpretation with a lot of people I have discussed the Bible with, who say they believe that Genesis states the exact facts of creation; that is an interpretation and the actual text starts by naming heaven, earth, and water without stating how they came into being.Strauss commits the fault of asking people living hundreds or thousands of years ago to censor the tales they pass on to suit the prejudices of people nowadays. In other words this is a form of reverse historian's fallacy. Instead of projecting modern attitudes back, he criticizes the past for conforming to the attitudes of that time. Strauss even goes to the unreasonable length of calling it perverted for Jews to interpret their own Scripture in more than one light, a fallacious claim that there can only be one right interpretation. Christianity is dogmatic about everything. Judaism only makes firm decisions in legal cases, or Midrash Rabbah, Midrash Tanchuma and many other works would not exist.Strauss ignores inconvenient details in the Bible or else he assumes some attitudes current in his time without realizing he has done so. Thus he attributes angels in the Bible to Zoroastrian influence, revealing that he thinks of Judaism as a late development in human history. In one sense we can give him a pass on this, because he wrote when Schliemann was only ten years old. Troy had not been rediscovered, let alone Nineveh or the Mesha Stele or Israel Stele of Merneptah. Radiation had not been discovered yet, let alone radioactive isotope dating methods or using satellite imagery to reveal traces left on the landscape by human activity. A conclusion reached on current data must be admitted to apply in the absence of further research, and must be given up in light of that research.Strauss shares a bad habit with other Biblical commentators. He claims a basis in Jewish scripture or practice for a particular statement, but he either refuses to cite the exact scripture or document describing the practice, or claims the authority of some other commentator. This is something like the fallacy of appeal to inadequate authority. Unless a reader has access to the commentator referred to, that writer's work remains inadequate authority for Strauss and anybody else. The errors I've seen in conclusions reached without adequate citations in works such as Philo, for one, makes me reject writers who adopt that practice.Finally, Strauss reveals he cannot adequately evaluate texts referring to Jewish practice or thought. In Part I, Chapter 3, section 23 on the conception, he describes an apocryphal work stating that Joseph and Mary both had to drink the waters of bitterness. This not only directly contradicts the Pentateuch (Numbers 5:18) which makes this the responsibility of a woman who is married, but it also has no basis in Jewish law documented in Mishnah and Gemara (Tractates Sotah). If Strauss realized the apocryphal work made this mistake, he should never have brought it up because it adds no value to his arguments. In section 25 he shows he believes that the Moshiach of Judaism was supposed to be a son of God. Judaism never did and never will teach any such thing and that is a point on which all Jews agree. Finally he apparently fails to realize that Judaism has the concept of a Messiah descended from Joseph as well as one descended from David, referred to in both Talmud and in Midrash Tanchuma.The only other pass I can worm out for Strauss is the nature of historical writing in his time. As late as Thomas Carlyle and Thomas Macaulay, history was still a branch of rhetoric designed to present a point of view, not compare and examine evidence. In Strauss's time there was no conflict between claiming to examine the historicity of Jesus, and at the same time ignoring or mishandling evidence that discredits one's thesis. Gibbon did that and lots of people still think he was a great historian.I don't recommend anybody to read this book who values logic, let alone impartiality or truth. Strauss is writing completely from the Christian point of view and yet claiming to be a cool historian. From the point of view of 1833, he is correct. In the 21st century we have or should have more stringent criteria."},{"Title":"The life of Jesus critically examined","review":"A controversy on which David Friedrich Strauss dared to express a strong personal opinion as a direct challenge to religious doctrine might easily be imagined by religious readers of this book. Those who chose to defend Strauss during his lifetime as a scholar who rightly reflected the thought of their day merely fall into a pattern that had already been described in scripture. Since the forbidden fruit in the Garden of Eden was from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, the only surprising thing is that Strauss could get onto so much trouble on an issue which was obviously just theological, if having an end of the world as a day of judgment is merely a religious issue. I might be confused, but a close look at his method of writing reveals a scholarly intent to examine various views that have already been expressly condemned in the scripture. In his search for a scoffer already condemned in 2 Peter iii. 3 f., Strauss referred to &quot;the Wolfenbuttel Fragmentist. No promise thoughout the whole scriptures, he thinks, is on the one hand more definitely expressed, and on the other, has turned out more flagrantly false, than this,&quot; that anything is ever subject to judgment. Annotations to the Text on Section 115 observe, &quot;Here we may observe an interesting contrast between Strauss and Reimarus (the Fragmentist).&quot; The contrast that is noted involves a close reading of the first paragraph of Section 116, in which Strauss supposes that Jesus himself expected to do as his apostles said he would: &quot;it follows that in this particular he was mistaken.&quot; The terrible error of the scoffers condemned here is their belief that &quot;all things continue as they were from the beginning of creation.&quot; The irony which is usually lost in the discussion of these issues is that those who expect the world to become any more modern in its approach to this kind of problem are the most likely to be disappointed at what happens next. Is anyone betting on what that will be?"},{"Title":"The life of Jesus critically examined","review":"Strauss's 1835 Life of Jesus is a classic work which was the first to systematically examine the Gospel accounts of Jesus' life with the express purpose of trying to determine what is \\"mythical\\" as opposed to historical in them. The criteria he used to make this distinction are substantially the same as those used by critical scholars today, starting with a fundamental conviction that events in the Gospels which require a suspension of ordinary physical laws (walking on water, stilling storms, raising the dead, healing the blind) cannot be accepted as historical but should be understood as myths added to the narrative to bolster the early Church's claims of Jesus' divine commission. In Strauss's day, it was fashionable for rationalist scholars to try to provide naturalistic explanations for miraculous happenings. Strauss effectively demolishes their arguments by showing that they do not fit the plain sense of the texts and are usually harder to swallow than simple belief in the miracle itself.To a modern student of critical historical Jesus literature, Strauss's approach to the texts will seem nave. There is little in his exegesis that takes into account evolving strains of tradition reflected in the texts, rather he reads them as literally as possible, pointing out difficulties and inconsistencies that arise, particularly when more than one evangelist reports the same incident. He also demolishes, often with wry wit, the still popular tactic of claiming that if different Gospels report what sounds like the same incident, but these accounts are irreconcilable, then the only explanation is that there was more than one incident of the kind, for example, Jesus must have cleansed the temple in Jerusalem on two separate occasions since the synoptics place this immediately prior to the passion, while John places it early in Jesus' career. Strauss's detailed analyses are still very much to the point in dealing with conservative apologists, such as Gleason Archer, who maintain in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary that everything in the Gospels presented as historical fact must be true, regardless of the contortions needed to reconcile the accounts.There are probably few books that can compare with Strauss's in being very well known and often referred to, but never in fact read. Fortunately, Sigler Press now has an excellent inexpensive edition in print, so readers can see for themselves, in George Eliot's superb translation, what put critical Jesus scholarship on the scholarly map and also cost Strauss his career as a theology professor. While not an \\"easy read,\\" Life of Jesus is remarkably accessible. Yes, it sometimes quotes Latin, Greek and Hebrew without translation, but if you have your New Testament handy, as you should when you read it, it's pretty easy to follow the references, especially with the additional aids provided by Peter Hodgson, editor of the Sigler edition. It also, thankfully, at 800 pages, is not a work that needs to be read cover to cover. The discussions of individual events are largely self-contained, and can be read with great profit on their own. Life of Jesus deserves a place in every thinking Christian's library, as well as in the library of those interested in the history of critical scholarly research."},{"Title":"The life of Jesus critically examined","review":"This book is an English translation of a classic German work written by David Strauss in the middle of the nineteenth century; most of the translation was done by the well-known novelist George Eliot (Mary Ann Evans). This is no lightweight monograph: Strauss is a scholar who draws on the relevant ancient sources and sprinkles his text with quotations in Greek, Latin and, to a lesser extent, Hebrew. However, only rarely does the argument turn on a lexical or grammatical peculiarity of one of these languages.Strauss was one of the first theologians to perform a systematic analysis of the text of the New Testament from an essentially modern viewpoint. (For example, he does not believe in the existence of angels or demons.) Strauss works his way through the NT, taking each event or story as it occurs and subjecting it to a painstaking analysis. He relentlessly, one might even say mercilessly, exposes contradictions and inconsistencies in the NT text, considering and eliminating one-by-one all the attempts of conservative theologians to reconcile the irreconcilable. As Albert Schweitzer wrote in &quot;The Quest for the Historical Jesus&quot;, Strauss's arguments &quot;filled in the death-certificates of a whole series of explanations which, at first sight, have all the air of being alive, but are not really so.&quot;Thus most of the book is still relevant, because it explodes harmonizing explanations that are still found today in popular Christian literature. However, there can be no doubt that Strauss is too single-minded in his desire to reduce everything in the NT to myth.The book shows its age; for example, Strauss is of the opinion that Mark is little more than an abridgment of Matthew and Luke, although it is widely held today that Mark in fact has precedence. Almost all of Strauss's references to his contemporaries are to other German scholars, and the majority of these references are now difficult if not impossible to find. (It's easier to find the ancient works cited, such as those by Origen, Augustine, etc.) The book unfortunately lacks an index, and, considering the book's bulk, it is often very difficult indeed to find out if and where Strauss treats a particular NT story."},{"Title":"The life of Jesus critically examined","review":"Albert Schweitzer said that there are two broad epochs of Bible Study - the period before David Strauss and the period after David Strauss. Strauss belongs to the 18th and 19th century German Protestant rationalist theological movement that tried to explain all the miracles of the Bible 'rationally'. The movement begins about 1776 with H. Reimarus and continues with J. Herder, K. Barhrdt, K. Venturini, H. Paulus, GWF Hegel and F. Schleiermacher. However, it is not ordinarily noted, but Hegel and Schleiermacher were in disagreement on just about everything, and David Strauss as a student of Schleiermacher, not Hegel.Strauss' troubles began when he crossed the line and used Hegel's name. Hegel was the most famous philosopher of the day, and Strauss decided to drop his name in the marketing of his book. Wrong move. Hegelians, led by Bruno Bauer, hotly contested Strauss' claims to use their mentors name. In his follow-up to this book, IN DEFENSE OF MY LIFE OF JESUS AGAINST THE HEGELIANS (1838), Strauss contradicted himself -- he admitted that Hegel himself would not recognize his writing as representative of Hegel's theology. Ultimately, Strauss ended up alone.Strauss was the world's first 'demythologizer' and that is saying a great since most 20th century theology centers around demythologization -- even late Catholic theology.But let's set the record straight -- Strauss was hardly influenced by Hegel at all -- his real strength came from Schleiermacher. (Schleiermacher had his own method of triads.) Strauss tried to capitalize on Hegel's popularity and in fact this worked -- Strauss' book became a best-seller in 1835 and Strauss lived on the royalties for the rest of his life. However, he never wrote a best-seller after this one.I would point out that Strauss no longer has the last word in Bible criticisms; for example, he did not see the logic in the Marcan Hypothesis, while most every other scholar since 1840 has accepted it. His defense of the priority of JOHN is quite weak. His quest for the historical Jesus was almost nil. His analysis of the mind-set of the Gospel Communities themselves, or of the Gospel authors themselves, was elementary.Strauss did not create in a vacuum, nor may we say that he had no peers. In many ways his fame was fueled by a fiction, and he did significant damage to Hegelians by obscuring their actual and already complex theological nuances.I liked this book and I recommend it. One needs to know Strauss before one can be fully fluent in, say, the Jesus Seminar and its authors. I think it is a necessary starting point for today's Bible scholar. To some degree I must agree with Albert Schweitzer: there are two broad epochs of Bible study -- the period before David Strauss and the period after David Strauss."},{"Title":"The life of Jesus critically examined","review":"Book Abstract: Strauss' main thesis denies the historicity of all supernatural elements in the gospels assigning their creation to mythological speculation between the death of Jesus and the writing of the gospels by second-generation believers from a mythological template.Until the Enlightenment, the gospel narratives of the life of Jesus were considered by the majority of Bible scholars to be accurate records of his supernatural person and work. However, in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries historical-critical scholarship concluded that the Jesus of the gospels was not the Jesus of actual history. The gospel viewpoint became suspect due to the understanding that non-eyewitnesses turned the mundane Jesus of space-time history who preached a political kingdom initiated by the faithful into the supra-mundane Christ of faith who preached an apocalyptic kingdom initiated by a catclysmic act of God.The skepticism of this movement produced reactions within the liberal and conservative branches of Christianity known as the First Quest of the historical Jesus. The liberals reacted by trying to rationally explain the miraculous aspects of the gospels by way of outright fraud, or pre-scientific explanations of natural occurences; whereas, the conservatives reaffirmed the plausibility of the supernatural face-value reading of the gospels.The Life of Jesus Critically Examined by the alienated Tubingen University professor David Friedrich Strauss (1808-1874) is a classic must-read monument to critical skepticism. His main thesis denies the historicity of all supernatural elements in the gospels assigning their creation to mythological speculation between the death of Jesus and the writing of the gospels by second-generation believers.Strauss uses a dialectical method pitting the opposites of mutually destructive rationalism and supernaturalism against each other. By way of minute observation of the texts, the implausibility of each approach is ably demonstrated by Strauss' razor-sharp analysis. He goes on to salvage what remains by applying a positive mythological template. This synthesis moves the narratives from crass history into the realm of idealism by focusing on the timeless truths conveyed in the stories of the life of Jesus.Strauss presented negative and positive criteria by which the gospel narratives could be determined to b e unhistorical and mythical. Negatively, an event could not have taken place historically if the normal cause-and-effect chain of events is violated by supernatural intervention, and if the account has internal inconsistencies and/or contradicted by parallel accounts. Positively, an event is legendary or fictional if it appears on poetic or lofty form, and if the account reflects preconceived notions of how and what should have happened based upon a new interpretive understanding of the Old Testament applied to the person and work of Jesus. When Jesus was understood to be the prophesied messiah, Strauss believed the originators of oral tradition and subsequent redactors of the New Testament would present legends of various kinds surpassing the miracles of former leaders and events, along with similar reworked vignettes from pagan and religious mythology just to raise the new religion to a par-of-equality with the dominant religious personages and expressions of the day from Greece, Persia, and Egypt.An example of Strauss' dialectic can be found in the transfiguration of Jesus found in the gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke, but excluded from John. In this eight verse account, Jesus takes Peter, James, and John to the top of a mountain wherein Jesus \\". . .was transfigured before them. His face shone like the sun, and His clothes became as white as the light. And behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with Him. . . .Behold a bright cloud overshadowed them; and suddenly a voice came out of the cloud saying, 'This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Hear Him!'\\" (Matthew 17:2-3, 5 NKJV).Naturalistic explanations maintain the disciples were sleeping, and that Jesus implanted the vision in their minds through hypnotic suggestion. The splendor, voice from heaven, and the two prophets are attributed to the waking confusion brought about by the intense glare of a sunrise at a proper angle, lightning, thunder, and two unknown associates of Jesus. The disciples confuse the voice from heaven and the disappearance of the two associates departing in a low-lying fog speaking words of approval as if they were the voice of God.The above thesis is contrasted with the anti-thesis of a face-value reading of the text by way of the supernatural template. Strauss understood this account as an attempt to represent a real, external, and miraculous event. to interpre it otherwise would be a gross imposition of modern external templates to the text. He correctly observes that Jesus' illumination radiated from within by way of a metamorphosis, not from a reflected external source. He observes the text never mentions the disciples were asleep. And if they were asleep, Strauss discusses the implausibility of implanting the same vision in the minds of three separate individuals. He also wonders why Peter would have wanted to construct physical tents for spirit or visionary beings, and why Jesus would not have corrected him of such a delusion. Lastly, he asks why 2 Peter 1:16 mentions that he and the other disciples were \\"eyewitnesses\\" of the transfiguration, not so much as this is actual testimony from the real Peter (Peter's authorship of 2 Peter was doubtful to Strauss), but because this is nonetheless an early interpretation of the gospel passage as representing an actual physical event observed through the sense of the eyes, not the mind.Then Strauss sets his sights on the implausibility of the supernatural explanation as having its origins in mythological embellishment. First, the gospel of John, which is concernined with showing the divinity of Jesus as the Christ, leaves out such a momentous external miracle as part of his divine sanction. To Strauss, the author of John's gospel is extremely negligent in light of Matthew, Mark, and Luke's accounts.In a second devastating attack on doctrinal inconsistencies and contradictions, Strauss observes in the parable of the rich man and Lazarus (Luke 16:19-31) that Jesus repudiates the testimonial value of a prophet rising from the dead to convert the five brothers of the rich man from their fate in hell. Whereas, in the transfiguration account, Moses is raised from the dead and Elijah appears to bolster the divine sanctioning of Jesus' preaching, instruct him concerning his impending death, and produce increasing faith in the three most dedicated disciples. Yet, the accounts relay that Jesus asked them to keep this povotal miracle a secret. Strauss asks, why would such a transcendent miracle be kept a secret until after the resurrection, especially when there was a multitude at the bottom of the mountain looking for the promised one? The account does not ring true to him, and leaves much to speculation as to why the event was produced at a later date.Lastly, he observes that Matthew and Mark say the event took place after six days, while Luke writes the event took place after eight days (Matthew 17:1 w. mark 9:1 contrad. Luke 9:28).Strauss proceeds to synthesize his argument by explaining the origin of the text on the basis of early church polemics. He observes that there are multiple instances of divine and human illumination in the Old Testament by way of supposed historical events, along with theological and poetic descriptions. Especially pertinent are the manifestations of light surrounding the person and activities of Moses, along with the taking of Elijah up to heaven in a chariot of fire. He remembers that if Moses and Elijah had such external signs, and the Jews sought signs for divine confirmation, then Jesus should have similar signs to confirm his messianic claims. The early believers, therefore, constructed mythological events similar to those of the Old Testament to give Jesus theological and scriptural credibility. The result is that a myth was built upon a myth, thus compounding the error.On an idealistic note, the myths of the Old and New Testaments relay a common thread throughout history of the perceived religious necessity for mankind to transcend his earthly existence and transformed into divinity. Those who seek to transcend like to follow those who have supposedly gone before. The only way to know if others have gone before is to have some kind of testimony that such an event has taken place. The transfiguration of the Jesus of history into the Christ of faith conveys the double message of these myths. The church, then, becomes the repository of these messages. Strauss, however, believes the church has literalized these accounts and lowered them back to a mundane level that cheapens the real import of the message.The Life of Jesus Critically Examined can be used by students to learn rationalistic explanations of the miracles of Jesus, as well as by believers to maintain what the authors said is what they really meant. Either way, the reading can be profitable for both sides of the debate. Howevewr, Strauss eventually comes down hard on both schools by supporting the text, but divorcing it from actual history. He believes he has rescued the eternal truths of Christianity from the naturalism of rationalism, and that he has divorced Christianity from supernatural history, thus allowing true religious idealism to be brought to the forefront of the debate."},{"Title":"The life of Jesus critically examined","review":"David Friedrich Strauss (1808-1874) was a German theologian and writer. This 1835 book (revised several times) was revolutionary, because it subjected the four gospels to a minutely-detailed critical examination, and pointed out the various inconsistencies between them. It remains the most detailed such examination of the gospels to this day. (Accordingly, Christian apologists---such as John Haley'sAlleged Discrepancies Of The Bible---are particularly proud when they feel they can find a way or \\"harmonizing\\" the gospel accounts that weave around one of Strauss's criticisms.)Unlike the earlier rationalists who, like the traditionalists, assumed that there was a historical kernel underlying all the material in the gospels---including the miracles---Strauss boldly argued that the gospel writers were not eyewitnesses to the events they professed to describe, and that many gospel stories (such as the virgin birth, the Transfiguration, the Ascension) were simply historical \\"myths,\\" created by the community of Jesus' followers in order to illustrate otherwise inexpressible religious truths. Strauss also challenged the historicity of the fourth gospel, calling it much less \\"historical\\" than the synoptic gospels.One cannot summarize an 800-page book (in small print!) within the confines of an Amazon review, so let me just give one quotation to give you the idea: concerning the \\"soldiers sleeping at the tomb\\" story in Matthew 28:11-15, Strauss comments, \\"their (i.e., the \\"chief priests\\") conduct, when the guards, returning from the grave, apprised them of the resurrection of Jesus, is truly impossible. They believe the assertion of the soldiers that Jesus had arisen out of his grave in a miraculous manner. How could the council, many of whose members were Sadducees, receive this as credible? ... (they would not) be inclined to believe in his resurrection; especially as the assertion in the mouth of the guards sounded just like a falsehood invented to screen a failure in duty. The real Sanhedrists, on hearing such as assertion from the soldiers, would have replied with exasperation, 'You lie! you have slept and allowed him to be stolen; but you will have to pay dearly for this, when it comes to be investigated by the procurator.'\\"Albert Schweitzer (in his equally monumentalThe Quest of the Historical Jesus) gave the most glowing of reviews to Strauss's book, and any serious student of Jesus, the \\"historical Jesus,\\" New Testament studies, or Biblical criticism, absolutely MUST devote serious study to it."},{"Title":"The life of Jesus critically examined","review":"This review is on the edition and not the content.

Quite the contrary, actually. If you want to gain an insight into who he was, who he met and spent time with, where he came from, where he went, what he did, and especially how his surroundings reacted to his presence, then by all means read this book. There are tons of different names and places mentioned, which sometimes makes it a little difficult to remember it all (well, very often, to be perfectly honest), but it rarely gets boring.So who is this Cagliostro character, then? Well, different people will give you different answers, but there's no doubt that he actually did exist. Some of his personas include magician, alchemist, healer, and founder of Egyptian Masonry, and even if he indeed was a fake - which his critics are convinced he was - numerous people claimed he had healed them, and at the peak of his popularity he had several dedicated followers who say his as a prophet and more or less were willing to do anything for him.However, powerful men have powerful enemies, and Count Cagliostro was no exception. He was especially good at pissing off men of the established medical science, but the priest and clergy didn't look too kindly to him, either. Thus he ended his life locked in a cell, alone and deserted, gloomy and miserable.But perhaps I should clarify what I hinted at at the beginning of this review. This book is only for the ones dedicated to really get to know Cagliostro, because even though much of the book deals with the occult, magic, and spiritism; it's always HIS versions of the occult, magic, and spiritism that is being dealt with. The phenomena themselves are never really analyzed, their history, development, influence on contemporary society, and so on, and at the end of the book you're never really told what the fate of Cagliostro really meant, how he affected the world around him (besides his obvious antagonists, obviously) and how history has come to look at him. Suddenly the books comes to and end, and you're left with all these questions you wished you had the answer too.On the other hand, Photiad&egrave;s wrote this book because he wanted to tell the story about Cagliostro, and with that he succeeded, there's no doubt about that.

This book demonstrates our Faith requires action for nonviolence and thereby for Peace.These twenty chapters guide us ineluctably to Peace and the practice of nonviolence, inter-personally, politically, globally, growing and nourishing our powers towards nonviolence, towards planting and nurturing these seeds of Peace.This is the most important book to read in these last days of violence, if we truly follow Jesus more and more, with greater commitment with total dedication, to the final consequence, in courage and in nonviolence and in peace.The back cover contains these endorsements from eminent Catholic clergy in the USAfrom Bishop Thomas Gumbleton--John Dear has lived the 'Peace of God' for many years. This book offers the theological and spiritual foundation for such a life. It may be the book that will convince all believers that our God is a God of nonviolence and peace. In our violent world, there is no more important message.from Bishop Walter Sullivan--A pioneering effort to use nonviolence as a lens for bringing all the traditional topics of theology into a new focus in our age of global violence.from the very Reverend Father Daniel Berrigan, S.J., New York--We have here a breakthrough of note: a modern version of an ancient summa, gathering between two covers the traditional subjects of theological inquiry: Trinity, Christology, Church and so on.

If Ansel Adams' YOSEMITE AND THE RANGE OF LIGHT is the greatest of all books of black and white landscape photography, then NATURE'S AMERICA is the corresponding greatest of all books of color landscapes. The first six pages contain text. Fortunately, the book contains no poems or cute Hallmark Card aphorisms. Each of the photos provides a 1-line identifier of the place, e.g., \\"Henry Mountains, Utah\\" (page 90) or \\"Ecola State Park, Oregon\\" (page 113). The following are comments about some of the pictures.CAPE ARAGO, OREGON (page 18) shows tafoni by the sea. Tafoni is a beautiful stone formation that is caused by fog and by seeping water. Unfortunately, this is not a good example of tafoni. Much better examples of tafoni can be found at SALT POINT STATE PARK (just north of Fort Ross, CA), PEBBLE BEACH (located 14 miles south of Half Moon Bay, CA), and in the southern half of BEAN HOLLOW STATE BEACH (located 16 miles south of Half Moon Bay, CA).BALD CYPRESS (page 21) shows a majestically beautiful bald cypress tree in a swamp. The image is enhanced, because the swamp is covered with bright green duckweed. I have taken about 500 photographs of the swamps in South Carolina, using a 4X5 camera and using a 35mm OM4-Ti camera. Therefore, I have a high degree of awareness of what sorts of images are provided by the swamps throughout this State. Because of my awareness of swamps and of the bald cypress that reside in these swamps, I am able to state with accuracy that David Muench's image \\"BALD CYPRESS\\" is one of the best possible swamp images that can be acquired from the American southeast.HOH RAIN FOREST (page 31) shows moss-encoated trees, looking like green zombies from a horror movie.DELICATE ARCH (page 56) shows one of the foremost icons of the United States of America. What is shown is Delicate Arch just before sunset, with a large round boulder in the foreground. Use of a large round boulder in the foreground is one of David Muench's trademark techniques.COLORADO RIVER (page 62) shows a horseshoe bend in the distance, with two spiral-like formations in stone in the foreground. The sun is near the horizon, which highlights the textured surface of the two spiral-like stone formations.POINT LOBOS (page 80) features the wonderfully textured melange of colored stones and plants and trees, so characteristic of this seaside park. POINT LOBOS belongs to Edward Weston, of course, and Mr. Muench has done justice to the legacy of Edward Weston, by providing a color version of the landscape from Point Lobos.GREEN RIVER (page 83) is a work of genius. This photo shows swirls of wood grain in elderly trees in the foreground, with red-colored stone in the mid-ground, and a network of canyons in the background. During the past 30 years, I have looked at this particular picture, as well as others from this book, for solace and inspiration.HENRY MOUNTAINS (page 90) has a foreground with two stacks of pancakes. The pancakes are thin, like the kind that is served at Ethiopean restaurants. This part of the image is similar to that of COLORADO RIVER (page 62), which also has stacks of pancake-like stones. In HENRY MOUNTAINS, the background resembles the parts of Canyonlands National Park that contain ELEPHANT HILL, CHESLER PARK, and NEEDLES. These three locations are all in the same general region of Canyonlands National Park.WATERLILIES (page 111) has David Muench's trademark large circles in the foreground. In this photo, the large circles are the lilypads. The midground has a V-shaped expanse of light, bordered to the right and left with deep shadows. The horizon has two mountains, forming a V-shape.EAGLE CREEK (page 123) shows one of the many waterfalls along the Columbia River, just east of Portland, Oregon. This area is a virtual shopping center of dramatic waterfalls, and pure heaven for landscape photographers.HAVASU FALLS (page 125) features the unusual rounded plunge pools located at the base of Havasu Falls. The plunge pools are distinguished by the fact that each has dozens of distinct shafts of water spilling out in a parallel array.BRISTLECONE PINE (page 129) also contains the trademark Muench style, where a large object dominates the foreground, adn where the background contains a dense array of detail. In this photo, the unusual object is a tree with a crooked branch resembling a flight of steps. The foreground is dominated by undulating grains of wood, in colors of black, light brown, and gray.HARDWOOD FOREST (page 144) has a foreground dominated by a fern, where the background is an ordinary forest, where the dark treetrunks are mottled with designs of leaves. The designs of leaves are bright white. The mottle design is not natural, but was probably created by sandwiching two negatives next to each other when printing the image using an enlarger.CONCLUSION. David Muench is most familiar with the American southwest, the bristlecone pines in the eastern Sierra, and Appalachia, and he is responsible for many of the best-existing images from these areas. During the course of his career, Mr. Muench seems to have overlooked Joshua Tree National Park. NATURE'S AMERICA does include an image from a park that is nearby to Joshua Tree Nat'l. Park, namely ANZA BORREGO STATE PARK. Also, Mr.Muench has overlooked (or has not devoted much time to) some of the best parts of the California coastline, namely, Salt Point State Park, Bean Hollow State Park, and Pebble Beach. Please note that California has five beaches called, \\"Pebble Beach.\\" I am referring here to the Pebble Beach that is near Pescadero, CA. Mr.Muench has also published some amazing photos from Hawaii, but unfortunately, has not devoted much time to discovering and photographing the best of the Hawaiian waterfalls. At any rate, NATURE'S AMERICA is still one of the best, if not the very best, book of color landscape photography."},{"Title":"Stand in the Gap: New Testament: Contemporary English Version","review":"I am 100% pleased and satisfied with the condition of the book as well as the price I paid.

Yet the contributors to the book are deadly earnest. Its main motivation is to assess the reliability of pilots. In terms of how safely and effectively they can fly planes. Hard to argue with that, for anyone who has ever been a passenger in a plane.Thus chapters discuss how to test civilian pilots and military pilots. There is a difference. While a passage also describes the testing of air traffic controllers. For all 3 types, there are guidelines for psychologists who might have to interview prospective candidates.Training is also considered. How to assess the numerous human factors and to integrate these into a teaching course. Along with methods to evaluate the performances of these factors.

Most are poorly written rehashes of common sense solutions that have had currency for centuries. Seidenfeld's book is a cut above most books of this type, due to a plethora of uncommonplace suggestions written in a lively conversational style. I particularly liked the idea of an &quot;office wide&quot; quiet zone periodically to lessen worksite stress. Also attractive were the author's anecdotes drawn from his colorful personal life as well as clinical practice. While I found the emphasis upon rationally analyzing difficult emotions simplistic, I did appreciate the author's jargon-free application of that school of psychology that boils down to sage folk wisdom."},{"Title":"Born to Rebel","review":"I'm in progress of reading this book, and I am finding it rather intrigueing. I would like to mention to those of you who have strongly opposed this book in reviews, that statisticsts are merely trends observed in nature and not facts. That said, it would be interesting to know the birth order of those who oppose and those who agree with Dr. Sulloway's observations. I'm willing to bet that the results of that survey would support his findings. By the way... I'm the youngest of 4."},{"Title":"Born to Rebel","review":"This book was valuable in understanding myself and understanding others. I had never realized that there has been an ongoing battle between firstborns and latterborns all through history. Nor had I realized that most of my disagreements have been with people who are of the opposite birth order.As a result of reading this book, I have twofold advice for anyone:1. Don't be too hard on yourself if you clash with those of opposite birth order. It's probably not your fault.2. Don't be too hard on the other party if you clash with those of opposite birth order. It's probably not their fault, either.I have just one criticism of the historical examples: why wasn't the protest against the Vietnam war ever mentioned?"},{"Title":"Born to Rebel","review":"Sulloway's expertly written book does have its biases, true, but they aren't pronounced enough to harm his research. I found it quite enlightening. And by the way, I'd have to contradict the gentleman here who claimed China has an unusually large number of 'oldest children' thanks to their stringent birth control policy. What China actually has is an unusually large number of only children. 'Oldest' is not synonymous with 'only'; you have to have younger siblings in order to be the 'oldest' of them. In fact, it would actually make more sense to say only children are 'youngest' children, since they're the youngest in their families. I'm getting a little facetious, of course; only children are neither 'oldest' or 'youngest'; their position in the family is different from either of those two categories. Just wanted to clarify that."},{"Title":"Born to Rebel","review":"Many reviews posted here do not argue his statistics, but rather argue the outcome. As science goes, the only way to refute the results is to refute the methodology or the data. It appears than many have read more into this monumental work than what Sulloway actually says. It appears that many more didn't actually read the entire book word-for-word as I just did, or your take on his approach would be either different, or your reading comprehension is considerably lower than what Sulloway is able to provide in content. Regardless, what I have learned as a lastborn (3 of 3) is that my greatest allies are often firstborns who keep me in touch with the status quo, and allow me to further refine my approach and arguments so that the end result of my work is better than if I was surrounded by a bunch of laterborns. Fully controlled by a firstborn is a disaster for me, but allied with a firstborn is priceless."},{"Title":"Born to Rebel","review":"Frank J. Sulloway's book, Born To Rebel, isn't, as some critics claim, pseudo science! It gives legitimate witness to what we have known for centuries. From Biblical times (Cain vs. Abel, Esau vs. Jacob, the first born sons of Egypt slain in response to the Pharoah's unrelenting slavery of &quot;younger brother nation&quot; Israel, Israel's rejection of primogenture values...King David, leader of Israel's &quot;golden era&quot; was a last born and left his last born son Solomon to suceed him....and Jesus..... a first born who didn't act like one!) birth order, inheritance of power and the passing of the family blessing has been a key theme in human relations. The beginning of the Industrial Revolution coincided with the rejection of the &quot;divine right of kings&quot; and monarchial models of leadership concentrated in various European aristocracies and the British throne....the cult of the first born child. With the rejection of European, primogenitor aristocracy, humanity was freed from the narcisicism that had kept younger siblings in the shadows and it was a wave of younger siblings who, as a result, stepped into the light. Oxford scholar, Joan Thirsk, back in 1969, wrote in HISTORY ( &quot;Younger Brothers In the 17th Century.&quot;) that she had discovered that there was a birth order rebellion going on in England just before the outbreak of the English Civil War under Oliver Cromwell in the 1640's. Younger siblings were chapped that first borns received the lion's share of the family inheritances and they found in their religion and politics reasons to abandon the old order. Democracy in America is the direct result of this birth order rebellion. According to David Hacket Fisher (Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways In America) English family shields and crests from the halls of heraldry contained symbols that revealed each sibling's birth order. The symbol of the first born son was that of a rasp or file. The first born filed off the younger siblings rough edges so that he! wouldn't get out of line or embarass the family (does that sound like the elder brother in Jesus' parable of the prodigal son or Sulloway's discovery that first borns tend to be cultural gatekeepers?) With the rejection of the English yoke, one of the first things that the new nation did was to give Thomas Jefferson the task of rewriting the laws of inheritance in the colonies so as to weed out primogeniture biases.What's next for Sulloway? How about sicking this masterful MIT statistician on a statistical analysis of the birth order of the original Plymouth Pilgrims plus the early settlers in the Massachusetes Bay Colony? Ten to one that his research would reveal that the birth order rebellion taking place in England at the time of the settlement of America could be documented and that the documentation would reveal that the vast majority of those who created this marvelously rebellous democracy were younger sibilings."},{"Title":"Born to Rebel","review":"My first reaction to &quot;Born to Rebel&quot; was that it most likelywas some very elaborate hoax. It's not that the book'sconclusions are preposterous. It's the patently puerileapproach the author takes. Everything that agrees with thethesis is appropriate data. Anything that doesn't isexplained away with a suitable arm wave.History can indeed be treated scientifically but this isn'tit.And describing the way in which birth order affects one'spersonality as an example of Darwinian theory has got to bea joke.Darwin hasn't enough trouble...This too!"},{"Title":"Born to Rebel","review":"I have just heard Mr. Sulloway interviewed this morning on KQED regarding his Darwinian interpretation of struggles within family niches. Also how IQ declines with every additional family, presumably because the parents are less invested with the following children than the first. Although we are enamored with psychological and abstract theories in this country (and there must be some validity I am sure), there is a huge, obvious reason for which this might be true without having to resort to any sort of theoretical abstraction. The first child has the entirety of nourishment in utero, as well as a generally more calm environment in which to gestate. Should the children be spaced within years of each other, each following child will have fewer nutritional resources, given the state of depletion of the mother's body with each ensuing pregnancy (it is not for nothing that pregnant women lose a great deal of teeth in the developing world; calcium and iron stores are often enormously depleted) as well as the stress hormones that must surge with the added responsibilities of looking after young children while pregnant. As well as the nutrition that has been siphoned off not only by the pregnancies but also by breast feeding. Anecdotally, my brother was born at a healthy birth weight and is, as the studies suggest, the one of us with the highest IQ. I was born a year later and severely premature with a host of natal conditions. And my sister two years later (my mother had a chance to rest, replenish and recuperate) at a healthy weight. I do not understand the reason for which we turn to esoteric psychological explantations when the physical one is so highly evident."},{"Title":"Born to Rebel","review":"The only thing lankmark about Sulloway's second big book is that it's been labeled &quot;landmark&quot; by everybody, and possibly by the author himself, behind his false modesty and intellectual cowardice. It is not surprising that all the big names are praising this book; and as one of the customer reviews said: Sulloway is shooting some Marxist and Freudian cows. In his dreams, maybe. I only wish Sulloway would learn to do some honest history one day, instead of piling documents upon documents, and &quot;evidence&quot; upon &quot;evidence&quot; and call that science. Well, science this is not. Unfortunately, the topic is too complex for even 200 pages of notes. In reading this book one ought to think about what Sulloway ignores and waves away...

However, it is bent, on every paragraph of every page, against older siblings. I know from my own personal experience that there is in fact a distinctive and characteristic older-sibling world view, but the author of this book appears to be so envious and so spiteful that he cannot see anything but the dark side of this distinctive pattern. Thus, the definitive written work understanding and celebrating the diversity of different birth-order world views remains to be written.I should like to know what the author, Frank Sulloway, thinks of today's China. The Chinese government has for at least two decades, especially in urban areas, encouraged families to be content with only one child. As a result of the partial success of this policy, there are now an uncharacteristically large number of oldest-siblings now growing toward adulthood in China, unleavened by what would otherwise be a proportionate cohort of younger ones. Does Mr. Sulloway view this with alarm? Is he prepared to be consistent with his own theory, which requires those who believe in it to characterize this generation of young Chinese as hierarchically content, unimaginative stick-in-the-muds? Surely nobody who values human diversity would go so far. Sulloway's theories are fascinating and should be followed up by other serious students of human nature.

You will find it especially enjoyable if you like scientific history and evolutionary psychology. This isn't necessarily easy reading. It is a book of research by an MIT scholar, not a silly book of theories by a bloated psychologist."},{"Title":"Born to Rebel","review":"First of all, I'm not qualified to evaluate the statistical analysis work that Sulloway has done. I left this book with the feeling that he has uncovered a trend worth considering and identified the need to do better study on the impact of birth order and personality formation.However, I found the claims in the book too large and too dramatic. Some of the discussions were distorted out of all sense to make a situation fit his theory-- particularly historical/political examples. While some of the material feels convincing and grounded, for much of the book I had the distinct feeling of a hammer trying to label everything as a nail. It may well be that the historical non-scientific examples were chosen to spice up the book and create a larger ripple. If so, it probably worked.A number of things bothered me: Sulloway seemed to rely heavily on reported personalities of the figures involved (all historical) to identify them as rebellious. This seems to me quite prone to errors of interpretation and historical misreporting. I would have been more comfortable with actions as the standard for rebellion. I actually had a lot of trouble with how someone was adequately defining rebellion in many of the contexts that Sulloway discusses. I also had the feeling that he did a lot of picking and choosing as to which scientific revolutions he considered rebellious. Conveniently (too?) his choices fit his own hypothesis.I was also troubled that when Sulloway found an example that seemed to break his model, he tended to come up with some kind of excuse that seemed even more tenuous and difficult to prove. Primarily here we're talking about first borns who proved quite rebellious by his standards or later borns who embraced conservative movements. Generally Sulloway seemed to argue circumstances that caused these exceptions to fall into a true birth category rather than factual (i.e., a firstborn who has a lot of conflict with the father effectively becomes a kind of laterborn).Full disclosure: I'm a firstborn, so you could argue that I'm always going to resist innovation in thinking. I think that I'm going to gift this book to my younger sister who is actually a scientist, and see whether her revolutionary thought processes will make more sense of the text."},{"Title":"Born to Rebel","review":"Irregardless of where you stand in your own family, this book should knock your socks off. You will either rave about it, or will angrily disagree with it. You should therefore give it a go. The author is meticulous and his prose is surprisingly good. The only minor criticism is that the author may over-reach in extending his theories of birth order to all aspects of human thought and personality and emotion. I am second in a family of three by the way."},{"Title":"Born to Rebel","review":"by Steve Sailer (http://members.aol.com/steveslr) -- Published in National Review, 12/9/96, 1,050 words -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --Born to Rebel arrives on a crest of imposing hype, with serious scholars comparing its importance to that of the works of Charles Darwin. For 26 years, this statistically inclined MIT historian has labored to uncover why it was Darwin who originated the theory of natural selection. After building a database of 6,566 scientists and other historic figures from the 16th through the early 20th Centuries, the answer's now obvious to him: Darwin was the 4th child born in his family. To Dr. Sulloway, much of history is literally sibling rivalry writ large, an eternal struggle between conservative, authoritarian, and closed-minded &quot;firstborns&quot; and liberal, rebellious, altruistic, and open-minded &quot;laterborns.&quot; (Pop quiz: Name Sulloway's birth rank and politics.)Despite the author's tendency to torture his examples to fit his comically obvious prejudice that firstborn = conservative = bad (one of his illustrations of a firstborn with a &quot;conservative ideology&quot; is the Unabomber), there is almost certainly some truth in his general idea. Sulloway's findings agree fairly well with popular stereotypes, the urban folk wisdom of our time. One of his accomplishments is to solidly ground his logic in Neo-Darwinian sociobiology rather than literary movements like Freudianism: sibling rivalry is genetically motivated competition for scarce parental resources. Older, bigger children defend their privileges, while younger kids try to subvert the status quo. As the twig is bent, so grows the tree. (The &quot;only child,&quot; by the way, appear to be too variable to generalize about.)A careful reading reveals, however, that Dr. Sulloway does not actually explain the cause of Darwin's creativity. It turns out that laterborn scientists are not significantly more innovative. (Kepler, Galileo, Newton, and Einstein were all firstborns. Genius remains largely inexplicable.) Instead, laterborn scientists are merely more receptive to other's innovatory theories, especially when there isn't much evidence one way or another. Once solid data becomes available, this gap rapidly closes. (Firstborns, in turn, seem to deserve some credit for resisting new but bad ideas like phrenology, the once-popular pseudo-science of predicting personality from skull bumps, which laterborns were nine times more likely to favor.)Birth order, it appears, primarily influences opinions, not accomplishments. Keep in mind that those of us who get our opinions published tend to vastly overrate the historic importance of published opinions.Despite heroic research efforts, lucid prose style, and admirable zeal for statistically testing hypotheses, at times Sulloway can sound like Matt Groening's Seventh Type of College Professor: The-Single-Theory-to-Explain-Everything-Maniac. (&quot;The nation that controls magnesium controls the universe!!!&quot;) Yet, family dynamics are a curiously impotent Single Theory. No nation can use birth order to control the universe because no nation can control birth order. The great engines of history remain cultural differences propagated through families, not differences between individuals spontaneously generated over and over again within families. For example, in one of his few attempts to explain distinctions between countries, Sulloway cites France's low birth rate and consequent high proportion of firstborns to explain why so many French scientists stubbornly resisted Darwin. Yet, since France's low birthrate continued into the 20th Century, by this logic France's surplus of firstborns should also have made French soldiers loyal conformists, while fast-growing Germany would be saddled with an undisciplined army of too many &quot;born to rebel&quot; laterborns. The events of May, 1940, however, would seem to cast doubt on this reasoning.When Sulloway leaves the relatively firm ground of scientific history for the swamp of politics, his analysis becomes a bit of a mess, partly because politics itself is messy. Unlike scientific revolutions, most political revolutions -- whether the American revolution, England's Glorious Revolution of 1688, Japan's Meiji Restoration, the Velvet Revolution of 1989, Mussolini's putsch or Hitler's takeover -- contain both radical and conservative elements.Eventually, somebody may make sense of the relations between birth order and politics, but they'll need a far more sophisticated understanding of politics than Sulloway brings to the job. His first weakness is that he assumes that &quot;conservative,&quot; &quot;liberal,&quot; and &quot;radical&quot; means roughly the same thing in all places and all times. For example, his description of Darwin's politics -- &quot;Darwin was ahead of his time, and his worldview was that of a twentieth-century liberal&quot; -- is a much more accurate portrayal of Sulloway's own ideology. True, Darwin was a &quot;liberal&quot;, but a nineteenth-century free market liberal, infinitely closer in outlook to Milton Friedman than Hillary Clinton. Darwin was linked to the rising tide of survival-of-the-fittest capitalism by blood and marriage (both his mother and wife were Wedgwoods, members of the factory-owning family that developed the first brand name in history); by heavy stock market investments; and by intellectual heritage (the single most important influence on Darwin was economist Thomas Malthus, a follower of Adam Smith). In spirit, Darwinism was Whig free market economics applied to biology.Further, Sulloway seems not to realize that it's much harder to define what's the orthodoxy to rebel against today than in, say, 1517 (the first year in his database), when the Catholic Church unquestionably defined the intellectual Establishment. He tends to assume scientific progress remains upsetting to conservatives. Yet, beginning in the 1920's with the discovery that subatomic reality is indeterminate (which flummoxed atheistic determinists), many recent scientific revolutions have proved deeply gratifying to the prejudices of sophisticated conservatives. For example, the now-validated Big Bang theory was long pooh-poohed by the scientific establishment out of anti-religious bias: the Big Bang is disturbingly close to Genesis (&quot;Let there be light&quot;) and Thomas Aquinas' Prime Mover proof for the existence of God.Most notably, the sociobiologists' ongoing &quot;rediscovery of human nature&quot; validates conservative distrust of the dominant liberal dogma that all differences between humans are the product of social conditioning. Today, the Pope appears more enthusiastic about Darwinism than the self-proclaimed &quot;cultural radicals&quot; who control who gets tenure in university humanities departments.Paradoxically, by offering even more evidence that human nature is fixed and that the power of state-mandated social reform to advance harmony and happiness is highly limited, Sulloway ends up offering additional reassurance to conservatives in their rebellion against liberal othodoxy.# # #Steve Sailer (steveslr@aol.com) is a businessman, writer, and only child."},{"Title":"Born to Rebel","review":"For those enthusiastic readers of Sulloway's book, he has revolutionized the study of birth order. But consider 3 points. 1. Sulloway claims to be comprehensive, but his data is highly selective. He claims to have studied 6000 individuals in history; but even so what he has ignored is a far more significant chunk of humanity than what he has included. Basically, whatever supports his idea he presents with pretentious authority; whatever doesn't fit he either ignores or interprets away in a very subjective (i.e. unscientific) mode. Moreover, he does not stick to strict biological birthorder, but rather prefers HIS INTERPRETATION of birthorder, a personal construct. If his book is indeed a revolution, we shall be grateful to Dr. Sulloway for telling us what our birthorder should be; he seems to have more authority in this matter than our biological parents. 2. As to a bit of data that contradicts Sulloway's hypothesis, any teacher of experimental psychology knows that the weakest correlation one could find is in birthorder studies. This is confirmed by literally thousands of studies done by students across the country. These results never got published because, as we all know, journals tend to prefer significant results. The null hypothesis, however true, does not make interesting reading. Of course, I can just see Dr. Sulloway protesting the unreliability of student studies. It seems that only his own research, and whatever agrees with it, has any authority. Other people don't understand statistics, or Darwin, or science in general. My point is this: those studies were done with samples from a real population, unlike Dr. Sulloway's subjective interpretation of historical figures. 3. The major reason for Sulloway's success, I suspect, is not his &quot;revolutionary&quot; idea, but his use of &quot;scientific methods&quot; to prove popular wisdom. In this sense this book is deeply and disturbingly conformist and reactionary, a betrayal of the scientific spirit, a grand example of pseudoscience. 200 pages of notes and 70 pages of bibliography rather betrays the feebleness of his thinking. Dr. Sulloway, a gifted student, finds statistics easy to learn. Unfortunately, scientific integrity is a bit more difficult,and seems beyond his grasp. This book shows how much one can get involved with the elaborate methods of science while avoiding any kind of critical thinking. Sulloway's &quot;revolutionary&quot; interpretation of history never goes beyond labeling historical figures and predicting their behavior--retrospectively. What is most disturbing about this book is the way in which Sulloway abuses Darwin, as many others are doing today. Alas, the theory of evolution is not a religious doctrine. I hope this flight from complexities of life will come to a halt soon. For a penetrating review of this book, see Alan Wolfe's in THE NEW REPUBLIC, which enraged Dr. Sulloway so much that he showed some neurotic dispositions in his letter to the editor."},{"Title":"Born to Rebel","review":"This book is illustrative to me of what is wrong with psychology today. As was brilliantly pointed out in Judith Harris's book \\"No Two Alike,\\" this book has no scientific basis. I am at least the second review here to point this out.As Harris explains, the portion of the variance for most major traits(juvenile delinquency being a rare exception) that can be attributed to birth order is basically negligible. The only reason for why a correlation may exist at all is probably due to genetic differences in the parents themselves. For example, parents with higher IQs tend to have fewer children. Since IQ is a heritable trait, we can expect only children to have higher IQs than latter-born children in large families. The cause here is genetic in origin. Once these genetic effects have been corrected for, the role of birth order becomes negligible."},{"Title":"Born to Rebel","review":"On 1/29/97, an anonymous reader undertook to trash two of Frank Sulloway's books, &quot;Born to Rebel,&quot; and &quot;Freud: Biologist of the Mind.&quot; There is not a single fact in either diatribe.

And Ha! - respectfully, now I know. But at the time I heard Sulloway's lecture to the Skeptic Society - I was still sympathetic to the idea. Finally someone got it! I thought. However, listening to him, I knew he got it all wrong. I could explain how he is wrong, and yet, he did all that research, he had all those numbers... maybe he is right after all...Later I found out.

If I didn't know better, I would say he has been spying on our family for a VERY long time. Curiously I had just read the amazing &quot;THE Autobiography of Jesus of Nazareth and the Missing years&quot; by Richard G. Patton. Patton's wonderful depiction of the human being, who later became deified, fits perfectly into Frank Sulloway's definition of the 'first born' as do Jesus's other brothers and sisters. Could there possibly be some collusion between these two authors?"},{"Title":"Born to Rebel","review":"That Sulloway's book has received critical acclaim as well as financial success will, I think, prove to be a disturbing fact about our age that future historians must explain. I see that the review below defends the book against charges of pseudoscience because Sulloway has used valid methods in reaching conclusions known since biblical times. If conformity is the mark of &quot;genuine&quot; science, I suppose one can find little to criticize in this tome. All that conforms to our age's worst prejudices is confirmed by Sulloway, scientifically, so he claims. His tool is statatistics, his muse Darwin (or the Harvard Darwin). And the genuineness of his science can be seen in the praises from Wilson and Mayr. How, indeed, can we question the authority of numbers and of authorities? And even if we can, can we go even further and question common sense and zeitgeist? Again, I would simply like to point out the importance of the Sulloway phenomenon for future historians of American culture. I would also remind readers that it was not too long ago that Nazi scientists demonstrated beyond doubt that Jewish noses were bigger, Jewish skulls more rat-like . . . and from these &quot;facts&quot; important conclusions were drawn regarding the history and the destiny of human beings."},{"Title":"Born to Rebel","review":"This book was selected by NY Times as a notable book of the year.

MIT.There can be no doubt that socialization takes place in the family. Now come the rebellions in EDUCATION that are born of this evidence. Given Professor Sulloway's extensive statistical evidence, there is no doubt about it at all. What this evidence means is of the utmost importance to education in the American public school system. It is a simple matter. Review and analysis of Sulloway must tackle the job. Certainly the book is important. The application of the evidentiary principles in it is a revolution in thinking. There are two distinct focal points. The most important is for schools, teaching theories, and their applications. Student do not acclimate to society and social rule or norms by peer interaction. Time need not be allocated to those things that SCIENCE proved cannot and do not happen. The extraordinary amounts of time given to socialization in schools, teacher training, and the texts for such mandates need revision and abandonment. The ridiculous practices of causing a nominally tardy student to miss more classes by sending them to the office for a &quot;tardy slip&quot; needs to slip away to never land from whence such idiotic practices came. Imagine this applied to life as so assiduously done by dimwit unimaginative public school teachers and administrators. Individuals who are aware that family pecking order is shaping their minds can work to enhance or oppose these proven effects. No nonsense entered into the research of Professor Sulloway means there'll be no nonsense out of applications of it. Extraordinary amounts of time spent on universally applying &quot;tardy&quot; rules and the even more arcane and picayune practices of schools and their administrators has led to contempt from within. We've gunfire, disorder and chaos in classrooms and public school halls only due to this arcane nonsense that never made sense in the first place. Colleges of Education need to revise their training, and re-train the robots and &quot;generatrons&quot; they've produced in administration and teaching programs. Certainly everyone knows that no one in the public schools is considered acceptable in Higher Education and that few make such transition to anywhere real learning takes place now. This is NEW. Prior to 'education theory' as taught practiced and learned in public schools it was not so. Being in charge of rules, socialization theory that never has had any substantial evidence to back it up and abandoning intensive study has long been the nature of Public School Teaching under the aegis of nonsense produced by bunk &quot;education theorists.&quot; It always was illogical. No one could have ever accused American Public Schools of using logic for the entirety of the last five decades. Professor Sulloway can be disputed for input to categories of social changes and revolution in society. His basic work shows that innovators always come birth order deep into family structure. Family structure shapes society. That is indisputable. The utter hilarity of teachers and administrators shrieking that families are the causes of their unsolvable problems while simultaneously spending so much time usurping what ONLY families can do is an ironic nightmare that Professor Sulloway's research can bring to an end. No one has ever disrespect learning and all respect the dictum that not much at all is learned in American public schools. None out of High School in 2000 AD can pass an educational test from elementary school in 1890. The restoration of curricula for comprehensive learning is what Professor Sulloway is all about. Everyone is very much aware that students who were subjected to and measured by the socialization scoring in Public Schools regarding behavior fomented rebellions that led to gunfire in the halls and slaughter in the cafeteria since the &quot;educators&quot; and &quot;administrators&quot; were paying attention to everything but individual education and particular students in favor of norms that had no statistical evidence like Sulloway produced. Special Education is the worse of these genres since it is over 90% socialization training and almost no education at all. Shouting from the rooftops that they are being forced to be measured for progress when IQ is the determining factor is the vogue response of the Public Schools today. Were these 'schools' in the business of education instead of socialization there'd be something to measure. Professor Sulloway has given us a way to do this using salient facts. The modern fiction of PETER HOEG in BORDERLINERS, and older fiction like &quot;UP THE DOWN STAIRCASE&quot; by BEL KAUFMAN point to the same truths. De-institutionalization of the MILITARY in the name of efficiency and cooperation; and reform in all institutions as called for in KESEY'S ONE FLEW OVER the CUCKOO'S NEST are more examples of the same. Kesey was also a National Champion and All-America in Wrestling before going berserk with The Merry Pranksters. The GOLDEN RULE of sanity restored is what Professor Sulloway has provided when his evidence is applied in society in all appropriate settings. Professional Sports are no exception. The authoritarians are gone. The authority of statistics used by Phil Jackson at Chicago and every other specialized coach show persuasion and education to exist. Surely no one will accuse many professional athletes of being very bright; though some are. Success is not based upon that in group settings of ANY kind. Sulloway is the evidence for what all with sense already knew."},{"Title":"Born to Rebel","review":"The role of siblings within the family and beyond has received attention for many years. Sulloway pulls together a mass of research, including his own to find patterns deriving from family structure. Using a strong evolutionary stance, he shows how &quot;sibling rivalry&quot; for resources extends into later life. This sweeping study keeps the reader's attention with clear, straightforward prose and a refreshingly direct approach. It will keep other students of human behaviour working for many years.The general pattern, examined within larger social, political, religious and scientific arenas, shows how later-borns become the flexible, innovative thinkers. While, necessarily, only a few become actual creators of new ideas, they more readily accept fresh concepts. Later-borns learn to adapt in the family environment - it's a survival trait. First-borns, and Sulloway notes the difference between chronological and &quot;functional&quot; first-borns, cling to a conservative stance. Even if the parents are radical thinkers, their first-borns will adhere to their way of thinking. Later-borns in such a circumstance are more likely to depart from the family's stance, adhering to more conservative social or political ideas. The disparity in attitudes is the norm within the family, not necessarily across family boundaries.Throughout the book, Sulloway frequently turns to Darwin as a case study in strengthening his thesis. It's a wise choice, since Darwin is emblematic of what Sulloway asserts. middle-class, middle sibling, middle-aged at the peak of his achievements, Darwin exemplifies most of Sulloway's criteria for distinguishing birth order as a personality driver. Sulloway concedes that the focus on Darwin is a logical result of the naturalist's showing the world how evolution works. The traits he describes have biological roots, intensified by the human condition. Human families have a long time to build the patterns he describes. Since Sulloway's thesis shows that cultural and socio-economic factors have little or no bearing on the evolutionary patterns established, previous dogmas will have to be revised or discarded. In more than one sense he's duplicating Darwin's own experience.The book concludes with a series of Appendices explaining how Sulloway built his database of events and people. He uses 121 historical &quot;revolutions&quot; and nearly two dozen scientific ones, as well as the Reformation to support his thesis. The criteria for selection are given and explained. He's not averse to challenges by other scholars, but they'd best have their data firmly in hand. He's buttressed his case admirably. Only one serious challenge to Sulloway's effort has emerged since this book was published. Readers should be aware of Judith Rich Harris' critique of Sulloway's methods in the Appendix of her The Nurture Assumption. This is not the place to examine the debate, but both should be reviewed by readers.

According to that account, Sulloway's work was never published in a peer reviewed journal, the book in which it was published failed to provide the sort of information needed for other people to check the truth of his results, and Sulloway repeatedly refused requests for such data--for instance, the names of the Protestant and Catholic martyrs whose birth order rankings he offers as evidence, or cites to the studies whose results he claims to summarize.When someone wrote a critical article pointing out evidence that his factual assertions about the data were false, he delayed the publication for several years by the threat of lawsuits.Judging by her previous book, Harris is a careful writer, so absent some evidence to the contrary my current conclusion is that Sulloway is a fraud."},{"Title":"Born to Rebel","review":"I was prepared to dismiss this book and its premise because of prior experience with birth order theories. However, Mr. Sulloway's book is tightly reasoned and supported by a great deal of research. In the end, Sulloway avoids the reductionist trap by showing how birth order interacts with a variety of other environmental factors to produce personality. Sulloway has put the issue of our biological nature squarely on the table by showing the relationship of human history to natural selection and the life forces that drive all living things. This book won't do much for our egos, but may well explain a great deal of human behavior. My only concern is the mischief that the inevitable misuse of his ideas is likely to produce"},{"Title":"Born to Rebel","review":"This book by Frank Sulloway places birth order, and the &quot;Darwinian&quot; struggle for parental attention, at the center of personality formation. Sulloway has taken 26 years to write his book - Born to Rebel, and it is worth it. He bases his theories on meticulous research into the biographies of over 3000 scientists, from the days of Copernicus to the present. His theories began with, and are founded on, the observation he made back in 1972 that there are dramatic differences between the groups of scientists who promote the periodic revolutions in science, and the groups who oppose and support orthodox science. His observation is that these differences are related to differences in family position, and Sulloway demonstrates a degree of statistical significance in these relationships that is almost unheard of in the social sciences. The book is remarkable on a number of levels. First of all, the theoretical observations have a power that may put Sulloway up on a level with Freud and Piaget in unveiling the mechanisms of human development. Secondly, the topic of the book is a fascinating read: first of all, on the personal level, and Sulloway is not so much of an academic that he shuns this. There are sideline remarks throughout the book that encourage the reader to apply the insights to him- or herself. Thirdly, the book is very interesting on the level of biography, and fourthly in its insights into the history of science. Also, it is beautifully written: it survives with flying colors the test that I apply - reading it aloud. Also, Sulloway is a master of statistical exegesis - in his command of statistical theory and technique (there is an appendix on the use of descriptive statistics that stands on its own as a beautiful piece of education), in the clarity of his explanation of the significance of statistical results, and in his use of just the right diagram. I have a particular fetish about the intelligent use of statistics and the representation of quantitative data. I have two favorite books on these subjects. There is Cathy Marsh's book on descriptive statistics called Exploring Data, and a book by Edward Tufte called The Visual Display of Quantitative Data. These two books, however, are textbooks. They explain in the abstract how to use statistics effectively and truthfully, though both books abound with fascinating examples. Sulloway, though, is manipulating his numbers for real, so his achievement is doubly impressive and doubly fascinating."},{"Title":"Born to Rebel","review":"With a minimum of psychobabble, Frank Sulloway has cogently written about one of the great questions of child development. His historical analysis is simply superb as are his statistical explanations.

Thanks for the review, Frank, it's been 25 years.)Because he shoots down some of the sacred cows of the Marxists, Freudians, and others, I am certain Mr. Sulloway will endure a lot of stupid criticism for the conlusions he draws. Yet, I am willing to bet that in 20 years, his ideas will be part of the intellectual furniture.If one only reads one serious book per year, this is certainly the choice for 1997.My only criticism is that I could not find where Sulloway reveals HIS birth order."},{"Title":"Born to Rebel","review":"As provacative and ground-breaking in its way as Alfred Russel Wallace's exposition of the theory of natural selection, Born to Rebel dares to suggest that our willingness to embrace controversial beliefs is a predictable consequence of our order of birth. The author's proof itself constitutes a facinating journey into the history of creative thought; the evocation of the childhoods of Darwin, Voltaire and Frederick the Great lend powerful support to the thesis. Sulloway's use of statistics is shockingly understandable even for someone who fled from Statistics 101. The prose flows like a wonderful after-dinner conversation; but after this feast the world is seen anew.

And, indeed, ironically, a couple colleagues and I had a related book, \\"Birth Order and Political Behavior,\\" come out at about the same time. Needless to say, we didn't sell many copies compared to Frank Sulloway's book!The work itself has generated much controversy. I am not so much interested in that as in the book itself. He states clearly his basic thesis (Page 53): \\"Most innovations in science, especially radical ones, have been initiated and championed by laterborns. Firstborns tend to reject new ideas, especially when the innovation appears to upset long-accepted principles.\\" As a firstborn, I am, of course, instantly skeptical!Sulloway brings a wide array of evidence to bear on his thesis. As noted elsewhere, there is some controversy there, but I am still impressed with the scope of his work.My colleagues and I, in our book, asked a different question--not about innovation and revolution: Is birth order related at all to political eminence and leadership. We studied birth order in terms of its effects on (a) the odds of being president of the US, becoming a Supreme Court Justice, becoming a member of Congress, military achievement at West Point and (b) the chances of being a British Prime Minister, Soviet leadership, United Nations secretaries general, Pope, and great generals in history. It was often quite difficult to ascertain birth order. Bottom line, though? No real impact of birth order.It is that set of findings more than any other that raises some questions in my mind. I simply find it hard to believe that birth order can be so powerful--whether in terms of leading to eminence or to being a rebel.Nonetheless, Sulloway's book is provocative, raises many questions, and ends up being--at least in my opinion--worth taking a look at."},{"Title":"Born to Rebel","review":"Although the data supporting his hypothesis look very impressive and almost convincing, the problem I have with this book it that Mr Sulloway picks his Revolutionary Theories for reasons that are dubious. For example, excluding certain theories on the basis that &quot;they would have been discovered by others around the same time&quot; can hardly be called scientific. And then, after lots of very impressive statistics, he wanders off into the land of anecdotal evidence science that makes the reader wonder why he's working at MIT in the first place. Although there is probably a basis for some of his conclusions, and it is a great effort to bring science to this subject of popular prejudice, I can't support the raving reviews it received in the press."},{"Title":"Born to Rebel","review":"Did you ever have the feeling that you read a different book altogether?I found Prof. Sulloway's work to be highly revealing. He obviously managed to bring this topic from coffee table discussion to true scientific value. I am a bit confused as to the criticism of other readers however. If one were not to use multi-variate statistics, pray tell how would one go about proving or disproving any social theory? The historical examples, as I understand them, are a means for the reader to understand the significance of the data, which was obviously well documented.Clearly human behavior cannot be determined 100% from research, but it does point to significant tendencies. I found the book highly informative and well worth the effort."},{"Title":"Born to Rebel","review":"I think the book is misrepresented by it's own title. It's not really a collection of knowledge on birth order and the psychological ramifications of birth order. Instead, the book is about applying what is known about birth order to see if there is a correlation between historical figures' birth order and family variables, and their degree of revolutionary innovation, or acceptance of revolutionary innovation.Most of the historically significant scientists are covered, such as Galileo, Copernicus, and Darwin (especially Darwin, there's whole chapters on Darwin).

Its proofs are too dense in some places and too sparse in others, and its notation is obscure. I returned it almost immediately. I do not believe that any eighth grader could understand this book. If its price were not so low and its potential audience so limited, I would suspect fraud on the part of the first amazon reviewer. I eventually used the 2nd edition of Fraleigh's Abstract Algebra text to learn the proof for the insolvability of the general quintic.

In my opinion, it is the ultimate book on Galois theory. All treatments written since this one were based on it, and do not add anything fundamentally new. There are only two things about this book which one could potentially complain about: 1) The awful cover. 2) There are no exercises because the book is just based on lecture notes. But that's forgivable, because there is no other exposition this good of Galois theory.One wonderful thing about this book is that it is entirely self-contained. It starts by proving the few basic results from linear algebra it needs, and then builds from there in a beautiful way until the fundamental theorems of Galois theory have been proven in a most transparent way. Then, in the appendix, not by Artin, a few results from group theory are proven, just enough for the classical applications to the solvability of the quintic.Every proof in this book is very clear and I cannot imagine how one could improve on any of them.ET Bell claimed in one of his books that anyone who knew high school algebra could easily understand Galois's proof of the unsolvability of the quintic.

The major elements of the book are definitions, lemmas, theorems, and proofs. The book introduces the major topics of Galois Theory. They are fields, extension fields, splitting fields, unique decomposition of polynomials into irreducible factors, solvable groups, permutation groups, and solution of equations by radical.The last part of the book contains the major results of Galois Theory with proofs using the theorems from the second part of the book. They are theorem 5: The polynomial f(x) is solvable by radicals if and only if its group is solvable; theorem 4: The symmetric group G on n letters is not solvable for n > 4; theorem 6: The group of the general equation of degree n is the symmetric group on n letters. The general equation of degree n is not solvable by radicals if n > 4.This is my second Galois Theory book. What impress me most is the involvement to prove the major results of Galois Theory such as theorem 5 and theorem 6. In order to prove the theorems, mathematicians invent many mathematical objects. They are root, group, symmetric group, solvable group, field, extension field, splitting field, Kummer field/extension, Abelian group, normal subgroup, normal extension, factor/quotient group, homomorph, fixed field, extension by radicals field, and more. Nowadays, we put all these objects under the domain of abstract algebra.The book is certainly not self-contained because one would need an abstract algebra textbook for reference to the mathematical objects."},{"Title":"Galois theory; (Notre Dame mathematical lectures)","review":"In my opinion this is without a doubt the best text on the subject.

That does not necessarily mean his textbooks should be praised *ad infinitum*. I understand some classics remain valuable for an incredibly long period of time (&quot;Morse theory&quot; by Milnor is one of such landmarks that comes into my mind), but I feel scheptical if this one deserves that claim. This book is okay if you are interested in his writing style of many years ago, but not quite so if your main concern is to study Galois theory (or algebra: that makes no difference for that matter) efficiently and effectively. In that case you should turn to more modern textbooks like Cohn (&quot;Algebra&quot; published by Wiley.)"},{"Title":"Galois theory; (Notre Dame mathematical lectures)","review":"This is a cute little book that guides the reader into Galois theory starting all the way from the review of linear algebra and polynomial rings over fields and progressing all the way to the Fundamental theorem. There are moreover many nice sections on Finite fields, Noether equations, Kummer extensions and as a final chapter the application to solvability by radicals of a general polynomial and the ruler and compass constructions. So the book is pretty self-contained and contains lots of good stuff. Also, Artin has a knack of giving very down-to-earth proofs that could be characterized as computational (rather than conceptual). It depends on everyone's preference whether they like this approach but for me it was very refreshing change of pace (compared to abstract and ofter almost magical proofs e.g. from commutative algebra).In any case, patient reader will walk away from this book with a feeling of having built the subject from the ground up.Nevertheless, I can't give it 5 stars because the book is very lacking in exercises. There are some applications scattered here and there (e.g. on symmetric extensions of function fields and on symmetric functions) but this is hopelessly insufficient to solidify the knowledge gained from the theorems. To properly understand Galois theory one needs to get their hands dirty by investigating splitting fields and Galois groups of all kinds of polynomials and paying close attention to the interaction of roots and group actions.

The edition that I read was I guess the first edition of the book, it did not have any index or preface, but that did not interfer in my gudgement. The thing I hated the most about this book, is that it uses old notation, which made the book wordy and less understandable. In the beginning of the book Dr Artin proves some results from linear algebra as if he assumes that people know nothing about it, but then later in the book he uses groups and quotient groups without defining them which implies that you should know something about group theory, but usually people with good knowledge in group theory are even more knowledgable in vector space theory. And I guess the moral here is that you really should have had some training in abstract algebra before you have read this book and for that I recommend Herstein's &quot;abstract algebra&quot; for those of you who have not had any course in group theory or Jacobson's &quot;Basic Algebra I&quot; Chapters I &amp; II for advanced students.

Such a great book is The Smithy Miracles by J. Denis Glover (iUniverse 2004). It takes its place among other notable and unforgettable books as Ishi: Last of His Tribe by Theodora Kroeber (1964); The Pond by Robert Murphy (1964); and The Cay by Theodore Taylor (1968), to name but a few that come immediately to mind.\\"Smithy\\" is a novel that is a giant metaphor for life. Parts of the story describe the basest human thoughts and actions: prejudice, cruelty, hate and the like. These are offset by the greater portions that illustrate life as it can be lived. One forgets that this is a novel.The descriptions are brilliant! \\"Canopied rusted remains of shingle machines, crouching like raptors in molding caves,\\" is only a minute sampling. Sonny's Papa has plenty to say about life: \\"Let's jis' say we choose to pin that note on ourself, or we don't. We got that choice, but we're gonna find out don't make no difference. None of us goes nowhere \`cuz everywhere's here, you see?\\" Yes, Sonny, all the \`notes' (labels) in the world are written by men who can't see what you now see.Readers of good literature, get this book!

You'll love it from beginning to end.A masterful work, combining elements of John Steinbeck (&quot;The Pearl&quot;) and John Fowles (&quot;The French Lieutenant's Woman&quot;), &quot;The Smithy Miracles&quot; introduces a wonderfully developed character in Sonny, the endearing swamp hermit. You won't easily forget him.With near-perfect structure-flights from the swamp, arrival at the smithy's forge, and return to the swamp-this magical tale unfolds in well-written, focused narrative by a former editor at the world-famous &quot;Christian Science Monitor.&quot; The style is vivid and fluid, even in the charming sections of near-dialect (but understandable) dialogue.You can read &quot;The Smithy Miracles&quot; on the poignant, colorful, exciting, and semi-tragic level, or you can read it on another, even more rewarding, one. It's based in reality and adventure, but it also has rich symbolic overtones. For example, the redtail hawk that follows Sonny appears regularly, and often subtly, as a kind of guardian angel. This device serves to clearly enforce the book's direction-its plot and its timeless meaning.Get this one, and know you can share it with others of almost any age."},{"Title":"The Smithy Miracles","review":"This story is one of the more moving I have read in some time.

Writing about a hermit means there won't be much by way of characterization. The book is self-published, but the author has had journalism experience. The locale of the story is the Great Dismal Swamp, a delicious prospect for a book.Sonny's father had served in the Civil War. He could subsist in the swamp on peanuts and other foraged food. Before the war the swamp had given refuge to escaping slaves. Lake Drummond bubbled up on the Virginia side.The game warden was surprised to encounter Sonny. He offered to give him a bus ticket to leave. Sonny had run into a bear, a puma and assorted other animals. He had watched bogs quench forest fires. Hunters, fishermen, campers sometimes built campfires or tossed cigarettes into the underbrush; but the Great Dismal was deep peat and a fire could smolder for months.He, a man of color, was shot. Pellets tore past his head. Men chased him. Sonny sought to find Churchland and his father. He was told Churchland had disappeared. It was all Chesapeake City now it seemed. In addition there would no longer be a blacksmith. Sonny followed the railroad ties. The blacksmith shop was sighted on Route 17.The book is well-written but the story is hard to follow because the focus is blurred. It is written in dialect. Time periods are confused deliberately.

The authors tried to avoid an overly mathematical style of writting but one wishes a little less hand waving.

This book is the \\"standard\\" reference for early British \\"Conder\\" tokens. It has remained the \\"standard\\" for over 90 years. The early provincial tokens of Britian are a fascinating and semi- affordable series for any collector to attempt to obtain, and are ripe with political satire, interesting architecture, sculpture, animals, boats, coats of arms and busts of famous people in the late 1700's. This book shows an example of what happens when people can mint their own money-fascinating. The \\"royals\\" thought \\"mere\\" copper coins below their dignity, so minted very few. This British series is rich with local trade tokens and medallic issues, but no other series offers the complexity and variety of the late 18th century token series so thoroughly catalogued in this reference. The token series reflects fascination with the emerging minting technology of the late 1700's and political, advertising and artistic goals.

I love how Ann has gotten other teen characters involved in the stories, not just the members of the BSC. They finally have friends outside the BSC it seems (like Claudia and Erica, Stacey and Rachel, Kristy and Cary, etc.). Anyway, This book was good because it let Claudia have a little romance in her life. I think they make a cute couple. Alan is still a joker, but he tries to hard to change for Claud, which makes her act different. Finally they get it together, and at the end, Alan asks Claudia to be his girlfriend. It was really sweet. It is so sad that they are going to graduate, especially when the series is getting so good, not just focusing on baby-sitting. Also, Claudia gets a job at the Stoneybrook Public Library, and that creates tension with her mom.

What will they say? Which side of Alan does she prefer- the old, goofy Alan, or the new ultra-serious one? Can she accept her relationship with Alan? And will working at the library alongside her mother bring them closer together or push them further apart?There is also a surprising break in Erica Blumberg's search for her birth parents. I am glad that other characters are being explored in this series, particularly Erica, Rachel Griffin, and Cary Retlin.Overall, I enjoyed this book.

The book makes her look like a real snob, which is strange because she always accuses her rich neighbors of being snobby. (Ahem. Can we say hypocrite?)But, of course, at the end everything is wrapped up in a neat, little package. The author really needs to get some better situations fast or the series will for sure die!

I found the artwork to be far too 'cute' to take seriously, and the opening story, while entertaining, contradicted much of the Player's Guide, and corebook impressions of the kith. Instead of their 'Whispers' Flaw having been born from 'Whispers being more terrifying than a shout' (Player's Guide), we have a tale of their voices having been bats slain by the Tuatha as revenge. We are told of secret Seelie-Unseelie Wars, when WW canon until then had been Kith solidarity, no matter what. The reason and motives behind Wraith/Sluagh linkage was changed...again. And murder by Iron for talking too much? Puh-leeze.This is not to say the book had NO redeeming qualities. It DID have interesting sections on Abbey Lubbers (sluagh that punished the wicked rich) Truth (and why it is important), and Wheelings and Dealings (How their network works) that seemed to keep to the spirit, and was entertaining.However, the editing was a bit sloppy; the Flaw, 'Knows Too Much,' was left in by mistake. It was intended to have been cut. As it is, the book contradicts ITSELF, with tales of reincarnated 'Sluagh of Note' in the back.One somewhat redeeming quality I found in the book was in the Merits and Flaws, which, on the whole, were decent. Excepting the editing error.As a whole, however, for creatures of born of darkest Nightmare, of whisperers in the dark and things that slither and Watch, I was left with far too warm and fuzzy of a feeling.

From the tale of the school teacher put in care of an Arab prisoner to the missionary who finds himself worshipping a cruel graven image, each tale pits man in a pivotal moment in time which defines his future. This is at the very heart of existentialism, a predominant literary vehicle of contemporary authors.The tales are simple in style, yet vividly written and rich in detail. You'll find youself shocked by the tragic irony in each of the characters, and haunted by the stories for years to come."},{"Title":"Exile and the Kingdom (Leather Bound, Collected Stories of the World's Greatest Writers)","review":"As a point of reference, I have read most of Camus's major works. The present collection is an interesting mixture of six short stories. The stories are more varied than his novels which tend to reflect his philosophy of the absurd. I thought the present stories were among his best works. The story The Guest is outstanding, two or three of the stories are excellent, and the others are good or are at least interesting.Albert Camus (1913 - 1960) was a French writer and philosopher. He is often associated with existentialism, but Camus rejected any ideological classification. Camus was a young recipient of the Nobel Prize for Literature when he became the first African-born writer to receive the award in 1957. He died in a car crash only three years after receiving the award. He was a social activist and Communist, and fought with the French resistance in WWII. Later he rejected Communism. The present book was copyrighted in 1957.The present novel contains six works:- The Adulterous Woman- The Renegade- The Silent Men- The Guest- The Artist at Work, and- The Growing Stone.I had previously read The Guest in other collections of short stories. It is one of his best short works and it it is about an Arab prisoner who had murdered a family member and who is now transferred to a schoolmaster, Daru, at an isolated outpost in the desert of North Africa. Daru is supposed to deliver the prisoner to a jail the next day.The Silent Men are a group of workers who have returned to work at a barrel factory after a strike, and who are not interested in talking to the boss who stopped the strike. The Artist at Work is about the rise and fall of a young painter. The Growing Stone is about a civil engineer on an assignment in the coastal jungles of South America, while the remaining two are set in desert towns of North Africa, and are the most eclectic and imaginative stories in the group.The stories are all interesting and I enjoyed the reads.The Stranger and perhaps The Fall remain as his best works and they are must reads, followed by The Plague. Those works include his use of irony and philosophical views. Also, Camus has written some good drama and non-fiction. The present work shows the broader range of his writing skills and is an entertaining set of stories."},{"Title":"Exile and the Kingdom (Leather Bound, Collected Stories of the World's Greatest Writers)","review":"To understand the spiritual struggle demonstrated in &quot;The Renegade&quot; we must separate the narrator from the narration -- because the narrator is mad, driven so through torture dealt by the very natives he hoped to convert. This is important because the narrator wished to honor God. He believed the best way to witness was to endure suffering.But he fails miserably; his torture is unbearable. Ultimately, the narrator concludes, &quot;I had been misled, truth is square, heavy, thick, it does not admit distinctions, good is an idle dream, an intention constantly postponed and pursued with exhausting effort, a limit never reached, its reign is impossible&quot; (59).The moral of the narration seems to be that no excuse justifies the narrator's suffering. If God himself is unfair, the world makes no ultimate sense. And this cannot be because it violates the promise made in Genesis. Silence, symbolized by the narrator's severed tongue, seems an appropriate response to this God.&quot;The Renegade&quot; suggest that we are not made in God's image, but rather that we are instead fashioned after Tantalus: the thing we most desire dances forever before our eyes, yet forever beyond our grasp."},{"Title":"Exile and the Kingdom (Leather Bound, Collected Stories of the World's Greatest Writers)","review":"When I was young and not partially wedded to any defined ideology or specific political perspective I was crazy to read, after Jack Kerouac's be-bop beat books,* the books, especially the short stories of the existentialists and absurdists like Sartre and Camus. Especially, after a certain time, Camus with his dagger-point little bursts of recognizable absurdity about the situational ethics of living a \\"normal\\" life in the modern (now post-modern, maybe) world. The world for me after World War II when one the one hand we faced total extinction on any given day (and still do) and unprecedented opportunities to live ten, no, one hundred times better than previous generations.That living better, if more dangerously, was at a cost though. The cost of being merged into some vast cauldron of moral indifference, moral vacuity, or worst, as Andre Gide was probe to harp on, immorality by putting on blinkers about the fates of the several billions other humans who inhabit the planet. That is the big picture though. What Camus excelled in with his relatively short novels, and here with the selection of short stories, was the dilemmas of confronting everyday life one person at a time- sometimes winning, sometimes losing and sometimes not being quite sure, that last being a fit category for much of modern existence.In this little book we have describe for us unhappy wives, adulterous or not, mad men and men made mad under the Algerian desert sun , angry men who are lost in a world not of their making but also one in which they have very little say over, a man who tries to do right but in the end is overwhelmed by movements, historically important movements, who finds himself however on the wrong side of history through no fault of his own, an artist who knows fame and its fifteen minutes and non-fame and its eternity, and even a \\"happy\\" ending where a man does right in this wicked old world and does not get beat down for it. Although all of these stories took place and were written over one half century ago on my recent re-reading the dilemmas presented seemed very current, very current indeed. The king of the absurdist writers, Albert Camus, writes with verve all through this set. And you wonder why I was crazy to read his stories back in the day.(*I was reading Jeanbon's be-bop beat down, beat around, beatitude stuff partially out of affinity to our common mill town, his Lowell, mine Olde Saco, and French-Canadian heritage, if only to spite my mother, nee LeBlanc, who cursed his name every time she saw me bring one of his books into the family house. And if she had seen Sartre or Camus books she probably would have done the same to them although they were not mill town boys and not F-C.)"},{"Title":"Exile and the Kingdom (Leather Bound, Collected Stories of the World's Greatest Writers)","review":"I believe that this book should be read along with the Fall, for as Camus intended, the two works lend insight into each other. I don't believe it's quite accurate to boil these stroies down into existential philosophy and social crticism. There is something to Camus' work which speaks to more hidden aspirations. This is an incredible collection of stories, who's diversity defies Hemingway. However, unlike the other reviews, I don't believe that the stories are about exile in such a simple way. Many of the charcters seem to be liberated at the end of their stories...or, imprisoned. Either way, the exile involved here, I think, may have more to do with the kingdom of God. Take that as you will. This is a strong piece of literature."},{"Title":"Exile and the Kingdom (Leather Bound, Collected Stories of the World's Greatest Writers)","review":"I find &quot;Exile and the Kingdom&quot; to be Camus' best book, and here's why. Here, towards the end of his life, he finally seemed to be sifting his philosophies from his characters; making real people turn up in unrealistic situations, hence making a point about either that character or society. What results is very strong fiction, be it the adultress in the desert, the teacher who cannot ignore a revolution, the artist locked up in his loft trying to find the perfect idea, or the islanders who must carry a stone to show their faith. Camus is blunt about what he feels are our shortcomings; but he lets his characters make their mistakes as people. Thus, years later, you find yourself still pondering these stories and seeing them reflected in the world around you. Profound, and uplifting in their own downbeat way. Considering that the novel he never finished, the recently published _The First Man_ is autobiography, it seems Camus felt he had said what he came to say about existentialism and society"},{"Title":"Exile and the Kingdom (Leather Bound, Collected Stories of the World's Greatest Writers)","review":"Exile and Kingdom is the chrysalis out of which The Fall (his great 3rd novel) formed.The stories depict various forms of exile,isolation,alienation.Four are set in Algeria,one of which \\"The Guest\\" gets most directly to Camus's present situation and dilemma: how do you treat the Arabs if you are a French Algerian?Daru is a teacher and is asked to keep an Arab prisoner in his house,one who killed his brother,then take him to the nearest town.There is a sense of the native Arab population on the move,in revolt,ready to rise up against their colonist masters.The story is unsettling in light of Camus's treatment by fellow French intellectuals like Sartre and his position as a pied-noir in Algeria.Camus refused to take sides in the conflict.Daru like Camus is exiled by the choices he has made. Daru does not turn in the prisoner,he sets him on his way to make his own choice,freedom or imprisonment.This kindness may result in death.The village was beginning to stir.The Adulterous Woman is disenchanted with her husband on a business trip through Algeria,she still feels attractive to other men,but the vigor has gone out of their marriage.She communes with the night stars,identifies with the nomads she can see from the fort as they aren't tied to the town.She is no longer an extension of her husband,she is freed to embrace the wider world.The native Algerians are disdained by Marcel,her husband.In The Renegade the exiled ex-priest narrator is waiting in the desert,a prisoner of a desert tribe,who have cut out his tongue,having become converted to the dionysiac religion of his masters. The narrator had been a missionary to the tribes of Taghasa,he now waits to kill the new missionary. He disowns Christ, refusing to believe in his righteousness and declares that the Fetish and the power of hatred are the only true and flawless powers in the world.Camus depicts religion as the disjointed absurdity of a disordered mind.The Silent Men is about a labour dispute in a Cooper's shop in the Algeria of Camus's youth. They have recently returned to work after a failed strike. When the owner's daughter has a serious, acute illness requiring an ambulance, the men do not offer any words of condolence. Where once there had been a sense of being all part of a whole, they no longer feel such for the owner who refused them.The next story is about the successful artist,Jonas, who ceases to be able to paint.The tone reflects Camus's bitterness and sense of isolation at the time of the quarrel with Sartre and his circle.In his new solitude Camus would never show more solidarity, giving way to the French equation/ pun solitaire-solidaire,the only word(s) written on a blank canvas by Jonas.The last story,The Growing Stone,is set on a Brazilian coastal town.A visiting French engineer,D'Arrast,finds a sort of mystical communion with the remote people.Many of the scenes in Exile and Kingdom have a dream-like quality.The \`Kingdom' in these stories is one of fantasy.The exile is real and from it stems the fantasy of the kingdom.In the stories solidarity pitches up against solitude.The stories are not easy reads,you feel Camus is trying to work on themes in miniature,but they fascinate anyone who has read his more well known novels and essays."},{"Title":"Exile and the Kingdom (Leather Bound, Collected Stories of the World's Greatest Writers)","review":"This work of short stories reminds me why I love reading Camus so much. The stories are entertaining and compelling on their face, yet there is so much more meaning just beneath the surface that the reader can come across new meaning with every reading. Camus requires a lot from the reader if you want to really understand what he has to say, but it is well worth the effort to dig deeper than the surface to find the meaning behind the words.It's hard to pick a favorite story from this collection, but for me it would have to be The Guest. It is a story of a school master in the back country in Algeria, probably pre-revolution. His is a solitary existence. Alone among the natives, but not a part of them, he works for the government but is so far removed that he isn't really a part of it either. I won't give too much away, but what I like is the hopelessness of the story. The school master rejects \\"civilization\\" and refuses to take an active role in the destruction of a native who has committed a crime. In the end the school master sticks to his beliefs, but saves no one and alienates himself from everyone. In the beginning his is a solitary existence, but by the end his decisions made no difference, and actually cause him even further isolation. It is not a feel good story, but it really stuck with me.The Growing Stone is a story with similar themes as The Guest, but with a much different conclusion. What really struck me with this story is the opening. The main character is stealing away in the middle of the night like a theif or a bandit. He, a European, is waiting at a river for a barge to carry his car across. The crossing on a barge carried along by natives using such a primitive means of crossing, while the protagonist remains in his car becomes an interesting juxtaposition later on. The reader gets the impression he is running or escaping from something, and the crossing of the river is a great metaphor for how this story plays out. This is another story of rejection, but unlike The Guest this story has redemption and acceptance as well. It is a very close second to The Guest.The Renegade was a nasty story that was certainly right up my alley. In the end the only story I didn't really enjoy was The Artist At Work. I'm not sure why I didn't like, but I felt it was to drawn out, and the themes didn't really connect with me which made the story seem unnecessarily long. I'm not suggesting the work isn't good, but just that I didn't like it.Other than that one story I enjoyed this entire collection. I enjoy Camus' work immensely and this one was no exception. Be prepared to go deeper than the surface and really dig in to find the meaning behind the stories and you will be rewarded. I recommend this collection."},{"Title":"Exile and the Kingdom (Leather Bound, Collected Stories of the World's Greatest Writers)","review":"This volume of short fiction by Albert Camus is easy to read and very provoking. The stories contained are varied and unique, but the message is similar to all. Man lives in exile. He constantly searches for a path home, spiritually and in physical terms. This message can be chilling because exile means loss, primarily psychological. The realization of this void is what makes them worthwhile."},{"Title":"Exile and the Kingdom (Leather Bound, Collected Stories of the World's Greatest Writers)","review":"You get the first impression of the book in the first chapter when Camus states (paraphrasing) that we are all free lords of our own strange kingdom. We control our thoughts and our actions; whether the outcome be our view of our Kingdom, we all believe there is one, and we are constantly trying to obtain it. Though the book is a bit easy, it was a good refresher of Camus...how liberating he can be sometimes!"},{"Title":"Exile and the Kingdom (Leather Bound, Collected Stories of the World's Greatest Writers)","review":"The short stories of &quot;Exile and the Kingdom&quot; remain, in my humble opinion (and of course in the opinion of Camus scholars, viz. Champigny, Fitch and C.C. O'Brien) stylistically-varied writing exercises more so than a response to &quot;L'envers et l'endroit&quot; (&quot;The wright side and the wrong side&quot;, written in the same format 20 years earlier). As the title indicates, and as &quot;Jonas&quot;, one the stories so blatanly (if not too dogmatically) alludes to, the metatheme is that of solitude v. solidarity (it sounds better in French due to rhyming...). Let me elucidate: in the context of the Algerian War - and certainly Camus' quandary during the latter - the perennial &quot;no man's land&quot; stance of an isolated, disliked-by-Sartre, disliked-by-the-pieds-noirs, writer makes for the premises of &quot;Jonas&quot; or &quot;La femme adult&egrave;re&quot; ('the adulteress wife'). What intrigued me was how Camus reversed the cultural notions of &quot;exile&quot; and &quot;kingdom&quot; in making of the latter one of 'here and now', amongst men and without G-d, as opposed to an other-worldy 'kingdom' which Camus sees above all as some sort of solitude - a man praying alone, naked in front of the universe - (think of the jesuit-fetichist in the second text). The biblical allusions are also of course blatant: Simon (last story) makes the entire text too easily a roman-&agrave;-clef type of read; the fetichist-priest quotes Jesus, etc. Furthermore, characterization is almost nill (for those of you familiar with Clamence in &quot;the Fall&quot; or Meursault in &quot;The Stranger&quot;, this work is entirely different - except maybe for the incredible second short story)in the sense that the individual stories, one senses, are more of &quot;varied writing exercises.&quot; I love Camus, and certainly do not intend to disparage him any longer - for those of you who do expect a &quot;Myth of Sisyphus&quot; ideology to be hiding in each short story, this is not the case (nor should it be; it is not a &quot;roman &agrave; th&egrave;se&quot; where everything must be interpreted in light of the Absurd). Finally, &quot;exile and the kingdom&quot; remains, on a more positive note, an accessible introduction to one of the facets of Camus' thought for those who may not wish to indulge themselves in his war writings or 'The Myth of Sisyphus&quot;. Yet I must add that the stories do not function as a &quot;r&eacute;sum&eacute;&quot; of the author's thought, and rightly so. I do recommend a reading of the stories perhaps after an exploration of &quot;The Fall&quot; as they were all intended for publication with it. This is perhaps one of the most interesting factors in glancing at each story and figuring out why Camus chose such and such locations, mode of narration, style, format, and order. These stories are also, I might add, largely ignored by literary (Camus) critics and so ought to be read regardless... -Lisa"},{"Title":"Exile and the Kingdom (Leather Bound, Collected Stories of the World's Greatest Writers)","review":"Cozmans introduction and tranlation are no improvment over the Justin O' Brian translation in fact Cozman's translation can not touch O'Brians flow, elgance and art. Cozman's tranlation is a labor while Justin O' Brian is tranaltion is a pleasure to read and easly comprehended. If Camus French was a bad as Cozman's English translation then we would not be reading Camus today.The introduction by the Turkish nobel prize winner is in same leauge as Cozmans translation. He is verbose and not elganant in any way. His novels reak of Camus and Camus should never reak.The first tip off is that Camus dedication to Frances is deleted from this edition. This is sad when a publisher does not respect the orginal author enough to give a page to a dead nobel prize winner for a dedication. Camus gave us so much that he deserves this respect.The O'Brian text has no introduction, no forward, just Camus translated well and the dedication to Frances. That is enough for me.The EXILE and The KINGDOM is wonderful. The Silent Man, The Adultrous Woman and The Artist's Life three of the greatest stroies ever written.

I can't think of a modern author who could have such a similar living context for Camus' fiction. While a life-long resident of Istanbul, Pamuk is treated like an outsider by his government (at least) though he is as Turkish as much as Camus was French.What draws all these stories together is a philosphy of both melancholy and fanaticism. Humor would dull the edge of Camus' two major themes, but the book seems to lack an ability to describe any. The narrator seems to find his characters trapped in a series of drab, slow, yet utterly poetic scenes. Likewise his characters seem to want to leap out of the settings they find themselves in. They share a hopelessness that one would expect from the author of The Myth of Sisyphus, but also a frenetic - not activity, but perhaps activism - that comes across as a yearning to get out of the story.There seems to be a whiff of Neitzsche's \\"The Birth of Tragedy\\" here, though I hesitate to draw it out to strongly. Could Camus' attempt at the short story be looked at as tragedy, and in that could his narrator be the Apollonian and the characters Dionysian?Lucky for me this is an amateur review and I don't have to answer that."},{"Title":"Exile and the Kingdom (Leather Bound, Collected Stories of the World's Greatest Writers)","review":"Albert Camus, born in Algeria in 1913, won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1957 and died three years later, but his writings live on. This collection of six unusual, strange-endinged stories will probably be of interest to a wide range of short story fans. Sometimes seemingly vague and symbolic (and with odd titles and endings), they are thoroughly enjoyable and readable. Though similar in complexity, subject matter and settings vary greatly: a woman joins her fabric-selling husband on a business trip, a detongued former missionary awaits his replacement, barrel makers strike, a prisoner is foisted on a schoolmaster, an artist works amidst ever-changing chaos, and an engineer visits inhabitants near the site of a future dam.

This is the third review of one of his works that I've written. I thought The Stranger was a great work and so I went on to The Fall and found it lacking. I've found that Camus is at his best when he concentrates on a story instead of preaching to his audience. Yeah, you can put philosophical ideas in fiction but you have to clothe it deeply enough in story. In Exile and the Kingdom (1958), a book of 6 short stories comes closer to the storytelling brillance of The Stranger but doesn't quite pull it off.Most of the stories in the book are about people that are being repressed by society in one form or another. They have gotten sick of their lives and are on the cusp of breaking down or screaming out or surrendering to their fate. Some of them escape and some of the characters don't.The first story, &quot;The Adulterous Woman&quot; is about a woman who has been married too long and while visiting an Arab town begins to awaken her physical being to the sights and sounds of the desert and of other men.&quot;The Renegade&quot; shows what happens when a missionary priest is captured by a tribe of savages and is forced to worship a pagan idol. This is one of the more effective stories and reminds me of the first person style of The Fall.&quot;The Silent Men&quot; concerns us with one of the favorite pasttimes of Europeans, namely the labor dispute. It is about the relations between some barrelmakers and their boss. Not exactly high drama.In &quot;The Guest&quot;, a schoolteacher on a remote mountain, isolated from civilization, is given the responsibility of escorting a murderer to the civil authorities.&quot;The Artist at Work&quot; is the greatest story in the book. It is about the continual conflict between an artist's desire to be a part of society and the need he has for solitude. The painter in this story gets married, has kids, tries to be a celebrity, and almost destroys his very reason for being. Almost everyone, even his disciples, are unknowingly killing him because they never allow him time to work.The last story in the book, &quot;The Growing Stone&quot; was almost completely a waste of time. I know it was about a French engineer going to a rainforest village to construct a flood prevention system but beyond that it got shaky. I know he went to one of their celebrations and saw something like a voodoo ceremony but beyond that I didn't have a clue as to what was going on. I'm sure it was one of those Heart of Darkness things where civilized European confronts dark forces of the jungle and loses.This book as a whole was OK. Nothing bad. Just Ok. The artist story was quite good even though it was a bit melodramatic and romantic. &quot;The Renegade&quot; I'll have to read again but I believe it to be quite masterful too. As for the other stories, I don't see that you would miss anything if you didn't read them. There just doesn't seem to be a lot going on in them. The characters aren't given enough to make us interested in them. In fact, I don't think any of these stories are essential to Camus' work or French literature. They were just average to me. Read The Stranger instead."},{"Title":"Exile and the Kingdom (Leather Bound, Collected Stories of the World's Greatest Writers)","review":"Having not read Camus since my school days, with the exception, that is, of his play *Caligula,* I picked up this collection of short stories remembering Camus as an old favorite. I wonder if I would now find *The Stranger* and *The Plague* just as pass&eacute;.These stories just don't hold up, if they ever did. Are they really considered representative of Camus \`at the height of his power,' as the biographical note to this edition maintains? I'd have to think, indeed hope, that was just hype.Delivered with all the subtlety of a trumpeting elephant, the themes comprising *The Exile and The Kingdom* seemed terribly dated, nave, and without any particular distinction as great literature. As translated, the stories are written with admirable clarity in predominately short, clean sentences reminiscent to me somewhat of Hemingway, which makes the reading quick and simple--but after fifty years, Camus isn't only saying nothing new; he isn't saying anything old in a particularly compelling way either.Perhaps the best story is *The Renegade*--a \`mad' monologue delivered by a missionary captured by a savage tribe in the middle of a salt wasteland and converted to their religion of uncompromising cruelty. Probably the worst of the lot is *The Artist At Work*--a didactic author omniscient narrative that has the simplicity of a fable and all the clich&eacute;s of one, too.In the end, I'd like to think that *The Exile and the Kingdom* is a collection of basically throw-away work of fourth-rate Camus that nonetheless made its way into print--and stayed in print so long--because of Camus's Nobel Prize-winning status. And because, at his level of literary importance and influence, everything he's written is of lasting interest, if only to Camus scholars. I'd like to think that, but I'm not so sure. One thing I am sure of, however, is that these weren't of much interest to me at all."},{"Title":"Exile and the Kingdom (Leather Bound, Collected Stories of the World's Greatest Writers)","review":"Camus' existentialism is expressed in very similar ways among the different short stories.

I received this book for Christmas and figured I would read a few pages to see what it was about. A couple hours later I had read the entire book.This book is mandatory reading for anyone who wants to make more money by slightly changing your outlook on what role you play in a bigger picture. The book clearly shows how you can make more money, be more satisfied, and help others do the same. It is not a bunch of spiritual theory that is based on socialistic ideals. In fact it is quite the contrary. It demonstrates how to be a better capitalist and the authors use real life examples to demonstrate their points. Further, the steps outlined in the book are simple to apply to your REAL LIFE and do not require any deep spiritual soul searching. They make sense immediately and are easy to see how they would work for you whether you are a wall street hotshot or a local plumber.I intend to start using the lessons learned in the book on Monday when I return to work.

Perhaps the most remarkable thing about this slim but important book is how much the authors themselves transformed. While they'd always put a strong value on ethics, even walking away from large, lucrative deals that didn't pass the sniff test, they had been, pre-9/11, shallow workaholics obsessed by money, too busy chasing the next big deal to notice and appreciate the things that really matter.Grieving over the loss of friends from both worlds, and struggling to rebuild their business after the triple whammy of the 2001 stock market downturn, 9/11, and the epidemic of corporate ethics scandals, the Resslers found spiritual guidance in the commitment of firefighters to help others, even at great personal risk, at yearly salaries that many of their Wall Street friends made every week. \\"Everything firefighters did was for love: the love of their colleagues, their families, their friends, their communities, their country...after witnessing the work of the firefighters, we also understood that wealth gained without thought to others was no gain at all...we could only proceed in business as *spiritual* capitalists by consciously combining the pursuit of profit with caring for the world around us.\\"One of the most interesting lessons was the idea that all work can be spiritual, and has a component of helping the world--even professions thought of as \\"lowly.\\"The book is peppered with examples of people who reap what they sow; each chapter offers a brief story of a grasping, conniving, back-stabber who is left destitute and friendless, followed by another vignette involving people who always saw their work as part of a higher good, who did very well financially while boosting the lives of others.And the authors even found an amazing quote by Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan--perhaps America's foremost booster of capitalism--on the problems that arise when greed replaces trust.They've isolated seven principles that businesses can take away not only from the heroism of firefighters and police officers on that fateful day, but also from the creation of a much deeper community as New York gathered itself together to heal, and accepted the love of the outside world (these are direct quotes): 1] pursuit of money without love is meaningless; 2] use your pursuit of money as a tool for spiritual growth; 3] profit cannot be earned form the suffering of others; 4] give to others what you wish to receive for yourself; 5] you have a sacred obligation to serve others through the divine nature of work; 6] employers and employees create a spiritual partnership based on mutual trust; 7] the spiritual purpose of business is to serve the community that supports it.Shel Horowitz's award-winning sixth book, Principled Profit: Marketing That Puts People First, demonstrates how to build a business around ethics, environmental sustainability, and cooperative practices--and how to develop marketing that highlights those advantages."},{"Title":"Spiritual Capitalism: What the FDNY Taught Wall Street About Money","review":"One of the best spiritual books I have ever read.

The 20th Maine is best known for its pivotal stand at Little Round Top on the second day of the Battle of Gettysburg, where a desperate bayonet charge saved the Union line and perhaps the Union Army.The 20th Maine's most famous regimental commander was pre-war college professor Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, who went on to post-war prominence as an educator and as governor of the State of Maine. His leadership at Gettysburg is known to more recent audiences from Michael Shaara's novel \\"The Killer Angels\\", and from the superlative Ken Burns documentary \\"The Civil War.\\" Chamberlein is however only one of many heroes to inhabit Pullen's narrative, closely documented from official archives, letters and personal histories of the war.\\"The Twentieth Maine\\" is very highly recommended as an exemplar of the regimental history genre, and as a superb read for students of the Civil War."},{"Title":"Bob Dylan: Performing Artist, Vol 2: The Middle Years 1974-1986","review":"The second volume of &quot;Bob Dylan, Performing Artist&quot; covers the less understood, less appreciated, but often more rewarding second part of Dylan's career.

Star Magazine or People don't go into what the rabbi and his wife do or the priest and his, and movie stars were never as enigmatic. Robert Warren Cromey tells you a great deal about his own sexuality right there in the 220 pages of Sex Priest, exactly how and when it was troublesome, and it what ways it enhanced his calling as an Episcopal priest. He shares with the reader the type of personal information many of us want to know about those in our lives and rarely get the opportunity to find out. A fascinating book."},{"Title":"Sex Priest","review":"With his new memoir, Sex Priest, Robert Cromey has done the churches a great service. He has opened up the private and personal life of a priest [his own] with unflinching honesty. He has neither minced words or glossed over events in describing his own sexual experience.It has been said that a person's unacknowledged shadow side will rise up destructively. The unacknowledged shadow side of an organization or system will do the same. For centuries the church has been undermined by sexuality hidden in the shadows of its life. It began, in all likelihood with the story of Adam and Eve. In the myth, nakedness and thus sexuality are signified as shameful; to be concealed, denied and repressed. Through history the churches have relegated the wonders of lust and sexual delight to darkness, sin and shadow. It is more than disastrous to note that women and women's sexuality have been cast into the same shadow as well. Since shame is more to be feared than death, there is great pressure to deny the existence of experiences that are, de jure, shameful.Once, however, that which has been driven into the shadow is seen for what it is, is self-confessed and welcomed into the fullness of one's persona, the healing energy that has been suppressed will emerge and new strength become available. It does take enormous energy to keep the shadow secret and conceal the behaviors that emerge from the hidden shadow.I have been a priest for 50 years and have contended with the sexual gyrations of clergy literally hundreds of times beginning in seminary and continuing through the years. From sad experience I know that the Roman Catholic Church has no monopoly on covering up clergy sexual problems. Protestant and evangelical hierarchs are as adept at the process as Roman Archbishops.The strategies are the same: Denial: It didn't happen. Admission 1: It did happen, but it was all in their minds. Admission 2: It did happen, it was real, but it's insignificant. Admission 3: It did happen. It was real and significant. We'll transfer the poor culprit and/or refer it to an expert.Robert Cromey's candor may open the gates to allow other clerics to identify, accept and integrate their sexual shadow sides. Sadly, it is unlikely that it will enable the church as a system to become more open, honest, and straightforward about all the dimensions of sexuality. Their first reaction will be to condemn Robert as an exception and renegade. They will call him eccentric, an aberration. Those deepest into denial will seek his excommunication/banishment.Sex Priest also reveals the passion for justice that has ruled Robert's life. He has been an unfailing minister and healer for those who have been marginalized because of their class, their race, their poverty, their gender, or their sexual orientation. He has embraced them all, welcomed them into his congregations and taken to the streets and City Hall in their cause.Thanks, Robert.A warning: Sex Priest is rated XXX for sexual language. Be honest! You talk the same way in private."},{"Title":"Home Wiring from Start to Finish","review":"This is the only book that describes simple single switch, three way switch circuits but also 4 way circuits in detail of wiring and operation.

There's only one story that seems to not fit and tends to be confusing: it's a rewriting of Shakespeare's Hamlet. I think you'll enjoy all the rest, though."},{"Title":"East, West Stories","review":"Great read and a very good quality and good price for this book. Everyone should read Salman Rushdie, he is great!"},{"Title":"East, West Stories","review":"These short stories were fun to read. I expected something like this from Rushdie, of which I had only read a college commencement speech and two pages from a novel. The East stories leave me a little more confused and mystified than the West, and the East, West fall on both sides. This makes sense as there is a North, South split in my own life. A good introduction to Rushdie I guess? The first few pages of Satanic Verses won't feel as odd or unexpected after this."},{"Title":"East, West Stories","review":"East, West is the first collection of short stories by Salman Rushdie. There are nine stories, six of which have been published previously in magazines. In the East section: Good Advice Is Rarer Than Rubies, where a woman seeking a permit to London gets some good advice from an advice wallah, but uses it is a way he doesn't expect; The Free Radio, where a rickshaw driver maintains his faith in a government reward from the sterilisation clinic; and The Prophet's Hair, where we learn that crime, especially in the form of theft of a holy relic, definitely does not pay. These have a decidedly eastern flavour. In the West section: Yorick, an interesting prologue to Hamlet that Shakespeare scholars might well enjoy; At the Auction of the Ruby Slippers, a speculation on what might be auctioned in an alternate world; Christopher Columbus and Queen Isabella of Spain Consummate Their Relationship, a speculation of what Columbus endured at the Spanish court. Finally, in the East, West section: The Harmony of Spheres, which explores a friend with schizophrenia, and has quite a twist in the tail; Chekov and Zulu, which looks at Indian diplomats in Britain during the time of Indira Ghandi's assassination and has very much the flavour of the Satanic Verses; and The Courter, a delightful tale of romance, cartoons and chess in the elderly, which has a slightly sinister edge to it. Rushdie's mastery of the language means these are filled with wonderful prose. His mock-Shakespearean and mimic-Indian are particularly entertaining. If there was not an autobiographical touch in The Harmony of Spheres and especially in The Courter, then these are certainly written from close experience, and are definitely my favourites."},{"Title":"East, West Stories","review":"East West is a short collection of short stories by Salman Rushdie. But there is nothing small or even limited about the themes they cover, nor anything bland about the palette Rushdie uses to colour his ideas. They were published in the mid-1990s, when the writer was deep into the confines of the fatwa that threatened his life. It is thus refreshing to reflect on the wide and poignant use of humour trough the collection.The stories are enigmatically arranged in three groups entitled East, West and East-West. They thus form a kind of triptych. In East we visit territory well known to readers of Rushdie. He is in the sub-continent, addressing notions of tradition and culture, notions that are interpreted and reinterpreted by change, personal ambition and by familial and religious associations.In West, Salman Rushdie presents Yorick's view of Hamlet and an encounter between Catholic Isabella and her hired man, Christopher Columbus. One is fiction superimposed on fact, while the other approaches the reader from the opposite direction. Both stories turn in on themselves, reverse roles and blur the distinctions between fact and fiction.In East-West we find people in new contexts, away from home, inhabiting places unfamiliar to them. We meet people who impose private, personal structures on a wider experience that others share. Misunderstandings create their own new language, and fiction expresses and interprets a shared reality.But what is continually astounding about these stories is the literary style that Salman Rushdie brings to almost every sentence. The pictures he draws are surreal, even hyper-real and yet utterly mundane, even prosaic at the same time. A change encounter with a particular object can evoke memory, visual allusion, lyrics from pop culture and tastes of what grandma used to cook. Then, in the next sentence, he can sustain the effect by unloading another bus-load of metaphors. The writing is arresting, but also beautifully fluid and entertainingly readable.For anyone who has tried Salman Rushdie's novels and recoiled at the challenge of their density, I would recommend these stories as a taster in miniature of what the bigger experience can sustain. Once you are used to the style, it flows easily."},{"Title":"East, West Stories","review":"The book takes on a stylistic journey through the the psyche's East and the West.

Definitely a decent read."},{"Title":"East, West Stories","review":"In the constant furor over Rushdie's novels, some may doubtthat a great writer lies behind the cause celebre.

Wow, good guess, considering that all that is written somwhere around. Enough with the joking.Well, having read most of Rushdie's work, I was finding myself, very often, suprised, about the fact that every educated reader in the world could find his work interesting. Or so the media tries to present it. As much as I do not appreciate his other work (including, Satanic verses and Midnight:Children) I must confess that these novels stand for the best ones I have ever read in my entire life.When westerner tries to grasp struggle that is (and still will be) going on between East and West, he can't run from prejudices which he breathes by mere fact of being westerneer. Upon reading this book, one does find himself wondering, what the hell happened to the world...These are the stories of prejudices, both East and West, stories of love and hate that exist in both spheres, told in language extraordinaire, stories that presents the world in his filth, and richness, in his sadness and loveability, stories that you'll remember long after the moment of reading has passed.I can only but recommend this book....(If you have any doubts, pleas call our emergency line at 1-800-HELP...j/k e-mail me)"},{"Title":"East, West Stories","review":"Controversial and acclaimed author Salman Rushdie has probably never stated one of his major literary themes as boldly as in the end of this book: \\"But I, too, have ropes around my neck, I have them to this day, pulling me this way and that, East and West, the nooses tightening, commanding, choose, choose. I buck, I snort, I whinny, I rear, I kick. Ropes, I do not choose between you. Lassoes, lariats, I choose neither of you, and both. Do you hear? I refuse to choose.\\" This passage nearly sums up the India born Rushdie who has spent most of his life writing and living in \\"the west.\\" In essence, he's chosen both. \\"East, West,\\" his sixth book of fiction, continues the quest to deconstruct enduring illusions between civilizations and peoples. As a collection of short stories, or fictions, its very structure suggests that the divides between us (namely, \\"East\\" and \\"West\\") may be a mere collection of fictions. Each equitable portion explores a different dimension: three stories take place in \\"the east,\\" three in \\"the west,\\" and in the final three the worlds collide. Nonetheless, the people and society remain fundamentally the same regardless of the dictates of geography. Nonetheless, the stories we do choose shape our lives.Each section also comes with its own savory flavors. The \\"East\\" stories read like rich adventure tales or romances, stories that may have emerged from \\"1001 Nights.\\" In contrast, the \\"West\\" stories contain a more experimental, intellectual, and heady tone. These sections collide, \\"East, West,\\" in a combination of tones that seem to favor a less experimental approach, while nonetheless retaining smatterings of the experimentalism that dominated the \\"West\\" section. A satisfying style sandwich results.The stories all read quickly and lucidly, making this collection of shorts by far Rushdie's most accessible literary work. Nonetheless, reading \\"East, West\\" will not prepare one for large complicated works such as \\"Midnight's Children\\" or \\"The Satanic Verses.\\" As such, this astonishingly short Rushdie book (some 200 pages) doesn't really give a taste for Rushdie's work as a whole, apart from some of his salient themes. Nonetheless, the book remains an intriguing and highly entertaining read, regardless of any aspirations to move to his more famous intimidating tomes.In the book's first story, \\"Good Advice Is Rarer Than Rubies,\\" we see gorgeous doe-eyed Miss Rehana presented with a choice. If she can only answer the questions posed by the consulate about her faraway, arranged bridegroom in England, she'll get to leave India. A lecherous trickster, Muhammad Ali, inadvertently tips her off to \\"the secret.\\" She seems content with her surprising choice. \\"The Free Radio,\\" the second story, tells of Ramani the rickshaw-wallah's travails with a thief's widow. He undergoes voluntary sterilization (the setting is Indira Gandhi's emergency) to seal this tenuous relationship. His hopes of attaining a free radio for this ultimate sacrifice go unrequited and he seeks solace in imaginary Bollywood stardom. The final \\"East\\" story, \\"The Prophet's Hair,\\" presents a hear-pounding read as an actual hair of the Prophet Muhammad goes astray in an Indian town. It ends up in the \\"collection\\" of the wealthy Hashim, who has no trouble rationalizing his irreverent greed. Much ado is made about something as Hashim's son turns up beaten by thugs and his daughter Huma seeks the worst of all criminals after Hashim turns fanatical. Huma seeks and finds the worst of thieves: Sheikh S&iacute;n. In the ensuing theft a few people expire and miracles occur. Magic lives.The \\"West\\" stories present a stark contrast to the tales preceding them. \\"Yorick\\" emerges from the Shandian 18th century in style and narrative. With complete Lawrence Sterne COCK AND BULL aplomb, a wildly unfocused narrator, along with an appropriate \\"reader in the text,\\" present a revisionist satirical history of Hamlet's bard Yorick. Retched halitosis plays a central role. \\"At The Auction of the Ruby Slippers\\" (significantly altered from the version that appeared in \\"The Wizard of Oz\\") evokes a dystopian present-future landscape where objects become holy relics worth dying for. Here, money dictates all value and meaning. Finally, \\"Christopher Columbus and Queen Isabella of Spain Consummate Their Relationship (Santa F&eacute;, AD 1492),\\" closes the \\"West\\" section as strangely as it began. Multiple narrators tell the political and social, complete with sensual undertones, of how Isabella I of Spain came to support Columbus on his journey. The final line leaves no doubt about where this relationship is going. Almost a bawdy romp.\\"East, West,\\" the final section, overlaps the two perspectives. \\"The Harmony of the Spheres\\" follows the \\"spiritual\\" quest of Eliot Crane and his friend. Both are seeking eastern-esque spirituality that seems both alien and distant. They also both end up cheating on each other in thought and reality. The narrator marries Mala, a rigid empiricist from Mauritania. She finds Eliot \\"bad,\\" but, as the narrator finds out, not all that bad. \\"Chekov and Zulu\\" mixes the Indian Secret Service with Star Trek. They discuss imperialism and loyalty as they carry out their mission in the days surrounding Indira Gandhi's assassination. One quits while the other goes down with Rajiv Gandhi. The final story, \\"The Courter,\\" follows an Indian family to England. Language, culture, expectations, and identity meld with mixed results. Their father asks a female store clerk for \\"nipples\\" and receives a smack, Grandma, Certainly-Mary, has trouble with words. which ends up charming Mixed-Up, the porter (she has trouble with 'p's and dubs him \\"courter,\\" giving him giddy ideas). Punks with Beatle haircuts (similar to the caricatures in \\"Satanic Verses\\") threaten the family and stab Mixed-up. Certainly-Mary decides she needs to go home, but the narrator, her grandson, chooses a life that straddles East and West. This leads to his pronouncement \\"I refuse to choose.\\"The effect of these tales, particularly when read together in a single reading, deconstructs presuppositions of what is \\"East\\" and what is \\"West.\\" Magic lives in both realms, as does greed, lust, confusion, racism, violence, and fanaticism. When these supposed cultures collide more magic, greed, lust, confusion, racism, violence, and fanaticism result, suggesting that neither is superior, but are each human-all-too-human. Both contain people sharing fundamental traits, desires, and ambitions. \\"East, West\\" highlights the similarities that underly our differences through a montage of stories showcasing people thrown into these worlds by nothing resembling choice. But the choices they do make (stay, go, or no choice) define the shape of their unchosen lives. In the end, the book raises nagging questions: what are these things we call \\"East\\" and \\"West?\\" Illusions? Distractions? Constructions? Or are they simply realms inhabited by people made, in essence, of the same stuff?"},{"Title":"East, West Stories","review":"I loved this book by Rushdie. I was first introduced to it as a selection in a seminar course, and have found myself going back to a number of the stories to re-read them - something I almost never do. The first three stories take place in India and play greatly with Western readers perceptions of Indians and Indian culture. The second selection of three stories takes place in the West. Some are contemporary while one is actually futuristic, bordering on sci-fi. The last three are a fussion of these two worlds. The stories are rich in their imagery, and definitely multi-layered. They prove to be an entertaining read for the casual reader, as well as an extremely intriguing read for those who are involved in a book club or academic enviornment. While some stories are difficult because of the Indian dialect or else due to the point at which the reader is dropped into the story, I would encourage one to keep reading. It will untangle into perhaps one of the best short stories you will encounter, and they are written this way for a reason. With Rushdie, nothing is left to chance, and there is a reason for everything in these stories whether it be the starting point, the dialect, the time frame, a character's name, etc. Definitely get this book. It is worth every penny."},{"Title":"East, West Stories","review":"Rushdie attempts at trying to reconcile his origins and his present state. Like the Enigma of Arrival by V.S. Naipaul, Rushdie asks the cultural Darwinism questions: How do displacedindividuals evolve in different cultures? How do they survive? Rushdie's answers however, are less than convincing, and perhaps even a little cloying. In trying to resolve the Occidental andOrientals worlds, Rushdie has fallen into the mould of most of his contemporaries: to wax lyrical about the mysterious and mystical East when it is convenient, and to attack with bitingvenom it's backwardness at other times. The thing that really gets my goat about this is that among those expatriate South Asian writers (with the exception of Naipaul and NiradChaudahri) who write of their homelands and their expatriate experiences, he seems to be the most ambivalent and yet most judgemental. When he judges the East, he uses the West'sstandards; when he judges the West, he uses Eastern standards. That's works for fiction, but not for apologies."},{"Title":"East, West Stories","review":"Reviewed by C.J.Singh (Berkeley, California, USA)In \\"Haroun and the Sea of Stories,\\" Salman Rushdie wrote about Khattam-Shud, thecult-master, whose goal was to drain the sea of stories, silencing creativeexpression. That book was an obvious metaphor for Rushdie's predicament: deathsentence from Islamic fundamentalists for his novel \\"The Satanic Verses.\\"His book \\"East,West: stories,\\" proves that Khattam-Shud has failed.In the meantime, Rushdie has gained enormous support from writers all over the globe,becoming a living martyr of secular-humanist values.\\"EastWest: Stories\\" comprises three parts: three stories set in the East, threein the West, and the final three about expatriates from the East living in theWest. His best stories are when the twain meets.In the 25-page story \\"Chekov and Zulu,\\" the two principal characters, bothIndians, are introduced to the reader only by their code names. Based in London,they are \\"intrepid diplonauts,\\" operating under the supervision of the IndianGovernment's intelligence division. Zulu is \\"a shy, burly, giant\\" Sikh; Chekov,in contrast, is \\"a small, slim, dapper man in grey flannels, stiff-collaredshirt and double-breasted navy blue blazer with brass buttons.\\" Chekov'sreligion is not explicitly stated, but several hints suggest that he is aMuslim. The two have known each other admiringly, affectionately, since schooldays at the elite Doon school in the Himalayan foothills.The story opens in London on 4 November 1984, a few days after the assassinationof Indira Gandhi in New Delhi. Chekov visits Zulu's home to inquire from hiswife about Zulu for he has not contacted the intelligence headquarters for twodays. Zulu's wife has not heard from him either. She resents being calledMrs. Zulu for \\"it sounds like a blackie.\\" She corrects Chekov, the proper namefrom Star Trek is Sulu.Zulu's wife is much distressed by the assassination and by the news on TVshowing hundreds of \\"our decent Sikh people done to death, as if all were guiltyfor the crimes of one-two badmash guards.\\" Chekov informs her that theintelligence chief, alarmed by Zulu's AWOL, now openly suspects Zulu to havejoined the U.K.-based pro-Khalistani militants whom he had been assigned to spyon. Chekov tells her that he is \\"fighting strenuously against the proponents ofthis view\\" of Zulu's absence, but also insinuates that \\"as some would say shemust know all too well.\\"The story time then flashes back to August, when Chekov had just arrived inLondon as acting deputy chief of intelligence. In this segment of the story,Rushdie brings in one of his characteristic political concerns. Although Chekovloves living in London, he is given to frequently comment that the British are\\"thieves, every last one...their fortunes and cities, built on the loot theytook... one forgives, of course; that is our national nature.\\" Zulu disagrees.He asks Chekov whether the poor tramp lying on a bench nearly is also guilty.Chekov retorts, \\"Never forget that the British working class collaborated forits own gain in the colonial project. Manchester cotton workers, for instance,supported the destruction of our cotton industry.\\" Zulu admonishes Chekov that\\"the colonial period is a closed book.\\" Says Chekov, \\"With my naturalradicalism, I should not have been a diplomat. I should have been a terrorist.\\"\\"But then we would have been enemies, on opposite sides,\\" muses Zulu, his eyesshedding genuine tears at the thought. The two friends reminisce about theirschool-days and pledge to work together as \\"blood brothers.\\" Rushdie draws bothcharacters with consummate skill and shows great sympathy for Zulu.The story flashes forward and Zulu calls his wife, but it is not clear after howmany days' absence. Chekov picks him up at a previously agreed upon spot. Zuluhands over a list to Chekov with \\"the names, places, dates ... the list wasbetter than anyone had expected ... in certain remote villages and urbanback-alleys in Punjab there would be a round-up for some big badmashes...\\"\\"Not long after they came off the motorway, Zulu said, 'By the way, I quit.'\\"Chekov stops the car. What's this? Did those extremists manage to turn yourhead or what?'Zulu replies: \\"Chekov, ji, don't be a fool. Who needs extremists when there are killings inDelhi? Hundreds, maybe thousands, Sikh men scalped and burned alive in front oftheir families. Boy-children, too. ...No Congress workers have been indicted. ...In spite of alltheevidence of complicity. Therefore, I resign. You should quit, too.\\"\\"If you have gone so damn redical,' cried Chekov, why hand over these lists atall? Why go half the bleddy hog?'\\" I am a security wallah,' said Zulu, opening the car door. \\"Terrorists of allsorts are my foes. But not apparently in certain circumstances, yours.Zulu quits and returns to Bombay where he achieves great prosperity as the ownerof a chain of personal security companies. Chekov continues in governmentservice and is killed in May 1991 while accompanying Rajiv Gandhi on the fatefulday when the former Prime Minister was blown to bits by a small Tamil womanexploding a powerful, suicidal firebomb.\\"Chekov and Zulu\\" is a brilliant story, although occasionally the English spokenby the Indian characters seems to be contrived to please a certain type ofnon-Indian reader. Doon school graduates don't talk like Kipling's babucharacters, Mr. Rushdie. (\\"Excellent jalebi, Mrs. Z. Thanking you.\\")\\"The Courter\\" appears to be the most autobiographical story in this book. Thenarrator, a sixteen-year old boy from Bombay studying in England, is trying tofind his identity, in \\"my enforced exile from the beloved country of my birth.''When his parents come to England for a year-long visit, he is troubled by hisconflicts with his father and the frequent quarrels his eleven-year old sisterpicks with the father: \\"As I witnessed their wars I felt myself coming unstuckfrom the idea of family itself ... and I looked at my choleric, face-pullingfather and thought about British citizenship... At sixteen, you still think youcan escape from your father. You aren't listening to his voice speaking throughyour mouth, you don't see how your gestures already mirror his; you don't seehim in the way you hold your body, in the way you sign your name. You don't hearhis whisper in your blood.\\"This story is interlaced with another--that of the family's sixty-year oldIndian housekeeper who is courted by an old East European porter. The twotransform their games of chess, modelled on war, to love. But at the same timeshe feels acutely homesick: \\"...her heart, roped by two different loves, wasbeing pulled East and West, whinnying and rearing like those movie horses beingyanked this way by Clark Gable and that way by Montgomery Clift, and she knewthat to live she would have to choose.\\" She goes back to Bombay. The narratormakes the opposite choice and acquires British citizenship. \\"But I too haveropes around my neck, I have them to this day, pulling me this way and that,East and West, the nooses tightening, commanding, choose, choose. I buck, Isnort, I whinny, I rear, I kick. Ropes, I do not choose between you. Lassoes,lariats, I choose neither of you, and both. Do you hear? I refuse to choose.\\" Inthis story, Rushdie poignantly describes another of his characteristic concerns:the predicament of inbetweenness.\\"The Harmony of the Spheres\\" is narrated by a former Indian student at Cambridgewho comes under the spell of a paranoid-schizophrenic Welsh writer of a book onthe occult arts. At the opening of the story the writer commits suicide;however, his dairies indicate that he had long \\"lubricious\\" sessions with thenarrator's wife immediately after their honeymoon. The characters in this storyare poorly portrayed and the plot contrived to the point of being altogetherineffective.In the East section, \\"Good Advice Is Rarer Than Rubies\\" is about a young Muslim womanseeking an immigrant visa to U.K. who deliberately botches up her interview withthe consular officer for she prefers to stay home. The story has an O.Henry-ishending. \\"The Free Radio\\" is a story about a young rickshaw driver who undergoes avasectomy for he mistakenly believes he will be rewarded with a free radio. Whenhe belatedly discovers that the reward scheme had already ended, he pretends hehas received a radio. The story is entertainingly written although it suffersfrom overt authorial intrusion.In the West section, \\"At the Auction of the Ruby Slippers\\" is a satiricalfantasy that addresses once again Rushdie's predicament. \\"See: behindbullet-proof glass, the ruby slippers sparkle. We do not know the limits oftheir powers. We suspect that these may not exist.\\" The ruby slippers arereputed to have magical qualities of crossing space and reversing time. Is itpossible that the ruby slippers can return the exile back home? Is there a homeleft to return to? \\" 'Home' has become such a scattered, damaged, variousconcept in our present travails. There is so much to yearn for.

This is, in my opinion, the best collection of short stories written in the later half of the 20th century. Rushdie is the greatest storyteller of our time, and this book is breathing proof."},{"Title":"East, West Stories","review":"I'm afraid that the stories in East, West, though occasionally interesting, really didn't do that much for me. It seems to me that the main reason for Rushdie being hailed as a great Eastern writer is that he is one of the very few currently well known ones, due to the publicity he got when clashing with Khomeini. I know he tried to write about life, to record on paper the lives of modern Indians in a modern age, except it doesn't feel very real. The dialogues are often bulky, sometimes clumsy. Maybe that's because of Indian conventions of speech translated into English. But it doesn't really seem like any of his characters could be real, breathing people, which is sort of the purpose of writing &quot;about life&quot;. Maybe that's because these are short stories and the characters don't have enough space to be fleshed out. But then again, many famous writers of short stories managed to record whole lives very accurately in a few pages (Chekhov, anyone?).That's not to say these are necessarily terrible. They're interesting enough, and most come with twists at the end that will genuinely surprise you. &quot;The Prophet's Hair&quot; is a nice Arabian Nights-like diversion, &quot;The Courter&quot; is kinda poignant, &quot;At the Auction...&quot; is kinda reflective and philosophical. But it's really not a book that I would _buy_, to keep on my shelf and come back to over and over. After reading it, I have utterly no desire to return to it.High point of the book: &quot;The Prophet's Hair&quot; or &quot;The Courter.&quot; They come the closest to making an impression. Low point of the book: Definitely &quot;Yorick,&quot; yet another bad modern bastardization of Hamlet which tries to be &quot;witty&quot; and &quot;literate.&quot; That story alone cost the book's rating a star."},{"Title":"East, West Stories","review":"East, West contains a wide variety of short story forms - from the classic story telling of Good Advice Is Rarer Than Rubies to the post-modern Yorick.

Enjoy."},{"Title":"East, West Stories","review":"The stories in this collection present lighter reading than Rushdie's mammoth novels such as Midnight's Children and The Satanic Verses but they display just as many of his lavish, elegant and rich prose writing talents. The stories focus on various cultural aspects of Western and Eastern societies - the lifestyles, events, stereotypes and prejudices that affect people in these areas, especially those who, like Rushdie, migrate from one to the other.The stories are vastly diverse - those in the 'East' section document important cultural events that are particular to Indian society - the woman seeking a Visa to travel West, the man who undergoes a vasectomy to get a free radio. Those in the 'West' section include a Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead esque reworking of Hamlet from the perspective of the minor characters and a whimsical portrayal of Christopher Columbus as beholden to the dominant whims of Queen Isabella rather than the pioneering bold explorer of legend.The final stories 'East, West' tackle issues of East, West cultural commingling. 'The Harmony of the Spheres' is the story of an Indian undergraduate at Cambridge University who encounters a paranoid schizophrenic, obsessed with the occult. Chekov and Zulu, the code names of two diplomats, is a story set in the historical context of Indian politics and mixes Western popular culture images in the unfamiliar context of Asian political circles. The final story 'The Courter' highlights perhaps the dominant theme we associate with East, West migration, the difficulties faced by poor immigrant families in London and the prejudices they suffer. The final page deftly highlights the sensation felt, perhaps by Rushdie himself, and many other people who have crossed frontiers: 'I...have ropes around my neck, I have them to this day, pulling me this way and that, East and West, the nooses tightening, commanding, choose, choose. I buck, I snort, I whinny, I rear, I kick. Ropes, I do not choose between you. Lassoes, lariats, I choose neither of you, and both. Do you hear? I refuse to choose'.

While at times there is a certain ambivalence in some stories, I think that is understandable in point of view of Rushdie's own background. It is an attitude that comes from being a product of two cultures and wanting to have claims to both, not just one or the other, as Rushdie so elegantly proclaims at the end of &quot;The Courter.&quot"},{"Title":"East, West Stories","review":"In the constant furor over Rushdie's novels, some may doubtthat a great writer lies behind the cause celebre.

A story about Yorick? Christopher Columbus? I am a fairly recent novitiate into the world of Rushdie (the only other novel of his I've read is\\"Midnight's Children\\"), and I must say I am continued to be amazed. Rushdie crafts believable worlds which, outwardly fantastic or not, suggest the possibility of elusive magic just out of reach but still quite tangible. He has an uncanny ear for dialogue; one is almost to be able to literally \\"hear\\" the words spoken by his characters, especially the Anglo-Indian spoken by characters from his homeland.There are nine stories in this volume, and though it is a quick read (I was able to read through the entire work in a single two hour sitting), the stories are immensely immersive. The stories are divided into three sections representing not only the locales for the setting, but also the cultural outlook of the characters described. The \\"East\\" stories blend the mysticism and political awareness I was familiar with from the previous Rushdie book I'd read, while the \\"West\\" stories reflect the fantastic madness of our Western culture. It's in the \\"East, West\\" section that Rushdie is his strongest. These stories deal with the collision of Rushdie's two backgrounds and the conflicts that arise from the struggle to maintain an identity between the confliction spheres of influence.This is perhaps a better introduction to Rushdie than \\"Midnight's Children\\". Not only did I have the cushion of reading a story I was already acquainted with, I did not have to struggle with the curious idioms of speech and political events that were unfamiliar to a child of the West.

I love when Rushdie digresses a bit and lets loose a curious flood of details, such as when describing a case of noxious bad breath, or, delivering a feast of images as he does in &quot;At The Auction of the Ruby Slippers.&quot; The stories are rewardingly short--you can enjoy an 11-minute vacation and come back with something to think about."},{"Title":"East, West Stories","review":"East, West is most readily accessible work of Rushdie. The stories are high entertaining, and each of the nine stories manages to create well-defined character sketches, as well as plots with interesting twists, myths and humor. The story about Columbus and Isabella is full of laughs, about Courter is full of sentimental exuberance, one about Chekov and Zulu delves into Indra Gandhi's assination and its effect on the friendship of a Sikh and a Hindu (very poignant for us who witnessed the tradegy), and there are others that deal with the charade of charlatan, the obsession of occult of some Cambridge students and so on. These stories reflect how well Rushdie captures both the Eastern and Western personalities and history and how he manages to combine them to make stories worth relishing."},{"Title":"Ultimate Doilies: 8 Thread Crochet Designs","review":"This is a beautiful book, designs by Patricia Kristoffersen, so no further explanation needed. The doilies look a little daunting to start with, especially if you are not used to US patterns or raised/twisted stitches, but with such brilliant instructions, and pictures to help, it's near impossible to go wrong. It's probably not for the faint-hearted or beginners, but if you love to crochet as much as I do, your own knowledge of what stitches and sequences of stiches should look like, will help you enormously. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who likes a challenge and loves beautiful designs."},{"Title":"Meeting Across the River","review":"While I like the Boss, I'm not actually a fan, so I was somewhat reluctant when a friend recommended this collection. I can't say how delighted and surprised I was by the stories. Although all inspired by the same song, the yarns were vastly different -- some comedic, others very intense. Eddie Muller's \\"Last Call\\" and Eric Garcia's \\"Meeting Across The River\\" were particularly compelling. A quick, memorable read, heartily endorsed!"},{"Title":"Meeting Across the River","review":"Some of these short story's were very depressing. Some were so flowery that you had to concentrate on what the author was saying."},{"Title":"Meeting Across the River","review":"I have to say - I'm a Springsteen fan to begin with, but this has to be one of the most creative ideas I've ever seen anyone come up with.

It is, first and foremost, a systems approach to social science. But it is more than that. It is also a unifying evolutionary framework and a plausible world view.

I started it way back then, got a few chapters into it and for some reason or other I can't remember, never finished it; while unpacking after a recent move I came across it and decided to read it through. Sometime you get a second chance at something really good and this was one of those times. Boulding packs a lot of knowledge into this work, and deals with this very abstract topic in a very enjoyable and concise manner. Each chapter is well arranged, and I particularly enjoyed his discussion of latent vs. manifest. A lot has happened since I purchased this book and it is still as relevant now as it was then. I am not sure if he ever found his Joshua, but the promised land certainly seems closer because of his having written The Image."},{"Title":"A Clear North Light: Book One of the Lithuanian Trilogy","review":"From what I have read by the other reviewers it appears I am the only reviewer thus far of Lithuanian blood. My parents were both born and raised in that country while I grew up the first in my family to be born in the United States (my sister was born near a Displaced Persons Camp in Bamberg, Germany). My sibilings and I were raised in Detroit, Michigan speaking the Lithuanian language.The book jacket indicates that the author visited Lithuania in 1996 \\"where she interviewed fifteen people about how living under Nazi and then Soviet domination affected their faith lives.\\" From this experience she wrote this first of a trilogy about the (fictional) life of one Petras Simonaitis, a Protestant Lithuanian. It is interesting that she picked a Protestant for the lead character as the majority of Lithuanian people are Catholic. She, however, only appears to have included two Catholics of any importance in the book. One, a Catholic priest, was depicted as a rather materialistic weakling, a brother to the antagonist (the Baron) a Nazi sympathizer. The other was the love and future wife of the lead character (Simonaitis). Aside from having made the murderer of Simonaitis sister, Ona, the son of a Protestant minister she seemed to have nothing positive to say about the Catholic church in Lithuania. This I think is a major flaw. When after years of occupation by the Soviets the Lithuanian regained their independence in 1990 it was through a strong faith and identification with the Catholic church that spurned their independence movement. This fact cannot be ignored.Additionally while the author spent a lot of time describing the horrible plight of Jewish Lithuanians she had almost nothing to say about the thousands of non Jewish Lithuanians who were forcibly deported by the Soviets or murdered for underground resistance after the final occupation in 1944. (Unfortunately these national heroes, our \\"partizanai\\" or freedom fighters have not had the recognition they deserve in world history books.) I would like to have seen more anti Communist material. As bad as Adolph Hitler was to the Jews, a far worse Antichrist was realized in the form of Jospeh Stalin.Although in some ways the book reads well and to those who have previously not known anything about Lithuania (or cared as one reviewer previously put it) it does have some value. I wouldn't necessarily end up recommending it, however, to anyone if they wanted to really learn about the country of Lithuania."},{"Title":"A Clear North Light: Book One of the Lithuanian Trilogy","review":"As the dark shadows of World War II march through Lithuania, Petras Simonaitas, a stained-glass artisan, watches in horror at the atrocities inflicted by the Nazis on his Jewish friends and neighbors. Petras finds that there is no safe harbor against racism and hate as the cruel fingers of Hitler's nightmare reach into the lives of those he loves.A Nazi sympathizer, Baron Pavel Gerulaitis, forces Petras' sister, Ona, a beautiful blonde, blue-eyed woman who fits the design of Hitler's so-called \\"master race,\\" to his castle. When she dies, the Baron's lustful eye turns toward Rima, the girl that Petras loves. After a brutal rape, Rima begins to fade away in front of Petras. What can he do to protect her? And how can he stand against the flood of hate that is threatening his beloved Lithuania?The first in Schunk's Lithuanian trilogy, A CLEAR NORTH LIGHT is a compelling look into a time of human suffering. The reader sees into the hearts of those who fought valiantly against a reign of violence and destruction. Schunk masterfully takes us inside the lives of her characters and allows us to feel their pain and rejoice in their triumph of faith and spirit. A CLEAR NORTH LIGHT will capture readers and hold them until the very end."},{"Title":"A Clear North Light: Book One of the Lithuanian Trilogy","review":"Until I read this book I barely knew where Lithuania is, and didn't know (or care) much about the country...I thought. Boy, was I in for a surprise. The history in this story is unknown to most. It certainly was to me. But, how significant, how moving, how dramatic, it was in WWII times, and is in the political world we have today. The story by itself is well-written, the characters achingly real. I loved being a part of the drama and heroism of their lives. It was very satisfying to become involved in this story, to learn important history so easily, and to understand that individuals, in Lithuania, in the USA, and everywhere, do make a difference. This book shows each of us that, around the world daily, real &quot;little&quot; heroes, unheard of, are starring in life stories that make all our lives richer.Thank you Laurel Schunk.

But here's one reader who says, &quot;It WAS worth it.&quot;"},{"Title":"A Clear North Light: Book One of the Lithuanian Trilogy","review":"Other than the setting, i.e., Lithuania, I found the book a great disappointment.

I found that a lot of addresses for museums and tourist information have changed (I visited Argentina in October-December 1999). Though the included local maps are usually very good and easy to read a first stop should always be the tourist office (ask locals for present address) for more up to date information. Background information on history is excellent. Generally I found the guide very helpful but it lacks enthusiasm for this beautiful country and does not really entice one to go. More descriptions about the essential character of individual towns would help."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Argentina, Uruguay & Paraguay (2nd ed.)","review":"The information on anything but the major cities was fairly skimpy. It was organized reasonably well by geographic location, but within a location was difficult to use. The maps were decent and conveniently placed. Recommendations on restaurants were sparse and inaccurate."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Argentina, Uruguay & Paraguay (2nd ed.)","review":"It is certainly a useful book to have with you when travelling in these places, but I was a bit disappointed on the &quot;opinion&quot; side of it. I.e. it's a very useful reference resource in your backpack, but it's rather hard to plan a trip relying on it. In city desctiptions, the author tends to get carried away by colonial history and gives hardly any insight at all WHY would someone want to go to these places. So: have one with you when you leave home, but get some others to back you up before you decide where to go."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Argentina, Uruguay & Paraguay (2nd ed.)","review":"Written for Lonely Planet, Bernhardson's book is, like most LP books, a thorough guide to a region of the world. Numerous places to stay and eat from a variety of price ranges are listed, and the LP tradition of offering extensive historical and cultural background along with dozens of activities appealing to all interests is maintained. This book, as is the case with most LP publications, has as its target audience the &quot;respectful&quot; traveler, who is seeking to gain a deeper understanding of the places he or she visits than the tourist who simply stays in four or five-star hotels and sees travel as one big shopping spree. Nevertheless, all audiences are well served by the enormous quantity of material present in Bernhardson's book, especially the parts dealing with rural/small-town Argentina and the Falklands/malvinas. Therein lies my sole complaint about the book. The section on The Falklands/Malvinas Islands is enormous, in comparison with the section on Buenos Aires. One would get the impression that the Falklands/Malvinas are the center of all Southern Cone activity, while Buenos Aires is at best a second-class city. The section on Buenos Aires is somewhat impoverished in comparison with write-ups on huge cities in other LP books; it seems one almost HAS to resort to buying the LP Buenos Aires book in compensation. The main scarcity is in the area of things to do in Bs. As.; Bernhardson does well in his list of hotels and restaurants, but really doesn't describe the city in any striking detail or provide a very adequate rundown of what there is to do there (unless all that is mentioned REALLY IS all there is to do in Bs. As., in which case I recant my criticism). Overall, the book is well researched and up to date. To reiterate, the only area in which the book appears unbalanced is in the wealth of information on the Falklands/Malvinas alongside the skimpy information on Buenos Aires. The section on Montevideo, on the other hand, was very informative and complete. I can't speak on the quality of the sections on paraguay and rural Uruguay, because I didn't make it to either place on my trip. Overall, this book is a fine example of the Lonely Planet tradition of top notch travel guides"},{"Title":"Thrown Pottery Techniques Revealed: The Secrets of Perfect Throwing Shown in Unique Cutaway Photography","review":"it doesn't contain glaze recipes of the finished pieces that are pictured in the book. that's the only complaint i have. it was given to me when i first started throwing and i've found myself going back to it even as i advance."},{"Title":"Thrown Pottery Techniques Revealed: The Secrets of Perfect Throwing Shown in Unique Cutaway Photography","review":"this replaces the same book that i mysteriously lost. it's a great book for a beginner, which is what i am. easy to understand with good photography and projects. it's the book i use the most when hand building."},{"Title":"Thrown Pottery Techniques Revealed: The Secrets of Perfect Throwing Shown in Unique Cutaway Photography","review":"I own almost every book on pottery out there and when it comes to the catogory of wheel throwing this one is the best.

(Jesus Christ and Napoleon being good bets as well.) For the average person, or heck the historian, the hundreds of books one finds even in the local bookstore beg the question, \\"So what's worth my money, and what's bogus?\\" Mr. Dunnigan attempts to answer this question with a short list of fifty books, covering the strategic aspects of WW2. The work includes popular history as well as scholarly books; the author's view being if you want to study the war, you're going to have to plod through some primary source material. I'm not normally a huge fan of Mr. Dunnigan. IMHO, he tends to dismiss inconvenient details in presenting his thesis. But overall, the choices and evaluations of the author are pretty good- not much to critique here. With two exceptions: he touts his previous works, \\"Dirty Little Secrets of WWII\\" and \\"The Pacific War Encyclopedia\\" in an appendix. Well, issues of ego aside, neither of these works is authoritative enough in my mind for inclusion in a list like this. That aside, this is a great reference for anyone to start independent research in what is probably the most significant event, ever."},{"Title":"The World War II Bookshelf: 50 Must-Read Books: Fifty Must-Read Books","review":"In \\"The World War II Bookshelf: Fifty Must Read Books\\", James F. Dunnigan tackles the demanding task of assembling a list of the best books on the enormously complex subject of World War II.If you took all the literature pertaining to World War II and placed it all in one spot, you would be swimming in an ocean of books. I am speaking of military and social histories, military strategies and campaigns, armaments and technologies, intelligence and spying, biographies and personal memoirs, and historiographies. Multiply these by both Allied and Axis powers and you had better get out your life jacket. In addition, there are still more books being published each year as new archival material becomes available to researchers and writers.Hurrah! for Dunnigan, who has taken the valiant yet dangerous plunge into the deep sea of World War II books in order to give us his 50 must read books. Dunnigan divides his book into five chapters wherein he offers readers a selection of books that cover the war from many, but not all angles. A clear synopsis follows each recommendation that describes what the reader can expect from the book. His reviews cover issues like military campaigns and strategies for fighting the war on the ground, atop and beneath the oceans, and in the air. These reviews allow readers to make a more informative decision as to what World War II books they may wish to purchase.Dunnigan's list covers some of the best books on this global epic. I was delighted to see that a couple of my favorites made his list: \\"A World at Arms\\", by Gerhard Weinberg, as well as Winston Churchill's \\"The Second World War\\". Gerhard Weinberg's book is a marvel of research and writing; it provides an incredible amount of detail - in a single volume. When it comes to World War II, it is difficult to imagine anyone writing a more superior account than Winston Churchill did. Churchill was intrigued by all things military. The fact that he lived and lead his country during that time made him one of the greatest military leaders of the war. It also gave Churchill a clear and expert understanding of the intricacies of war. While both titles are works of tremendous importance, they tend to be quite complex - especially \\"The Second World War\\" which was published in six volumes.Dunnigan' list is very useful for those wishing to build a formidable library on World War II. I own most of the books and enjoy reading and using them for research. Some of these gems are hard to come by - you may have to buy some of them used, but most are readily available. In his first chapter, \\"The Big Picture,\\" Dunnigan presents us with a selection of books for general reading on World War II. His list contains some of the best World War II books, but I think that to better enjoy them, new readers of World War II history need to begin with even more general reading. With this in mind, I would recommend James L. Stokesbury's \\"A Short History of World War II,\\" \\"A War to be Won: Fighting the Second World War,\\" by Williamson Murray and Allan R. Millett, and \\"The Story of World War II,\\" by Donald L. Miller. All three books are excellent entry-level reading that may be considered before diving into Dunnigan's list.I am partial to World War II memoirs - who better can describe the horrors of war, but the men who did the fighting. Therefore, I recommend, along with George S. Patton's gripping \\"War As I Knew It,\\" one of my favorite memoirs that was written by a common soldier, entitled \\"With the Old Breed,\\" by E.B. Sledge. Sledge wrote about the brutality of war and those who fought in it - his description of the fears and stench of death are startling.Apart from these additions, I say congratulations are in order for James F. Dunnigan's superb and very readable book, \\"The World War II Bookshelf: Fifty Must Read Books\\". The book is an absolute winner and is prominently placed on my World War II bookshelf. I salute you."},{"Title":"The World War II Bookshelf: 50 Must-Read Books: Fifty Must-Read Books","review":"I found that this book was not only helpful in narrowing down the choices of the many books about WWII, but also in informing the reader. However Dunnigan can tend to write very lengthy summaries of each book, which can sometimes be a turn-off. I love history, but I also love English, and because of this, I noticed the greatest number of grammar mistakes and type-o's in any one book I've ever read. These can sometimes be a nuisance, for you may have to re-read sentences to make sense of them. He can also go from scholarly sounding to tired/lacking sounding. But he can also be humorous in some of his definitions and witty comments. Though I did have some frustrations while reading this book, I found it to be a helpful and educational guide to the 50 must read texts on WWII."},{"Title":"The World War II Bookshelf: 50 Must-Read Books: Fifty Must-Read Books","review":"I'm giving this book four stars. I'm using it, so that is in itself a recommendation. However, there are problems. I wouldn't have put \\"Soviet Casualties and Combat Losses\\" so high in his list. Important it may be, but with so little text, mostly just tables of statistics, I'd put it lower, an adjunct for those want to peruse such statistical tables. Some of recommendations are out of print and are unobtainable only used, and even then at very high prices. Lastly, and most importantly to me, personal accounts are left out, by design. Such personal accounts have been among the most memorable books I have read about World War II. Use the list in conjunction with other lists or other sources of recommendations."},{"Title":"The World War II Bookshelf: 50 Must-Read Books: Fifty Must-Read Books","review":"I really liked this book. I use it to further add books to my Wishlist. Dunnigan's mini-summaries of included books are loaded with details. I have several books by Dunnigan all of which I have enjoyed reading. Some other reviewers have provided less than glowing reviews of some of his books. I try to keep things in perspective so flaws noted are not ignored. Given his background and experiences, I suspect James Dunnigan might be a very interesting author to meet in person."},{"Title":"The World War II Bookshelf: 50 Must-Read Books: Fifty Must-Read Books","review":"If you are a lifelong student of World War Two or just starting out- this is the book for you. It is author James Dunnigan's take on the 50 books you must be familiar with to have a deep understanding of that gigantic conflict.His book deals with both the general and the specific.He examines big scale accounts of the war when dealing with Gerhard L. Weinberg's classic A World at Arms as well as more intricate subjects such as code breaking and soldier morale.(His description of The American Soldier by S.A Stouffer and others is fascinating. This study looks at survey's done by the military during the war to \\"get a handle \\" on the new army made up of mainly draftees. I was unaware of this and I am looking forward to reading it) Dunnigan's necessary reads include the Western, Eastern and Asian Fronts.The war on land, sea and air are all represented.He gets inside the head of famous commanders by discussing War as I knew it by George S. Patton and Crusade in Europe by Dwight Eisenhower.I learned much from Dunnigan's work- but no one book can include all aspects of the conflict and there are some minor flaws. The role of Ultra code breaking was critical to Allied victory but there are too many books on that topic in this work. An inside view of battles through the eyes of common soldiers is not really included.Hitler was not the only major figure in this World War-but a good biography of him(Kershaw for example) is needed. John Keegan is mentioned in this book but his fine overview of WW2 is not nor is his Six Armies in Normandy.The Holocaust is a key part of the Second World War and a book on that topic is needed in any must read bookshelf. (It could be an overview by Martin Gilbert or a specific monograph such as Christopher Browing's Ordinary Men) Over all this is a very interesting book that reminds us that there is so little time and so much to read and understand. Mr. Dunnigan helps us on that quest."},{"Title":"The World War II Bookshelf: 50 Must-Read Books: Fifty Must-Read Books","review":"Just reading through the reviews made this book a page turner. Dunnigan gives enough information to give you a pretty good idea of the scope of the books."},{"Title":"The Deep Sky: An Introduction (Sky & Telescope Observer's Guides)","review":"The well written content of this book aids the reader in star-hopping to find about 300 of the finest deep sky objects down to 60S declination, using excellent text, photos and sketches to describe their appearance.The first five chapters contain excellent instructive material, followed by the seasonally ordered descriptive material. The reference material in the back includes useful listings of data on the objects described in the book, the constellations, the Messier Objects, an excellent Bibliography and useful addresses listing many web sites in both cases, in addition to a Star Atlas.The unusual atlas included at the back is appropriate for the magnitudes of the objects described in the book. Unfortunately the author failed to include a crucial bit of information for each description by omitting a page reference for the location of the objects in the Atlas. Perhaps this will be corrected in a future edition of a book which will certainly merit further printings.Despite this annoying defect, this is a good buy and a valuable tool for a beginning star observer. Although some of the objects described can be seen with good binoculars and a few with the naked eye, you will need at least a 100mm telescope or better to see many of them."},{"Title":"The Deep Sky: An Introduction (Sky & Telescope Observer's Guides)","review":"This work by Phil Harrington should be in the reference library of any amateur astronomer. Although it has been to some extent superseded by the author's &quot;Star Watch&quot; , information is provided on a more exhaustive listing of objects.The general impression one receives upon cracking the cover of this book , is of library quality rather than a &quot;field book&quot; , since the paper stock is of high quality gloss finish. I would use this book indoors to plan my observing sessions and use either photocopies of the star charts appended at the end of the book , or a field type star chart for outdoor use.More classes of objects are covered in this volume than in &quot;Star Watch&quot; : galaxies , asterisms , star clusters , multiple stars , and quasars are all represented. Rather extensive verbal descriptions are included with directions for finding approximately 300 celestial objects , along with very interesting descriptions and explanations of them. The only criticism I have is that a few of the Messier objects are not included.In a direct comparison with &quot;Star Watch&quot; , I find this volume to be more difficult to use. For a beginning astronomer , I would recommend this book as a follow-up project once the skies are familiar. &quot;Star Watch&quot; is a bit more user friendly for beginners. I still rate this work 5 stars and recommend it. The author has an excellent approach to finding and explaining celestial wonders."},{"Title":"The Deep Sky: An Introduction (Sky & Telescope Observer's Guides)","review":"I have a well used, copy of this book that I find essential while planning a nights viewing session; I also keep it next to my telescope when observing. As the title suggests, only deep sky objects such as nebulas and galaxies are covered. Objects like the moon and planets are \\"shallow sky\\" objects and aren't listed. Most of the objects are probably visible in telescopes of medium size from dark sky locations.This book is divided into 3 main portions. The first briefly covers various types of objects, and equipment and techniques to observe them. The next part lists constellations seasonally. Deep sky objects are listed along with descriptions and star-hopping methods for locating them. The last part is a Mag 6 star atlas, with all the listed objects shown.One of the other reviewers bemoaned that the descriptions don't mention the pages they appear in the atlas. I agree it would be a nice touch, and is the one thing that I'd wish for.In my case, I've scribbled notes and underlined portions of text.Despite this, I highly recommend this book. I find it one of the better beginner-intermediate selections in this field. It doesn't take up too much valuable space, but lists a number of objects both common and overlooked. I keep it with my charts, and it's one of a very select group of objects I keep with my telescope."},{"Title":"Philosophy and Contemporary Issues","review":"While another review on this book points to the fact that it does not cover \\"the classics of philosophy,\\" I found it to be an interesting introduction to the discipline.

But, I found it to be enlightening due to its nature.I have tried to circle through some of the \\"classics\\" and often have a difficult time relating them to the modern world.

It is a splendid anthology that shows us how philosophy adds to our understanding of the world around us and how to think about abstract and complex subjects. It sheds light on the most fascinating subjects and it inspired me to read more on some of the topics. It covers general topics, each with about a half dozen well written article, in six chapters. Freedom and determinism, God and Religion, Morality an society, State and Society, Mind and Body and, lastly, Knowledge and science.

System and software engineers will recognize and appreciate the fact that this book bases its advice on real world experience - the kind you get only from working on complex projects.A well-defined plan of migration is presented early on for a complex retail supply system migration. Each phase of the plan is presented and explained in detail - covering both management and development perspectives equally well. For those of us who spend our days in a developer's world, the additional information on managing the migration effort contributes the right mix of information for what we are tasked to accomplish. I appreciated the technical specifics that were included throughout (i.e., utilizing Enterprise Java Beans) so that I didn't need to use my imagination as to how this plan would fit into my current project. Everything you need to know about legacy migration and then some is covered in this book. I knew that when I started to agree with what I was reading (aka Been There Done That) and could relate what was in the book to my own experience that I had found a winner.This book is a good read and a great reference guide to help you get through a large, complex legacy migration. When you finally finish the book, take another look to capture all the detail you missed on your first read-through."},{"Title":"Modernizing Legacy Systems: Software Technologies, Engineering Processes, and Business Practices","review":"This book describes the process and technologies involved in updating a legacy system. Chapters 1 through 4 do a very good job of describing the problems inherent in working with legacy systems, which the authors define simply as having \\"code that was written yesterday.\\" I couldn't agree more with their perspective. Once code is written, it needs to be maintained, updated, and managed, whether it is COBOL, Fortran, PowerBuilder or Java; all code becomes legacy code once it is written.Early in the book, the authors present a Unified Modeling Language (UML) activity diagram to describe their proposed process for updating legacy systems. They then open each chapter by depicting where they are in the process -- from Portfolio analysis completed (modernization candidates selected) to Modernization plan defined. The book defines ten main steps and two checkpoints for completing this process, including decision points to determine whether modernization is the correct choice.To describe the process in detail, the authors follow a legacy system modernization project over the course of the book. As process experts from the Software Engineering Institute (SEI), they consulted on this project, which was to update and Web-enable a primarily COBOL retail supply system. The case study helps readers understand the flow of the process the authors recommend and brings reality to their suggestions, although at times they abandon the \\"story\\" and go into overly minute detail, discussing every process option they could have chosen. I would have liked them to focus more deeply on the option they did choose, and to discuss at greater length how to be successful with that option (or any other). A good example of this is the discussion in Chapter 4 around requirements. The authors do a good job of describing where to get requirements from, but never discuss good processes and techniques for gathering those requirements. In most situations I have been involved in around requirements, knowing where to go wasn't much of a challenge, but knowing how to elicit them was.The book does a good job of describing the different technologies the project used as well as others available for modernization efforts -- Java/J2EE, Web Services, wrapper code, and different packaged systems -- providing an overview of each technology as well as customized ways to write integrations from the legacy systems to modern ones. They discuss screen scrape technologies as well as screen rewrites, but focus mainly on modernizing the software. This was a little disappointing: Based on the title, I expected to see discussions of all the hardware, software, development processes and additional technologies involved in modernizing systems.Overall, however, I learned a lot from the book, and it confirmed many of my beliefs about the importance of modernizing legacy systems and the best approaches to use. The authors provided good strategies for understanding systems that are already in place starting with the workflow they follow throughout the book. They then go into examples which include modeling, requirements management and the process they followed. What was a bit lacking is the actual process for implementation. The book focuses primarily on understanding what you have, designing for change, and planning how to get where you want to go, but it doesn't go far enough into what you actually have to do to get there. I would recommend this book for people who need a better understanding of the processes and technology decisions you must make made when building software systems. For most of us in the industry, no matter what we are working on, there's probably a legacy system involved in some way."},{"Title":"Modernizing Legacy Systems: Software Technologies, Engineering Processes, and Business Practices","review":"Addressing a timely and vital topic, 'Modernizing Legacy Systems' is an excellent book from the standpoints of both content and presentation. The advocated approach, which is termed the Risk-Managed Modernization (RMM) Approach, is synopsized on page 28 in UML activity diagram form. The exposition in the subsequent chapters is keyed to corresponding activities in this diagram. This key makes it quite easy to situate and interrelate the coverage of the respective chapters in the context of the RMM Approach. I found this recurring orientation feature to be very helpful in understanding and integrating the book's content.The book describes, rationalizes, and selectively illustrates the RMM Approach, where the continued availability of the legacy system capabilities is necessary over the sequence of modernization increments. While the approach is illustrated through an incremental transformation of a legacy COBOL-based system to a Java-based derivative, the RMM Approach is nevertheless applicable to other modernization problems or technologies. Moreover, the book does an exceptionally good job of interweaving explanations with examples. These examples are modest but salient and revealing, thereby avoiding unwarranted detail or distractions.The advocated approach is at once both architecture-centric and component-centric. Architecture centricity captures and sustains a rather specific vision of the as-desired system, and the associated target architecture provides a stable reference over the various modernization activities. Component centricity enables the identification, analysis, grouping, and ultimate realization of system elements that are allocated to the respective modernization increments. Overall then, the target architecture establishes the initial and termination points of a modernization project, and the componentization installments determine the actual redevelopment trajectory connecting the project end points.For me, the most intriguing, innovative, and vital parts of the approach appear under the RMM activities labeled Define Modernization Strategy and Reconcile Strategy with Stakeholder Needs (Chapters 13-15 and Chapter 16, respectively). Basically, the modernization strategy provides a systematic approach to delineating, analyzing, and grouping modernization elements through an examination of the legacy system implementation, subject to project constraints and certain prior higher-level technical decisions. Then, the finalization of element groupings into sequential increments is determined using programmatic preferences of the various stakeholders. This two-stage definition of modernization increments is driven prominently by cost and risk considerations, as well as by programmatic and technical factors. Ultimately, the designated increments establish waypoints on the aforementioned redevelopment trajectory, thereby identifying interim architectural configurations that facilitate closure on the target architecture, while simultaneously maintaining user capabilities during the modernization effort.In all, 'Modernizing Legacy Systems' is a readable, coherent, illuminating, and surprisingly broad treatment of a vital topic. Hopefully, the RMM Approach or variants thereof will see widespread use in industry, thereby exploiting &quot;a systematic and fact-based method that avoids arbitrary, intuitive decision making...&quot;"},{"Title":"Patriarchy at Work: Patriarchal and Capitalist Relations in Employment, 1800-1984 (Feminist Perspectives from Polity Press)","review":"Walby offers a sweeping analysis of patriarchy and gender inequality in industrial society. In one instance, she studies gender relations in employment from 1800 to 1914. In other words, virtually from the start of the Industrial Revolution.While women were always employed by factories, she points out that it is very difficult to find surviving written views of those women from the 1800s. At that time, universal literacy (including for girls) was still being introduced. So many of those women would have had limited literacy. And even then, writings were seen as the purview of the white collar classes. Walby describes well this paucity of female worker viewpoints. A reader might compare this to finding written testimonies by ex-slaves in the US from that same period."},{"Title":"The future of socialism","review":"It's a sign of the times we're in that this book was a bombshell on the British Left of its day, an iconoclastic, tour de force of revisionist thinking to equal 'Die Voraussetzungen des Sozialismus', the original revisionist text of Eduard Bernstein written at the turn of the century in Germany. Tony Crosland immediately became a saint to rightward-leaning moderate socialists and a devil to the traditional Left. His attempt to re-cast socialism for the post-war era was seen by some as a betrayal and a repudiation of socialism itself while, for others, it showed the way forward and excavated the essential values of the socialist movement out from under a host of unnecessary and destructive accretions that had attached themselves to it.After reading the book and comparing Crosland's revised socialism with the state of much post-1990's socialist and social-democratic thinking, it is somewhat jarring to note that, were he alive today, Crosland would probably be seen on the Left of the Labour movement rather than the Right where he was in his own day. Moreover, although it has often been argued that the modern Labour Party is the living fruit of his work, I think it unfair in a way (rather as it is, to a degree, unfair to lay 20th Century communism at Marx' feet) to attribute the Blair years to Tony Crosland's legacy. The man has been misunderstood it seems by friend and foe alike. Far from being the scribblings of a craven sell-out to free-market capitalism, this book reveals itself to be the work of a highly-intelligent, principled democratic socialist trying to argue, in essence, that socialism had been misdefined by history as 'state-ownership of the means of production' whereas the true essence of the socialist movement had always been in extending democratic participation and control into society. According to Crosland, democracy and equality are the hallmarks of socialism rather than the nationalisation of enterprises. This argument (in a sense much more radical than bland proposals to put public enterprises under dull, bureaucratic administration, in no way more meaningfully 'popular property' than privately-owned firms) rests on firm ground with regard to the history of socialist ideas. The identification of socialism with the state is, indeed, largely an accident of history and the circumstances produced by the 1920's and 30's, more than a sacred principle of socialist economics (as any glance at the debates among different branches of the socialist movement as far back as Marx' time will reveal).In coming to this not-unprecedented position, Crosland was largely paralleling the concerns and approach of Swedish Social Democracy, arguably one of the most successful political movements in the 20th Century. Capitalism, he argued, due to the political advances made by working people in the post-war period through democratic self-organisation, was no longer really capitalism at all. Capital was being subdued and tamed for the benefit of society as a whole, removing the need for the militant approach of the more traditional left-wingers. Socialism, in other words, was already bearing its fruits through the mixed economy of the 1950's.Sadly, although Crosland may have sounded more convincing in the golden, Keynesian era that followed WWII, today's capitalism is re-discovering its old bite and is busy throwing off the chains briefly imposed on it by democracy. Crosland's book is a wonderful product of a keen mind and compassionate heart and it deserves to be read and studied by democratic socialists. Its assumptions however, now require a new revision (though not, I would suggest, of his central assertion which was true in the time of Bernstein and just as true today, that the struggle of socialists is ever the struggle for a more democratic, more participatory society). This message, long affirmed by all democratic socialists, is eloquently argued in this book and deserves to be heard again- even more now that the historical dead-end of state socialism no longer exists to distract us or confuse the debate. There may be little that is programmatically useful for modern socialists in this book as the death of Keynesianism has resurrected a much fiercer version of disembedded capitalism that Tony Crosland, in his time, had believed dead forever, yet there is much of value in the spirit in which this book is written, and much still to be admired in the values it expresses."},{"Title":"Daily Dose of Toxins","review":"This book is a must have for any healing modality practitioner, especially NAET practitioners. It provides a wealth of information and helps you, as a Practitioner, on your investigative journey."},{"Title":"A practical guide to nutrition, feeds, and feeding of catfish (MAFES bulletin)","review":"I love Clive James' writing - especially his wry style of combining haughty superciliousness with biting self-deprecation, often within the space of one line. He writes like he speaks, with a verbose sarcasm, and throughout reading May Week Was In June it's almost impossible not to hear his nasal, scoffing tones narrating the book for you.And while this third (and final?) instalment in his autobiographical memoirs (following the hugely funny Unreliable Memoirs and equally hilarious Falling Towards England) contains the familiar elements of James' comedic style, it doesn't quite measure up to its two predecessors.Unreliable Memoirs, where James told of his childhood days in post-war suburban Sydney, didn't have to exert any effort whatsoever to raise a laugh: James' skewed take on his youthful surroundings in Kogarah coupled perfectly with the countless moments of hilarity he lived through and strange and twisted acquaintances he made. In the same vein, Falling Towards England introduced us to a young man desperately out of his depth as a newcomer to the Mother Country, armed only with an ill-fitting suit and cardboard suitcase.May Week Was In June is a continuation of James' days in Britain, as a late twentysomething attempting to forge an acting career in Cambridge while simultaneously stumbling clumsily through his English degree. Even though he's older he's still no wiser, being cursed with an overly healthy interest in women, a not-so-healthy interest in pints of ale and frustrating his teachers and himself by forgoing his assigned texts in their entirety to read countless books of his own choosing.Yes, it's funny, and it certainly continues to reinforce James' portrayal of his younger self as more larrikin than laureate and more clown than Casanova. He's still a fish out of water, despite having immersed himself for many years in British culture, and his distinctly Australian outlook stands out in 1960s Cambridge like a sore thumb.The funny moments, though, don't tend to come as thick and fast as in the first two memoirs. This was a shame, as episodes such as James practising his twist in his darkened bedroom in Swiss Cottage, and his teenage sex education in the back of a Kogarah garage, were what made the first two books so laugh-out-loud funny. James has grown up in his third boo, and is a slightly more serious and focused character (with the emphasis on slightly, though!), despite his shortcomings as a student and his scorn for conservative behaviour. However, the narration is still flawless in its eloquency and James proves he has not lost his sharp and unique way of observing the world around him with a cynicism that never grates, but constantly entertains."},{"Title":"A practical guide to nutrition, feeds, and feeding of catfish (MAFES bulletin)","review":"This looks like being the last personal memoir Clive James intends to let us have. After he left Cambridge he became well-known from the media, first as BBC film critic, then as the television critic of The Observer on Sundays, and latterly with several shows of his own. He must be nearer 70 than 60 by now, to the best of my knowledge his marriage has survived, and the combination of anno domini, stability and exposure has probably left him with nothing much more that he feels driven to tell us.His Cambridge career must have given the university more of a challenge in dealing with him than the other way about. He read voraciously, but he read what interested him rather than what was on the syllabus. He devoted much of his time and energy to theatrical productions, and much of his time if not energy to watching films. To what extent he found the Cambridge experience formative I can't really tell, but it clearly didn't take him over. He mentions a number of personalities - F R Leavis who clearly angered him, Germaine Greer thinly disguised as Romaine Rand, and a few others such as the college dean who come across to me as institutions at least as much as they do as personalities. Of the institutions properly so called he has a bit to say about the Union Society, which was clearly as imbecilic a tabernacle of triviality as its Oxford equivalent that I knew only a little earlier. Other institutions were the regular theatrical events, and here we get a genuine sense of involvement. Cambridge gave him a forum here where he could develop his talent. It might have developed less if he had never gone there, but in any case he carried on with his theatre productions in London at the same time, so I'd guess Cambridge's real gift to him was the student grant that unintentionally left him free to do substantially what he liked.How reliable or unreliable these memoirs are I have to guess too, but I should think they can be believed a lot more than those of, say, Berlioz. Every newspaper review of this book since it appeared in 1990 must have pointed out that his or anyone's team on University Challenge consisted of four members and not three, and I wonder how this ever got past the proof-readers. Those of his contemporaries that he deigns to mention by name are mainly unknown to me, but some may be pseudonyms like Romaine Rand. As the book continued I started to recognise more names. These by and large are people he can mention without compromising or embarrassing them, so it's fair to suppose that some of the unknown personae are aliases to avoid problems. The story reads convincingly, and of course it reads very well. A child of that time attending a similar place of education can relate easily to his progressive disgust with the bogusness and herd-mentality of the 'intellectual' political left that drove us from any nave revolutionary ideas back into being staid social democrats. The story of the attempt by one theatrical beauty to seduce him, in which he failed the test, is hilarious, but rather near the bone as well for someone whose occasional specialisation in such cases was just to abandon the scene or even to fail to recognise it as a scene in the first place. As for reading what one wanted to rather than what one was supposed to, scrambling through the syllabus and finishing with a better degree than one deserved - well, that rings a few bells too.Those who know either or both of the earlier books of memoirs, or who simply know Clive James from The Observer and/or television, will know the style to expect here. It's individual, and in its way it's brilliant as well. It has 'matured' rather by this third volume - the one-liners are not so conspicuous as before, but there are plenty left and the writing has more evenness and homogeneity. He traces his developing interest in artistic and intellectual creation of various kinds, and the wide-eyed ingenu quality of his appreciation is one of the things I like best about him. The last chapter, in which he hears, as we must, the clock ticking more loudly as he continues to look into the door opening ahead of him is really striking and affecting. I sense that Clive James has said most of what he was given to say, but how well he said it all."},{"Title":"A practical guide to nutrition, feeds, and feeding of catfish (MAFES bulletin)","review":"This third volume of unreliable memoirs picks up where the previous volume (Falling Towards England) let off.

It was the first book on the subject of vitamins to sell a million copies. At that time, the cause for vitamins and &quot;antioxidants&quot; was considered the domain of crackpots and was generally dismissed by the medical establishment. This is not the case any more, but this is so largely due to the long (30-year) almost single-handed efforts of Herbert Bailey.Herbert Bailey's latest book about vitamin is the only one of his seven books not out of print.

I have to say that if LaPlantz herself drew all the diagrams in this book, showing the over/under patterns and shape of the basket as it progresses, she must have spent a Very Long Time doing so: the book is generously full of scores of such drawings to help the weaver. LaPlantz's approach is never to impose a pattern upon the weaver. Instead, she teaches method, tells you what you should be doing and looking for as you weave. The pattern itself is up to you. Such an approach is encouraging and liberating.

For the serious astrology student or enthusiast, this book is a well written, in-depth exploration of not only major aspects, but also the minor aspects.When I first bought this book for my own library of reference books, I must admit that I wasn't expecting such a wealth of information to be packed into less than 280 pages (A5 size)! This is not a book designed for light reading, so turn the TV and radio off.Bil Tierney has been involved with astrology for more than thirty-five years. He has lectured and given workshops at major astrological conferences throughout the United States and Canada since the mid-1970s. The author has been a member of the Metropolitan Atlanta Astrological Society (MAAS) for many years, and has served as its newsletter/journal editor several times. Bil's work has been published in astrological publications such as Aspects and The Mercury Hour.While looking through this book, I must say that I was impressed by the collection of references that would be particularly helpful for those of you wanting to explore certain topics in more depth. There is no index, although I'm not sure it would have made a difference having one since the information is so well set out.My personal favourite part of this book is Chapter 10, Retrograde Planets. I liked the exploration of stationary planets within a natal and progressed chart and, of course, the individual planets within the birth chart that are retrograde, stationary retrograde and stationary direct. These themes are also explored in terms of transits and progressions as well.All in all, Dynamics of Aspect Analysis is a book I recommend for the serious astrologer or astrology student to include as part of their personal reference library.

That said, there's quite a bit of interest here: The discussions of aspect configurations are more detailed than I've seen elsewhere, dealing in depth with different sorts of T-squares and grand trines while also treating some rarer combinations. The chapters on unaspected and retrograde planets are also very helpful. Perhaps the best thing about this book is its discussion of dissociate (out-of-sign) aspects; these are a problem that many treatments gloss over, but Tierney deals with them at length in a plausible way. I have a few gripes: Tierney seems to derive the basic meaning of an aspect from the degree that forms that aspect with the beginning of the sign of Aries; that seems like an unhelpful and in some cases misleading way of looking at it. He gives quite a bit of space to discussions of &quot;upper&quot; and &quot;lower&quot; aspects, which doesn't seem to me to be a useful distinction. If Amazon.Com let me, I would give this book three and half stars. It's not the first book on aspects I would recommend, but it is useful and I'm glad I bought it."},{"Title":"Dynamics of Aspect Analysis: New Perspections in Astrology","review":"Tierney deals with T-Squares, Yods, Kites, Grand Trines, Grand Crosses, Mystic Rectangles, Mystic Hexagrams, and even unaspected planets. Nowhere else have I found anything to compare to his intelligent analyses. Wish he had put pictures in and the typesetters understood what footnotes, headings, and callouts looked like. Small gripe. Buy this book!"},{"Title":"Dynamics of Aspect Analysis: New Perspections in Astrology","review":"There are plenty of books out there that will tell you what your Sun sign means. There are some books that will describe certain aspects, such as Sun square Mars (like the excellent James Braha title.)Tierney's book, however, is one of the few (if not the only one) that will explain in depth what an aspect itself (e.g. a sextile, a square, an inconjunct) means, how waxing and waning aspects are different, how aspects relate to signs and the more complex configurations that build on aspects, as well as other topics such as retrogrades.While the material is rather abstract, in my opinion it is virtually impossible to have a mastery of astrology without understanding the contents of this volume. It is that profound and important."},{"Title":"Dynamics of Aspect Analysis: New Perspections in Astrology","review":"This book is highly recommended and I have asked that it be made available on Kindle. The author is a former engineer. The title pretty well describes the content. He starts with the basic aspects and includes the sesqui-square and quincunx and on to more rare aspects. He covers dissociate aspects which can be confusing for beginners in interpretation. All these are well done, but his greater contribution is in discussing aspect patterns. He dissects the T-squares, Grand Trines and Grand Crosses, but goes beyond into more arcane aspect patterns such as the Kite, Mystic Rectangle, Yod and others. His discussion of retrograde planets is quite thorough, going into natal, progressed and transiting retrogrades for each of the planets. Finally, he looks at hemisphere and quadrant patterns.This is a great book for people who are familiar with the basics and are looking for additional knowledge. It is also one of my reference books for chart interpretation. I've had it since shortly after it was published in 1980 and still find it relevant today."},{"Title":"Dynamics of Aspect Analysis: New Perspections in Astrology","review":"This is one of those books that every professional astrologer should have in their library for reference."},{"Title":"Dynamics of Aspect Analysis: New Perspections in Astrology","review":"Bil Tierney has succeeded in contributing a very broad in scope and in depth look at the &quot;Dynamics of Aspect Analysis&quot; that is as understandable as it is rich in content. Highly recommended...a wonderful resource!"},{"Title":"Dynamics of Aspect Analysis: New Perspections in Astrology","review":"This book is an incredibly rich source of clear and concise information on aspects, patterns, even retrogrades. Bil Tierney's astrology and his writing are incredibly solid. This book is a must for any astrology student's library"},{"Title":"Dynamics of Aspect Analysis: New Perspections in Astrology","review":"If you were to have only five books on astrology this is one of them!Tierney's insights into the traits aspects sponsor, his logial assessment of the meaning of their postitons in the cycle of becoming, and the inclusion of the most unique aspects make this book essential reading."},{"Title":"Tales of the Long Bow","review":"Someone, I suppose, told Chesterton that his ideas regarding distributivism could never work. He was evidently inspired to write this series of interconnected tales, set in modern times, each somehow dealing with the achievement of an impossible thing. The ultimate goal is to agitate for his distributivist agenda (Land distribution among the common folk).I don't know if distributivism could be made to work. But (sorry G.K.) these stories do not work. I tried to like them, but I found myself becoming increasingly bored.Chesterton has written quite a few good short stories. But he seems to be at his best when he does not stray too far from the \\"detective story\\" format. Aside from his Father Brown stories, which can be quite good, you can also try:\\"The Man Who Knew Too Much\\" (Horne Fisher stories)\\"The Poet and the Lunatics\\" (Gabriel Gale stories).\\"The Club of Queer Trades\\" (Basil Grant stories).All of which are better than \\"Tales of the Long Bow\\". (I here consider only his short stories - many of his essays and novels are also worth reading)."},{"Title":"I Like Being in Parish Ministry: Social Justice","review":"What are Cornel West and Jim Wallis doing in a book about Catholic social teaching? Professor West sees the world almost entirely through the prism of race, while Wallis is best known for providing cover for abortion rights politicians with his Sojourners organization. Yet somehow Mich endorses works by both of these partisan figures in his book. There are useful things to learn from Mr. Mich, but the vision of social justice on display in these pages is frequently politicized. (One of the accomplishments cited by Mich is lobbying for a reallocation of funds from a large tobacco settlement toward favored political projects.) That isn't surprising; Mich is employed by the Diocese of Rochester, a redoubt of progressive politics and doctrinal dissent. Readers are advised to seek other resources, and they might consider learning what the Church teaches about social justice. Fr. Rodger Charles'sAn Introduction to Catholic Social Teachingis a good place to start."},{"Title":"Reconstructing Yeats","review":"Books don't get much better than this one. It is a true literary classic, that I highly recommend to anyone even the least bit curious about Yates. It is, without a doubt, simply the best book I've ever read....not only that, it's probably the best book ever published. Perhaps, the best collection of words on paper in the entire history of mankind. This book will make you think! It's epic proportion is matched only by perhaps The Schastic Scriptures. The authour's genius is clearly present from the very first sentence! Amazon only lets me give this thing five stars....I really think it deserves 5 million! Buy it! Buy It Now! Buy one for you Mom, your Dad, your brother, your sister, your son, your daughter, your boss, your teacher, your cousin, your aunt, your uncle, your bus driver, your coffee shop espresso server, your gas station attendant, your accountant, your lawyer, your ex-wife, your president. Hell, even get a copy for your dog and cat!! You can't get enough of this book!"},{"Title":"Chance Of A Lifetime","review":"Amy Leigh's talent really shines in this warm and witty book. I love how her non-traditional heroine and her sexy-as-all-get-out hero make their way down the bumpy road to love. From the moment he crashes into her tractor to the last lingering kiss, these two are a wonderful couple.I also really enjoyed Ms. Leigh's vivid use of language. She creates images that make the story really come to life. I look forward to more stories from her.Don't miss Chance of a Lifetime. It's a wonderful book."},{"Title":"Chance Of A Lifetime","review":"Chance of a Lifetime is Amy's Leigh's first novel, and what a treat it is! It's humorous, heartwarming, and the characters practically leap off the page they're so real-to-life.

What a revelation this book provided.Very well written, interesting, informative, humorous and sometimes tragic, The Stars Were Big and Bright is one book that will remain in my personal library for years to come. It is sure to be reread whenever the urge to revisit the history of Texas' contribution to the U.S. Army Air Force's efforts during WWI and WWII.I was impressed also with the numerous vintage photograps, maps, descriptions of the relevant airfields, aircraft photos and specifications, as well as the high level of documentation from primary source documents.This book absolutely has to be the best book on this topic yet written. Perhaps the author, Thomas E. Alexander, will treat us to another great book in the future."}]`),W={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:S,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},x={class:"card-container"},G=["disabled"],L={key:0},M={key:1};function q(s,o,n,u,r,i){const c=f("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",x,[(e(!0),t(g,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),w(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",M,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",L,"See more"))],8,G)):p("",!0)])}const j=d(W,[["render",q],["__scopeId","data-v-e2d91e1b"]]),E=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/47.md","filePath":"guide/47.md"}'),J={name:"guide/47.md"},B=Object.assign(J,{setup(s){return(o,n)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(j)]))}});export{E as __pageData,B as default};
