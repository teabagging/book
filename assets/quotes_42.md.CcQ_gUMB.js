Truly a one of land author and a pioneer."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"My Grandpa Ben and I used to go fishing in the lake? canal? pond? in my grandparent's old condo neighborhood. I wasn't some great fisherman (caught my finger on a hook at least once) but it's a fun experience and a great memory I have of my grandfather and I from when I was younger before he passed away.So to help with my A-Z Book Challenge, I picked up The Old Man and the Sea by Hemingway. It's a short read and was written in the 1950&#8242;s, taking place in Cuba. I had no idea it was so \\"modern\\" for classic literature. I mean, Hemingway's characters were discussing the Yankees baseball team and Joe DiMaggio.Anyway, The Old Man and the Sea is a book about an older man who is having bad luck catching fish, but in general he's a great fisherman. One day after a long streak of no fish, he goes out alone, only to hook an enormous catch.But will he be able to make it back to shore with the fish? And will he make it alive?This book was good, but seems to be right in the middle for me. I thought the ending fell a little flat. And the whole time I was reading, there were these little shark-killing episodes that had me thinking. . . oh no, Allison @ The Book Wheel would not like this (since she's like a crazy anti-hurting-sharks person).My overall thoughts? If you need a short classic to read, this is a decent one. I wasn't thrilled, but mainly because the ending was a little too short for me.Tell me about your fishing experience!Thanks for reading,Rebecca @ Love at First Book"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Maybe Hemingway wasn't that old when he wrote &#34;Man&#34;, but he captures the essence of struggle with all things earthly in the book, particularly as one ages. I read this earlier in my life as a survival tale. It still is, but reads differently from this perspective."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This book may be small, but after just reading a couple pages I wasn't able to put it down.I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"\\"Man is not made for defeat...A man can be destroyed, but not defeated.\\" And so the old fisherman, down on his luck after 84 days not catching a fish sets out and catches a magnificent marlin who takes him out to sea for days before the old man can try to turn the boat home and try to get his prize home for all to see. What takes place is a magnificent story of obsession, pursuit, success and heart break. I think this book is a metaphor for man's obsession with reaching a goal. It also shows how illusory and transient such goals can be, but how we strive for them nevertheless...as Hemingway was an avid fisherman, it's also a terrific description of what it's like to try to catch the big one. To the old man, I say - sleep easy, you caught a magnificent fish!"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This is an excellent read for the discerning person who likes the minimalist approach to story-telling. Mr. Hemingway was a master of this form and this book is my favorite. He wastes no words yet gives a detailed, emotionally complete, satisfying depiction of this old man's travails and ultimate loss. The relationship between the old man and the young boy is particularly poignant and gives real insight into the life of Cuba's poor in the time long before Castro was even thought of.

An unabashed allegory of a tale. Santiago, the old man, a fisherman, has gone weeks without landing a fish. Which would not be so bad, we feel, except that it means the young boy he has been fishing with has been prohibited from going out with him any longer. He must be too old, or too unlucky, or something, to go so long without a fish. In any case, the boy's father forbids him to go fishing with Santiago again -- which is a terrible blow, as the old man is tired and lonely and loves the boy like a son. He understands (and would probably have done the same if he was the boy's father), but still, it's a great blow to him, and to the boy as well, who loves Santiago perhaps better than his own father. After all, it was Santiago who taught him to fish in the first place.In any case, Santiago goes out alone into the wide sea once again, neither fully hoping nor totally emptied of hope, but just waiting to see what the ocean will give him this time, or what it will withhold. He wonders if he could still handle a big fish if he got one; and he thinks he probably could, because he knows all the tricks.He gets a bite, finally a bite, but is curious about the behavior of the fish. It's a big one, he knows, but how it fights him! As if it is not merely big, but intelligent as well. It holds the line, then begins to drag the old man well out to sea. An epic game of patience ensues, pitting the old man's strength (how much does he possess at this late stage?) against the fish's, which turns out to be a Marlin, fully 18 feet long.The battle lasts all day, a night, another day, another night, and part of another day. Eventually, Santiago manages to kill the great beast, but on his lengthy journey back to land, the sharks that inhabit that part of the sea eat most of it. Of course, the old man fights them off as best he can, but it's a pointless exercise: there's too many, and it's too long a journey back to the mainland.By the time he reaches his beach, it's dark again and the Marlin has been reduced to a fleshless carcass, rendering all the old man's work pointless, right?Or was it? The boy has been waiting for him, for one, very worried. And he is awestruck when he sees the size of the catch (even though no money can come of it now). And even the other fishermen, who long ago had written off the old man as definitely finished, must revise their estimates of his abilities when they see it. No one has ever gone out in such a small craft and returned with such a large catch, or they can't remember if it did happen before. And it took days, an enterprise most of them cannot even conceive of. And the old man held out to the last.The symbolism of the story (concerning man's obsession with getting and gaining and ryet eturning home with essentially nothing) hardly need be gone over again. It's quite simply one of life's most painful lessons. We go out to gather all our lives, only to have it taken away from us piecemeal before we can benefit from it.All of which has been written about before, so no real surprise. I will only mention the special touches instead that make this one of my favorite books by Hemingway. The tenderness of the protagonist, his gentle love of the boy, for example. Or how he doesn't dream of anything anymore but the lions he saw playing like kittens years before. How he respects the fish even as he kills it, but kills it nonetheless, and then is sorry to have done it, and even sorrier when the sharks eat it -- but not for himself, but only because such a great fish died for no end after all. He's a kind, selfless soul, not like the typical hard-hearted Hemingway character. One of his fondest fantasies is to go fishing with Joe Dimaggio, that's the kind of hero he is. That's allSo, great tale, only too short, too short."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"You don't have to love fishing to enjoy this read. From beginning to end Ernest Hemingway made this gothic story a delightful story of an old man that finally accomplish his dream and also watch his dream disappear."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"One of Ernest Hemingway's earliest short stories that will captivate the reader with layers of meaning and symbolism. A very short and easy read that I recommend to all classical story readers."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This story made bedtime reading for my Ten Year Old over thanksgiving break. He loved the story. And now I feel like an accomplished father because I have passed down my enthusiasm for Hemingway to my son.It has been my third time reading it since college. I still have the receipt for the book which I keep as a book mark when I'm reading it. I remember at that time, not being a lit major, I pounced on an opportunity to speak with a lit professor who had his office filled with Hemingway memorabilia and had done his Phd. on Hemingway. It made me wish I had been a lit major. Symbolism is too often lost on me. I had just finished reading the Old Man and the Sea the first time, and this professor says, \\"You know it is all about Christ, He was marrying a Catholic at the time and reexamining his thoughts on Christianity.\\"Like I said, symbolism is lost on me most of the time, but when I'm looking for it, I can sometimes see it. This read through with my son was fun. I liked picking up how the boy, he wouldn't say it, but he had lost faith, much like Peter. How this fish redeems the old man with his death that takes him 3 days out to sea. Ichthus always make good Christ figures. I suppose I could read more into it than all that, and ruin the story. But seriously, my ten year old liked it, and he does not like reading. He liked this story. He also liked the symbolism when I explained it to him. I think he liked the epic tale of survival and man against beast most."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This novel was the first piece of literature that I enjoyed reading. I was in 9th grade when I read it for the first time. The novel can be summarized in one sentence: It is about a man struggling to catch a fish and eventually failing. The true meaning of the novel goes so much deeper than that though. This novel taught me not to judge a book by it's cover. Since reading this novel, I have read several other pieces of literature by Ernest Hemingway and he has become one of my favorite authors. I strongly recommend taking the time to read this novel."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Listen to Samuel Barber's adaggio for strings. Hear it symphonically accompany the climb of a man toward a stunning achievement, then falter for an instant, rise again for a moment, but then collapse, never again to recover the great heights once so briefly achieved.But it continues in muted form, heroically playing to completion, and then dies, the man's greatness and courage unacknowledged, except by being inscribed in the adaggio.Santiago, the old man who makes his living from the sea, leads a life that parallels the adaggio. He takes to the sea on an uneventful day in pursuit of a peasant's meager living. Unexpectedly he does battle with a huge marlin, perhaps the biggest ever. The struggle lasts for days, painfully exhausting nearly all his resources, but he triumphs. Or so it seems. But his fisherman's glory, even his material sustenance, is stolen by sharks, feeding off his work, destroying his victory, leaving him with little but a skeleton of his success.Tourists wonder at the stripped carcass, never guessing the heroic struggle that brought it to shore, or the noble effort that rendered the marlin tractable, only to have it stolen.The old man worries about the great Dimaggio. Is he still hobbled and unable to play because of bone spurs in his heel? The old man accepts his own misfortune and painfully exhausting stuggle as just the sort of near miss that comes with the life of a peasant fisherman. The great Dimaggio sits on the bench, nursing his bone spurs, making a fortune for dramatized idleness.Today, the great Dimaggio, who never endured the struggles and disappointments that the old man accepted as routine, is remembered best for his brief, failed marriage to a movie star past her prime, his sartorial elegance, and his rich man's dignity. The old man is not remembered at all. There is no hall of fame for peasants.There is, however, Samuel Barber's adaggio. The old man's nobility and everyday heroism is inscribed in its rise, fall, and denoument."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Ernest Hemingway is one of my favorite \\"time past\\" authors. His great insight and the delivery of it in simple sentences is unmatched by any other author. \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" is one of Hemingway's better known works, though it was written in a form of a novella. It is that much more important that this book won a Pulitzer Prize and helped Hemingway win the Nobel Prize in literature.Santiago is an old Cuban fisherman who is down on his luck. Eighty four days without a catch, with a previous personal record of eighty seven. Santiago is not giving up though, even when the boy who helps him fish tells him that his parents will no longer allow him to fish with Santiago. The old man takes it in stride and on the eighty fifth day takes to the sea, alone.Soon Santiago gets a bite, and a bite so strong that the fish can only be a large one. Catching a glimpse of it, the old man sees that the fish is indeed a magnificent marlin of the size that the old fisherman had never seen before. Immediately approximating the marlin's weight, Santiago realizes how much he can earn from the sale of the fish. But the marlin is strong and refuses to give in easily, taking Santiago farther and farther away into the sea, until there is no land.Santiago and the marlin are caught in a battle of persistence, a battle that drives Santiago almost to the point of breaking. Having gone so far, the old fisherman can not give up, as he gains respect for the strong and brave fish. The battle must end soon, as both the man and the fish are running out of food and out of strength, and Santiago is relieved when he sees the marlin behave in a capitulating manner, circling around Santiago's skiff.\\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" is truly a classic, a book that is written in a very simple language. Very simple characters and a simple plot reveal a complicated life dilemma of survival, courage, respect and pride. Santiago, originally driven by the need to survive, becomes driven by pride, causing careless behavior that creates the need for survival yet again. And Santiago's win turns into a loss, making one wonder if the price of pride is really worth the end result.Hemingway is typically calm in this novella as he reveals Santiago's thought processes and the events that directly influence these processes, while at the same time revealing a different side of the fisherman, his past and all that led him to the marlin and the fight with things that are larger than himself. Santiago puts up with all the blows and pains, accepting them as they come along as a part of life, not realizing that he himself largely caused those pains. This is indeed the case with most of us, and Hemingway only pointed this fact out in his usual leisurely manner.All in all, \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" is a refreshing classic, maybe a bit short and sometimes too simple or haphazard, especially in Santiago's repetitive thought processes and dreams. Nonetheless, this is a novel that makes the reader think about the message that Hemingway invariably leaves in all his works. Recommended."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"If there has been a better book written in the English language than \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" then I am yet to read it. This book is the very essence of the written language at its best. Here, we see the perfect amalgam of simplicity and poignancy. Here, we see a novel of scarcely more than 100 pages tell a truly touching tale with absolute clarity.\\"The Old Man and and the Sea\\" was first published in 1952 and was the key to Ernest Hemingway being awarded the 1954 Nobel Prize for literature. It is the simple tale of a very old Cuban fisherman who has not had a large catch in 84 days. He is deemed as being beyond the task by the people of his village. No one seems to have any faith in him except the boy, Manolin. The boy never loses his faith. He adores the old man and is bursting with emotion when the old man returns from the sea with the remains of a huge marlin. He is both proud of the old man while also being desperately sorry that the fish had been eaten by sharks. Indeed, it is the attack on the fish by the sharks where one feels so sad for the old man. He has been at sea for days and single handedly brings the fish to his boat only to see his prize snatched from him by remorseless sharks.Many authors should take lessons from Hemingway in general and this book in particular. Simplicity of tale and frugality of structure are the keys to the book. Sentences are simple and words direct without being needlessly flowering. This is truly the work of a genius. Indeed, Hemingway wrote many books in his time but none match this peerless effort."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I first read The Old Man and the Sea when I was in high school in the mid 1970s, and at the time it made a considerable impression on me. I was a typical teenager, easily bored and more interested in sports than reading, but the book nevertheless managed to penetrate my youthful indifference. Perhaps it was Hemingway's direct prose style, perhaps the story itself. I don't know, but I enjoyed it enough to devour it in one sitting and feel hungry for more when I'd finished. That was unusual.Since then I've read it several times, and on every reading I get something new from it. Its few pages contain so much wisdom, there is always something that I can relate to my own situation at the time of reading. How many books can claim to do that?I've read other Hemingway works since, and have enjoyed them all, but there is something magical about The Old Man and the Sea. It has the glow of myth that elevates some tales above the rest.Hemingway's style is both simple and complex. His sentences are sometimes short, almost abbreviated, and at other times long and convoluted. But they always work. Try reading him aloud, and see just how skilfully his prose is constructed.Read this book."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This is one of the best books ever written, both in the human depth and in style, and many writers today still could learn from it.I bought the copy for my grandson."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"(My review contains a major spoiler)When Santiago, the old fisherman, finally decides to try his luck far away from the shore, he probably did'nt realise he would meet his destiny both as a fisherman and a human being. As a human being because after all his troubles he comes home empty handed, a fate most of us humans will find at the end of our life, we will ask if this is all we have done.But it seems to me that the story has a second meaning. When a huge sword-fish takes the bait an epic battle starts between the two. The fish swims away, forcing the old man to taut the cord for almost two days. During this moments one could ask who's the hunter and who's the hunted.In my point of view it's this duality that makes the story a masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Immediately, you are swept away by the story's innate tension that rages in Santiago's blood, you are in the sand, sweating, tired, exhausted, depleted. You long to extend your hand, you yearn to set him free, but he could only know true freedom in his death. He is a spent man, having giving his years to the sea, and having let a young boy adore him, look up to him as his hero. That's who Santiago was, not the miserable old man scolded by a loving but relentless relative who means well.Anthony Quinn's rendition of Santiago, (the old man) was a rare treat in the 1990 movie, ringing true to Hemingway's legendary style. Even Joe DiMaggio makes an appearance in the lazy hours of fishermen.Ernest Hemingway is one of our great American legends. The Old Man and the Sea is far more than a simplistic view of an old man who fishes in the sea--it is a parable; it is man's struggle against himself; it is the plight of humanity in which a man finds himself; it is the underpinning of a wretched, old soul who thinks he was defeated back on the beach; it is an allegory of a boy who looks out to the ocean and an old man for his salvation. What a magnificent American tale!"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Hemingway delivered his last masterpiece with this book, a cultural phenomenon when first published in the early '50s: in an unprecedented move, Life Magazine published the novella in its entirety,recognizing that Hemingway, the most influential writer of 20th century American literature and then a world-wide celebrity, had delivered a long-awaited masterful story. The Life magazine edition sold more than 5 million copies in a week so this book reached tens of millions of people within days - not many authors can achieve that! And that's before becoming a much beloved story translated into scores of languages. It is fair to say that this book, which won the Pullitzer Prize, reignited the interest and respect for Hemingway as a serious writer and might have been the decisive factor for his Nobel Prize award.It is so disappointing when people say that story is boring and has too much simbolism... if you have experience fishing or sailing or simply appreciating the sea and nature, then the book offers a marvellous account of man AND nature (not man vs. nature). As for the simbolism, don't dwell too much on it. Hemingway himself said that the book is about \\"an old man, a boy, a fish and the sea\\", but if the story is told well enough (as it is on this book) it can mean so much more.And the story is indeed so much more, in no small part because of the inherent goodness of the old man. That's how I enjoy and interpret the book: it is a straightforward tale of an old man embracing the struggles and rewards of life with courage, dignity and still full of the human spirit. Santiago is one of the most dignified characters in Literature, and I have to say he is my favorite and a bit of a personal hero... the old fisherman strives to be the best he can be and do the best he can do... he does not complain of his living in poverty, do not blame others for anything. His spirit is big, generous, undefeated. While other Hemingway heroes might have disappointed some people by way of too much machismo, Santiago keeps all the best traits of courage, resilience and non-nonsense survivalism, while displaying more maturity and humility - perhaps reflecting the middle-age wisdom of the author (then is his fifties).Hemingway story-telling skills are at his best here. I am a big fan of his style, particularly in the short-story format, but here he is astounding all the way. yeah, the prose is deceptively simple at first, but if you pay attention we can see the craft of a master. The opening sentence alone is formidable and could only be delivered by a master of the short-story format. Ihe last sentence is also wonderful and pure Hemingway- simple but infinitely deep, and in this story hopeful and bitter-sweet.In between, Hemingway writes with uncanny power,in such a way that you can fully experience what the character is going through: first you see what the old man does, from mundane tasks and spadework to the excitement of the deep-sea hunt and the exhausting struggle, and in the process you start to think the way Santiago thinks and finally you are feeling the way he feels. It is magical if you only give it a try. Granted, it is easier to immerse into this story if you are familiar with the ways of fishing and the ocean, but in any case, when Santiago is alone in the boat looking at the sea creatures or at the night-sky... I guess the recognition of the infinite solitude of human condition, mitigated by the bonding with the life and the world around us, that is truly universal.I am so glad that such a sweet, simple, timeless story became the classic that it is. You have to try this one too!"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Ernest Hemingway is a tremendous writer. I feel like I am with the characters when I read his novels. When the old man feels sick eating raw dolphin. When the old man cramps in his left arm. And the utter disappointment the old man feels at the end. I wish the end could have turned out differently, but it is like the old man knew, he never should have gone out as far as he did. He was a master at what he did. The old man knew exactly how much he had, and how much the fish would give. He knew how to survive on the ocean in a small boat without food for multiple days. This was a great story, and I enjoyed it immensely."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"From the start to the end I really enjoyed this book. This is because of Hemmingway's writing style. I really enjoyed the simplicity of the way he wrote this book. It doesn't really have any challenging words or phrases that make the book tough to read. Im am usually turned away from those type of books. But this book is different. It really makes you feel like you are with the Old Man through his adventures with the Marlin dragging him. There is a lot of emotion running throughout this book. The brotherly love the Old Man and the boy share with each other and the pride and determination the Old Man has throughout his journey in the sea. It really sent the message to me to never give up in anything I do. That is why I am giving this book a 5 star rating."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"awesome, I usually hate Hemingway. I read this back in high school.

The way that he would say crazy things made me think, what in the world, but then it followed the crazy thoughts up with him knowing that he said or thought something crazy. His imagination ran wild though. He would talk to the fish and the sea. That allowed me to stay with him by allowing my imagination to picture where he was and the scene. The author did a good job keeping me interested. I like the book, and it's the first novel I've read this year that kept me interested."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"When Santiago battles with the huge marlin he is fighting for his very existence and at the same time trying to give meaning and value to his life. Santiago represents all of us and he ultimately will win because he is willing to give the maximum effort.It is not possible to ask more of Santiago. Although he may become temporarily discouraged, Santiago is quick to revive and rejoin the struggle.I recommend this book because it is both uplifting and it deserves to be included in the ranks of great American literature."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"In our modern world, Man does not survive by bread alone; he also feels compelled to &quot;survive&quot; by meeting self-imposed expectations within a personal construct.

So he squeezes every ounce of determination from his aching body to wrest one last triumph that affirms the meaning of his life before he withdraws with Honor.A classic story of Man versus Nature and Man at One with Nature, Hemingway's words demand to be read aloud to appreciate their astounding beauty. For its prose alone, this is a five-star classic truly worthy of The Pulitzer.&quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; is also one of those works that translates extremely well to the screen: view the original film with Spencer Tracy and revel in that late, great actor's flawless soliloquy, set against gorgeous whitecaps at evening in riveting black and white.This is a must-read, and a must-view."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"If you only read one Ernest Hemingway novel, this has to be it. You can get no better picture of how he turns such simplicity into such sheer brilliance. I hate him, why is he so good and I'm not??? This is a nail biting adventure, very symbolic. Small and insignificant man going after that elusive prize he has been striving for his entire life. Who cares that sharks ate away everything but the tail and the head. It's like an orgasm. You work and you work, you build and you build and then the moment comes. Who cares how good it was getting there, the climax felt great. And that is what this is all about. You read it so fast because it's so short, then you read it again. You tell yourself that you weren't convinced he could do this and so excitingly. Then you read it again and your dreams come true, he wins. You're just so damn happy that he can go back home and go to bed, lying there, baked from the sun and exhausted, unrelenting in the face of the most trying of adversity. This is the ultimate story of triumph. Why oh why did you have to leave is Ernest?"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man &amp; The Sea is arguablely Hemingway's best book, not only considered a classic for both fans and literature. In my private opinion, this a really good effort, which focus more on [principal character] Santiago's thoughts and feelings, a fisherman whose bad luck has reached 84 days without any catch. Thus, he is surprised when hooks a fish of an extraordinary size and weight. The book basically goes off on this, speaking of his thoughts, the old times, his beloved gone wife, and his feelings about his &quot;disciple&quot; Manolim. The book also covers many reflections to be brought up, not despising the fact that offers a rich, fortified vocabulary.However, I would not give five stars, for it isn't an outstanding achievement, nor give it three or lower classification. Four stars for a classic who may inspire people to write five stars books or reach five stars knowledge."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I am not a Buddhist nor do I claim to be, but the notion of living simply and honestly is my goal in life. I bought this book in a effort to read some of the modern classics that I had either read as a child or missed out on. This story floored me. At points brought me to tears. Hemmingway's use of the language is mesmerizing. One man's struggle with old age, the elements, fatigue, self doubt. His triumph in a days old battle, only to be confronted with new struggles and failures. His respect for the fish is next to worship and soon turns to apologetic sorrow. In modern society we can only imagine this type of stuggle. Only possibly in war do we possess this type of mutual respect and reckless passion.Much more than the required reading I remembered."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The sea is an empty and foreboding area. When left alone in its presence, it consumes the soul and destroys the mind. In the story The Old Man and the Sea, Santiago learns of this when he boats out into its depths. This intriguing tail is an enjoyable and exciting read.I enjoyed reading The Old Man and the Sea. Even though the book was assigned to me as a class, I did enjoy it. This was well written and easy to understand and thus enjoyable. I like reading good books as long as the style is to my liking. Hemmingway, like many other great people in history, was slightly crazy when he wrote his master-piece which makes it all the more enjoyable. I think that Hemmingway's state shows through Santiago in a few ways, giving it more voice. Style, language, and structure add to this story significantly, making the story easy to read and understand. Overall the story was very enjoyable. Hemmingway makes his story as pleasurable as possible for the selected age group.The Old Man and the Sea, along with being enjoyable is also exciting. Because it has many turns in the story it makes the reader not get bored. When Santiago hooked the Marlin it seemed to be the climax but the book continued on and that changed. Every time Santiago's World calms down another corner is turned and a new surprise is uncovered. In fact is an exciting and intriguing story that keeps the reader on their seat. I found this book very unpredictable. Rats aren't included in the book at all, but it is still an exciting story. From the beginning, The Old Man and the Sea, twists and turns till the end of the story.All in all The Old Man and the Sea is an exciting and enjoyable novel. Hemmingway has an unbeatable style that is compared to his situation is amazing. The way Hemmingway weaves himself into his story in great. This is a great book that holds the story of Hemmingway in its pages."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and The Sea was an incredibly inspirational story because Santiago gave it his all and never gave up. He set himself a goal at the very beginning, worked hard at achieving it, and over all, didn't give in to the trouble that awaited him. That is pure inspiration.The old man was an inspiration because always gave everything 100% and never gave up, even when the times got rough, he stayed strong. For example, many people thought he was very unlucky. Even though the townspeople would say things like that to bring Santiago down, sometimes it made him want to try even harder. Also when the old man was to prove them wrong they all had to show him respect. He tried to do something that not very many people thought he could do. For example, even though not too many people believed in him, Santiago's friend Manolin was there to help him through his hard times. In addition, the old man went for his dream because it was what he believed in doing. He wanted to do the right thing, and he can do anything he says as long as he believed in himself and didn't care what the others thought. The Old Man and The Sea was very inspirational because Santiago never gave up; even when people would make fun of him and tell him he couldn't do it. He always tried his hardest. That leads me to believe that the old man was an amazing role model and was extremely strong.When things got hard, Santiago didn't talk negative, he always thought positive and just thought he'd try harder next time around. For example, when he caught the fish, he held on, and just kept going on with the trip, he didn't just let the fish go. On the other hand, the old man did all that was possible to stay alive and comfortable while he was working. Santiago didn't ever have any money because he was considered \\"unlucky.\\" When he didn't ever have any money, he was alone at times, and thought that was the end, he still worked really hard to stay alive, and turned to the good things in life. For example, without his young friend Manolin there to help him by bringing food, the poor old man had a good chance of dying, but still he tried his hardest to stay alive and well. Likewise, even though Santiago has other things to work at, he always plans on paying the things that come first. In conclusion, when he was having a hard time on the land, and in the water, the old man always gave the situation his all, and always thought positive.I enjoyed this book because it showed terrific inspiration. The way Santiago set himself a goal, and was his own person. Both Manolin and Santiago showed extreme maturity in everything they achieved. They also showed themselves worthy of a good fisherman. The Old Man and The Sea was a great book."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This book by Ernest Hemingway is amazing. This man has the ability to write a story while painting a picture with the scenes, and keeping the heart of a poet. Yet the entire time he does this while never allowing the reader to forget the author is male. It is a great book. In fact I recommend anything by this man."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I really enjoyed the movie (1990) with Anthony Quinn as Santiago. So I decided it was time to read the book. Well I found the book and the movie paralleled pretty well. How ever I was getting bored with the book it seemed a bit repetitive. The old man kept going on and on about Joe Dimaggio's bone spur.There were a few places that made me squeamish. One such place is when he gutted a dolphin and had his face stuck in it.The story is too short to go into detail without revealing the surprises; however it is about (you guessed it) an old fisherman, that should be over the hill, going out to sea from Cuba to catch fish. He has 84 days of bad luck and with any luck this is about to change (or is it?)The reader helps bring the story to life.The Old Man and the Sea ~ Anthony Quinn"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"After winning the Pulitzer in 1953, THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA received special recognition in the citation that accompanied Ernest Hemingway's 1954 Nobel Prize for Literature. And the Panel recognized \\"[Hemingway's] powerful, style-forming mastery art of narration\\" that has captured men and women's imaginations for several generations.\\"He was an old man who fished alone in a skiff in the Gulf Stream and he had gone eight-four days now without taking a fish. In the first forty days a boy had been with him. But after forty days without a fish the boy's parents told him that the old man was now definitely and finally salao, which is the worst form of unlucky...It made the boy sad come in each day with his skiff empty and he always went down to help him carry either the coiled lines or the gaff and harpoon and the sail that was furled around the mast. The sail was patched with flour sacks and, furled, it looked like a flag of permanent defeat.The old man was thin and gaunt with deep wrinkles in the back of his neck. The brown blotches of the benevolent skin cancer the sun brings from its reflection on the tropic sea were on his cheeks. The blotches ran well down the sides of his face and his hands had the deep-creased scars from handling heavy fish on the cords. But none of these scars were fresh. They were as old as erosions in a fishless desert.Everything about him was old except his eyes and they were the same color of the sea and were cheerful and undefeated.\\"Santiago was born a fisherman and simply loved to fish. He happily awakens from his dreams of lions on a beautiful African beach each day with the hope that on this eight-fifth day he will get a fish. He rows out before the sun starts to rise above his beloved sea. As the sun breaks over the horizon he decides to go far out, farther than he should without the boy. He sees the bird circling and knows where to get his elusive fish. And his sticks slightly quiver. A fish at last! Now the battle between the old man and the fish begins. \\"Then, with his right hand he felt the difference in the pull of the line before he saw the slant change in the water. Then, as he leaned against the line and slapped his left hand hard and fast against his thigh he saw the line slanting slowly upward.\\"He's coming up,\\" he said. \\"Come on hand. Please come on.The line rose slowly and steadily and then the surface of the ocean bulged ahead of the boat and the fish came out. He came out unendingly and water poured from his sides. He was bright in the sun and his head and back were dark purple and in the sun the stripes on his sides showed wide and a light lavender. His sword was as long as a baseball bat and tapered like a rapier and he rose his full length from the water and then re-entered it, smoothly, like a diver and the old man saw the great scythe-blade of his tail go under and the line commenced to race out...He is a great fish and I must convince him, he thought. I must never let him learn his strength not what he could do if he made his run. If I were him I would put in everything and go until something broke. But, thank God, they are not as intelligent as we who kill them; although they are more noble and more able.The old man had seen many great fish. He had seen many that weighed more than a thousand pounds and he had caught two of that size in his life, but never alone. Now alone, and out of sight of land, he was fast to the biggest fish he had ever seen and bigger than he ever heard of, and his left hand was still as tight as the gripped claws of an eagle.\\"On the third day Santiago finally wins the battle, but not before he has suffered. His hands are torn, his back and legs roil in pain, and he is suffering sun sickness. But he has endured to achieve his personal best. But the sharks finally defeat him. He rows into his home harbour with a gigantic skeleton. only the great Marlin's tail is intact. The boy weeps for the old man. But Santiago never complains that he is now 87 days without a fish. He did his job and his personal best was not good enough. He goes home and sleeps dreaming of lions. He will get up the next morning and he and the boy will go out together and fish. He knows life's bitterness and sweetness: strength of character, endurance, and the importance in defeat. He did his best to bring the Marlin to Market, though his best wasn't good enough on the 87th day. Perhaps the 88th day his best will be enough. And tonight, I will sleep dreaming of lions frolicking in the sand on an African beach."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I have finished reading this book for Lit. class.

One day, when Santiago went out to sea, he sees a large fish. After finally managing to capture it and succeeding, he tries to drag it home.

The book starts off as the old man (Santiago), had already went out fishing at sea for 84 days, and he was ready to go on his 85th day the next morning. He woke up that morning, and him and a boy he was friends with got everything ready, and he set off into the sea. Later that day he caught a small fish, but this wasn't what he was aiming for, he was after much larger fish. Even later that day he felt his line being pulled, and he soon set the hook on a marlin well over 10 feet long. He battled this fish for a long time, about a day and a half, and he grew very tired, and weak from not having much to eat. He liked to talk to himself at sea, and he thought that most people would think he was crazy for this, but he didn't care. Eventually he wrestles the fish to the boat and stabs it with his spear and ropes it to the boat. He begins his journey back toward shore, and he encounters more than 5 sharks while he is trying to get the fish back, and each shark he encounters takes a large bite out of his prize fish. He makes several weapons to try to fight off the sharks, and they work at first, but eventually break. He gets the fish back to shore about 3 days after he first set out, and can barely even walk to his shack, he finally makes it after falling down several times, and he just falls asleep for a really long time. The other townspeople are astonished by the fish in the morning, and wish to congratulate him, but he is far too weak to talk to anyone, and they do what the man wishes with the remainder of the fish. And the man falls back asleep, and dreams, and the book ends. Overall I thought this book deserved a 4 out of 5 because it was entertaining, but did lack some interesting points at times. I recommend this book to anyone who likes to be entertained, and whoever likes survival type books."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"What makes Michael Jordan and Tiger Wood exceed their hype in what they do is in the grace they do it with. They don't necessarily make it look easy but you see the result of hardwork and you say this fellow has done a good job. Hemingway's not an exception. Writing the way he has and the simplicity of it all completely belies the decades of honing a talent encapsulated in genius.To think that The Old Man and The Sea is a \\"simple\\" book would be wrong. This story is a snapshot of life in many dimensions: a vessel on which you float, arching of the Sun along the hours of time, a desire to persist in achieving a goal, living with the consequences of our actions, and actions not within our control all make up the strings of life waiting to be strummed."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Quote: \\"There are a few issues with the book (hence the four out of five grade) which include how the book bounces around and can become a little choppy at times.\\" - reviewer belowFirst of all, I'd like to remind those who aren't familiar with Hemingway - hey,choppy is his style! His simple prose was what made him stand out, and it was very beautiful and powerful.Anyway, I was very impressed with this classic. I had it on my bookshelf for a long time, and I finally got to it. I found myself feeling very in love with the old man, and thought the relationship with the boy was so tender and profound. The way he constantly thought of him during his battle out at sea was so sad because at that point in his life he really needed that boy's friendship.The lovely descriptions of the sea and its life really makes the reader see it all, and you feel the pain and burdens of the old man as well. This one is truly a simple and short story with an abundance of symbolic meaning. I urge those who have not read the book yet to look for certain things that I found interesting.First, Santiago's dreams about lions playing on an African beach. Then the wonderful, calm, relationship he has with nature and how he sees it as a \\"brother,\\" and deeply respects it.Also, discover the amazing gift that the Marlin fish gives to Santiago, the old man. Santiago leaves in one state, goes through triumphs and trials at sea, and returns differently.Finally, the reaching old age is a different state of mind, and Hemingway describes bittersweet human feelings of life in it's December, and also captures them beautifully in Santiago's pensative character."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"If you only read one Hemingway work--and that is not meant to disparage either you, or Hemingway--this should be it.

Yes the toad fish or if you are feeling less regional the oyster toad fish or Opsanus tau if you will. When I was a boy we would visit the Atlantic coast of North Carolina (the Pacific Coast of NC was to far of a drive) and hang with my grandparents. My grandfather would as a rule take us fishing freshwater and then for a week or two we would be on the coast fishing in big blue aka the Atlantic Ocean. My grandfather was not flush with cash so we normally found very creative places to dip a hook.Shrimp and squid was the bait of choice, my grandfather would scoff at my collection of lures and try as I might I always went back to real live dead bait, because the lures never worked and the dead bait would produce. We would use a 2 oz weight with two hooks, drop it into the water and most of the time you could real in two fish! Pin fish, blow fish, croakers, preacher dicks, eels, spot, mullet among others but my favorite was the toad fish! The toad fish is ugly and not good to eat but it was a fighter and the sense of danger you would feel when trying to take it off your hook was addictive, the thing had jaws like a vice and always in the back of my mind I would think \\"what if this thing latched on to my daddy parts\\"?The ocean is about fished out, I cant remember the last time I caught a toad fish ~\` I t makes me sad but then again I don't fish that often if I am on the coast so maybe the sea still has a bounty but its lost to me, I miss the I caught bottom like tug of a toad fish and the adrenaline rush I felt when I would ask my grandfather to help me get it off my hook.

The first 40 days a little boy was with him but after 40 days his parents didn't want him away with the old man anymore. To tell you anymore about the book would ruin Hemingway's purpose for writing it. To read the book yourself order it right now. It is definately a &quot;can't put it down for anything&quot; classic.

Santiago loves this fish, respects its beauty, its size, its power, but still must demonstrate his own power, mainly for the sake of his pride. When he catches the fish, ties it to the skiff, and hauls it back to shore, frenzied sharks begin to feed on the now defenseless carcass. Santiago acts in the great marlin's defense, protecting its beauty, its dignity, as well as his own triumph over the mammoth beast. He needs to be the sole destroyer of this fish. Yet the marlin is still decimated by the relentless sharks, and Santiago feels he must blame himself for the fish's demise. Santiago's bitter struggle to reel in the mammoth prize is told simply and eloquently in a style that forever bears the Hemingway stamp."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This book is a true classic. It is the story of down-on-his-look Cuban fisherman who is the fight of life against a giant marlin. What is great about this book is that it tells exactly what the old man is thinking. This makes the story all the more real as we learn that the old man is thinking about the arm-wrestling he won in Mexico or wondering if Joe Dimaggio's bone-spurs are more painful than his rope-burn. The old man makes a great hero as he does not give up under any circumstance and he treats the the marlin he is trying to catch not as just another fish but as brother."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"By far one of the most profoundly beautiful pieces of American literature ever written.

The fish, like all great fish, puts up a great fight but in the end of the second day finally kisses the blue ocean goodbye. The main point, I think, is a metaphor; we always want what we can't get and when we do get it, we never have it for long.

IMHO, TOMatS works best as fishing adventure and is slightly hokey as an existential allegory. Nonetheless, this won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 1953, maybe in recognition of Hem's many outstanding stories. Still, I think he produced more impressive work inThe Sun Also Rises,A Farewell to Arms, andFor Whom the Bell Tolls.With 766 Amazon.com reviews, I'm sure there's nothing left unsaid about this pretty-good story. But... this does show Hem's debt to his boyhood hero Theodore Roosevelt, who was an outdoorsman advocating for the strenuous life when Hem was growing up in Oak Park. In fact, TOMatS is most alive when Hemingway writes concretely about male adventure, as did Ted when he was on safari in British East Africa in 1909.\\"The night was clear, the stars shone brightly, and in the west the young moon hung just above the line of tall tree-tops. Fires were speedily kindled and the men sat around them, feasting and singing in a strange minor tone until late in the night.

I believe he's one of those authors that you either hate or love. I am happy that I am, like many, one who adores him.The book itself is a philosophy of sorts. It doesn't entirely have a plot, therefore it doesn't entirely have a purpose. Then again, I consider book to be about moral and not about man. The way this moral is portrayed is helpful and perfect.As for the characters, there is little to say. The central characters are the old man and the fish. Each had admiring qualities that I am constantly searching for in characters. The old man's spirit and determination was what truly helped get through this book. He was entertaining and his speechs eloquent. Though the fish wasn't really a character, I found myself sympathizing and empathasizing with the creature. The author poured passion into such simple characters making them out to be complex.It was fascinating to read this book. It kept interest and I didn't want to put it down.

A double hitter!Four Stars:Can't say that I \\"like\\" Hemingway but few writers can match his imagery. That specific talent soars in this book.Well, in this novella. I was surprised by how short it was when I first picked it up.Santiago, a very old man in a fishing village has earned respect over his long life but he has been unsuccessful in bringing in fish for a very long time. He has a young protogee, Manolo, who is very fond of him. Manolo's family has made him leave Santiago's skiff work though because they wanted Manolo to actually get some fish. Manolo is very considerate of Santiago and, while obeying his family, manages to ensure that Santiago has food and is kept as warm as such proverty-stricken conditions allow.One day, Santiago, alone in his skiff, decided to go further out on the sea to look for fish especially when he detected a large bird diving in a specific area - a sign that fish should be close. Hemingway's prose is gripping that describes this decision and the rowing and care for the lines as Santiago worked his way further out. A long wait and continual checking on the lines finally gives an indication that the decision was a correct one. One line is grabbed by what must be a huge fish, Santiago thinks. The fish is so large that he actually towed Santiago's skiff out further to sea. For three days and three nights, Santiago's skiff is towed but refuses to give up. Santiago must manage the lines, literally, with his bare hands (and his back.) That is the equipment used at the time - no automated assistance available in this time period. He is convinced the fish will tire and that will enable Santiago to capture him. Santiago, as opposed to Ahab, considers this great beast to be his brother. He regrets the need to kill him but believes that \\"his brother\\" understands the things in life and that he will provide nourishment to many people. The physical pain and injury that Santiago experiences and how he manages those obstacles was inspiring. Santiago felt proud of himself.Santiago captured my heart with his humility and endurance. He is said, at the beginning of the story, to understand that he is humble in nature and doesn't question that. That humility is tested when after succeeding in capturing a fish of almost historically unmet size and weight, he has to fight off the sharks that want to take his prize. He loses that fight. He wonders if he really was happy about the catch because it would feed so many people or did pride, for once in his life, make him take chances that were so outrageous.A true pyrrhic victory.I was so impressed by how Hemingway wrote both the struggle with the fish and against the marauding sharks. I was so gripped by Santiago's discussions with himself about how he would handle his injuries so that he could continue to work toward capturing the fish and, again, defeating the sharks. I was so moved by how he kept wishing \\"the boy\\" was with him.Without being heavy-handed with symbolism, Hemingway still makes the points of being reborn (3 days and 3 nights); that maturity of age and the energy of youth having equally valid strengths; that, on occasion, simply knowing that you won will just have to be enough.The spoils of war are sometimes spoiled.Enchanting read.DL"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I love Hemingway, and this is one of my favorites of his works.

I cry every time I read it. There is a noble sadness to the book that makes u interested every time u read it."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The most fascinating aspect of Hemingway's \\"Old Man and the Sea\\" is that it is timeless. Yes, it can be read on the story level, but if you do only that you're missing the point. I truly believe that Hemingway meant this to be a sort of fable.The plot is nothing much: Santiago is an old fisherman who has had no luck recently. He is shunned by his village and even the small boy who is supposed to accompany him is taken away. He's completely alone when he decides to go out into the Gulf.When he does land a fish, it is the struggle of his life. While he has the fish online we're privy to his inner thoughts, and most of all, his conflicts. He wants to catch the fish and puts up the fight of his life, but the fish is also fighting and part of Santiago respects this, and part of him wants the fish to win.The story on a much deeper level is about two things in my mind: Man's struggle with his environment, and man's struggle with himself. The conflict of emotions within Santiago are in a way even more heartbreaking than those between himself and the village that has so shunned him, for the conflict within a person is all his--all that one person's problems.Some have seen Santiago as a Christ-like figure, and I suppose this is possible, but if you want to take it to that level you're probably carrying it further than Hemingway meant, though we can't know that for sure.I like Hemingway's books, but some of them seem colorless at times. This one, \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" seems timeless and is the best thing he ever produced. It IS a classic in so many senses. I don't think anyone realized that this book would stand the test of time when it first appeared. Now it is everywhere and has been read by almost everyone.A short easy read, there's more packed into this novel than most bestsellers today.

Manolin has much faith in Santiago, which is mentioned on page 12. \\"He hasn't much faith.\\" \\"No.\\" the old man said. \\"But we have. Haven't we?\\" \\"Yes,\\" the boy said. Santiagois down on his luck, he hasn't had a catch in 84 days, and on the 85th day Santiago decides that he will not return home without a catch, to break his losing streak. On the 85th day, alone in the boat, he manages to hook an enormous marlin, the biggest fish he's ever seen in all his life. The fish is larger and stronger than Santiago. Santiago's experienced fishing skills and his will to catch and survive push him to pursue the fish for many days, and many miles out to sea. Santiago loves this fish, he respects it for its beauty, its size, and its power. Pg. 49, \\"Then he began to pity the great fish he had hooked. He is wonderful and strange and who knows how old he is, he thought.\\" Still Santiago must demonstrate his own power over the fish, for the sake of his pride. After an incredible and exhausting fight, the fish is his. He must now get it back to shore. After killing the fish, he ties the fish to the skiff. The marlin fish he catches is as big as the struggle he has yet to face after his catch. And so his next battle begins. Sharks appear and start to feed on the defenseless carcass of the marin fish. Santiago tries to defend the great fish, he tries to defend its beauty, its dignity, as well as his own triumph over the fish. He tries to defend his prize, his joy, and make it back to shore. Read to find out the conclusion to The Old Man and The Sea. Hemingway's language is simple and profound and he touches us, enabling us to feel Santiago's emotionts, experiences and struggles. His sentences are full of detail but at the same time are very clear. The author delves into the mind of the old man, and we experience the pain and suffering that Santiago endures through trying to catch his fish. There are four reocurring themes that the author presents in The Old Man and The Sea. The first theme that Hemingway presents is the idea that you shouldn't keep wishing you would have this thing or that, do what you can with what you have. \\" I wish I had a stone for the knife,\\" the old man said after he had checked the lashing on the oar butt. \\"I should have brought a stone.\\" You should have brought many things, he thought. But you did not bring them, old man. Now is no time to think of what you do not have. Think of what you can do with what there is.\\" The next theme Hemingway presents is the idea that something is too good to be true, or that something is so good that you must be dreaming. Pg 97, \\"He could see the fish and he had only to look at his hands and feel his back against the stern to know that this had truly happened and was not a dream. At one time when he was feeling so badly toward the end, he had thought perhaps it was a dream.\\" Then he mentions, \\" Now he knew there was the fish and his hands and back were no dream. Another of Hemingways many themes is the idea that man is not to be defeated. In this story, full awareness of defeat is contrasted with an unwillingness to be destroyed. Pg. 101, \\" But man is not made for defeat,\\" he said. \\"A man can be destroyed but not defeated.\\" One of the most important and most reocurring themes in this story is the power struggle between man and nature or what we call man vs. nature. On page 66, the old man is talking about how he will show the fish what man can endure, he says, \\"Although it is injust, he thought. But I will show him what a man can do and what a man endures.\\" The old man also shows respect for nature,and calls the fish his brother. The old man says, \\"It is enough to live on the sea and kill our true brothers.\\" I highly recommend this book. It is a sad but extremely beautiful book. I enjoyed reading about Santiago and his struggle with catching the big fish. It reminds me of the struggles we face in our daily life. This book is about the human spirit and the struggles we face in our lives with ourselves and nature."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"It was a very good read.

Now I have grown bored with this answer and have developed a rough chart on people I can beat up, some are easy some take time. Now if asked if I can beat up someone I tell them yes and how long it would take. At the top of the list I am going to place the Incredible Hulk, I ran the numbers and it would take me 4 hours to beat him up.1. Incredible Hulk : 4 hours of good old fashion street fighting, but in the end I would exhaust him and be declared the winner.2. Evangeline Lilly : 3 days . Not really a fight but I would sure be spent after the engagement.3. 300lb Giant Lobster: 2 days in his environment 2 minutes in mine.4. Superman: He is a fictitious character so I will not dignify this with a response.5. Sylvester Stallon and Tom Cruise teamed: Well this is tricky cause in real life about 30seconds but also in real life I might have a little fun with them first. I would climb up on my dining room table and pull up all the chairs with me and sit on one and watch while the two circled trying to figure out how to get up to my high perch. Stallon would eventually tie a rope to Cruise and through him up on the table and then climb up the rope afterwards. I wold then take the two by the scruff of their necks and drop them in a huge aquarium with a giant 2 lb. Lobster and lots of prehistoric decorations, big little boulders, big little fern trees and so on. Then comes web cam and a reality blog of Stallon and Cruise living together in a prehistoric land with a giant lobster. It would be so cool to see Cruise in the lobsters pinchers crying like a little baby scientologist. It would be a smash hit, not to mention a money maker...Don't let me forget this idea.6. Kodiak Bear: 2 Hours It would be a challenge but I think I could take him in two.7. BlackBeard: We have agreed not to fight even if he were alive.8. Arnold: 3 minutes just so he can save face. I want him to run for re-election cause he talks funny and his wife skelator freaks me out. I am not saying I want him to win I am just saying I like to here him talk funny.9. Steven Segal: 3 seconds .Steven Segal is a puss.10. My brother toilet.

Often, critics look upon this work as a reflection of the author's rugged individualism, but there is a tragic aspect that clearly makes this work a representative piece of the Modernist era--a period of time from the early to the middle of the twentieth century, where, among other things, was a real fear that the world's classical values were disappearing. To me, this is apparent in the relationship between Manolin and Santiago, Santiago's pathetic quest for the eighteen-foot marlin, and the encroachment of a commercial world apparent through the tourists.What first strikes my sensibilities is the integral relationship between the apprentice, Manolin, and his master, Santiago, who, according to society's standards, can be considered a cast away as a result of the death of his wife, his financial hardship, his weak physical condition, and, increasingly, his declining performance as a fisherman. Clearly, he is in the last stages of his life and can only function with the assistance of Manolin, who increasingly has begun to venture off into his own sphere as, one might suspect, a successful commercial fisherman. And yet, Manolin is the son we fathers would all want: his loyalty, his respect of his elders, his willingness to learn the ways of the past, and, most importantly, his humility in the face of his own superiority. Living in Katy, I still witness these relationships, but increasingly they can be found only in movies or in books such as Hemingway's.Hemingway also aptly points out the fleeting ancestral values through Santiago's pathetic quest for the king of fishes. This journey displays Santiago's cunning and physical prowess as a fisherman and reinforces his commitment to Manolin, but clearly, as Santiago leaves the familiar to venture out into unfamiliar waters, he must battle not only the marlin itself that is dragging him out to sea but also the sharks that naturally want their pound of flesh for his sin. At the top of Santiago's mind is Manolin, of course, but his deeper motivation is to prove himself worthy of the battle, and, in the process be rewarded with the riches accompanied with selling the flesh of the marlin, his revered brother. In a not so subtle way Hemingway, I believe, sends the subtle message that Santiago's flaw is what many modern men do today: going to extremes to earn wealth from the world and admiration from society, especially of those closest to them. Santiago may have accomplished his ultimate goal, but he is merely left with a skeleton that reminds him of his tragic error.The other aspect of this novella that is striking are the tourists. The tourists really could almost be any of us, especially in that last scene where one spots the discarded skeleton of the marlin heaped in trash pile. \\"What is that?\\" the tourist asks. Although the waiter gives a literal and wrong response, Hemingway's answer is clear: it's the values of a bygone era expressed through the interplay of Manolin and Santiago heaped upon the trash pile of history. All may not be bleak. Manolin rushes to aid Santiago by providing him food and comfort, but one has to wonder if the younger generation will be as kind and generous as Manolin. That fear may be answered in the final line when, in a dream, we learn what is at the top of Santiago's mind: the Lions of Africa, symbols of his glorious youth that will live only as long as the deteriorating old man.As many have demonstrated, Hemingway's genius is to take the every day and pack it with symbolic values in the most terse language. The Old Man and the Sea is not an exception. One part fishing story, one part allegory, and the final part social commentary, this story is truly rewarding for those patient enough to unravel the layers of the story's onion."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"\\"Be detailed and specific.

There is nothing like it in American fiction; it says a great deal about man and his relationship with the rest of the world."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I first read Ernest Hemingway as a young college student and missed the depth in his simplicity. Reading him again has turned my opinion around. I urge you to read this book.In \\"The Old Man and the Sea,\\" he shows the story is not in the language per se, but in the complexity found in the subtle reality of life.Of course, \\"Old Man,\\" is not subtle in the classic sense. What I mean is that Hemingway doesn't labor the book with fantastic descriptions detailing the intricacies of the sea, or of being a fisherman. Instead, he delves into the mind of the old man, shows the fatherly love he has for a young boy, and the quest for his legacy.A quick read, I finished it in three or so hours. I was captured by the smell of the salt and the slippery feel of fish squirming in a net. I felt the thirst of a long night fighting a huge fish, and the burn of a fishing line running through my hands. I missed the young boy's company late on the boat, and also wished he were to help me fish. How Hemingway did do this to me?As a Midwesterner, I have barely seen the sea, and have never really fished. It is a great book. Read it for the drama, the language, the psychology, the suspense. It is romance in the sense an old western novel is a romance. By all means, read it.I fully recommend \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" by Ernest Hemingway.Anthony Trendlhttp://anthonytrendl.com"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"\\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" remains a literary staple for students learning about literature -- and American literature in particular. I read this book many years ago and just re-read Ernest Hemingway's best-known work.This novella offers different things, and different perspectives, at different times. Put another way, \\"The Old Man and Sea\\" might read as an entertaining fish story to a young student and then offer an insightful metaphor for life for an adult.One of the interesting metaphors that I found on my most recent read of this novella is that of the sea for perspective. Hemingway writes of the different levels, or layers, in the sea through the eyes of Santiago, the protagonist. There are different fish, and different challenges, across different layers of the sea. One can look down through the water and see different things based on how deeply one looks.Given the widespread popularity and critical acclaim for this novella, it is no real surprise that it is an entertaining and enjoyable (and quick) read. I encourage all readers to examine this book at different times in life.

Some will find this struggle tiring, but if the reader looks at it as a man doing what must be done, he will come away with a lot.

Certainly enough has been said about this book -- and enough book reports cribbed from Cliff's Notes et al. - that any reviewer who presumes himself intelligent should put forth high-minded and multi syllabic ruminations. At this I am a failure. I just think it is a great adventure! The story of the old Cuban alone in the ocean, battling, landing, and ultimately losing to sharks the biggest fish he has ever encountered, is magnificent. I found myself mentally in the boat with him, and endured his selfsame agony as sharks first decimated, and then destroyed, his remarkable catch. Again, as the scholars have said, I am sure this all &quot;means&quot; something. I will content myself, though, in this fine tale memorably told."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea is a great story told with a simple prose style that carries across the pages like wind.It is the tale of one man, in his own sad world, who carries upon his shoulders the burden of age -- to triumph against the immortal forces of the universe, to have it ripped away, only to learn his own mortality through his conquered prey.This is a tale not so much about the hardship and triumph of marlin fishing, but a tale of an aging champion. It is anything but boring."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This is an ok story if you enjoy fishing. I personally don't enjoy fishing that much so this book did not hold my interest for very long. The story was far too tragged out when the author starts talking about his battle of the fish. Again, if you are a fisherman this will hold your interest to the final page. For me, however, this book was a bit boring. The part I did like about the book was when the sharks ate the fish that Santiago had fought so hard to catch. The description about the big, white Mako eating the fish caught my interest. Hemingway describes the head and the jaws of the fish very well. If I had written the book I would have not written so much about Santiago catching the fish. Instead I would have written more about the sharks and Santiago fighting for the fish. There are some parts of the book I would have understood better had I been a fisherman myself. The book was easy to read because the beginning about Santiago not catching a fish for 60 days and the end when the shark eats the fish that Santiago caught are the reasons that make this book good. If you mix the good with the bad you get an ok story."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This book was great.

I feel it has an interesting description of a man catching a fish, but it's hard to believe Ernest Hemmingway could write an entire book about one topic - fishing! If this book was not required for me to read for my English class, I would not have read it. To read Ernest Hemmingway's books, you have to &quot;read into&quot; everything, which was challenging at times.

I would not want to read this book in my free time, because it isn't very exciting, but considering it's a book I had to read for school, it's not too bad. The only drawback of it is that it is too lengthy. The same thing could have been written in half as many words and portrayed the same idea.

I found it to be boring and not suspenseful. Also, I think Ernest Hemingway intended his book for older readers and I feel the ending needs something more. All in all I did not like The Old Man and the Sea.The book was not interesting and suspense is much needed. For example, \\"The myriad flecks of the plankton were annulled now by the high sun and it was only the great deep prisms in the blue water that the old man saw now with his lines going straight down into the water that was a mile deep.\\" (40) This quote and many others like it made me yawn uncontrollably. Interesting books don't make readers yawn. In addition to being boring it didn't leave me wanting more. For instance, \\"It was quite light and any moment now the sun would rise.\\" (32) Where is the suspense? All stories need suspense to keep the reader involved. A good book is a book a reader doesn't want to put down. Therefore the book is not one I would recommend to others.The Old Man and the Sea was intended for older audiences and the ending needs to have some changes. For example, Santiago is at sea and then BAM he is home again, the end. The ending needs more content and it ought to explain what happens after Santiago returns. It leaves the reader wondering and lost. Also, the tone of this book wasn't written for junior high students to read. The book is sophisticated and most teenagers today are not into such sophisticated writing. I being a teenage reader makes me of all people understand this. In conclusion, most teenagers are not interested in this book and the ending needs to have some changes made.Even though Ernest Hemingway is one of the great American writers of all time this book is not one of his best. I found The Old Man and the Sea to be boring, without suspense, written for an older audience, and the ending needs to be different. In my opinion I didn't like The Old Man and the Sea."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea Book reviewThe Old Man and the Sea, to me the mention of its name makes me want to fall asleep. In my own opinion The Old Man and the Sea by Ernest Hemingway was a book that lacks suspense and voice from the author. For example \\"He settled comfortably against the wood and took his suffering as it came and the fish swam steadily and the boat moved slowly through the dark water (pg64). This piece of writhing doesn't keep my attention and I don't feel the need to keep reading to see what happens in the story.The material is to general and the author's voice barely comes through in his writing. For instance \\"The myriad flecks of the plankton were annulled now by the high sun and it was only the great deep prisms in the blue water that the old man saw now with his lines going straight down into the water that was a mile deep\\" (pg40) sentences seem to go on forever and they still do not show a strong voice from the author. The reader can't tell who is writing because the author's style isn't shown in his work.I believe that even though Hemingway was a great author of his time this particular piece of writhing is not up to his usual high standards that the average reader comes to expect. All in all I found the book to general and I think it needs more good details and voice from the author."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Boring ... Repetitive ... Predictable ... These are just a few words that describe Ernest Hemmingway's novel, The Old Man and the Sea. With each turn of the page, the book worsens. The plot of the book is solid, yet it is lacking the details, originality, and emotion to be a great story.The Old Man and the Sea is just a dull tale of man vs. fate. For example, Santiago is very persistent in fishing, yet he does not catch a fish in 87 days. No matter how hard Santiago tries, he can't catch a fish. There is an obstacle in his way that he cannot overcome - fate. Furthermore, fate also stands in Santiago's way when he finally catches the fish of his dreams. After he catches the fish, problems arise that are out of his control. Even though Santiago might have deserved this fish, fate took it away from him. There are two major themes in this book - fate and luck, neither which are very kind to Santiago.With a predictable ending and dull dialogue, The Old Man and the Sea is painful to read. For instance, the ending of the book is not only predictable, but so are the pages that lead up to it. I found myself in agony as I turned each page for I knew it would be the same repetitive dialogue. As I neared the ending, I knew what was going to happen and didn't feel a need to finish the book. In addition to the predictable ending, this book is also painful to read because of the short, choppy sentences that dominate most of the story. With this writing style that Ernest Hemmingway models, I do not see how it is possible for anyone to like this book. I would not recommend The Old Man and the Sea to anyone. This book should not have won any awards. It's too short, too simple, and just too boring.The Old Man and the Sea is not a quality read. The only thing this book is good for is for English classes to read. I haven't read any other works of Hemmingway, and I don't plan to. I lost all interest in his writing while reading this book.

The story's style makes the reader feel as though he too his sitting on the small boat with the Old Man.

Otherwise ull enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The book wasn't too long, in fact, it was incredibly short. And while it is full of symbolism that a person may not catch in the first read, it still wasn't worth it. I'm not a person that hates reading books, in fact, I enjoy it, but when I read this one, it was a struggle to continue reading. I did not find it too enjoyable, and I doubt if any people who do not enjoy reading/fishing/symbolism are going to really want to pick this one up."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I agree that children who hate reading and doing book reports should not post their reviews on Amazon, because the kids are going to hate reading it anyway since it is an assignment. As an 18 year old book lover, I thought I would give this book a try. Nobody forced me to read it, I read it for my own enjoyment. I just did not find this book interesting. I kept thinking..Santiago, let that fish go and row back to shore. Was it really worth all that trouble? I gave this book two stars because the book had one or two genuine moments in it that inspired me, but I did not care for the story as a whole. The book left me disappointed, so I started reading &quot;A Brave New World&quot;. It is a much better book, in my opinion."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Okay, so I was forced, by way of caring about my grades at the point, into reading this book for freshman HS English class. Ten years and some 3,500 showers later, I still can't get the stink of this fish off me. I promise you, I still have fits when I see it on bookstore shelves. The only redeeming quality about this book is Unca Ernie's name on the cover (although, being in the middle of &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; at the moment, I'm not sure that qualifies as redeeming, at that). Sure, it's different, it's simple, it's simply brimming over with symbolism. But in my opinion, this is the sort of symbolism writers use when they don't really have anything to say. Yeah, Jesus, the cross, whatever-- we know the story, thanks. You can only read so much about how the moon is the brother of the fish and the lion is the brother of the man and the lion is also the brother of the moon and therefore the man is the brother of the fish and therefore Donnie Osmond is the brother of Marie Osmond before you want to stick your head through a plate glass window and slice your jugular open on a shard. As a matter of fact, I have a suspicion that shame over writing this book is the reason Hemingway killed himself. I speak three languages, and none of them have negative words strong enough for how I feel about this book. Would I be writing a review ten years after the fact if I didn't have strong feelings? As a last note, I do not tell friends to avoid this book, I encourage them to read it (but just checking it out at the library, don't give the sods anymore money!), because the utter badness of this book truly has to be experienced to be believed."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I read this book with great expectations. Hemingway has been billed as &quot;one of the greatest writers of the 20th century&quot;! I figured it must be good, to have so much publicity. I was wrong.The book starts out in Havana, where a poor old man lives. He fishes for a living and has not caught a fish in a while. He knows that he is near the end of his life. He knows a boy who comes over often, but can't fish with him anymore. The old man decides to embark on a fishing trip.Once this happens, the pages drag on. And on. The grammar is supposed to be &quot;cutting edge&quot; and &quot;of powerful simplicity,&quot; but it's really just incorrect. Call me a stickler, but in the end it's plain annoying.After a hundred pages of time at sea (with not one interesting page), the man returns with no fish. Oh, what great writing? No, just a boring &quot;novella.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Ernest Hemingway, in my opinion, is very over-rated. I know he's one of the greats but I'm just not fond of his style. He gets pretentiously romanticized in such films as City of Angels but I simply don't like him. I am sorry, I just don't. His writing style is harsh and obsessed with physical strengths and pretty much macho 'I must prove I'm a man Grrrrr! Fear my manliness!' content.I don't really feel the depth to his writing that others claim to feel and see. I can find it in Victor Hugo, Dickens, Wilde, and many others but not here, not with Hemingway...I am an avid reader and book collector. I love literature in general. I love books. I have always loved books but when I was tenth grade back in 1996 or so (I'm twenty eight now) my literature class was made to read The Old Man and the Sea. In my opinion this is the one book to choose if you WANT to make a book lover lose interest in books.Imagine, if you will, spending your entire teenagehood trying to tell other teeangers that books are wonderful. They take you on adventures and you meet fascinating characters who do incredible things. And then you're handed this book.An old man goes out on a boat and struggles with a really large fish for several days just to prove himself to himself. It's dull and tedious. To me it felt like self-justified egotism and an inferiority complex manifested in a story of a man proving his manliness by catching a large fish. It bored me.To me it felt as if Hemingway was insecure with his sense of being a masculine being, of being someone with purpose. He seemed that he always had to prove his own worth to himself and people had to prove their worth to him and it's reflected in his writing.I was told that Hemingway killed himself because he knew he was developing arthritis in his hands, this seems to reflect what I suspected of his personality already, a deep-seeded insecurity, self-consciousness and doubt of self-worth that he thought that he was of no worth to the world if his hands didn't function properly for his writing. He died in an era where recording your voice or dictating your story to someone else was fully possible. To me his suicide just proved the insecurity I noticed reflected in his 'Prove yoruself' droning prose that is The Old Man and the Sea. Yes, it's sad that he did that to himself but at the same time it showed the mindset that I disagree with and noticed in The Old Man and The Sea.I know there will be many who disagree with me but I do not like Hemingway's writing style. It reminds me of Jack London and I am not really a fan of Jack London either. Though I love stories about wolves, Jack London's knowledge of wolf behaviour is questionable at best. He didn't even realize wolves could bark or that they mate for life! And London's writing has that same macho 'prove your manliness' quality to it that makes the writing feel harsh and at certain points surprisingly shallow and insecure.The Old Man and the Sea personifies for me everything young readers usually resent about classic literature. It was unrelatable, anti-climatic, long winded, and all-together-lacking. I felt no sympathy for the hero. I didn't understand why he felt he had to catch the fish in order to be satisfied with who he was. And the lack of other characters, interaction, external antagonists or antagonism (aside from the fish) made it dull. I say this as someone who loves the intricacy of Victor Hugo's Les Miserables and the wit of Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray. I do NOT like Hemingway.I think schools make a big mistake in picking this novel for literature classes for young readers. It doesn't inspire interest in reading. I may cause students to lose interest in reading instead. It's the complete opposite of what's required to inspire young minds eager for adventure, drama and fantasy.I like good characterization and social interaction in my stories. I like tangible antagonists and more than two settings, I like my stories to have a littlle... more."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I hate fish this book was written about fish. This was torture to read."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"It would be easy to think that \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" is boring, and you would be right. The book tries to portray some good themes, but lacks enthusiasm and a page turning plot. Most of the plot is predictable and lacking of life like characters. This book is one of the worst I have ever read.The story has some good themes, such as survival and persistence, but needs work on the plot and the tone. The plot was basic, following a strict pattern that would be expected of lesser authors. There were hardly any twists in the plot to excite the reader. This is due to the poor foreshadowing, \\"he hadn't caught a fish in 85 days...\\" the entire story was predictable. The only turn in the plot came at the end near what might have been considered the climax, when the sharks played a big role in the ending. There is a very monotone feeling about the book. None of the characters show much emotion. Even for a senile old man, he should have at least shown some emotion at being dragged out to sea. During the entire story, there was no sense of urgency. The story seemed more focused on delivering the message then telling a colorful story. In general, \\"The Old Man and the Sea,\\" needed more work on developing emotional characters and creating a plot that would keep the reader interested.Ernest Hemingway didn't seem to put any research into his story. Some of the actions aren't very realistic. Holding onto a 17 foot fish in a dingy is not possible. I have gone fishing for large fish before, and fighting a four foot fish for an hour can make even the strongest man give up. There is no way a decrepit old man could keep a 17 foot marlin on his line for even 15 minutes. He would be pulled into the water. The whole tone wasn't very realistic. The only time there is any enthusiasm in the story is when the sharks attack the fish. Sharks the size described would be able to put a hole in the side of the book. A person could get more action fishing on a lake. This book lacks in realism and anyone who has gone deep sea fishing can easily see that.\\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" is a quick read but not even worth the time. If you're just after themes, this book might appeal to you, but if you want anything more, look elsewhere. Anyone who has signed on for a charter boat can tell Hemingway didn't put much thought into the technicalities of the book."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Hemingway apes \\"Moby Dick,\\" recasting Ahab as a \\"black sheep\\" shaman who constantly yearns for his overly emotional boy slave and has self-destructive tendencies he takes out on his loved ones and those who seek to possess said loved ones. Everything is emptiness, like brainpans fried away, ornaments without luster.At least Idaho Spud keeps his aimless ramblings brief, unlike the constipated \\"A Moveable Feast,\\" in which Papa Longstocking trained a spotlight on the mundanity of social hour at the writers guild."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I thought this book was pointless and had no meaning to it. All its about is some guy who goes out on a boat and chases a fish around for three days. When he finally returns home he doesnt even have any of the fish left because they got eaten by sharks on the way home. I dont reccomend this book unless you have a book report and want to read a short book."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Are you thinking about reading The Old Man and the Sea? Stop, right now. The Old Man and the Sea is at best very bad due to the poor plot, minor action, and boring characters.The plot was boring and actionless. For example, only two things really happen throughout this whole book. The Old Man is completely insane, all through the book he talks to his hand trying to make it uncramp and if that is not crazy I don't know what is. Now the second thing that happens is the shark attack. When it attacks it is the most exciting part in the book, but if I was to say how good the scene was I would have to say only mediocre at best. Also throughout the book it is all one setting. I don't know about you but sitting through a whole book with just the ocean for a setting is boring. To say the least he could have improved on the plot and setting a lot.As for the characters in this book, Oh, excuse me character as to that he was quite dull and not to bright either. For instance, the Old Man is always thinking about baseball and fishing and how he thinks everyone will think he is crazy nothing else. Being very one-sided like that the Old Man makes for a bad main character. The Old Man could have been made handsome, like myself, so he didn't have to be smart. He is also very simple minded he says he was put on earth to fish and nothing else. I myself would prefer a more multi faceted person. And if not that at least have more than one character. So the Old Man and the Seas lack of characters and the dullness and the simplicity of the character he does have does not help the book at all.So in conclusion, it's a very bad book and if the previous paragraphs did not prove it go ahead and read it, I don't care if you suffer. Also keep this in mind If I were to rate this on a scale of 1to 1000 One thousand being the best I would give it a one."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"There are many books out in the world that have been awarded for excellence. The Old Man and the Sea sadly was sung to the high heavens as Hemmingway's best work ever. I don't believe I would want to read his other books if that is the case. With a writing style so boring, The Old Man and the Sea isn't deserving of the Pulitzer Prize or even positive praise.The plot of the story aggresses slowly with predictable outcomes. For instance the \\"action\\" in the book happens so rarely and slowly. The day spent on the skiff is prolonged so much that it seems like weeks. Since it takes so long for the events to take place, the reader loses interest. In addition to the slow action the event, if noticeable, are foreshadowed well before. Because the main events take so long to happen, they are hard to notice due to the reader's boredom. If the reader has managed to stay conscious, they are able to predict the outcome of each predicament, making the story even duller. The Old Man and the Sea does not deserve an award of any kind. The events are slow and the outcomes predictable. That makes for dull reading and an uninterested reader.I refuse to recommend this book unless it is changed to satisfy most readers. Because the book needs to be changed, it won't be interesting until it is. .... The whole story, especially the ending, needs to be changed to make me read this book again. However, a small group of people might enjoy this book if it were recommended to them. People with extremely creative imaginations could actually find this book amusing. The only other person to enjoy it is a critic who was blackmailed a large sum on money to put in a good word. .... The Old Man and the Sea doe not deserve the award and especially any praise. I'd rather be stuck looking at teen magazines the read that book ever again.The Old Man and the Sea, as I've been saying so much, dose not deserve any praise at all.

The man character, a peasant fisherman, is written as simple, old-fashioned, and quaintly charming in an adroit manner that is neither stupid nor cliched.His battles with the sea seem very realistic. The story is basically a parable, man vs. the world. The old man is happy, he has led a good life, and he has found a struggle worth giving his life up for: perhaps the biggest fish ever caught.Unlike other ethnocentric Hemingway works, Hemingway shows a more deft sensitivity here, even deigning to give the fish a soul, if you can believe such a thing.Check this one out. It's short, and definitely worth it."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Hemingway invented a terse style using King James biblical cadences with an awful lot of and's and very few commas in his rhythmic sentences. Certainly no semicolons, God forbid. The shorter the word, the better. The more ordinary, the more often in common usage, the better--but sprinkled here and there we find a highbrow word thrown in as if for spice. In The Old Man and the Sea, which is a short story posing as a novel, Hemingway offers an example of the Sisyphean heroic tale.Each day for eternity Sisyphus rolls a heavy ball up a hill and at the end of each day the ball comes rolling down again. Albert Camus famously said that one imagines that Sisyphus was happy. The old man of Hemingway's story embodies the karma of the Sisyphean hero in that most days throughout his long life he has gone to the ocean to fish. And each day he comes home, and then the next day he goes out again. The forces he is up against, the sea itself, the leviathan monsters of the deep, the unpredictable weather, the seasons of dearth and plenty in unpredictable fashion--all of these things and more, including the wiles of women who are influenced by the moon, all of these things are like the ball and the force of gravity that Sisyphus labors against.And for what? And to what avail? It is the struggle itself that is the glory and the purpose and the reason for being. So saith Hemingway in the way he meticulously details the laborious struggle of man versus fish: of the old man, not as strong as he once was, not as full of the desire that once burned in his soul, not as keen in discernment or vision, yet still a man with a man's pride and a man's duty; and the primordial fish, the great marlin, powerful and beautiful, full of great dignity, smarting now, suffering now with a hook in its mouth.Who will win? Will the marlin break the line or will the crafty old man lead out just enough to keep him hooked, and then as the fish tires, slowly gain a little line, inch by inch?Some great or seemingly great event may define a man's life. Here it is the off chance of hooking an especially huge marlin, and with diminished strength, bring him in for all to see, that defines the old man's life. It is good that it comes late when for most the highlight of life was long ago. It is good that the effort nearly kills him, and it is especially good that there was much doubt about the outcome.This is the heroic or machismo view of this celebrated novel. Since this was first published in 1952 its reputation has waned, or not so much waned as become something seen from another direction. Instead of the heroic old man and the gallant marlin we see a kind of anthropomorphic delusion in which a hook of steel and a large brain torture a huge, dim-witted creature to death. Instead of an epic struggle we see one predator taking advantage of another. Instead of heroism we see a kind of tedious Darwinian incident made into something akin to a Greek myth.And so it is with Hemingway himself. Now seen as incorrigibly sexist and as more of a stylist than a writer of substance, Hemingway is no longer revered in the English departments of our great universities. Instead he is remembered for shooting defenseless animals in Africa and imagining that such activities made him a man. Instead of being one of America's greatest writers, he is now recalled as a good short story writer whose stylish mannerisms eventually grate on our sensibilities. From being a great artist he has fallen to being a minor one, from being a best selling writer, the literary lion of his time, Hemingway is now remember as the man who blew his brains out because, as he is quoted as saying (in anticipation of course), something like, \\"I could no longer make love good.\\" Too bad he lived before the age of Viagra.Note the psychologically correct use of the adjective \\"good\\" instead of the grammatically required but artificial adverb \\"well.\\" Hemingway, like Mark Twain, made a point of not being a slave to grammar.Regardless of the rise and fall of his reputation and even regardless of the lack of political correctness of his writings, it is nonetheless the case that The Old Man and the Sea is a striking piece of work, sentimental to a fault, simplistic in philosophy and even shopworn in theme, yet still it is a book that must be read if only to add to our understanding of the progression of popular American literature from James Fenimore Cooper to Mark Twain through James T. Farrell and John O'Hara to Larry McMurtry and Stephen King.The Old Man and the Sea is in a sense a story best experienced young, which is one of the reasons it is on the high school curriculum. It is striking and totally fulfilling the first time it is read. Read it a second time and the mannerisms and the mock heroics begin to be discerned. Read it a third time and it becomes tedious. If read a fourth time the temptation is toward parody and burlesque."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"While on vacation last month I let a friend borrow this book. I had brought it with me to read and had so many others to choose from I decided to let her dig in while I read elsewhere. When she handed the book back to me I asked her what she thought. Her response was the quote in my review title. She looked at me and said \\"it's just a story\\" and at first I wasn't sure if that was a good or a bad thing.Then I read the book, and I understood what she meant.\`The Old Man and the Sea' is a very direct and literal story. There are no colorful details; no deep elaborations. Instead, the book (if one can call it that) gets right to the point. While many find a more philosophical and meaningful depth to this classic tale, I found the dryness a tad overwhelming and the overall effect to be rather stagnant. Yes, \`The Old Man and the Sea' is told in such a way that it loses impact. For me, it was just a story. It was the equivalent of sitting around the campfire and listening to your grandfather tell you, in an excruciatingly bland monotone, the story of that one fish he desperately tried to bring home.The story told is that of an old Cuban fisherman who ventures off for a fishing trip, catches himself a prize marlin and then battles with it, and the elements, in an attempt to prove his worth (to himself and doubters) by bringing it home. It is a simple story that could have used some life, but it just lays there and in the end failed to move me much at all. When I explained this to another friend they simply said, \\"well, I found it very \`Hemingway'\\" and then they shrugged and said \\"so, what you just said\\". In other words; apparently this dryness was his style. I haven't read other Hemingway, so I can't comment, but I'm not entirely sure I'm going to.You win some, you lose some.This lauded classic was lost on me, but this is solely my opinion and so isn't to be taken as the majority vote, since I seem to be highly outnumbered."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Today I sat down and read \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" by Ernest Hemingway. This was my first book by Hemingway, and I hated it. I plan on reading \\"The Sun Also Rises,\\" and \\"Farewell to Arms,\\" but if this book is a sign of things to come, I cringe thinking how I may waste precious time better spent on better books. This book was so wordy for such a nothing story. I know for many I've just become a heretic but this book is dreadfully boring. I had rather high expectations about this piece, as a good friend of mine has talked it up. I was sorely disappointed.Not having read Hemingway, I had an uninformed reverence for his writings; he's been mystified to a great degree. \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" is relentless in its repetition, and I never felt an affinity toward either of the two characters - the old man and the young boy (for whom the old man seems to have an inappropriate affection toward).There are several types of authors: those who are great at coming up with stories, those who are great at describing situations, and those who can do both. I will admit that Hemingway is good at describing but with this book he failed, in my opinion, to come up with a good story; it was quotidian at best. Authors like Tolkien, G. Martin, King, and Rowling are great at creating stories that captivate us but their writing styles are arguably pedestrian. Hemingway feels like a skillful musician who can play with great proficiency but listening to one of his songs is repetitious and unmemorable. I should suspend complete judgment until I've read several of this other works but as of now I would gravitate toward Gore Vidal when he said, \\"he's a show off....He's a publicist and should be selling automobiles on the corner....He's a fat little girl who should be in the typist pool. I'm changing his sex for him because I think he'd be happier. He is more like a vain little girl.\\""},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"There is no doubt that Ernest Hemingway's \\"The Old Man And The Sea\\" is an incredible novella that everyone who loves great literature ought to own. My low score here has nothing to do with Hemingway - it has to do with the audio version spoken by Donald Sutherland. I've listened to literally hundreds of audiobooks (my job both forces me and allows me to do so) - so to see this gem filled me with anticipation! Hemingway's brilliant tale of an old man suffering for relevance against time and mortality read by such an actor as Sutherland ought to have been outstanding - but Sutherland's performance is so lacking in passion or even creativity that I took to the time out to write my thoughts here for any who are looking to purchase the audio version. Don't do it - it'll break your heart. Leave Sutherland on the stage and away from the studio - he has not the ability or the willingness to tell a story, especially one as this, like it should be. He drones on - monotone and listless, without differentiation between characters or even between dialogue and description. It's three hours of somnambulistic regurgitation of a classic. That's no way to honor Hemingway."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I wanted a first addition to add to my new library.

Readers vary in taste. For instance, after reading Ernest Hemingway's The Old Man and the Sea, students in my class have different opinions about it. Personally I didn't find it very entertaining. I also believe that there is something in this book for all types of audiences. The Old Man and the Sea is a pleasing book but it lacks greatness.It has characters that the readers can relate to. I can relate to Santiago, the main character, because I often find myself to be unlucky at many things and if the reader tends to be lucky, then they can't really relate to this book. For example, in the book Santiago is an unlucky fisherman who hasn't caught a fish in eighty-four days. I can't relate to Santiago because I have never gone fishing and I know nothing about it. To most people a fishing adventure doesn't sound all that appealing. In addition to being an unlucky fisherman, Santiago goes on a fishing adventure. I am sure that a fisherman would enjoy reading about a fishing adventure. Loosing interest in The Old Man and the Sea isn't hard if the reader finds that they can relate to some of the characters.The Old Man and the Sea is targeted to entertain a certain audience. Most people who read this book I assume are not fishermen. I get lost and confused while reading The Old Man and the Sea. For example, most characters in the book are somehow connected to fisherman; sharks, fish, or fisherman. When I read about how Santiago is a fisherman, I suddenly didn't want to read the book. In addition to Santiago being a fisherman, he has been fishing most of his life. Now I'm surprised that Santiago is still a fisherman after all those years and becoming unlucky. Luck and fishing is what this book focuses on and if readers like that then they will surely like The Old Man and the Sea.Ernest Hemingway has a unique style of writing and it is very good. The Old Man and the Sea is one book that Ernest Hemingway wrote with his unique style. While reading this book I got lost repeatedly and had to reread a few parts. Some people enjoyed reading it. Whether readers like The Old Man and the Sea depend on their characteristics. People wont know if the like it or not until they read it."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Stevie LaBareMarch 11, 2002Period. 4All time classicThe Old Man and the sea is an all time classic. ThisNovel has a powerful style that appeals to many. This bookis a straightforward story about an old man and hisstruggles. I think this story moves slowly but demonstrateshow a good novel is written.Hemingway's style is easy to read and understand. Hedoesn't use words that overcomplicate the situation. Forexample he could have used long words that make the storysound more professional. Instead he used the least amountof words he could to get the point across and paint a vividpicture in the readers mind. Not only was his word choicegreat but he had a way to keep my attention throughout thewhole book. Through the whole thing I was always thinking oh my gosh what is going to happen next. Hemingway has language that is not cluttered and yet still exciting.I am not the only one who thinks The Old Man and The Sea is a good book. Hemingway won the Pulitzer Prize in 1953, for his outstanding writing skills. He is also known as the voice of the \\"lost generation.\\" Ernest Hemingway has a way to catch your attention and hold it till the end. Not only does he capture your attention but he also sets this book as a role model. His struggle with the marlin shows people to \\"never give up.\\" He shows bravery in all he does. It gives people hope that they can accomplish anything.The Old Man and the Sea is a great book. It is a perfect example of literature. This all time classic will be remembered for ever, it gives an example of what a perfect novel is."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the SeaIn the book The Old Man and the Sea had some very boring moments, but some of those moments were well made up for. It was written creatively but was very bland to myself as a reader. In The Old Man and the Sea it talks about Santiago&#65533;s struggles with his luck, and with his own will power.The creativity of the book while Santiago was on land with the boy was very dull. For example, &#65533;They sat on the Terrace and many of the fishermen made fun of the old man and he was not angry.&#65533; Santiago and Manolin only spent time worrying about fishing and they never shared their feelings about anything else that interested them besides baseball. They showed their care for each other in all their fishing needs. For instance, &#65533;He was asleep in a short time and he dreamed of Africa&#65533;&#65533; Santiago is always fantasizing of the better times and not facing reality. When he was facing reality he didn&#65533;t know how to handle it so he talked with himself for days until he had caught a fish he had been fighting for and slowly headed towards home. Within this book there is a hidden meaning behind the actions of Santiago but the way it was expressed made the book boring.In Hemingway&#65533;s writing he uses simple words that have a lot of meaning. For example,&#65533; &#65533; behaviour&#65533;&#65533; is what Santiago teaches to Manolin. These words are used throughout the book, which make it very boring, and very confusing. If the words were more intriguing, then the reader would be more interested in the book. For instance, &#65533;congregated&#65533;. The typical reader for this book isn&#65533;t going to know what congregated means. I think that if you&#65533;re unable to understand the words in the text then you won&#65533;t be able to understand the moral of the story either. All this put together really made the book hard to comprehend.In the end of it all, with given evidence, it was proved that this book has no true connection and feeling with the reader because of lack of comprehension. This book would have been much greater if the words were more exciting and more about Santiago&#65533;s and Manolin&#65533;s life, instead of with his luck throughout more than three-fourths of the book."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and SymbolismErnest Hemingway wrote The Old Man and the Sea and because one of the greatest writers of his time, because of his ability to appeal to the greater minds of America. For this book he won the Pulitzer Prize in 1953 and the Nobel Peace Prize in 1954. Most people know how great the book is, but only because of his awards for it. The book left some readers confused, because you have to understand the knowledge of great writing to know how great the book is.Hemingway is a brilliant writer, but the writings of The Old Man and The Sea are not for everyone. First of all, the average attention span of a person is 30 seconds. Some found The Old Man and the Sea to be too slow and drawn out to read. But as with most classic books, the more you read on, the more entranced you become. Secondly, Hemingway doesn't use much, if any clutter in The Old Man and The Sea. Simplicity is the key, clutter is useless jargon and it has no purpose but to make the writer look smart. Thankfully Hemingway knew the basics of good writing and ends up making it simple enough for everyone to read. Probably the most complicated word in the book is \`phosphoresant' (47) and given the context clues even complex sounding words are understandable. In the word choice sense, the book can be for everyone, because it's easy to read, but the content of the book is not something that appeals to everyone.The book had an unusual choice of main character resolution, and way of symbolism. For example, Santiago himself says, \\"I am a strange old man...\\" (14) Santiago may seem to have more faults that qualities, but it is the endearing quality of his persistence that makes the reader so intrigued by him. Santiago is stubborn and foolish, but like everyone all he wants in life is to be happy. Also in the end, Santiago dreams of lions and places he had once been, symbolizing dreams he still has for himself. The resolution for Santiago is out of the ordinary for a book of that time, because people were still rebuilding form the depression of the 1930s. Most books of that time were to make the reader forget about their own real life troubles. An uncommon ending gives the story what it needs to symbolize life and be realistic at the same time.The greater the age among readers, the higher percentage of people you will find that enjoyed The Old Man and The Sea. This is because, with growing age, comes a growing sense of reality, and how life around us really is. The book leaves the reader wondering about what happened in the rest of Santiago's life. It leaves the reader wondering if that if Hemingway hadn't died, maybe he would have one day written a sequel. Like this book, life is better left unfinished at the end of the chapter. Hemingway didn't write a fairy tale, he wrote something that people can relate to, and that's what makes him a great writer."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea is not a good book. As an interested reader, I came to this book with an open mind and high hopes. But what I got from it was a meaningless lecture on the basic plot of the story.Although Earnest Hemmingway is a brilliant man, this particular story is dull and unimaginative. While reading this book, I often found myself wandering from Hemmingway's words. His tale lacks the adventuresome qualities that usually spark my interest, and shows little enthusiasm in his writing. He relates the entire story to his own experiences, therefore the reader feels lost in his reflection of his life. In fact, Hemmingway's inspiration to this story was that he lived in Key West and was a humble fisherman, much like Santiago. Most readers can relate in no way to his idea of a good story. Especially when they don't know the terms of fishing, which Hemmingway so repetitively uses. I would have enjoyed the book more if I had shared the same interests and experiences as Earnest Hemmingway. My opinion on the book is simply based on my lack of interest, knowledge and experience with this topic.I would not recommend this book to readers my age or younger. Though the book contains a somewhat interesting plot, Hemmingway's style does not serve the topic well. His paragraphs seem to repeat themselves constantly, and the seemingly endless story unfolds slower than glue. He drains the energy from every sentence. This type of book probably appeals to older or more patient people. Hemmingway's writing is brief, factual and organized. He eliminates all clutter, including his imagination. By doing this, the reader becomes bored and uninterested. As a result, the book is not recommended by other readers, so no one reads it anymore.Though he is an honorable writer, Earnest Hemmingway's The Old Man and the Sea is hardly an honorable accomplishment."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"FishingSpending four days at sea can be very boring; reading about it can be even worse. When I read The Old Man and the Sea I wasn't just completely bored I was also very confused and the story was unclear. The book The Old Man and the Sea is about an old man Santiago who is out at sea to catch a big fish. He hasn't caught a single fish in 84 days and he thinks today is the day. The young boy Manolin is Santiago's friend who he has known since he was five. They use to fish together but Manolin's parents said he had to go to a lucky boat. As the story gets going Santiago hooks a fish and struggles to keep it. Finally the fish jumps and he kills it. The plot was all right but it just didn't keep your interest.Fishing, fishing, and more fishing, that is all The Old Man and the Sea is about. It doesn't keep your interest at all. For example, it rambles on and on about nothing when Santiago is talking. If the story didn't ramble on about a couple things the book would be more interesting and easier to read. It seems like Ernest Hemingway didn't have anything else to say when he keeps rambling on! Besides, the story is to slow to make you want to read more. The main point of writing a book is to make people want to read it. Well, this book does none of that. Not only do you not want to finish The Old Man and the Sea you want to throw it away while you're at it. When the reader is finished with this book they will ask themselves one question, why did I read this book? If the book isn't interesting there is no need to read it.The worst parts of The Old Man and the Sea are the beginning and the end. For instance, the reader doesn't get any information about Santiago except he is old, poor, and friends with a young boy Manolin. If the reader knew how he became poor or how he became friends with Manolin the story may make more sense. Not knowing about the beginning of Santiago's fishing makes you wonder how he even became a fisherman. In addition, the ending makes you wonder even more than the beginning does. The ending just stops, you have a little bit of an ending but you don't know what else happens. It just leaves you clueless, you don't know what happens. In the book The Old Man and the Sea the two most important parts are missing, the beginning and the end.The Old Man and the Sea is very confusing, unclear, and boring. It isn't interesting and the beginning and end are practically missing. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone who hates fishing or anyone who gets confused very easily because that is exactly what The Old Man and the Sea is about."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"My Old Man and the Sea ReviewI have read a lot of books over my many years on this earth, ranging from See Spot run to Hemingway's book The Old Man and the Sea. Hemingway has been said to be one the greatest American writers of his time. I don't agree with this statement because I found parts of his book could have been simplified and excitement should have been added.I found the book The Old man and The Sea to be very dull. It lacked excitement and suspense that would make a teenager reader enjoy the book. The excitement level stayed low though out the whole book. It was quite light and any moment how the sun would rise (pg 32.) Many times I found myself falling asleep. This is just one boring quote out of a whole book of them.\\" The boy carried the hot can of coffee up to the old man's shack and sat by him until he woke (pg 123.)\\" This sentence isn't interesting. I have a hard time finding the point all in all I would say Ernest Hemingway didn't make this book very exciting.Excitement is a lot easier to get across to a reader when you simplify your sentences. Simplifying is a big part of a book, shorter in some cases is better. \\"The myriad flecks of the plankton were annulled now by the high sun and it was only the great deep prisms in the blue water that the old man saw now with line going straight down into the water that was a mile deep (pg40.)\\" I found this quote to be extremely too long to keep my attention. It needs to be simplified. \\"He had rigged his harpoon long before and it coil of light rope was in a found basket and the end was made fast to the bit in the bow (pg87.)\\" Looking at this sentence and seeing how the words where placed, my attention starts to dwindle. Many sentences like this one make the reader tied. I think this story could have been shortened and more attraction packed.As a result I have found Hemingway's book The Old Man and The Sea to not be a book I want to remember nor recommend to anyone to read under the age of 50. Many times in while reading this book I believe that it was a last desperate attempt to produce a final best seller. He may have sold a lot of books in the time that this book was released but I think now being the twenty-first century his book would flopped."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Have you ever caught an eighteen foot fish, that weighs over three-quarters of a ton? Well, an elderly man named Santiago does in this book, The Old Man and The Sea. One morning, he wakes up and goes fishing. He thinks he's going out to catch small minnows for bait. Boy, was he wrong!This book is a very well written piece. There is so much mening and emotion in such a short amount of pages. There is only 127pages! This book doesnt take long to read, but when you're through, you feel a deep sense of sorrow for the old man.The Old Man and The Sea has lots of information on fishing.(obviously)And strangely enough, it also has a little bit about baseball. From the dialogue in the book, one would probably think it \\"occured\\" sometime around the beginning of the twentieth cetury, in Cuba.This novel would be best read if the audience was a young adult, that likes interesting stories about pretty much anything,and is looking for an adventure.Ernest Hemmingway,the author of this wonderful story did a very good job on this book."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"A True Classic. I have read this book many times and each time I get the same feeling of being there. Great descriptions and most of all great story."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I am no fan of The Old Man and the Sea, but it's worth publicising more widely the little-known story of its genesis. The Old Man and the Sea was actually an allegory of Hemingway's doomed attempts at wooing Norma Jean Baker (Marilyn = marlin: geddit?). He saw himself as the &quot;evolved&quot; being of man against the &quot;shark&quot; of his contemporary Arthur Miller who nipped and nipped and was the ultimate victor of her affections."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Santiago, an old Cuban fisherman, has the battle of his life with a ferocious marlin in the book, The Old Man and the Sea. He is a very poor man and is very unlucky with fishing but with the help of the little boy, Manolin, he gets through the days of his life. Santiago's adventure with the giant fish begins eighty five days after his last catch. The Old Man and the Sea is an appealing and an enjoyable book because Ernest Hemingway is an excellent writer.The events and actions of this book create interest for the readers. For example, Santiago was not angry with the other fishermen when they made fun of him. He is a good man and is so wise that being made fun of does not bother him. A good protagonist is always a good character to read about. Moreover, the characters and their actions can be related to real life situations. For instance, the old man ignores all the laughing made by the younger fishermen because he cannot catch any fish. This is like a student dealing with bullies and humiliation at school. These are some points that Ernest Hemingway made to arouse interest to readers.Hemingway has a very unique writing style. For example, in the book it says, \\"Most of the boats were silent except for the dip of the oars.\\" He has a very soothing way of writing. This is also easy enough for kids to understand. Also, Hemingway does not use clutter in his sentences which makes him different from the rest. For instance, he writes sentences like, \\"Only I have no luck anymore;\\" which is very direct. Many writers tend to use clutter to sound professional or important. Hemingway's style and voice is calming and intense in all the right places.I think The Old Man and the Sea is a great book to read. My favorite part of the book was the climax when Santiago defeats the antagonist. If I could change something in this book, I would change some of the rising action so it is more gripping. I would recommend this book to adults and teenagers. Although a grade school student could read and understand this book, they would not value the moral of the story. Hemingway's original style and the characters in this book make it an interesting and wonderful book to read."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Review is on the manufacturing of the book, not on the content - one of Hemingway's classics.

Do yourself a favor and get a version that has the author's name spelled right on the cover. It's Ernest Hemingway. Ernest Hemingway. Ernest Hemingway.This book is a classic."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Well, I have never read a book by Hemingway before, although I have heard quite a lot about him, so I wasn't sure what to expect. What I ended up with was a pretty obvious and boring story about, (big surprise) and old man and the sea.A fisherman named Santiago (though his name is mentioned only about 3 times) has had 84 days of bad luck. He hasn't caught anything and the boy who helps him has had to leave because he needed a more profitable job. So Santiago decides to fish out deeper than he usually does. He hooks a really big fish, which begins pulling him out to sea.It keeps pulling him for 2 days before they finally battle it out, and Santiago kills the fish. He manages to lash it to his little boat and begins rowing for shore. However, before he gets very far, sharks start coming to feed on the carcass of the fish. Santiago fights them off for a while, but eventually nothing is left of the fish but a skeleton. He makes it back to land in the middle of the night and crawls home to bed, bruised, battered and defeated. The next day the boy takes care of him and the rest of the town marvels at the gigantic skeleton. At the end, nothing really changed.So the story (and this is a 117 page book) has very little to it. I didn't like the writing at all. It was too spare, it reminded me of the fish's skeleton AFTER the sharks ate it! Instead of describing stuff, he'd just state it blankly and without any emotion or eloquence. Instead of describing how or why the boy loved the man, he just says \\" The boy loved the old man.\\" How interesting is that? This was a short and easy read, but it totally bored me. It was a struggle to finish it.I think he was trying to prove a point about how desperate and determined the old man was, and how even though he succeeded, it all came to nothing. Three days later, after his big adventure, nothing had changed at all. However, this book didn't reach me at all. Too bad, I had hoped I would enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Old Man and The Sea Book ReviewThe book, Old Man and The Sea, is about a fisherman named Santiago, Who hasn't caught a fish in eighty-five days. When he comes upon the biggest marlin he has ever faced. Who will pull who in? Hemingway's book is good, but it is repetitive with boring topics, and needs to summarize. As a result it made the book slow moving.Hemingway's way of writing slowed the book's movement down. For example, Hemmingway goes on about topics that don't entice the reader. Using topics that bore the reader doesn't move the story along, does it? Topics are important to readers and using boring and unwanted topics push readers away. In addition, the way Hemingway wrote of people talking, \\"the old man said\\", is to repetitive and thus slowing the story down. \\"The old man said\\" is ok if the writer uses other more descriptive words for the character's dialogue. Repetitiveness and boring topics are only half of what makes the story slow moving.Hemingway spends too much time on topics that don't concern the story. For example, Hemingway spends takes forty-five pages on Santiago catching the same fish. There is no need to use forty-five pages to catch one fish. Who needs to know all the little details of what goes on in Santiago's head? In addition, he also took eight pages for Santiago to climb up to his shack, fall asleep, and then Mandolin to get him coffee. I could write that in at the most four pages, and deliver the same information. Eight pages are too much for what had happened. Summarizing is something Hemingway needs to learn.Hemingway's book is good, don't get me wrong, but it is too slow. He takes too long to write something so simple. From what I read of Santiago, he needs to see a shrink (Santiago). Hemingway is a good writer, but still needs some work."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Molly JonesEnglish, DelgadoMarch 11,2002The Old Man and the SeaThe Old man and the Sea was a very adventurous and exciting novel. It won the Pulitzer Prize in 1953 and also the Noble Prize in literature in 1954. I'd say that this is Ernest Hemingway's greatest novel yet. There are also many amazing features that await hungry readers. Hemingway's style for The Old Man and the Sea has very desirable qualities.His writing style and choice of words are remarkably incredible. For example, \\"He had come from the deep down in the water as the dark cloud of blood had settled and dispersed in the mile deep sea\\" (100). I have never read something so edging in my life. His choice of words and sentence style is so amazingly unspeakable. For instance, \\"The flow was less strong and as he rubbed the side of his hand against the planking of the skiff, particles of phosphorous floating off and drifted slowly astern\\" (79).This describes exactly what is happening and he uses specific words to explain it more. Some authors say the same words redundantly which leaves the reader bored and miserable, but not Hemingway. Hemingway's style in unforgettable and exciting with loads of detail and well fitted word choices.With some of the characters they are either alike or different (which makes it rather intriguing). For example, \\"The old man was thin and gaunt with deep wrinkles in the back of his neck\\" (9). His description for the characters is breathless. He makes sure that everyone knows exactly what they look like and how they act. For instance, \\"It racked back and as the fish swam just below the surface the old man could see his huge bulk and purple stripes that banded him\\" (90). This describes what he saw as the fish swam below the surface of the water. It gives an incredible amount of detail with his own touches of vision. No one has ever described characters like Ernest Hemingway, it's like he knows everything about them, like he already knew them in life.Ernest Hemingway is very talented in writing action packed novels. His word choices are extremely well thought out which makes it very interesting. I know that I have enjoyed reading The Old Man and the Sea and hope to read more of his novels before my life reaches an end."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I hated the book &quot;The Old Man and the Sea.&quot; It was about the way old fishermen used to fish marlin and it tells of an old fisherman that hooks a huge one and is pulled out to sea by it after it gives up he brings it in with sharks eating it as he goes.

Many reknown Literary Critics have suggested that this was a metaphor for Hemingway's own battle with Depression and Alcoholism.

Sadly Hemingway shot almost every living animal on this planet until the only thing left to shoot was himself.

In \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\", the main character Santiago learns this lesson the hard way. With the odds stacked against him Santiago overcomes a lack of proper equipment, health issues, and being attacked by sharks. One can find many life lessons in Santiago's story beyond its relevancy to fishing. Well-crafted works of literature like this can shape our world view and cause us to reflect on how themes of the story can be found in our own lives. Well-developed characters, dramatic and/or entertaining stories, and a sense of purpose which cause us to reflect on our own lives are what make works of literature like \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" great.At first glance, \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" appears to be quite simply a story of one man's battle to catch the fish of a lifetime, yet in further analysis more can be found within the symbolism used in this tale. In the story, the old man Santiago has gone 84 days of fishing without catching a single fish. On the 85th day he catches what could be the biggest fish ever pulled out of the sea in the area near his home. In this example, Hemingway is showing us the value of staying the course regardless of history. This is but one example of the symbolism used here, many more lessons like this can be found within the text.The old man is an interesting character to follow because he possesses many unique qualities that readers will find likable. Down on his luck and then being outmatched by both the fish he caught and the sharks out to steal it away from him, Santiago becomes an underdog fighting to save his fish and maintain his livelihood. The drama of the situation before him and the quality of his character makes Santiago easy to root for because this underdog story has universal appeal. At some point, most of us have fought for our own livelihoods in our lives and we can see a little of ourselves in Santiago.Appealing characters not only work great for literature, they also work extremely well in real life stories we hear from people around us. Some of the best teaching and coaching is done in the form of stories of individuals facing challenging situations. These stories teach the principles of how to overcome adversity and the importance of rising to the occasion in order to come out on top. Stories also teach us how to avoid mistakes that others have made. Many times a good teacher or coach will share stories not just of triumph but also of tragedy, hoping the listener will learn valuable lessons on what situations or actions they should avoid in the future. Great story tellers find a way to intertwine both the triumphant and the tragic. This will provide balance plus make the story more believable and entertaining. In \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\", Hemingway does this skillfully as Santiago triumphs over the marlin only to lose it tragically to the sharks when returning it to his village.The beauty in literature, just as it is also true in works of art, lies within the eye of the beholder. Some people will not find Hemingway's novel as fascinating as others. A reason why this is an important point to make for this essay comes from the knowledge that not everyone will agree on a story's interpretation. Thus knowing how to reach a wide audience and gain universal appeal is one of the most defining qualities of a great author or story teller. People come from a wide range of backgrounds and levels of experience, meaning one must find a way to connect with a diverse group by finding themes which touch basic emotional responses. Hemingway's story \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" succeeds in doing this because it gives the reader a lesson on the struggles of life and trying to survive even when the odds are stacked against us.In \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\", Santiago's battle with the fish becomes symbolic of the battle man faces in his fight for survival. One defining element of this story is whether Santiago should let the fish go in order to save his own life. Not only is Santiago underprepared for the size of the fish he catches, he is out of water, food, and it is questionable if he possesses the endurance needed to outmuscle the fish long enough to get him to the surface, let alone pull it into his boat once it has been caught. Yet throughout the story we see how Santiago does not give up and let the fish go and the longer he fights the fish the more invested he becomes in accomplishing this task making his determination to kill the fish that much more meaningful to him.While there are certainly dozens of individual lessons one can derive from Santiago's story, the most valuable lessons appear to be:-Never give up hope that good things will happen simply because nothing has happened yet. Santiago knows there are fish in the waters he fishes in. He goes 84 days without catching a fish, yet on the 85th day he landed the biggest fish anyone in the village has ever caught showing that great things are rarely accomplished without dedication.-Do not plan what to do with a reward until the job is fully completed. When Santiago catches the marlin, he begins to plan how he will spend the money he makes from selling the fish on the market. It is at this point in the story when sharks begin to circle his boat and eventually take the fish from him piece by piece. The lesson here is that Santiago could have brought his fish ashore had he focused his attention on finishing the task at hand rather than deciding how to spend his money.-Enjoy successes in life even if they are taken from you or lost. Regardless of the fact that Santiago's dream of bringing his prized fish ashore is taken from him he does not let his loss defeat him, rather he find energy from it. In the closing paragraph of the story, Santiago finds himself once again dreaming about lions. The lion dream is symbolic for Santiago of past times, more youthful times where he was full of vibrant energy.While the aforementioned ideas certainly are valuable lessons, Hemingway's main purpose in writing this story was to inspire the reader to see that regardless of the situation one has the ability to overcome insurmountable odds with the right attitude. By failing to cave into the negative self-talk that often accompanies dire situations, individuals can find hidden strength within themselves to persevere through almost anything, even circling sharks, health issues, or a lack of proper equipment. While it is true that we often face our greatest challenges when we are least prepared and at our weakest yet Hemingway says that with the right attitude, anything is possible."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I was very interested in, what on the surface sounds like a plain story, that I finished it in one day. Typically I am a slow reader, so finishing anything in one day is rare for me.I liked the clear and concise details and descriptions. Just enough to let the reader imagine the scene without belaboring the story.The story itself had me wondering what would come next for Santiago and how he would handle it."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"How dare I? How dare I criticize one of the greatest works by the Nobel laureate, Hemingway, a literary giant of the last century? How dare I criticize a great American writer who showed that the U.S.of A is more than than a land of gun-toting, tobacco chewing, spitting cowpokes? How? Because Hemingway himself would expect me to do so. If The Old and the Sea has something to teach us, then as every great teacher knows, it is to teach the next generation to be better writers.Hemingway's sentences are often long, convoluted and confusing. Take one at random \\"Each line, as thick around as a big pencil; was looped onto a green-sapped stick so that any pull or touch on the bait would make the stick dip and each line had two forty-fathom coils which could be made fast to the other spare coils so that, if it were necessary, a fish could take out over a hundred fathoms of line.\\" Take a breath.First this is 'telling', it is not 'showing'. Maybe 50 years ago readers were content to be told, but they no longer are. Second it has words that are as sin in contemporary writing - 'was'. Third it has redundancies that add nothing to the story ', if it was necessary,' These errors detract from the story. The greatest writing error is such complex sentences shove too much information into the reader's mind in one breath. The reader is forced to read again, to check he has understood. Good writing should slip effortlessly into the readers mind creating scenes, characters and emotions, like a good wine intoxicates. Writing is not to be read , it is to be seen and felt.We all know readers will forgive all manner of errors for a gripping story. Hemingway's writing is powerful. He engages the reader's empathy for the protagonist and skillfuly plots, building the pace up and down like the waves of the setting. These are the true story telling skills but Hemingway uses them to excess. Long before the story turns the corner, the ending is predictable.For the literati, The Old Man and the Sea is a classic retelling of courage in the face of defeat, of personal triumph snatched from the jaws of loss. But lets be candid. We can imagine Hemingway sitting in at a bar in his tropical escape, gradually getting bored by visiting tourists' stories of the fish, this big, that got away. So he told the most incredible story of the biggest one to get away, a story to end all such fishing exaggerations.Let's not be distracted by Hemingway's failure to edit, his failure to recognize darlings and kill them. Let's pay homage to one of the greatest writers and personalities of his time. Let's pay homage as Hemingway would have wanted, by emulating his skills and learning not to repeat his failings."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This is an amazing (and short) novel, written by one of America's greatest authors. Recieving the Pulitzer prize, The Old Man and The Sea is similar in theme to some of Hemmingway's other well known novels (The Sun Also Rises, A Farewell to Arms) and as such will probably leave you in a morose, contemplative moodDescribing the relationship between an old man and a young boy, both of them fishers, the story takes place over a couple of days, describing a harrowing fishing adventure by the old man in his small skiff. After 84 days of not catching a single fish, Santiago sets out, alone, once more to do what he was born to do - fish. What's left to describe of the story is better done by Hemingway, and at under 100 pages the novella is accesible to almost anyone, at least on some level.Short and terse, Hemingway's style is in full swing - writing only the so called \\"tip of the iceberg\\" it is many times what Hemingway understates or doesn't say at all that is most moving and important. Dealing with issues common to the 'lost generation' Hemingway considers a the role of man in relation to nature, presenting a very different yet relatable understanding to previous generations of American writers. Human accomplishment, missfortune, and aging are all dealt with in this deeply critical novel. Indeed, one could even imagine the themes and ideas represented in this work to be as the Marlin, swimming, powerfully under the surface of the endless ocean.The publication (for the Kindle) is acceptable, but interspersed are several poorly done, and hardly acceptably drawings. These interrupt a serious and engaging text, are little more than childish illustrations and - because of the Kindle display - they interrupt the text, offsetting it with their poorly recognizable 4 gray tone lines and coloring. I'd recommend getting a paperback version, or simply being prepared to skip over these. (This is the reason for the four star rating of an otherwise 5 star novel)"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This book sums up the neverending challenge and struggle of the human condition in less pages than any other book. It may seem trite to read this beyond high school English but it has more impact as life progresses."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This is my first Hemingway story, and was pretty pleased with it. I have always been told that his writing gets right to the point and that he's not a \\"flowery\\" writer, so I wasn't surprised to see how long this story was. On the surface, the story was very exciting, even more so at the end when he battles the sharks. As I was reading it, I would get so excited whenever he ran across another shark I didn't even want to read those parts. I was really rooting for Santiago, and felt totally gypped at the end! In terms of reading the story for just \\"more\\" than the story, I found that the themes are very easy to identify and talk about so that would make this a great \\"discussion\\" novella, and it's no surprise that this is a frequently read book in school. This is an excellent starter book for those who are interested in reading a story for more than face value. It's not too long and it's themes and symbolism aren't too vague to understand."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Ernest Hemingway one of the best authors of all time wrote many great classics. The old man and the sea may go down as his best. He was able to portray so many symbols in this story. For example the old man, Santiago was like Christ and his disciple was the little boy. Another symbol is the old man always dreamt about lions in on the coast of Africa, I think this resembled his strength when he was young and able to handle large jobs. The final symbol is the old man and the boy cared about nature. When the marlin was being attacked by the sharks, Santiago kept on apologizing to the fish for going to far out.Some people may not like the book because it is mainly an old man in his boat out at sea battling with a marlin.I really enjoyed this book and I fell that alot of other people would enjoy this book also. This book was so great it won Mr. Hemingway a Pulitzer Prize."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea is one of the worst books I have ever been required to read. The first chapter put me to sleep. I found the fishing examples and language hard to follow since I have no interest in fish. The one thing that I found interesting about the book is the way Ernest Hemmingway wrote it as a reflection of his life. Hemmingway, like the old man, had not had much success for a while in his career. The entire story is left free to interpret it how you wish. Fatalism takes place when the shark eats the fish, Endurance takes place when on page 64 it says &quot;He was comfortable but not suffering, although he did not admit the suffering at all.&quot; This book is considered to be one of Hemmingway's greatest books. With this stated I might venture to read one of his books again but not for a while. I think that this book would be far more appreciated by someone who is into deep thinking. Myself...I like the point of the story cleary stated."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I've read just about everything by Hemingway I think, but never this one. I believe in the back of my mind I was saving it; keeping it in reserve, so to speak, so that there would always be something to look forward to.But I finally picked it up. I can't even begin to tell you how disappointed I was when I saw the size of the type, which is huge--like a child's book--and realized the book was only 140 pages long. I read ten pages and almost didn't pick it up again.But I did and I'm glad I did because this is really a terrific book. The plot is pretty simple: it's the story of an old Cuban fisherman who hasn't had any luck in 84 days, and finally, on the 85th, experiences the catch of his life. It is typical Hemingway: the taut prose style, thorough understanding of human emotions, plot tension, and superior knowledge of his subject matter are all here.Thematically it is also superb. The struggle of man against nature, the need we have for one another, the sad decline of all of us as we age, and our eternal hope that tomorrow will be better, no matter how awful today is, are just a few of those represented. I thought the Christ symbolism near the end was layed on a little heavy, but this is only a minor complaint. This is an excellent, moving novel.But it is simple, and Hemingway was clearly past his prime. It is remarkable that just a little more than ten years after writing the unbelievably complex For Whom the Bell Tolls, he was reduced to this. But, a good book nevertheless. Read it to your kids."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"What do Saddam Hussein and the American reading public of the 1950s have in common? They both loved this book. Its easy to see how Saddam saw his own predicament in this sentimental story of an old fisherman landing and losing a legendary fish. Hemingway was not, unfortunately, a good novelist. Hemingway's best short stories are some of the finest in the English language but he doesn't seem to have been able to sustain character and plot development sufficiently to produce really good novels. Even this short novel displays Hemingway's weaknesses as a novelist. Even worse, it is sentimental beyond belief, without any of the clear-eyed irony or insight into human nature exhibited in the best short stories. This is a weeper for middle-aged men. See any of the great Nick Adams stories for comparison. While this book appears to have revived Hemingway's career, at least in terms of popular readership, it really shows the decline of Hemingway's powers."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This is one of the most boring books I've ever read. I had to read this back in high school. In that time I struggled with reading it because it was so boring it took me almost a month to finish it. The only exciting thing in the whole book was when the sharks appeared. I cared so little for all the characters especially the old man I hoped they were going to eat the old man. But nope they ate his stupid marlin instead. When the reader is hoping for the \\"hero\\" to die your book sucks."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I was looking forward to read this acclaimed book but in honesty, was just disappointed by it. Not that the writing style isn't good, not that the story isn't interesting. Yes, as many critics say, the book touches on many topics of human personalities, flaws and qualities. But when they say \\"touch on\\", that's really all it is. If you are looking for insights, for inspiration in any of these topics, I think you are better off reading Herman Hesse. So much that it's clear to me that the level of awareness that Hemingway had was quite lower than that of Hesse. Where Hemingway saw that there was more to man than his action and thoughts, Hesse saw emotions, yearning and melancholy.Perhaps 50 years ago, with the level of consciousness society had, this was a good novel. But today, the main value of this book is the details of fishing at the time."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This was the book that changed my life. I read it as a young child over and over. I then put it down and later read it as a young adult. Hemmingway inspired me to become the Author I am today.

I have noticed the same styles in my new book &quot;Sunset Point.&quot; (www.lathamdoxey.com) I recommend this book to every author out there who wants to be motivated. It sure helped me!!"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"For many, the thought of Ernest Hemmingway brings to mind a great author and a great read. For me, it is another story. I find his writing extremely boring and predictable. To think that this book, The Old Man and the Sea won the Pulitzer Prize makes the thought of writing a great read very simple. The Old Man and the Sea, by Ernest Hemmingway is a very bland and boring read without enough excitement to keep the reader captivated.The plot of the story begins with persistence and results in defeat. For example, Santiago is an old man, yet a very persistent one staying out at sea for over eighty-five days without the luck of catching a fish. From this, Santiago learns that only sometimes does persistence pay off. Going out to sea everyday with the hope of being lucky, I think Santiago deserves to catch an award winning fish. Furthermore, this man vs. fate conflict arises when Santiago goes out to sea to catch another fish. Excited by his success, he heads home reaching the only thing that unknowingly stands in his way-fate. Fate is very different for everyone, but cruel to Santiago. He must feel that his luck came back to haunt him as fate begins to set in. While Santiago tries so hard to accomplish his goal, he loses control of the fate that he regretfully must overcome.Santiago is very persistent and I can relate in many ways, but I still see the book as a lack of originality in a short story. For instance, Santiago works so hard for those eighty-five days to catch a fish and never gives up, but is still let down. I have been in many situations where there was a need for persistence and I know how he felt when he was let down. Many people of every day life need persistence when competing against another as Santiago was with fate. Furthermore, this book is simple and without detail. The repetition left me bored and I did not want to turn the page because I knew it was only going to get worse. Toward the end of the book, I felt it was too predictable and I felt there was no need to read the ending; for I already knew what would happen. Being able to relate somewhat to parts of the story made it better, yet it still lacked the complex plot and intense detail that I would have expected, knowing that it won the Pulitzer Prize.As Ernest Hemmingway's short story, The Old Man and the Sea leaves others excited and completely captivated, I sat there and as I turned the last page, I closed the book with enthusiasm; not the enthusiasm one would think when finished with a book. I was extremely relieved that at last, the end was here. I already knew how it would end and felt it was incredibly boring for a writer who has given himself such a great name. I would definitely not recommend this book to any readers who needs detail and enthusiasm to turn the page."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I read the book The Old Man And The Sea by Ernest Hemingway. The main character is an old man named Santiago. He is from a Cuban village where fishing is life. He didn't catch a fish for 84 days. The man is very old and not respected. A good thing the author did was to give a hopeful ending. With all the bad luck Santiago is having something good has to come out. The problem is the man catches no fish. This means he gets no money and the people in the village find him to be a waste. The kind of people that would like this book is middle aged people. The book tells of a bond between a boy and an old man who is struggling to prove his worth anymore. The authors style was good. The book had a good lead up and was well detailed. I liked the book because it showed there was hope. The old man goes out on a 3 day fishing voyage to prove he is not bad luck. Will he come out succesful or return a useless old man?

This novel is a brilliant story about a man's personal victory. It is also an ingeniously analogous to Jesus Christ's struggle. The only reason I gave it four stars is because I got bored the second time I read it. Did you kids even pay attention in your english classes?"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea is a great easy reading book for children and adults. The author uses small and understandable words to help the reader read smoother. By doing so, it makes the story more interesting when the reader doesn't have to trouble themselves with confusing words. The author creates Santiago's character through his dialogue by using Spanish words and that he talks to himself and the animals. Though the author uses Spanish words he explains them immediately after their use. This makes this a good book in my opinion.The word choice of the author definitely increased the quality of this book. The Old Man and the Sea is a great book for the young and old readers. This is because of the authors style. Hemmingway makes the book very understandable and fun to read. The book had a good plot but being able to follow along and not get lost really helps the novel. I recommend this book to almost all ages (if you can read of course).This book is also enhanced by the authors' method of describing the story through the character. Santiago talks to himself in the story and because he does this Hemmingway uses him to describe events in the story as it happens. Santiago is also described with the character through his speech. The author uses Spanish words to show his nationality, which helps you under stand him. Though he uses Spanish words, they are immediately explained after their use. These elements put together made this story much better.The Old Man and the Sea was a great book for almost all ages. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who likes to read."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the SeaThe Old Man and the Sea is a great example of Ernest Hemmingway's writing. It was a great and interesting book. I liked the book The Old Man and the Sea.I thought this book was a good book. For example it had good description and sentence fluency. With the good description and sentence fluency, it made it so that the book was not boring. An example of this is \\"it is a strong full-blooded fish.\\" It had good description. Also, this was not a boring book. It was interesting and it kept my attention throughout the entire book. \\"If sharks come God pity him and me.\\" This is a great example from the book that kept my interest, and was exciting. Over all, this book was a good book that kept my attention and was not too boring.I would recommend this book to other people. For instance it is pretty easy reading. An example from the book is \\"He settled comfortably against the wood and took his suffering as it came.\\" The words are easy to understand and they are not too sophisticated. This makes it easy for the littler kids, who are into reading, to understand what Hemmingway is talking about when he uses the types of words he uses in his style of writing. Also people will probably have had to read Hemmingway's books to understand his style, because his style also confused me. Some of the wording is strange. I didn't even understand it. His word choice was also pretty strange. He used words like que&igrave; va and agua mala. Overall, I think people of all ages might enjoy reading this book.I think this is a good book for people of all ages. I do recommend the book The Old Man and the Sea to people who like books that go into a lot of detail and who like short novels. Even if people haven't read his other writing they will like this book."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and The SeaThe Old Man and The Sea was a great time altering novel by Ernest Hemingway. A story by an old, depressed mad man not afraid to speak his mind, he caught not only the attention of the young adult, but this book could also be read to little children with the exception of censorship. This is obviously one of the greatest books of our generation and others to come.Santiago (the old man) was a great Spanish fisherman striving on catching fish for money. His main goal in life is to be able to catch the one fish that will get him his riches. The old man was 84 years old without a fish. Although everyone in town mocked him and his ability to catch fish, he pursued his dream and kept trying. And he knew that one day he would in fact prove them wrong, with the help of a young boy he knew so well. The young boy is the one person with the most integrity to help out this mocked old man. He was a very brave young boy. Hemmingway made a smart choice in putting such bravery into this story of self-victory.Without the young boy, Manolin, the one person in the world who cared, the old man felt lost. The boy helped Santiago in believing in himself, and gave him the majority of self confidence he could possibly hold. The old man truly needed that young boy. He was the link to all his striving. The boy and Santiago were most inseparable, when Santiago caught even the littlest fish; the boy was there to cheer him on. The boy is a smart character because of his sense to not follow everyone in copping fun at the old man. This makes the story so much more intriguing to have a friend for the old man so that he can laugh and have fun too. This shows how even such a serious writer like Hemmingway, can, to, put a little bit of fun hidden within his writing.This story was not only one of the most easy to follow novels, but also it was fun to read and it intrigues every man, women and child with the reading ability. It was also intelligent enough for the normal person to read, not just the higher class people. This story of and old man and his dream of fishing is a true classic. A person wouldn't think to look at it or just read a page, but to know so many people liked it; there can't be a single person with simple intelligence who doesn't like this book. It would be smart to give it a chance and just try to read such a life changing story."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Original...Simple...Gripping. The Old Man and the Sea is an example of classic American Literature that is all this and more. It reflects on Hemingway's past fishing experiences and has deep inner meanings. His style makes the reader feel as if they are actually struggling with Santiago on a skiff off the coast of Cuba. The Old Man and the Sea is a heart-wrenching tale that is worth reading.The Old Man and the Sea is a novel that people of all ages can enjoy. The reading level is simple, but that gets the point across. For example \\"\`It is not bad,' he said.\\" (84). Instead of cluttering up this simple sentence, Hemingway used four simple, but concise words to get the point across. It would have been unnecessary to use the thesaurus to replace these mono-syllable words with more complicated ones. Everyone has obstacles to overcome in their life. \\"You're feeling it now, fish,\\" and he said, \\"and so, God knows, am I.\\" (56). Everyone can relate to what Santiago is feeling, which creates a connection between the reader and the protagonist. The author gains the reader's interest with his simple style and a plot that can be related to.Ernest Hemingway portrays his two main characters brilliantly. For instance, \\"You better be fearless and confident yourself, old man,\\" he said. (84). The character of the Cuban fisherman, Santiago, and the marlin both show personality traits that make them seem real. The reader can almost guess how the old man feels and how he will react. Santiago's story causes many emotions in the reader. In addition to portraying the characters perfectly, he also creates well-founded relationships between them. \\"But perhaps he has been hooked many times before and he knows that this is how he should make his fight, he said.\\" (49). While reading this novel, I particularly enjoyed how the marlin represented the old man. The respect Santiago has for the enormous fish and their similarities doesn't affect his determination in killing it. Both characters are giving all they have, and their age and wisdom prove to be equal. Ernest Hemingway created a masterpiece in is portrayal of both the antagonist and protagonist.It is amazing how a story can capture so many people's attention in only 127 pages. Ernest Hemingway's special style can never be re-created. The unique plot and the secret deep meanings are what make this story great. If I could change one thing about The Old Man and the Sea I wouldn't.

I know that that may now make any sense but I am going to explain how that works. Also I am going to give my thinking on why this book was written, and also, why kind of hidden meaning is in this book.In this book Hemingway talks about a mans life (Santiago). To me this book was boring and dull. But there was also a hidden meaning behind this whole story. Now at first I didn't get why I and to read this story. Then I started to think about what this book could mean or what it could be showing. And then it hit me like a ton of bricks. Not giving up, have faith for what you believe in. That is what the whole book was about. Having the courage to keep going even when it may seem like there no reason to.In Hemingway's book he expresses what he is feeling. When times are sad he writes sad. When Santiago is being stubborn then you can actually feel what Manolin is feeling. Which in my opinion is a awesome way of writing. Because when Hemingway is expressing the way that he feels it is almost like you are feeling the same thing. In the book, Hemingway is explaining what Santiago is feeling in his hands, like how they are cramping up and how they are so raw from holding on to the rope for so long (62). In the book, just the way he explains the feelings of Santiago is amazing. He puts so much feeling into his writing.I must say that in some parts the book seemed to just kind of go on and on and on. But also, when I think about it he can't help it, because he is writing a book about a man's life and he can't help it if the man's life is boring. In my opinion this book is more of a man's book, because it is talking about fishing. Now don't get me wrong I like fishing, but I don't like to read a book about it. This book showed that even if things may get tough you should still try your hardest until the end. Never give up. The book The Old Man and the Sea, was a very inspirational and meaning full book. It showed me that things may get tough, but when they do that's when I should work the hardest."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Old Man and the Sea is a novel about struggles, challenges, friendship and love. Hemmingway invented a new style of writing when he wrote this book, which attracted many different types of audiences. He uses this book to tell what he went through early in life, and how he conquered many difficult challenges. This novel is a classic story of man verses self.Santiago was not having very much luck fishing, but things started to change on the eighty-fourth day of bad luck. He went out expecting another empty day, but when he encounters the catch of is life, things begin to change. Santiago would not have been able to complete his challenge as well as he did with the marlin, had memories and the voice of Manolin not been heard by Santiago. The battle between the Marlin and Santiago is a very long exasperating battle. Ernest Hemmingway uses the battle to symbolizes his own feelings and of his place in life. Santiago and Manolin have an amazing friendship that helps them survive the difficult fisherman life in Cuba. Without their friendship, the battle with the marlin and Santiago may not have lasted as long as it did; because Santiago would have felt as though he has little to fight for. Santiago has little life left in him at his old age, but the things that keep him going are the love and friendship he feels for the boy. Hemmingway uses the characters in this book to express his feelings of life, and how he got through the long struggles, which a lot of authors won't attempt to write.Ernest Hemmingway's novel The Old man and the Sea, is a new way of writing. Hemmingway uses simple words and simple sentences, to make the book easier to read and follow. Making the book easier to read is what attracted so many different types of readers. Even though he uses a strong emotional story he manages to keep the story fun to and easy to read. Hemmingway did something that most writers won't do, which is share his life, feelings and opinions through the book. Using Santiago to represent himself is a brilliant idea. He was able to share his life experiences, with the audience, but still have the book seem fictional, which attracted many different audiences. I believe he won the Pulitzer Prize, for this new technique of writing. This book shows just a little bit of the courage, challenges, love and friendship that he encountered while he was living in Cuba.Hemmingway told of his life through the characters he invented for this novel. The hardships and challenges he faced may seem unreal for a-lot of people. In society today we have so much in life, that a lot of people take it for granted. Read this story to see what it is like to have nothing, but the love and care from one true friend to keep you going. He truly deserves five stars for this unique style of writing, and for his new invention of powerful narration."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea was a boring, but good book. It was boring because the book didn't go into a lot of detail on the action scenes and it was good because it turned out to be a peaceful ending. The author Ernest Hemmingway talked the struggles and unluckiness of Santiago.The creativity of the struggles and unluckiness were blunt. For example Santiago was an old man who fished alone in a skiff in the Gulf Stream, and he had gone 84 straight days without taking a fish. (9) Santiago would be the only person out of the people who went fishing that day who didn't catch a fish. For instance So Santiago didn't have any fishing stories to trade with all the other fisherman and he couldn't trade in the fish to get money. There was no pot of yellow rice and fish and the boy knew this. (16) Santiago was so poor that he did have anything to eat, unless the boy brought him food. Luckily Manoline brought him food everyday and he checked on him to make sure he was doing well. Santiago has found some way and some how to make it through his struggles and unluckiness.I thought this book was boring and good at the same time. For instance the action parts didn't have enough detail and all they other fisherman did was explain boring fisherman stories. Like about them catching a trout or salmon. Poor Santiago couldn't relate to any of their stories because he hasn't caught a fish for a long period of time. The book was good because Hemmingway's writing style was superb. The action scenes weren't really detailed, but a lot of the other scenes were. For example the shark oil was tangy and it flowed warm down my throat on the cold morning. He didn't actually say that, but that's the kind of detail he provides. I think this book should be recommended to everyone who likes fishing stories and who ever think that luck turns out to be a good thing.Santiago is an old man who hasn't caught a fish for 84 straight days. He is the unluckiest fisherman. Ernest Hemmingway's style of writing made the book good, through all the boring parts. The book it self was boring, but his writing style is great. What I think about the book The Old Man and the Sea."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Tami RobinsonPeriod 63-13-02A Very Intriguing StoryWhat happens when Ernest Hemingway, Santiago, a marlin, Manolin, and the ocean are put together? A really great book is created! Ernest Hemingway brings the characters and setting to life. The Old Man and the Sea proves to be a very intriguing story.I was at once thrilled with the character, Santiago, and the conflicts in the story. For instance, this wrinkled, sun-burnt old man passes the time by talking to himself. This is such a typical old man characteristic and it adds a dash of humor to the story. Santiago was not only entertaining but believable. Because of his knowledge of the sea and description of his many scars it was obvious he had been a fisherman for a long time. Also, a huge marlin drags Santiago around for a couple of days and he finds that he has no food on board the skiff. This creates quite a problem for Santiago. He is out in the middle of the sea, miles from shore, and there are not any boats around. But somehow he manages to catch some flying fish, while still holding on, for dear life, to the marlin. All in all, a great book starts with a believable character and a good conflict and Ernest Hemingway delivers.In my opinion, The Old Man and the Sea deserves four stars. The story's strong point is not excitement. For example, it takes Santiago at least fifty pages to catch the marlin. I must admit that while I was reading I was thinking \\"Okay, he needs to catch the fish already.\\" But the story makes up for it in other areas, which I see as more important. However, while the plot lacks in excitement, Ernest Hemingway excels with description. For instance, the description of the marlin when Santiago first sees it is extremely vivid. As I was reading this part the fish was not only jumping out of the water, but also out of the book! I felt as though I was sitting in the skiff alongside Santiago watching the massive fish explode out of the deep blue-green water. In summary, I enjoyed this book very much and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good, easy read full of adventure and beauty.Ernest Hemingway turned a simple story about an unlucky fisherman who hooks \\"the big one\\" into an epic. His description of the sea's beauty and the fish that belong to it can dazzle anybody. This story has a way of making me smile and pity the old man. This story is great for people of all ages! And I guarantee that anyone who reads it will feel challenged, inspired, and enlightened."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Ernest Hemmingway's The Old Man and the Sea is about an old man, Santiago, who wants to catch a huge fish. The young boy, Manolin, wants to go along, but Santiago does not feel that he needs to take him along. The Old Man and the Sea is just another ordinary book.This book is not the most exciting book I have ever read, although it does have its moments when it does get exciting. For instance one of the most exciting parts of the book is when Santiago hooks the fish and the fish turns around and pulls Santiago out to sea. I my opinion this is where most of the action takes place. Santiago starts to have trouble reeling in the marlin and I think this is when he wishes the boy was there to help him. Another exciting part of the book is when Santiago pulls the marlin in and the sharks can smell the blood so they come to feed on the marlin. Santiago gets furious and starts killing the sharks by stabbing them over and over. He knows that if he lets them eat the marlin he will lose everything that he worked for. These are the two most exciting parts of the book. This proves that this book is not the most exciting book in the world.This book shows that nothing in life is free and everything has its price. Although Santiago has not caught a fish in 85 days he is still determined to catch the biggest fish ever. Santiago is a very persistent man. I think Manolin knows when Santiago is gone for a long time that he has caught the big one. As soon as Santiago's hand starts getting [cramps] and he hasn't been able to eat for a long time he wishes the boy was there to help him. The boy would be a great asset to Santiago at this time. This shows that Santiago was not thinking about the possibilities that could happen out on the water when he left.This book shows that nothing in life is free and everything has a price. I think this book is an okay book. I still don't see how it could win the Pulitzer surprise though."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This book was a little on the boring side. But also contained many morals and values. The old man never loses his fight for catching the big one. And the boy at his side gave him strength through the tough times the man encountered. So all in all it was a good book, but I think it should be aimed more towards a younger generation."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I just finished reading this book for the first time and I thought it was great. It's short and to the point with it's plot line and it doesn't take long to read at all. It's like the sunday paper. Please read it, it's just that good."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"When I first started reading The Old Man and the Sea was totally turned off to Hemingway's simplistic writing style. Although the more the book went on and the more I learned about the Old Man the more I liked the book. It was written with simple words and a simple plot but yet you can take so much out of the book. You can understand the pride the Old Man has for fishing because Hemingway puts so much emotion into the Old Man. The book consists of no pauses, page breaks or chapter markers which is something that I haven't experienced before. It makes you feel like you are right there with the Old Man through his journey with the marlin. I think chapters or pauses would take away from the Old Man's journey and make it seem less intense, especially when he hooks the fish. Over all it is a great book and would I would recommend it to anyone. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I am used to reading books with more complex plots so to me the book seemed almost too simple but full of great morales you could take from it and apply to your life."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Old Man and The Sea is about an old man's determination in the face of misfortune. After heading out to sea, he realizes he is in for a greater challenge than expected. The old man, Santiago, encounters a battle with a great creature of nature and the elements. But, it doesn't end there. The struggle to get home after being beaten by the elements is the greatest challenge of them all. The old man shows his endurance and determination by remaining calm in the face of danger. My favorite character in Old Man and The Sea is Santiago because he has so much determination in what ever he does.I think I could most relate to Manolin, the boy that helped Santiago, because I like to give my help and things I have to my friends without expecting any thing but friendship in return. I have gone fishing before and caught a pretty big fish. My fish was not even close to the one Santiago caught. I think it would be very exciting to catch something that big. It would also be a great accomplishment to get it home.I liked the book because it is easy to read and understand. My favorite part was when Santiago is beats the sharks away from his fish. He finds any means necessary to kill the sharks. My least favorite part of the book is when Santiago eats the raw fish because I think eating raw fish is disgusting. If I could change any part of the book it would be the sharks attacking the Marlin. I think the old man worked so hard that he should have had a greater reward.I would recommend this book to another person because it is a simple book. The book is easy to interpret. The type of person that would like this book is a patient person because the fish-fighting scene goes on forever. All around it's a good book though."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This is undoubtedly Hemmingway's most masterful piece. In this simple story takes place a man who goes out to sea, catches a wonderful fish, and who ultimately loses it because he has gone too far out to sea. As the man struggles to keep whatever is left of his magical fish, sharks attack and slowly pick away at it until nothing is left of it. In many ways, this is the jealousy that inflicts mankind, to have something pure and good and wholesome, only to have it corrupted through mankind's greed. In another way, it is mankind's eternal struggle against himself, to find something magical deep within the foaming sea of mankind's subconscience and to attempt to bring it back as one piece, failing to do so. Hemmingway learned both sides to this from his previous successes and failures, and in this book outlines the pitfalls that lay ahead as one attempts to capture that ephemeral trophy of the muses."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man & the Sea is a powerful story about an old Cuban Fisherman named Santiago. The old man hasn't caught a fish in eighty four days, which is a very long time not to catch a fish. The village people didn't think much of Santiago . They thought of him as less than a man. His only friend was a young village boy named Manolin. Their relationship was special; they respected one another . The boy learned the lessen of greatness and faith from the old man. He also learned about courage and strength. The boy didn't think that Santiago was a failure. In fact he regarded the old man as El Campeon (the champion). The opening story is tense and direct. The main characters are described well. Hemingway's novel is based on a true happening. The old fisherman sets out in the gulf of Cuba to catch a dolphin but misses his chance. He decides to go after the big fish the \\"great marlin.\\" He fights endlessly for his catch, but he can't stop the struggle with it; he has a code of the hero. It was a code that men must live by always. He speaks of the New York Yankees & Joe DiMaggio with great admiration because DiMaggio's father was a poor fisherman like himself. Also, he admired Joe's fortitude because he played while in pain with heel spurs. DiMaggio was the old man's hero. Santiago had missed his chance to catch a dolphin. But he still went after the big fish in the gulf stream of Cuba off the coast of Havana. The old man and the fish are locked in the struggle of their lives. This goes on for days & old man gets weaker and weaker. He didn't have food to eat and hadn't slept in a long time. Santiago thought that he might die fighting the big fish. He admired the fish. Here Hemingway likens the old Man to St. James the lesser the patron saint of Spain. Also to St. Francis of Assisi. There also is the comparison of the suffering of Christ on the cross and the Christian martyrs. These are symbolic of Santiago's suffering and never giving up. The struggle finally comes to an end & he feels sad about the kill. The old man had felt a kinship with the giant fish. As though the two were brothers in nature. The old man apologizes to the fish. He felt a deep love and respect for this noble creature. The test of endurance continues & lack of sleep etc. The old man dreams of lions. \\"Aristotle pointed out that pity is a vital ingredient of tragedy\\". The quality of pity completes the tragic situation. The dreaming of lions symbolizes the old mans strength in his younger years. For the reader to learn the fate of the old man they must read the book. Ernest Hemingway was awarded the Noble prize and the Pulitzer Prize for literature in 1954 and 1955."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"As true today, as the day it was written. Are we not all just fishermen in little boats in a great big sea? Do we all not head out day after day, only to return home empty handed? And if we're lucky we may briefly catch our dreams, but not without a struggle... and is the catch worth the effort, or is it better not to try?The questions, as well as the answers, are as elusive today as they ever were..."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"There is nothing inherently wrong with this book. It actually moves along quite well. At times Hemmingway's sparse and arid prose is maybe a little too one dimensional to sink your teeth into, but he gets his point across. We understand quite well the degree of Santiago's persistence, and bad fortune, yet he still persists. There is zero pretension in this novel and that makes the simplicity of the fisherman's life that much more authentic. If you're a Hemmingway fan you'll like it. If not, you won't... 'cause it treads the same stylistic grounds."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"When the old man set out on his daily routine he experiences more than he has expected. He has found his dream fish and now has the task of reeling it in.Ernest Hemingway was born on July 21, 1899 in a small village in Illinois. After he graduated from high school he started to report for the Kansas City Star where he learned to get to the point in direct, simple sentences. After going to WWI and being injured he fell in love with his nurse. These events inspired his first novel, which led to his amazing career as an author.In my opinion &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; was a great adventure and accomplishment book. In the book the old man is so dedicated to his goal that he endures pain and hardships to achieve this goal. I also think that the book is well written in the aspect of how easy it is to read. The book is easy enough for a younger reader to follow yet it is still interesting and in depth enough for the more average reader to enjoy. So if I had to rate this book on a scale of one to five I would probably give it a four because sometimes the book gets a little too detailed and boring."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Amazingly I did not read this book as an assigned reading in high school... it seems like so many have. But I did read it on my own back then... I loved it then and I love it today! This is a book that stands up each time you read it no matter what stage of life you are in. Other books struck me as moving in my high school years... and then when I re read them 10 years later they were less than satisfying.But Hemingway's little gem always hits the mark. I've read it at least 4 times and it hits me fresh each time.You really get to know who Santiago is through his strong dialogue. What Hemingway says is limited but it says so much! Santiago's feelings are apparent, his hopes and dreams jump out even when it is not written directly by Hemingway.If you read it once... read it again. If you haven't read it read it now... This should be required reading!"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Granted, this is probably &quot;the&quot; greatest testament to man's inner will to prevail against great odds, but was it really worth a Pulitzer Prize? I'm not entirely convinced that it was. There are only two main characters in this story, one of which is only read of in the beginning and end of the story. The leading character, Santiago, is what makes this story work, and provides a window into the inner thoughts of the lower/peasant class. Only Steinbeck's &quot;The Pearl&quot; goes this far in depicting the peasant class in its daily struggle to make ends meet. Santiago is a determined individual. He is obsessed with gaining a fortune from deep-sea fishing. The story builds up gradually, finally having Santiago gain his ultimate goal, and then see it all wisked away before his very eyes. The element of tragedy, combined with Santiago's hope for a better future provide a bittersweet emotion when compared to the over-all message. This is a great novel, and a classic. But, I feel that it just lacks any real depth. There was no real diversity between characters that is present in Hemingway's other works. Reagardless, this is worth reading, and I encourage anyone interested in classic literature to do so."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"If you have never read any Hemingway before then I would not recommend that you read this book. I think that it can only be fully appreciated with a consideration of his style and history.He wrote this short novel towards the end of his career and, having read Hemingway novels, you get the sense that this book is the final, undiluted book of fiction from Hemingway. If his life was a learning curve, then perhaps this book is the end result and all of his previous works moulded him to give this conclusion; all plot, love interest, violence is finally surpassed by the raw, inescapable internal struggle that is always present within his charactersIt is beautiful and very poetic and is pure Hemingway. Unforunately, this probably means that if you don't like Hemingway, you will hate this book as much as I love it."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The novel &quot;The Old Man and The Sea&quot; is a very interesting one. Not only in its content, but in the way that it was written. Many topics, such as morality and relationships were covered in a very short novel. It is not a book that can be categorized as one with a villan and a hero. But much more as one with an antagonist (Santiago, the old man) with no enemies. It is a book that many may find boring, as I first did when I read it. But it is upon reading it and reviewing it that one begins to enjoy it. Analysing this novel is what I found most interesting, for there is much to pondered due to both the author and his ideas. This book may not be for everyone, but it is written very well, and was written in a way that I have not previously seen before. I hope that if you read this book you will enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"What happens if you love your profession, but you are not making any money? What should you do, continue or proceed to a profession you don't like? In The Old Man and the Sea, a cuban fisherman named Santiago had to encounter this problem. He proceeded to be a fisherman. He and a little boy went fishing with him for 84 days without catching a fish. What bad luck! But Santiago was determined to catch a fish, so one early morning he sailed alone into the cold sea. He sailed for many days, until one day he batteled with a marlin and killed it. Santiago is a perfect example why we shold continue to pursue our profession no matter what barriers try to diverge you away from it. Santiago brought back the marlin and was drained from the voyage, but he was a hero to the little boy because he knew Santiago was one of the best fishermans and continued to pursue."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The title and cover of the fabulous book, &quot;Old Man and the Sea&quot;, give you reason to believe that the book is all about and old man fishing (at least thats what i thought!). Suprisingly, after reading the short, easy to read, book, and discussing it in great depth with my wonderful teacher (hi- Mrs. M :)!), my perseption of the book changed completely. Throughout the novel, the reader is introduced to the old man and his daily fishing activites. Hemmingway writes the book so well, that the reader feels as if she's experiencing all that the old man goes through. I hope you enjoy the novel as well as i did!"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I think that the Old Man and the Sea is a great book! If you dive down beneath the words, you find something I have never found before. This tale of triumph and tradgedy is so moving you just want to hug Santiago. If you think about it, this happens to so many people. Santiago probably would have prefered to watch the fisherman, not be one. I would recommend this book to anyone because anyone can read this novel. It is so simple, yet so profuond, it is probably one of the greatest stories ever told."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This book shows a beautiful portayal of extreme courage in individual, unrecognized situations.

I was so suprised at the meaning and symbolization of this book because i took it even to higher level.

Look into it. It is Awesome!"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"At first I thought that this book was alright, Just another book I was assigned to read for class. But then my teacher made us look deeper into the meaning and symbolization. I found it to be an excellent book with a different meaning for everyone. I myself am very into my religion and I found the religious symbolization to be very profound and greatly related to the Bible. Whether Hemmingway wanted it to be that way or not he did a good job of symbolizing Christ. Give this book a try. Look farther than the story of a fisherman and I'm sure you'll enjoy this novella."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This story was pretty good , but I expected more from Hemingway.I lost intrest in the story as Santiago's battle with the marlin was dragged on and seemed as if it was never going to come to an end."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"book was in great shape,lost an old copy in hurricane andrew,just replaced it in my small collection.will be back for more."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Ernest Hemingway is one of those authors who has become famous for defining a style of writing. Dostoyevsky and Dickens swam in intricate detail to the point of verbal diarrhea in their prose; by comparison with most writers, Hemingway has verbal constipation. Admittedly, the only one of his works I'd read previously was \\"A Farewell to Arms\\" (which left much to be desired), but I was dreading \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\". Stories about hunting and fishing rarely catch my interest, and that plotline, combined with the trademark less-is-more writing style, had me gritting my teeth through the first few chapters. But at the end, I actually liked this book a lot more than I thought I would.\\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" is about a Cuban fisherman named Santiago. He has had eighty-four straight days of not catching anything, and when he sets sail on day eighty-five, he is determined to come home with a fish. Relatively early on, something large catches his hook, though it is several hours before he realizes how big of a fish he has gotten. For two days, he and the giant marlin he has snared battle it out on the open sea, both fighting for life, and, despite their mutual respect for one another, both knowing that it won't end until one or both of them dies. But Santiago catching the fish is only the beginning. He still must make it back to Cuba, through sharks and other carnivores that want nothing more than to snack on the large prize tied to the side of his boat.I know there is some symbolism in the story, but I didn't read deep enough to find anything major. To me, it was a poignant tale about the will to accomplish something, and how, despite your best efforts, that accomplishment doesn't always work out the way you want it to. When I realized that Santiago's journey back to land wouldn't go smoothly, I was saddened, because at that point, I was somewhat attached to him.After reading this novella, I think I may give Hemingway another chance. This book redeemed my faith in him, and while I don't think it ranks with other masterpieces of literature, I can see why many beleive it to."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I have read this book before and of course it is a classic but for some of us on a fixed income $10.00 is too much for an e book that you can't even pass down to your family and I know from experience that the publisher S&S will tack on tax also, so Off I go to the library to get it free."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I bought this book in preparation for a visit to Cuba that included a visit to Hemmingway's home.

There were many I did read, but was \\"forced\\" to as a school kid. One of them was The Old Man and the Sea. As I kid, I thought it was an \\"okay\\" story, and I sort of enjoyed the film with Spencer Tracy, too.But I recently re-read the novel and realized something had changed within myself. I could actually feel and understand the depth of Santiago, the old man, and understood his feelings about the sea, the marlin he caught, about the sharks, and about his life and the lives of others, as these things are depicted in the novelAnd, I could truly appreciate the power and beauty of Hemingway's prose in this novel. His descriptions are magnificent, and Santiago's character emerges in great depth, and the meaning of his struggle with the sea, too; all of it comes out in relatively few pages at the hand of a master.I guess it pays to re-visit some of the classics that were thrust upon us in school, but with the perspective we now have. It was an awakening for me--a realization of the power of time and maturity and how they impact on one's perceptions.A fine read it is, if you read it long ago when you were a different person.Mark Rubinstein, Author, MAD DOG HOUSE (Thunder Lake Press, October 23, 2012)"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I never fully understood Ernest Hemmingway until i got older.What a great author, you actually can feel, what he felt about himself ."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Salient and nostalgic, the dry voice of Santiago, quietly accepting and melancholy, casts a penumbra upon the most noble of professions. The weathered \\"old-man\\" might better be described as \\"seasoned\\" in his strong character as a fisherman. With vivid memory he recalls events from the past as they relate to his current struggle; a tireless tug-of-war with a sizable fish. His personal wrest may be allegorically comparable to man's plight against the perils of the sea and the ambivalence of self. Part short story, part heroic account of perseverance, the old man's confidence provokes arrogance in this classic tale of a battle not yet won. Experience as a fisherman allows him to make predictions about the environment and the behaviors of the game, these are not always fortuitous and the old man's ominous acceptance of future events can read as pessimistic. Good introduction to Hemingway, masterfully written as he captures the feeling of a summer setting."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Donald Sutherland's narration of this classic Hemingway story is simply the very best narration of an audiobook I've ever experienced.

The struggle between the fish and Santiago (the fisherman) shows that humans aren't always the greater force. At the end the struggle taught him a lesson, and also thought me a lesson. It taught me that everyone struggles, but there is an end to that struggle. He had a lot of courage and determination to get the marlin. The relationship with Manolin and Santiago was a good one. Manolin was there for the old man at the end. Overall, it was a good book, and it was a pleasure to read. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes fishing or the sea, like my uncle.

It is also nice that it is by the un-intimidating prose of Hemmingway. You don't have to worry about ending up in the never-never land of T.S. Eliot, William Faulkner &amp; Ford Maddox Ford (although visiting never-never land isn't always a bad thing).&quot;The Old Man And The Sea&quot; is an age-old struggle between man and Nature. The persona is a fisherman who spends most of his time either mulling over his lost youth or vicariously re-living the prime of his life thru the baseball exploits of Joe Dimaggio. I think it was Charles Degaulle who said that old age was a shipwreck; this story is indeed emblematic of that.At base, this is a classic story of what Joseph Campbell describes as a hero's journey. I would recommend you join the old man on his heroic quest."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I recently read this book for English class. I was really affected by it. Yes the book was short and the story simple, but it was a well told story. Hemingway is a great writer using simplistic sentences that we all can understand. I feel that he wrote this book to leave us with the poignant message that &quot;a man can be destroyed but not defeated.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Hemingway as usual deciphers a different language into English in the way it would be spoken originally... Beautifully. The story is timeless and the plot need not be retold.Hemingway explores worth in life. What is worth more; a prize or what makes one stronger in the end. What people think over what you know. Worth.The fish which leads Santiago is allegorical to faith in God. Santiago has faith but in the end, as in life, we do not always get what we want--yet we endure and become stronger because of our faith even in the event of loss.I need not even say this but--this truly is a timeless masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"One doesn't have to fish to enjoy &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; by Ernest Hemingway; the story is short and told with simplicity. When reading this work one should try to imagine living the life which Santiago must endure, a hard and unsure life. Because Santiago has been down on his luck he must catch this great fish which he needs to survive and regain the respect of his peers. As the epic battle rages on, Santiago begins to feel as though the fish, a grander Marlin, is his brother. This belief makes Santiago feel guilty about finally dispatching the great animal. Though he has triumphed over the fish he still is defeated by nature.Hemingway uses several conflicts to show the theme of the novel, man versus self, man versus beast, and man versus nature. The most significant of these being man versus self. Santiago must face himself, as he has aged he feels weak and useless. He must fight this fish as he fights himself, his hands and muscles do not perform as they used to and he must be strong to overcome the fish. Santiago is in great pain and he must defeat himself to triumph over the fish. Hemingway also installs into Santiago a love for the magnificent creature. Santiago struggles to kill the fish; he is filled with guilt because he feels as though the fish and he have a bond. Hemingway is showing that the strength of man is minute when compared to that of the wild and that man must find triumph in the dark reaches of defeat."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Enough reviewers have already expounded the brilliance (and hatred) of &quot;The Old Man and the Sea.&quot; Thus, a possible metaphor for this book should be noted to give it an interesting angle upon reading the material:Kurt Vonnegut stated, in the introduction to his book &quot;Timequake&quot; (1997), that Ernest Hemingway's &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; was possibly a metaphor on the fact that the book previous to this was his first in a number of years, and it was widely criticized by the press. The gigantic marlin that the old man (Santiago) catches, and subsequently lashes to his boat, only to lure sharks by dint of its bloody scent, was the creativity that Hemingway put into his last story, only to be &quot;eaten up&quot; by the critics. Not all the characters in the book understand what happened to the old man and his great, big catch--but still, he can dream that he is strong, and will not fail again."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I certainly was not ready for this book in junior high. I was in absolute agony when I had to read this book for my English class. But when I went back to read the book a couple of years later, I was shocked at the beauty of the book, especially since I am not a fan of Hemingway.I would say this is one of Hemingway's finest books, but I guess you really have to be in a certain frame of mind to appreciate this book. It's a shame that kids who can't fully grasp the meaning of this book are forced to read this book and end up getting turned off by this wonderful book. The book, despite its simple language, is deceptively comples and mature."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the SeaI've always thought of The Old Man and the Sea as Hemingway's suicide note.

So I decided it was time to read the book. Well I found the book and the movie paralleled pretty well. How ever I was getting bored with the book. He kept going on and on about Joe Dimaggio's bone spur.There were a few places that made me squeamish. One such place is when he gutted a dolphin and had his face stuck in it.The story is too short to go into detail without revealing the surprises; however it is about (you guessed it) an old fisherman, that should be over the hill, going out to sea from Cuba to catch fish. He has 84 days of bad luck and with any luck this is about to change (or is it?)The reader helps bring the story to life."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The old man is cute and you really want him to catch that fish, you feel like you're in the skiff with him.

Reading him again has turned my opinion around. I urge you to read this book.In \\"The Old Man and the Sea,\\" he shows the story is not in the language per se, but in the complexity found in the subtle reality of life.Of course, \\"Old Man,\\" is not subtle in the classic sense. What I mean is that Hemingway doesn't labor the book with fantastic descriptions detailing the intricacies of the sea, or of being a fisherman. Instead, he delves into the mind of the old man, shows the fatherly love he has for a young boy, and the quest for his legacy.A quick read, I finished it in three or so hours. I was captured by the smell of the salt and the slippery feel of fish squirming in a net. I felt the thirst of a long night fighting a huge fish, and the burn of a fishing line running through my hands. I missed the young boy's company late on the boat, and also wished he were to help me fish. How Hemingway did do this to me?As a Midwesterner, I have barely seen the sea, and have never really fished. It is a great book. Read it for the drama, the language, the psychology, the suspense. It is romance in the sense an old western novel is a romance. By all means, read it.I fully recommend \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" by Ernest Hemingway.Anthony Trendleditor, HungarianBookstore.com"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I never intended to revisit this book, but the other morning I pulled it off the shelf to read a few pages while drinking my coffee, and Hemingway's soulfully simple tale swept me away for the rest of the day. Not that it's really simple. What's amazing about this novella is how Hemingway makes it seem simple, how he weaves Christian symbolism with human/fish/bird/baseball parallelism so precisely, so delicately, so subtly. Don't let the ease of its language fool you. If you (or your teacher years back) missed the Christ-like significance of the crucified marlin gliding below Santiago's boat with his pectoral fins spread wide, then you need to read this one again."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"It is the story of an old Cuban fisherman named Santiago who hasn't caught a fish in eighty four days. A boy used to accompany him in his boat to assist him, but after the fortieth day without catching a fish, the boy's parents declared that the old man was unlucky, and made the boy go out in a different boat that wound up catching three fish the first week. The boy still loved the old man however and even after he no longer accompanied him on his boat, he still tried to look after him and lend him some assistance on the shore.One day in order to try to change his luck the old man sails out by himself beyond his normal limits to the deep sea in search of a big fish. Out beyond all the other boats and the view of the land he gets into a great battle with an 18 foot Marlin and several sharks. Several times the man has to gather his remaining strength to match his wits and will against that of the great fish. The battle becomes a kind of religious experience and in it the old man gains great respect for the fish and for life itself. He shows great courage in the face of defeat, and with it gains a personal triumph from his loss.The story is based on a true story Hemingway was told by one of his fisherman friends named Carlos when he lived in Cuba. They were having a discussion of the thrill of deep sea fishing and big game hunting. It took several years however before he actually got time to write it down and turn it into a short story. When he finally got back around to it he had to go back out deep sea fishing with his friend again several times to get the feel down just right, but I believe he captures the experience perfectly.This book was written in 1952 which was baseball's glory days, and you certainly can see it's influence in this story. Joe DiMaggio who's father was a fisherman is reverently mentioned on more than one occasion. (I wonder whether it's favorable depiction in this book has helped Baseball maintain it's tremendous popularity as a sport in Cuba to this day.)I first read this story over twenty years ago when I was in High School and loved it. When I was recently reviewing my list of books deemed to be among the best ever written, one of my daughters asked me to read it to her. It wasn't really a children's story, and was a little difficult at times to read out loud (since the main character Santiago speaks in broken English), but she appeared to love it just as much as I did. I haven't read all of them as of yet, but In my opinion I'd say this is the best story Hemingway has written out of the ones I have read."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This bookm is one of the greatest books i have ever read,it is meaning ful to most every one espescilly me.Even though it is a short book it is really good.it was recomended to me by my favorite teacher and i really enjoyed it.I would recommend it to every one."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"You don't come across a lot of stuff like this in literature: a novella that has so much depth to it.

Not only for fishermen, but for anyone who enjoys good literature.The storyline is of much simplicity, but through those terse sentences in which this story is written, there is so much. This is the story that really assured Hemingway the Nobel Prize.I shan't say more about it, just read the book! This is the quintessential classic."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Over the years, Hemingway wrote a number of novels along with short stories. His novels are now somewhat dated, and his style was one of simple subject, verb, and object. This is great if you are using one of his books to study a foreign language, but in my opinion it lacks in terms of descriptive beauty. For all of that \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" is superb. It has balance, adventure, and originality, and the simple, straight forward text is perfect for the uneducated, Cuban fisherman he is describing.

While I initially struggled through it one summer as part of my high school honor's course it wasn't until years later that I finally came to appreciate its numerous levels and nuances for what they are. Much like any book what you will take from this one is dependent on your own experiences and the authors, however here Hemingway offers up quite a bit more then you tend to find in your average paperback. Discussing life, the connection between man and nature, the relationships between people, the illusions of greatness and safety, all while touching on such key archetypal figures as destiny, nature, oppression, victory, honor, familial love, and success it is no wonder why for so many it and for so long it has been a treasured piece of American Lit. Don't get scared off by the heavy subject matter though, the book is amazingly short and Hemingway's poetic prose style makes it one of the easiest reads to get through. If you're looking for a quick read with a lot to offer then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This book is beautifully written! The language is simple and unambiguous. You may get a little chuckle out of it here and there.

The baseball allusions, especially those of Joe DiMaggio, hooked me. Of course, I also had to keep rooting for the underdog Santiago. The boy's loyalty is honorable, and Santiago's determination is inspiring. Friends ask me how I can love such a depressing book, and all I can say is that the book was never depressing to me.

Perhaps, it might have something to do with the way I celebrate the conflicts in my own life while gaining strengh from my own successful failures."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The MarginAfter reading The Sun Also Rises by Hemingway I was reluctant to try him again. I was not impressed with the novel of post war expatriate hedonists looking for fun and the meaning of life. But, I did try him again and am glad I did. The Old Man and the Sea was and is a masterpiece. Hemingway puts the reader soundly in the skiff along side the old fisherman. You feel, I mean you really feel the old man's utter disappointment after many days of fishing failures. And you feel the old man's determination as he sets out again for another day certain to be a waste, but it wasn't.I recommend you take the hour or two required and read The Old Man and the Sea. As for me, I'm on the way to the local library to see if they have a copy of For Whom the Bell Tolls.Marvin Wiebener, author of The Margin.

Santiago's battle against the indefatigable takes us to a chilling conclusion and eternal truth: even if man feels that he has won against nature, in such a victory he has actually lost. Santiago has drowned: he has lost his pride to the sea. What will humanity lose?Read this novella again and again and again and you will always discover some new literary magic.

Using simple words, with few words over two syllables, Hemingway makes us feel as though we are in the skiff with Santiago, the Old Man. There is a short setup where Santiago describes his struggles as of late by going 80 plus days without catching a fish, and how, even with the lack of fish, he goes out day after day in search of another fish.The novel describes Santiago's struggles with a fish, a marlin, that is the largest that Santiago has ever seen. As Santiago struggled to haul in the fish, one can't help but feel sorry for the old man, and cheering that he will land the fish.The novel is capped off by a trademark ending that is indicative of Hemingway. I largely enjoyed the novel, and my one complaint is that I wish that it were longer."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Ernest Hemingway's short novel &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; received the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 1953, and undoubtedly played a role in his being awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1954. The book tells the story of an elderly Cuban fisherman and of his epic struggle with a gigantic marlin.This is a simple, straightforward story of courage and endurance. For most of the book, the old man is totally alone (aside from the animals he encounters) on his boat. Hemingway fills the book with memorable details about marine life and the fisherman's trade. An interesting touch is the invocation, throughout the book, of U.S. baseball player Joe DiMaggio as an iconic figure.Hemingway's style has been justly celebrated over the decades, and his writing in this book is remarkable. In &quot;The Old Man&quot; he achieves a purity, clarity, and stark beauty that remind me of the poetry of Stephen Crane. This book is an enduring classic, and Hemingway's old man is one of the most memorable characters in American literature. If you like this book, also try &quot;The Story of a Shipwrecked Sailor,&quot; by Gabriel Garcia Marquez."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"10 July, 1999 A.D./2542 B.E. Chiang Mai, Northern ThailandTHE OLD MAN AND THE SEA, Hemingway's greatest work, leads to a reading of THE EPISTLE OF JAMES and to the entire BIBLE. Santiago means St. James in Spanish. Remember, Hemingway had first heard the story of a fisherman's struggle for four days at sea from his good friend Carlos Guiterrez in Cuba in 1934. Hemingway waited sixteen years to write THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA in Dec., 1950-early Feb., 1951. In the years between his first knowledge of the story and his own lyrical rendering of it, Hemingway took Mass in Spanish in Cuba on far more than one occasion. Examine, for instance, the fact that all the characters in THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA are named after Catholic saints or Apostles. &quot;La Carta de Santiago&quot; is from the Spanish New Testament; its English translation is &quot;The Epistle of James.&quot; Like THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA, &quot;The Epistle of James&quot; focuses on themes of patience in the face of adversity, of enduring life's struggles for the sake of a greater good, and of gaining inner peace. Manolin, the Cuban boy's nickname, is the Spanish nickname for Manuel, a name derived from the prophecy of the Christ child Emmanuel in &quot;The Book of Isaiah&quot; in THE OLD TESTAMENT. Perico is the Spanish nickname for Pedro, which means Peter in English. Peter, of course, is another of Christ's apostles. Intrigues me that Santiago is the name of two vital figures in Christianity, Santiago del Zebedeo/St. James of Zebedee (whom Christ first met as a fisherman) and Christ's brother, Santiago/St. James the Martyr, who was stoned to death in Jerusalem. Martin, the owner of The Terrace bar who is generous to the impoverished Santiago, is also the name of two famous Catholic saints who were extraordiarily helpful to the poor, St. Martin of Tours of France and St. Martin de Poores. St. Martin of Poores is regarded as the patron saint of Afro-Cubans due to his incredibly generosity and sacrifice for African slaves in South America in the 1600s. And from the time he returned from Spain in 1939 to the time he wrote THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA at the Finca Vigia, Hemingway attended Spanish Mass in Cuba. Readings from &quot;La Carta de Santiago&quot;/&quot;The Epistle of James&quot; figure prominently in the Catholic Liturgical Calendar Year B, Ordinary Time(normally, in the September of every B cycle year). Santiago makes his journey for his marlin in September, &quot;the month when the big fish come.&quot; September is hurricane season in Cuba, by the way, meaning Santiago knows he is risking his life. No, it's not too bad that this is Hemingway's shortest novel. In many ways, it is his richest and deepest work, and moreover, truest to his aesthetic. Five stars are not enough! Rock hard and ride free, Cool Papa H.! Hemingway evidences an incredible understanding of Cuban culture in THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA as he tells a story of one man's struggle to carry his dream at high sea in the face of death. Ultimately, his journey is spiritual at its core: Santiago's ability to accept the butchering of the marlin by the sharks, and his resolution at the end to continue going out to sea, teach us volumes on how to carry our own dreams in the seas we sail in our time. Santiago's story is timeless as love and endures with all the grace of every wave hitting all the shores of all the beaches of all the world. Reviewer: Mike Tucker"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I have, I think, read everything that Hemingway ever had published. As a youngster he was my favorite fiction writer and has remained so, although I have read a great many books in the interim, some by great writers.Ernest Hemingway has had many detractors, but his writing speaks for itself. He needs no other champion.Of all his stories, &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; is perhaps his best. In it, an old Cuban fisherman, Santiago, fishing by himself, catches a giant, magnificent marlin, after a terrible struggle, and makes it fast to his small boat. On the way home, however, it is eaten by the sharks, leaving only a skeleton.The story is, reputedly, autobiographical. The story itself is the great marlin, and the sharks are the critics, which have dogged Hemingway's declining career, panning such efforts as &quot;Over the River and Into the Trees,&quot; and disparaging him generally as an aging has-been.With &quot;The Old Man and the Sea,&quot; Hemingway proved, to them and himself, that he could still write magnificent prose. For it he was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature--a prize at which he had previously scoffed, saying that no one who had ever received it had subsequently written anything worthwhile.Hemingway's literary style--his clipped, unadorned approach--has been often aped but never equaled. He was a true original, and most important; he was a sensitive observer of humanity and its follies. But, never an observer only; he was a participant. &quot;The Snows of Kilimanjaro,&quot; if not autobiographical at least was based upon his own experience. He knew the people of whom he wrote. He had been a combatant and a journalist and a fisherman and a hunter: a man's man.Like all really notable writers of fiction, he had lived his stories. I suggest that you read his work for yourself, and disregard the slurs of the effete intellectual snobs who slyly claim that he was a latent homosexual, and contrive to belittle his genius. They are like the sharks he portrayed, who would destroy the great prize of his legacy. Heed them not. In spite of his tragic death, he was a peerless writer.&lt;P&lt;"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"What an incredible story. I read this in less than two hours (it is a novella) and upon completing this simple story, I had a incredibly overwhelming satisfaction toward the ferocity of the human spirit. Yes, this book is all story but the main idea is all spirit. Those that can't see the incredible battle within are not READING the story, just the words. As a simple by-product, this book led directly to Ernest Hemingway's receipt of the Nobel Prize in 1954.This story features three main characters: the old man (Santiago), a young boy (Manolin), and the human spirit. Santiago takes on the once-in-a-lifetime catch of a prize marlin which is described and portrayed in a manner to draw out the challenge facing each individual, both physically and emotionally. Santiago hasn't had a catch in 84 days. On day 85, he decides that, no matter what, he'll not return with a catch. Indeed, that was his fate. Santiago experiences physical pain, emotional pain, spiritual pain, and the pain of being alone with the elements. Yet, he continues on, creating hope where there is none. Before this story reaches it conclusion, getting right with life, Santiago decides it is he or the marlin.This story is incredible. It deserves(d) all the critical acclaim received. Once again, those who didn't find this story touching their soul didn't read the story."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The old man and the sea is the best book of all times!I have this book in many languages and enjoy collecting every edition of it ! here we follow a man who represents us all in a way ,and the fish represents our struggle in life.

I liked it because it is a really interesting and a really well written and described book. This book is about an old man who always went fishing, but he had bad luck for about eighty-four days. His bad luck went away. One day he went fishing and grabbed a marlin, one of the biggest marlins in history. Later his problems started. At first the marlin was so big the marlin was carrying the boat,with the old man inside. The old man spent three days fighting with the marlin, until the third day when the marlin was tired and the old man was able to pull it. When the marlin was one meter away from the boat the old man killed it with a paddleboat. The marlin bled a lot. Later more and more problems occurred.My favorite character was Santiago also called the old man. Santiago is an old man he was thin and gaunt with deep wrinkles in the back of his neck. He was a very generous, nice and very perseverant old man. The Old Man and The Sea mostly takes place in the waters of the Gulf Stream.I believe the author did a very good job with this book. It is a real page-turner. It once kept me reading for an hour: for me that is like a world record.I think that if you would ask anyone how many stars do you give to The Old Man and The Sea I bet every one would say four or five. I am one hundred percent sure I would give it five stars. The books moral is being perseverant, never give up, and if you put your mind to something you will achieve it."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I read this book in Chinese,and I plan to read it in English again.(Maybe something that I am writting is not good translation from Chinese to English)I think the best way to understand a novel is to read it in its original language.Hemingway is one of my favorite authors.I like his style.&quot;Less is more.&quot;He uses the words that are not hard for me to understand,and they express his thoughts as well as the big words.In The Old Man and the Sea,Hemingway tells us a story about an old fisherman's experience on the sea.The part I like best is after the old man's way home after he finally catches the big fish,but he doesn't have enough strength to protect his victory from the sharks.He is all tried thirsty and hungry.Unfortunately,the sharks eat his fish bit by bit.So when he gets home,the fresh of the fish is gone,only the bone left there.Hemingway uses symbols a lot.For example,the old man's dreams of lions play on the beach represent the old man's youth and power.The old man is a hero that Hemingway creates successfully."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I read this book at one go at a local bookshop. It's bad that I did it but how could one stop reading when one's heart is captured the first instance one lay one's eyes on the first sentence of the book? Pausing will only result in breaking the feel the book gives me and to continue later will not give me back the same feeling. I know that.This book is about an old Cuban fisherman, yes. But to me it is much more than that. It's about how one struggles in life just to live and also at the same time how one could appreciate what one has and treasure the pleasures that one is lucky to be bestowed from time to time. It's also about determination and perseverance, of how one should never let go without a good fight. For those who has been a warrior, this book will ring deep in the heart.The prose that Hemingway employ is extremely simple yet beautiful. Conveying beautiful messages in simple sentences is not easy but in this little novella, one can see ample demonstration on how a master of prose employs it so elegantly. Read it and feel good about it. If you're as unlucky as the old man one day, this book will surely be your best companion as it is as real and as good as it can get."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I, like many, have laboured my way through a number of books that are hailed as modern classics and have been left wondering why they are acclaimed as such. Therefore, it was with some degree of trepidation that I began reading the tale of Santiago, the ancient Cuban fisherman. Do not be put off by critics eager to impress upon you how they grappled with the religious symbolism and spiritual undercurrent. Instead Hemingway's crisp, clear style will have you loosening your collar as you bake in the hot sun on the Old Man's boat. In this slim volume you share in Santiago's recollections, friendships, joys and his frustration. Despite the brevity of this book, it is a must for anyone who wishes to enjoy one of the ultimate displays of power through the written word."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea, by Ernest Hemingway, is a short novel about an old Cuban fisherman named Santiago, the many struggles he faces in his life and his main conflict with a large marlin far out in the Gulf Stream. The details of this novel are very specific and to the point. It does not seem like Hemingway used any special techniques to try to attract the reader even more towards the novel. However, the novel was still enticing, and clear; unlike other authors, Hemingway did not keep me bewildered throughout the whole novel, and then surprised me with a bad conclusion-it was the opposite of that. I liked that Hemingway used various themes like courage, loneliness, defeat, and others. I also liked that Hemingway used very detailed descriptions of everything he talked about, and he used very simple language, comprehendible to everybody. I found the novel interesting from beginning to end."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Intrigued by the classics of the 20th century such as 1984, Animal Farm, and Brave New World, I decided to request Old Man And The Sea as a Christmas present and am I glad that I did. This was not my first time reading Hemingway,however, as I had read a Farewell to Arms in my sophomore year of high school and did not really enjoy it analyzing it as a book for school. The Old Man and the Sea was a different book altogether. Based in Havana, Cuba, an old fisherman sets out on an thrilling adventure to catch the biggest fish that he or any other fisherman has ever seen. After 84 days of fruitless fishing, Santiago strikes rich with an enormous Marlin and must endure spiritual, physical, and mental anguish to outlast a fish that has every bit of the strength that he does. The ending is tragic considering what Santiago went through to get the fish, however, it is a wonderful novel and my first time that I enjoyed reading Hemingway outside of a school environment.At 127 pages, I'd pick this book up right away... a short and quick novel to enjoy on any occasion.-Travis S."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I thought The Old Man and the Sea was a great short novel. I could not put this book down until I was finally finished it was just that exciting and powerful. I think this is one of the best short novels ever written. Hemmingway wrote this book as a short but influential novel. I suggest The Old Man and the Sea to all readers who like exciting, fun books that are a quick read.The first reason I thought this book was great was because of the characters. Characters like Santiago were great characters because though he is a failure as a fisherman he still has enough pride and will power to go on and continue to do what he loves knowing that one day his luck may change and he may start to catch more fish then anyone else.In my opinion perhaps the best and most significant part of this book is when Santiago has a three day fight with the largest fish he has ever encountered. I thought the old mans will and relentlessness to catch the fish was great and moving because if I had that kind of commitment in anything that I do, I think I would be much more successful.The thing I did not really like about this book is how in the end Santiago only makes it back to shore with the bones of the huge fish. The reason for this is because of the scavengers that ate the fish as he towed it back to shore on his small boat.Though I feel there is one down fall to this book I still think it is an awesome book which if you have not read yet you should do to its interesting and moving plot."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Very good short story about a man, his passions and dreams. If you want to read at least one book from Hemingway, this is the one. It is defenitely worthwhile to be read and it will only take you 2-3 hours. Read it and \\"dream with lions.......\\"."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I read this book in one sitting. It's a shorty, but pretty good considering its length. It is a classic Hemingway book, which I like, but it isn't his best."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I gave the book The Old Man and the Sea four stars. I gave it four stars because though I enjoyed the book, I found it boring at times and sometimes hard to follow. Although the book was sometimes boring it had great detail that made you feel as though you were right there with the old man trying to pull in the huge marlin fish. In using such vivid description he put you into the story feeling the sorrow the same sorrow for the old man that the boy felt.I suppose I found the book boring at times because I sometimes felt as though I was reading about things that had no relevance to the story. Which in turn also made it hard to follow and I would get confused. But, I kept reading because the determination of the man to catch a fish kept my interest to see if he really would get that big one he was waiting for. Hemmingway makes you become emotionally invested in the story. &quot;No one should be alone in their old age....But it is unavoidable&quot; (pg. 48) When the old man says this you feel bad for him and you hope never to become that way.The old man possess much determination he shows this by never giving up. \\"Fish...I'll stay with you until I am dead.\\" (pg.52) The old man says this during his chase of the big marlin. When he says this you can hear the determination in his voice and you know he will get this fish or die.I would recommend this book for others because although there were some parts that were boring are hard to follow it was a good book and I thought it had a great lesson behind it. Never give up. I think this lesson is proved when Hemmingway writes \\" But man is not made for defeat... a man can be destroyed but not defeated\\" (pg. 103)."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I found the book the &quot; The Old Man and The Sea &quot; written by Earnest Hemingway a pretty good book to read. I thought it was simple to read and understand.The author begins by introducing Santiago, the main character. He is an old fisherman who has be nicknamed &quot; salao &quot; meaning the worst kind of unlucky. It's been over 80 days without a single catch of a fish. A young boy Manolin helps the old man, and has great faith in him. Manolin's parents finally told him not to fish with Santiago, because the bad luck might rub off on him.One day, Santiago goes out to fish on his own. Although he s not as strong as he used to be, he believes he can still make it on his own. So out to sea he sails. He sailed out further than any other sailor has ever gone out. He gets situated and finally casts out his line. Little does the old man know that he is in for the struggle of his life and pride.Santiago has caught the marlin. It's the biggest marlin that Santiago has ever seen in his life. This marlin drags the boat for several days and nights, yet the old man refuses to let this one go. He wants everyone to know that he can do it and his luck is still on his side. At times, it seemed like the marlin was going to win. But Santiago hung in there, ate his raw fish, got his rest in when he could and beat the marlin. Now all he had to do is bring that marlin home. And the only way to bring the marlin back was to tie it to the side of the boat. The blood from the dead fish attracts sharks. So Santiago had to battle the sharks the whole way back. By the time Santiago got back to the village his prize catch was all eaten up. So he crawls back to his shack and into his be, face down, arms stretched out.I liked this book because it was a conflict between Santiago and himself. He knows he sailed out to far. He knows it would be a battle to catch and return with the fish, especially for his age. I think it's Santiago's determination that made him sail out to catch the marlin. I would say he succeeded in his unlucky streak by catching the biggest fish anyone has ever caught. The funny part is that no one saw it and he has no proof of it. But Santiago knows for himself and thats what matters."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This is another work of Fiction that I put off for years to read. I enjoyed it from the first to last word. It's not genre fiction for sure. Hemingway tells one man's battle in life as it often truly occurs. The protagonist achieves his goal, but the elements of nature take the most from him. Great fiction! I think, sometimes, I see a hint of this writer's dynamic impact of simplicty within the pages of today's popular genre novels.Hell, Old Man And The Sea won a Pulitzer!"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Any fisherman going eighty-seven days without a catch would be considered by many as unlucky. But when the old fisherman Santiago managed the feat not just once, but twice, he rightfully earned the dubious distinction of being outright salao-the worst form of unlucky. However, when he sets out on his eighty-fifth day for the deeper reaches of the sea he remains as determined as ever. This passion and determination beam forth from his eyes, \\"Everything about him was old except his eyes and they were the same color as the sea and were cheerful and undefeated\\" (10). His pride long lost, he sails on, deeper and further than ever.Perhaps he is merely fulfilling his duty to a task he was born to, or perhaps a debt owed to the unflagging loyalty of a young boy named Manolin who continues to believe and care for him. But most likely, it was Santiago's unbridled belief that la mar would once again open her arms and embrace the fisherman she had known and loved for so many years. Irregardless, Santiago sets sail hours before sunrise fatally optimistic, \\"Every day is a new day. It is better to be lucky. But I would rather be exact. Then when luck comes you are ready\\" (32). Santiago captures the adage that success is achieved where opportunity meets preparation. But it is this blind faith in his ability and the righteousness of the universe that blinds him to the fact that his odds are really no better than Sisyphus'.Santiago's fishing expedition begins auspiciously after catching a ten-pound tuna. It is perhaps one of life's greater ironies that man is so deceived by such a token gift that his faith is restored in himself and that of divine justice moments before it was to be thrown overboard. Yet the fisherman's years have made him quite attuned to nature as he immediately realizes the significance of a man-of-war bird circling above him. He sinks his line deep in the ocean and hooks an eighteen-foot fifteen hundred pound marlin, thus beginning an epic struggle between man and beast that would last two days.The fisherman's line wound taught and on the verge of snapping, parallels that of his physical and mental suffering. Alone and fledgling, Santiago realizes how lonely he is, and perhaps how life is more enjoyable when you have someone to share it with. Santiago says aloud, \\"I wish I had the boy. To help me and to see this\\" (48). His determination is as resolute as that of the marlin, or any being of nature left desperate and bereft, \\"Fish, I'll stay with you until I am dead. He'll stay with me too, I suppose...\\" (52). Their fates have become entwined both in life and death.The fisherman realizes the sorry predicament that life has put him and all God's creatures in, \\"Then he was sorry for the great fish that had nothing to eat and his determination to kill him never relaxed in his sorrow for him\\" (75). Finally, the marlin weakens and Santiago is able to harpoon him. He proceeds to tie the marlin to his skiff and begins the long journey home to the Terrace. The struggle weakened the fisherman sufficiently to make his catch vulnerable to an onslaught of hungry sharks. Fending them off the best he could, his efforts were no match for the relentless number of sharks.After finally seeing the lights of his beloved Cuba in the distance, Santiago experiences a moment of clarity after reflecting on the loss of his marlin to the sharks while journeying home, \\"It is easy when you are beaten. And what beat you, he thought. Nothing, I went out too far\\" (120). He is to blame for his misfortunes. His pride led to his downfall, but presumably he is somehow a better and wiser man for taking on nature and living to tell about it. Reminiscent of Sisyphus rolling his rock up the mountain for the first time, Santiago will inevitably try again, and again will be left with nothing more than the experience that must ultimately end in failure."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Those who haven't read Hemingway, this novel is a great way to start.

It talks about the life of a old man who has been unlucky lately with his captures of fish and who has an apprentice with him that is not allowed to go with him because of his bad luck.

The old man is a professional fisherman who makes a poor living catching fish. So he sets his sail and goes out to sea. The way the old man catches his fish is by holding a long piece of rope with a hook and a piece of bate on the end of it. So while sailing he hooks up a huge Marlin that will make him rich. But the problem is that a group of macho sharks are going after his fish. The old man has to struggle with life threatening situations like starvation, dehydration, and the pain of holding on to the rope that will cut through anything. Will he bring in the fish in time before the sharks tear all of its flesh off? Will he get rich? \\"The shark closed fast astern and when he hit the fish the old man saw his mouth open and his strange eyes and the clicking chop of the teeth as he drove forward in the meat just above the tail.\\" This book is for readers who like fishing and excitement through the whole book."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The old man and the sea was probably one of the best books that I read this year. I would recommend this book to anyone. Although this book is not as fast paced as some other books out today, it still has some very good qualities. One quality that I thought was good as a young person was that it was an easy read. Also the book has less than 150 pages and does not contain a wide range of vocabulary. However the book being short and not containing a wide range of vocabulary doesn't mean you can't learn anything from it. This book contains some very valuable life lessons and philosophy."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"There is a hero. And the hero has courage.And the hero shows silent courage and dedication to his task. And the task is a great task , and one whose meaning does not end in itself alone, but has greater human significance. An old man is battling a fish . And the fish is greater and stronger than him. And the old man in the battling uses all the wisdom of his experience. And the old man in seeking to catch and bring home the great fish , struggles with all he has. And the old man is destroyed but not defeated .And what he is he teaches to the ' boy' who is his helper who will be a fisherman after him. And will continue to be what he is.The language is simple and clear. The description is clean and light. The story is simple and moving.The parable is also readily understandable. Man at his best struggles with all he is against a Nature, a world , a Cosmos indifferent to him and ultimately stronger than he is. Yet in the manner of the struggle, the grace under pressure, the courage Man reveals himself to have a dignity which is great and uplifting.Hemingway toward the end of his days writes the parable of his own struggle , and of his own ideal conception of Mankind in the Universe. And he does it in such a convincing way so as to enable us the readers to take greater pride and hope in our own humanity."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This book has had volumes written about it's subtext, it's reflection of modern society on old world morals, or as a metaphor about the individual versus globilization. This story is simply about a man catching a fish. It is written so well that you can smell the salt air, your skin burns from the unforgiving sun, and you muscles ache with the struggle of pulling in a really big fish. Beautifully written. Hands down my favorite book."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Even though this is the last book in Hemingway's career, it is probably his most well-known. This is, indeed, one of the books that won him the Nobel prize, an extraordinary thing to win in the literary world.It's a tale about an old man named Santiago who hadn't caught a fish in 80 days. You would think that that would be no big deal, other than money-wise, but the village people have tagged him as unlucky and washed-up, and a boy named Manolin, whom he loved as a son, was not allowed to fish with him any more.One day he sets out to sea in a small skiff, and he hooks a gigantic marlin (kind of like a swordfish, but really very pretty). The marlin drags him far out to sea, and he feels a great connection with the fish. During the time that he's out to sea, he talks to himself and to the sea a great deal, experiences great pain, and just the teeniest bit starts to lose his mind... in the end, he does kill the marlin, but he finds out that the thing is two feet longer than his boat. This is also a really sad time for him because all through the book it talked about his connection with nature; he called the fish his brother.To recap: He's two days out to sea, he just realized that this HUGE fish that he caught has to be TOWED IN to shore, and he's totally spent both mentally and physically. There would have been a little bit of a chance of getting back to shore with his fish, but then... a large Mako shark appears. A bite is taken out of the fish and the blood pours into the water.Poor old Santiago has to watch as shark after shark comes and rips apart his beautiful fish, and when he gets back home, almost the entire thing is gone, except for the tail, the skeleton, and the head. Santiago is battered and bruised, not only from the catching of the fish, but also from trying to fight off the sharks.It works out okay in the end- Manolin gets to fish with the old man again, and the village fishermen have respect for Santiago. The end just makes you so sad-happy (now that's an oxymoron if I ever saw one), though- an American couple sees the skeleton with the head taken off (Manolin got the head) and they think that the fish is a SHARK. But Santiago's alive, and everything's okay.I just gave the bare facts; if you really want to experience the beauty of the text then you have to read it for yourself. :)"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"When Hemingway published THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA, it had been sometime since he had last published anything that would stand as being among his best work. Like too many writers, too many years of hard living and very hard drinking had taken its toll. He had tasted success, and perhaps he was no longer as hungry as he had once been. But whatever the circumstances, he managed to resummon his considerable talents for one final masterpiece.The remarkable thing about THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA is that it tells a story so simple that a child can appreciate it (I read it to my daughter when she was seven years old, and she loved it--she wanted to know more about this mysterious and obviously great Joe DiMaggio) yet only an adult can fully appreciate. It also represents graphically Hemingway's own philosophy of life, a philosophy that even his own suicide couldn't completely negate. Hemingway was fascinated with Norse mythology, and the imagery of the gods and heroes of Valhalla struggling against an enemy against whom they were destined to fail fascinated him. Like them, he felt that the struggle was everything. The Old Man of the story similarly struggles to win with victory improbable. But in the end, his failure to bring his magnificent blue marlin to market pales beside the courage and fortitude he displays in his struggle.Everything about this simple tale is &quot;just right.&quot; It is the right length for the story, has just the correct number of characters to keep it from feeling too sparse or too cluttered, just the precise, deft language needed to tell the tale. It partakes almost more of the folktale than the modern short novel. And in his depiction of The Old Man, Hemingway has created one of his greatest characters, simultaneously noble, simple, wise, and courageous."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I have never been a fan of Ernest Hemingway, but The Old Man and the Sea is a truly classical story.Set in Cuba during the 1960's, an old fisherman named Santiago seeks to catch fish: a feat which he has not accomplished in eighty-four days. Outlasted by successful fishermen with better equipment, Santiago can only hope to catch fish the old-fashioned way with the help of his apprentice, a young boy named Manolin, whom the boy's parents eventually force to work on a different, more successful boat.Santiago sets out to change his 'losing streak.' When a giant marlin takes his bait, he struggles with the great fish for several days until he finally catches it. To his great dismay, sharks that are by Santiago's boat attack the fish's body, and it is completely devoured, leaving only a skeleton.With the skeleton as his only record of the great catch, Santiago returns to Cuba. What will happen to his apprentice, Manolin, as well as Santiago's well being after an apparent defeat by the sharks, is up to the reader to find out.Hemingway conveyed a powerful message in a very short book.

This is a truly fishy tale that tells of one man's courage and defeat. I would recommend this book to readers around middle school and up. Be warned, though.

The old man's quest began following his second longest \\"record\\" of 85 days, when he caught the biggest struggle of his life. Despite the old man's wisdom, due to his many years on and around the ocean, he depended on the resect and love he held for the young boy to pull him through.The book, in my opinion, was enjoyable and absorbing in all aspects. The conflict was easy to relate to because of its clairity and simplicity, yet still contained a strong underlying complexity. My most favorite part of the book was the old man's struggle with the marlin. My least favorite part was in the end, when dispite the old man's many attempts, he had to watch helplessly as his prize got ripped from his grasp.I recommend this book to almost everyone because of it's easy to follow story line, yet complex underlying conflict. This book, in my opinion, is most suitable for an advanced middle school level to college level reader.

The author did a very good job using imagery because during the whole entire book I was able to picture everything in my mind. For example, in the part were Santiago is fighting for what he wants I could feel his emotions. One thing that made me love this book was the theme, which is so aspiring because it teaches you determination and how to endure pain and it also shows you how anything is possible. I really recommend this book who loves to read for the reason being that it can relate to almost anyone because every human being has come to a situation were there just about to give up.

The book starts off with this old man called Santiago and this little boy named Manolin spending some time together talking about how he's due for a catch.The main plot about this book is the old man and a battle he has out at sea with a huge fish. It doesn't sound like it, but it's a really good story. I really enjoyed how it made me worry that he was going to stay out at sea and die or something. It keeps you reading from around half way threw the book to the end. You can't help but feel bad for that old man, the way he gets beaten up by this fish he is fighting.A problem I had with the book is how it started off very very slow. I had problems keeping my attention in the book. However, it wasn't that bad, and all I needed was a quiet room in order to get my reading done.Another thing, is that the way he wrote the book was kinda annoying. He always seemed to use really short sentences, and it's semi-distracting, but nothing too serious. I could also be wrong, and the size of the sentences are actualy standard size.I recomend this book to anyone who wants a short story to read on say, a plane trip or a long bus ride. Because this book will do fine in that place. I give this book 4 stars out of 5. It missed one because I didn't like how the book was written, and it got a little bit under my nerves."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"\\"'Meaningless! Meaningless!'says the Teacher.'Utterly meaningless!Everything is meaningless.'\\" (Ecclesiastes 1:2)Ernest Hemmingway, in this short little novel, gives us a glimpse into a meaningless life. The Old Man lives a life which has no real purpose, beyond catching fish. There is no higher goal, nothing to stive for beyond himself. This was Hemmingway's own view, and he ended up committing suicide later in life. It is a very interesting novel, which is very enjoyable, and it is nowhere near as dark as stuff by Camus.The Old Man is a very interesting character, and it is great fun to watch Hemmingway develop his character. I really enjoy Hemmingway's writings, and if you like this, I would recommend his longer book For Whom the Bell Tolls, which is much better (though that is difficult to do)."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"\\"The Old Man and The Sea\\" was Ernest Hemingway's last novel published in life. Not only did this book give him a Pulitzer Prize, but it also cinched the Nobel Prize for him, awarded in 1954. Nevertheless, critics and scholars aren't unanimous to believe that this is best work. For many, in this book, Hemingway abandoned his realistic approach.For many people this is an allegory of the writer's condition when he wrote the novella. Hemingway himself would be the \`old man' being attacked by critics on a feeding frenzy. However much some people do believe in this interpretation - and they say that Hemingway's writing were based on his life experience, so why wouldn't this be? - this would be a very small interpretation.In \\"The Old Man and the See\\", Hemingway found a middle shape that fits between his long novels and his short stories. In this novella, the writer takes his famous style to another level since he retains so much from his prose. Everything we know about his writing is there: the short and direct sentences are the best example. But in this novel the sentences aren't the only device that is short.The novella \`lacks' characters - actually, there are only two major characters and one of them is off the stage for most of the time. This is the \`old man''s show. As character he is fully developed however we don't learn much about his past, but it doesn't take too much from Hemingway to tell us who somebody is - just some tips and we know.The narrative is short and concentrates on a couple of days in the old man's life. The most dramatic moments -near the end - unfold beautifully. Throughout the book, Hemingway deals with someone struggling against defeat. The main character, Santiago, has gone eighty-four days without catching a fish. But he refuses to accept defeat: the old man sails out beyond the other fishermen in search for the biggest fish.\\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" is a short book that doesn't take to much time to be read. On the other hand, it may stay with reader long after finishing. With his power of persuasion, Hemingway has created an unforgettable tale of love for life and honor."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I'd never read any of Hemingway's works before picking this slim book up on a whim. I hesistate to pick up very famous, classic works because they can be very difficult and sometimes boring to read. If you are hesitating as well, don't. This story is simply, beatifully written. I literally could not put it down - I had to know how it ended. And after I finished I thought about it a long time - both the story and what Hemingway was trying to say through the story. No matter if you are looking for just a good read or a thought provoking work, you won't regret reading this book."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I consider this novel Hemingway's best. This novel is quite unlike other novels of Hemingway. As Hemingways's last novel it has only two human chracters - a boy and an old man - in stark contrast to his first novel 'The Sun Also Rises'. Yet it represents the same themes that pervade his other novels - not belonging to society and trying to vindicate yourself by taking a challenging route.The novel discusses an old fisherman's struggle with a porpoise he sympathises with and how victory proves futile but does not break the old man's dreams.In this respect it is a philosophical reflection on the meaning, negation of meaning and search for new meaning in life."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea was a good book and it took place in a tropical island, which was Cuba. It had a good story line and interesting storyline but easy to follow if you paid close attention to what was going on with the old man. The book was about an old man and his problems in life. The sharks stood for the problem, the old man stood for the people, and the marlin stood for the goal in life but it was also about the old man catching a marlin on a little wooden boat with a hand line in the middle of the Caribbean Sea. I think it could have not had a better ending.I recommend that you read this book if you are interested in adventure and fishing. I give this book a 5 star rating"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This is one of Hemingway's best efforts, a short yet moving novel. It's the story of Santiago, an aged subsistence fisherman in Cuba around 1950. The old man plies his trade from a tiny boat, but hasn't caught a fish in months. His near-destitution forces him to lose the assistance of his devoted boy helper, so now he goes out alone. Sure enough, he hooks a giant marlin, one that pulls and fights and drags the old man out to sea. The old man professes love and respect for his catch, but remains determined to kill it. Of course, if he succeeds in that difficult physical struggle, he will need further effort to keep his catch away from sharks. Hemingway aptly describes the fears, hopes, and frustrations the old man feels as he struggles for days to land and bring home his prize catch in that tiny boat.This book led author Ernest Hemingway (1899-1961) to a Nobel Prize. The author uses crisp and readable prose, and avoids the too-lengthy descriptions that detract from some of his earlier work. This is a powerful story about physical and mental challenge, age, dreams and effort."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Slow.Slow.Slow.Enough saidI really wanted to burn Hemingway alive (but...that's out of the question)Plot was awfully developed."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the SeaThe Old Man and the Sea was uneventful and dull. Reason being when there is only one event throughout the entire book, the book becomes uneventful. He did a great job with details, but it was redundant in most areas. The Old Man and the Sea was the most boring book I've ever read.Throughout the story, Santiago becomes a very lonely man. For example, he is constantly talking about how he misses the boy and wishes he was there. The boy is his only true friend and because of this, he is lonely without him. Santiago would probably be a normal guy if the boy was there. Also, Santiago talks to the animals around him. Talking to animals helps keep him occupied and not so lonely. Plus, he never has to argue with them because he knows he will be right. Believe it or not, that's only part of the boringness.All the story talks about is how Santiago doesn't catch his fish. Between ten pages after the story begins and up until ten pages before the ending, all the story talks about is how Santiago doesn't catch his fish. That's the biggest waste of 127 pages in the entire universe. If there were more characters, maybe it would have kept my attention. The only other character is Manolin, a young boy. He also has no friends other than Santiago. This is because he is a little nerd. Next time this book comes up in discussion, I'm leaving the room.The old man and the sea was the worst book I've ever read. It was dull which made it seem very long and drawn out. It talks the whole time about Santiago's loneliness and his crazed fishing incidents. I do not suggest reading this book to anyone. It was a waste of the honorable Pulitzer Prize."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This &quot;novel&quot; was the worst &quot;piece of literature&quot; I have ever read. If you can spare yourself from the agony of reading a hundred or so pages about an old man and a fish, than do so. This book brought the worst period of my life to a dramatic climax. I was more miserable reading this book than when my wife divorced me and my parents disowned me. I now have no one but at least I don't have to read this book anymore. Thank you god."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This was the most boring and pointless book I had ever read. I was forced to read it for English class a year back. The book has no point except that humans keep fighting no matter what. The old man is catching a fish for about 80 of the 127 pages. It's a very bad book that shouldn't have ever been published. I've never read any of Hemingway's other stuff and am not going to any time soon because of the lasting effect of this book."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"One of the greatest books of all time? I think not! Although a couple nearly interesting things happened, through out the majority of the book there was nothing to keep my attention. Had I slept through the reading, I wouldn't have missed a thing. I wouldn't recommend this book unless you lack a personality completely.Every single aspect of the plot was stale. After all, only two exciting things happened. Even in those \\"action\\" scenes nothing really caught any attention. The setting didn't even change except at the very beginning and the very end. Beyond that, the very few characters didn't even do much. His actions only portray certain aspects, leaving much of his personality blank, and making him shallow and predictable. That's just why it was boring on it's own.It was also boring because it didn't relate to the experiences of many readers. After all, how many people have gone marlin fishing? Very few to be sure. The size, style, characters, and plot of the book seem simplistic and geared towards a younger audience. The actions, though, are the things that adults would be the only, if them, group interested in. Yet The Old Man was the only developed character. He was very hard to relate to and seemed to make nonsense decisions. The Old Man was so simple, he seemed to fake to care for. When a novel is hard to relate to, it's hard to get into also.With so many things wrong with the book, I never cease to be amazed by people enjoying this book. Nothing changes, very little happens, and it's more of a folk tale then novel. I would never recommend this book for anyone!"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"A joke. That's what I think about The Old Man and the Sea getting a Pulitzer Prize. I can not comprehend what the Pulitzer Committee was thinking when they gave this book a prize. The Old Man and the Sea is a redundant book full of hum drum that is not worth 127 pages of anyone's time.This book did not deserve a Pulitzer Prize for the book lacked excitement and plot. For example, Santiago does a ton of work and does not succeed. The Climax of this book is a major let down which makes the reader regret reading it in the first place. Since the climax is poor that also forces the plot of the story to go downhill. Another example is that this book was written at a low reading level. This is a big part of why I can't see why this book got one of the highest awards in history. Sure the book probably got the prize for the theme or the symbolizing the author put in it, but these are not very strong in my opinion. Any younger kid could have written a book like this. The Old Man and the Sea is not worthy of its award.Repetitiveness makes a book extremely... For example, Santiago always says \\"I wish the boy were here\\" (48, 50, 51, 56). By saying this over and over this book gets old. Half of this book is unnecessary because it is so repetitive. Another example is; he often says that he \\"must eat the tuna in the morning\\" (57, 58, 59). This happens several times in the book and the book becomes tremendously dull. Tediousness makes any piece of writing uninteresting. And this book is exceptionally uninteresting and tedious. All together this book is quite redundant.I did not find this book entertaining, pleasurable, or enjoyable. This book definitely did not deserve any prizes at all. All in all, The Old Man and the Sea is a redundant book full of hum drum that is not worth 127 pages of anyone's time."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old man and the Sea is a story about a lonely unlucky old man who never loses his faith even thought he has not caught a fish in over 80 days. Even thought his fishing partner, Manolin, was ordered by his parents to leave the old man, Santiago Still continues to fish. And then one day while he is out fishing the amazing happens, he catches that one dream fish. The Old man and the Sea does not deserve the praise and adoration it gets. This book deserves to be cast adrift from the landmass of literary works.The Plot of this story is slow and dull with little action. In this book action is like a slug slowly climbing up a steep hill, it takes for ever and ever to get to the top. For Instance, when action comes it drags on and on. Action in this book is like running backwards; it takes forever to get anywhere..."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea, by Ernest Hemmingway is it a captivating and relentless story? Or is it an uneventful, praise-seeking, fishing tale? Santiago, the protagonist of the book, is an old, unlucky fisherman. After 84 days without catching a fish, he goes farther out to sea than ever before. He then catches a marlin as large as his skiff. Exciting, isn't it? Not particularly. The Old Man and the Sea is a boring and difficult book to get through.The lack of events is capable of putting the reader to sleep. For example, the most exciting event was when Santiago caught the fish. This book is mostly a hundred pages of an insane man's dull thoughts. When something actually happens, the moment is short-lived. In addition to having only one \\"thrilling\\" event, the book has repetitive and mind numbingly pointless dialogue. Santiago often talks to himself, like when his hand cramped he said, \\"Come on hand. Please come on.\\" (62) He also talks to the fish, trying to tell it what to do. \\"...I'll let him eat it well... Eat it well.\\" (44) One or two events and boring dialogue leads the readers to dreamland.This tiresome reading seems to be fishing for compliments. Hemingway tries to make the reader feel pity for the old man. For instance, Santiago puts himself through so much pain. It is his own stubborn attitude that causes his agony. In addition to putting himself through pain, he is very tired, weather-beaten and sore. He is old and cannot handle this \\"feat\\". He has been out to sea for a few long and uneventful days. Is the wear and tear worth the pity?The Old Man and the Sea is a bad book to read due to being a dull-as-dirt book begging for compliments. It took a lot to keep reading and finish it. It is short and simple, but so incredibly uninteresting. My suggestion is to just keep reading Harry Potter."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This book, Old Man and the Sea, is so immensely unbelievable it isn't even funny. Exhibit A: it says in the book that the marlin was longer than the skiff. Come on, sometimes it takes 2 people to handle a good size shark. On another note, how is it possible for a single old man to hold onto fish that size for that duration of time?Then there are many paragraphs were he goes on and on about how he is sorry for hooking the fish. If you are that sorry for hooking that fish let the thing go. I mean, if you are that torn up about it, then better you live and let it go than get killed adn catch the biggest fish ever.I mean thats just my opinion. Well thanks for reading my review. Many of Hemmingway's other works are good. Thank you."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"How can a book with excellent characterization be an uninteresting novel with no realistic thoughts or adventures? The author does not clearly explain mandatory parts in the book that are truly needed to make the book a success. I would not recommend this book to anyone that wants to read an exciting and realistic book that is very descriptive and relays the thoughts of the protagonist.The main character in this novel is not exposed to a consistent amount of realistic conditions or events that would in reality take place. For instance, the protagonist goes out and is pulled around by a fish for four days. Santiago should go out and take control of the fish, so he can go home and be rewarded for his great catch. Santiago does not show that he deserves the fish. He should be strong and wise about his actions. Furthermore, Santiago goes out unprepared, with just his boat, not expecting anything. Santiago does not sleep for hours, thus causing severe exhaustion, which lowers the overall possibility of catching the fish. When Santiago's hand cramps, the only thing he does is talk to it, and he does not try reviving it by other conventional methods. The problems that persist and the treacheries that he overcomes does not allow an overall clear understanding of the plot, theme, or other critical elements that arise in the conflict of the story.This book does not reflect the author's overall knowledge about the subject of this novel. Truly, Santiago goes out and catches a fish that he then follows through the water. The very large fish does not allow more action to enter the story. The author does not reflect the major thoughts or actions put our by the protagonist (Santiago) which makes the story dull and uninteresting. Likewise, the characters do not add much action to the story. The protagonist does not have any extremely exciting experiences or battles that could twist the ending, and thus the plot is very predictable. The parts in this story that are not extremely boring do not add up to much, because the author does not use many metaphors to relate the story to any actual experiences. The plot and characters make the story dull because they do not add any suspense to the story.This book should not be read by anyone. This truly shows Hemmingway's weakness as a writer. The protagonist does not prove to have any common sense at all and he may be going insane. This book proved to be an overall failure because it did not add up to my expectations as a reader."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Look--I don't really like Hemingway's style. I've read two of his books and a few of the stories, so I'm no expert, but from what I've seen, his sentence structure and diction is at a junior high school level for the most part. That's not my criticism, really, it's just his style. For his works to be worthwhile to read, then, there must be much more to the stories than the words themselves. The Sun Also Rises has more. The Old Man and the Sea does not, as far as I can tell. It is simple, but simplicity does not equal genius. Yes, of course, there is symbolism, but it is completely obvious and heavy-handed. This book is a nice parable, I guess, but it doesn't deserve the praise it's been given as one of the greatest books ever. There's just not enough substance to it."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This is the first Hemingway I've read and I have to say that I was disapointed. I did like the scenes with the boy and the old man but that was about it! But when he is at sea for five days I got tired of reading it and wanted to stop the book. As one reviewer said, &quot;The story line was dragged on...&quot;. That sums up exactly how I felt about the book. When I learned it won a Pulizer I was even more surpirsed. When I talked to other people they felt that he deserved a Pulizer for his other books and maybe they just gave him the Prize because they felt they needed to. I'm not sure and I'm probably wrong. To me, it seems that you either loved it, or hated it. I've talked to people who think this is the best book ever and I've talk to people who didn't like it at all."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Philip Pullman, my favorite author, once said that a lot of novels get so wrapped up in showing off beautiful writing that there's no story, and the story really should be the most important thing. I agree with him. This book seems like just an excuse for the author to explain his view of the world, and life, &amp;c, &amp;c., and the author forgets to put an interesting story in it. Luckily it doesn't get too boring because it's short. I also hate fishing, and I hated the author's writing style, which sounds like it's trying so hard to be simple and profound. The author also sounds snobbish and superior at times, and at other times like he's trying to show you, look at this character I've created, isn't he wonderful. For a novel with deep things to say and beautiful writing AND a great story, try Philip Pullman's The Golden Compass."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This was an extremely boring book to me. I had to read it for school in 8th grade,and I almost fell asleep reading it. I think a big part of it was that as an 8th grader i didnt understand a lot of the hidden meanings of the book. I didnt like it also because it was very slow going and the end is a dissapointment to me. Also, none of my friends liked it either"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"After reading the old man and the sea, I found myself wondering what exactly Hemingway was trying to do. At first I found it extremely hard to actually get into the book. I mean how much can you say about a fishing trip the last 84 days with no luck. I did find that i sympothized with Santiago, especially when Manolin's parents force him to leave Santiago's boat. I feel that there wasnt enough action in this book to keep my interest going. Hemingway goes into such great detail in all that he says, that i find that it gets boring. Once I had finally gotten to the 85th day of Santiago's unlucky streak, I found that I was rooting so much for him the whole time. I was much more intrigued once he caught hold of that big marlin. I continued to read because I was afraid that he would give up after all that he went through. I fell that the most exciting part is when the sharks lured by the blood of the marlin. I felt bad that Santiago didnt get to enjoy his fish, although by this point Santiago has grown so much I dont think he minds. I enjoyed how he finally did something for himself instead of trying to impress others. I enjoyed the end of the book when Manolin and Santiago see eachother once again. The end of this book gets much better, but i found it didnt compensate for the rest of the book. I would not recomend this book to anyone who seeks action thrillers."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This is a book of great descriptions and great symbolism. It's great to write a book report on but if you're not a Hemingway fan you probably won't enjoy it. It's a good book to see if you like Hemingway or not but not a great book otherwise. Must read for Hemingway fans, read it once just so you're familiar with it otherwise."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This book is the most likely of Hemingway's works to be loved in the future. Why? Because it is a classic. Why is it a classic? Because of two reasons, pertaining to content and style. In the content, the message is universal and eternal. In the style, the writing is self-contained but evocative and brilliant. Excess is entirely absent from Hemingway's craftmanship here.Santiago is an old fisherman from Cuba, a lover of baseball and contact with the sea. His life has been rather sad, lonely and lacking in material well-being. But, and this is what makes the book unforgettable, he is a MAN. Not just a brawling macho, like Hemingway himself, but a MAN in the best sense of the word. Although nobody will be witness of his prowess, he accomplishes it nonetheless. He is not abjectly trying to become a celebrity, like many people nowadays. Fishing the marlin, and carrying it home against Fate incarnated in a school of sharks, is not a matter of spotlights, but of dignity, of true love for oneself instead of plain vanity. And so, dignity is the name of the game. He is not like Hemigway, who got utterly stressed at having to go on with his fake image and so gave up and killed himself. Santiago would never kill himself: he fights on. Dignity is deep inside of him, in his consciousness of what he is worth, even if he remains a lonely old man scratching survival day after day. This is then a great book because it pairs the relevance of the story with the excellence of the writing. One last note: Hemingway is not very much liked these days, and for good reasons. But at least he could write this. Not many of us have done so and I guess it proves he was an extermely complex man, and not just a macho type."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"My fianc&eacute;e hated this book; she told me it nothing but fish and machismo - futility personified as a short novel. After absorbing the story, I cannot agree with her. While it may appear to be nothing but a fight between an old man and a big fish, it is more. It is struggle. It is pain and perseverance. It is the acknowledgment that sometimes defeats look like victories, and victories defeats.That being said, I can now also say that I am not a fan of Hemingway's choppy writing, his overly overt masculinity, or his cavalier attitudes towards death and pain.

If you want a good Hemingway read, I recommend A Farewell to Arms. That is a great story."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea is a classic literary work. Hemingway was at his shining best when he wrote about the fearless old man, Santiago, and the epic personal battle with a hooked marlin. Here, unlike in Melville's Moby Dick, Hemingway's main character is both at odds with himself while seemingly being at peace with the natural world. Many time he describes the marlin as his &quot;brother.&quot; Hemingway is also a master of unconcious symbolic gestures. Many times the old man describes his wish for a young man to help him with the tasks aboard his small skiff. There is a young male character who had fished the ocean prior to the start of the text with Santiago, but if the reader has read such books as Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises and Farewell to Arms one would interprate this as another one of Hemingway's symbolic loopholes that leads us to a further understanding of the intristic nature of Santiago. In simple terms, The Old Man in the Sea examines the search for youth through the experiences of an old Cuban fisherman who examines his life while praising DiMaggio and cursing his lack of strength. But, all the while, never losing his confidence and spirit. A beautiful story."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea is a story about an old man named Santiago and his love for the sea.

Maybe I'll like it better when I am older."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"To put it bluntly and honest I found &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; incredibly boring. It's surprising that a short story could have such descriptive, drawn out parts. This is why the story lacked interest for me, the descriptive words took up most of the book not leaving much of a story line. Another factor for the dislike is that it's all about fishing, and since I don't like fishing the dislike is obvious. Many people say you have a look beyond the fishing for the symbolism, but considering I couldn't get into the story and that I have a very literal mind I didn't see any of that. I'm sure it was a well-written piece for those who can enjoy that sort of thing, but it wasn't my cup of tea."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"A quick comment on the amazonian editorial review, above, which states that the old man is \\"triumphant as the other fishermen marvel at the size of the skeleton.\\" Perhaps this reviewer read a different book ... there is absolutely no \\"triumph\\" or any other strain of hubris in the old man's character. Only a strong resolve and bucketloads of humility. The old man is not even around when the fishermen and tourists are \\"marvelling\\" - he's in his shack, in bed, recuperating. Maybe this reviewer never even read the book. Just up to the bit where it starts to get boring, after the old man actually hooks the fish, and then figured on a good Hollywood ending. Fair enough. Actually reading a book is a hindrance to writing a good review. Check out my only other amazonian review, on &quot;Recollections of a Bleeding Heart&quot; and see what I mean. Never even read it. Good review though, don't you think? Sure, no one has yet voted that they found my review useful. I would be very hurt if anyone did. Bleeding utilitarians. If you want to read something useful, read the instruction manual for your dvd player or something. Don't waste your valuable - sorry, useful - time reading reviews by mark coddington.But I did actually read Hemingway's novella. Sort of felt obliged. You know, when books start to reproach you each time you glance at them? I've got a 614 page biography of Arthur Miller on the bookshelf in front of me, with Arthur's face on the spine looking at me through those crazy black minimalist glasses (they never really caught on, did they?) and he knows (he knows!) that I'm never going get around to reading Timebends in this lifetime. And he's mocking me!So, this old guy hasn't caught a fish for yonks. Everyone thinks he's no good, except the boy. One day he goes out deep, hooks himself one big effoff fish. Too big to fit in the boat, he straps it alongside and by the time he brings it in, sharks have picked it clean.I mean, there you have it. Its not about spoils going to the victor. Its not about overcoming great challenges against all odds, then rubbing your detractors' noses in it. Just because The Old Man and the Sea is written by an American, doesn't mean it's about winning.The book's 127 pages long. After the old man hooks the fish, he takes 83 pages to bring the creature in. 83 pages! Of Hemingway's unrelenting and unembellished prose. Think of the most uncomfortable chair you've ever sat on. Now pick a number between one and ten. Imagine sitting on that chair for that many hours. It will start to give you some idea of what reading this book is like, particularly if you are an empathetic type like me. The cuts on the old man's hands from the line - ow! Now, multiply this number of hours by nine. If you get a two-digit number, add those numbers together, otherwise stick with what you got. Now subtract five. Just do it! (Oops, I think I've broken copyright laws. Ignore that last sentence). Next, count along that number of letters in the alphabet and think of a country starting with the letter you came to. Take the second letter of that country's name and think of the first animal that comes into your head. Got it? Now when you've finished reading this review, I'll tell you what animal that was. (And I'll bet you right now that you didn't think of a fish or an old man.) Okay, do we have a deal? But I digress. The idea of the animal kingdom provides one key to understanding this tale. Firstly, the old man constantly dreams of lions on the beach in Africa. Why? What do lions represent? I do not profess to be proficient in, or interested in, psychoanalytic approaches to literature. But the lions must represent something important to the old man, or why would Hemingway waste his valuable - sorry, useful - time by writing about it? Secondly, the old man (his name is Santiago, by the way, but is seldom referred to as anything other than \\"he\\" or \\"the old man\\", so I'll follow Ernest's lead) continually refers to the fish he has hooked as his \\"brother\\". During the old man's three day fishing marathon, he eats raw fish, as he has no other sustenance, which further emphasizes this \\"brotherhood\\". Hemingway is asking, where does man stand in relation to the animal? Then he goes a long way toward answering it: \\"I am only better than him though trickery and he meant me no harm.\\" And: \\"But I was more intelligent than he was. Perhaps not, he thought. Perhaps I was only better armed.\\"The old man is alone, locked in a battle with both himself and the fish. Yet he identifies with the fish; he feels sorry for it: \\"I wish it were a dream and that I had never hooked him. I'm sorry about it, fish.\\" The fish's name is Alberto, but is only ever referred to as \\"fish\\" by Hemingway. In a struggle to come to terms with his own life and imminent death, the old man talks aloud to himself, asking questions both simple and profound. Death is a central motif in The Old Man and theSea, but not one I'm much interested in.Perhaps looking for motifs, and pondering their significance, is to read too much into a book. Maybe this one is just a story about a guy who catches a fish, a short parable about the food chain. Now there's an interesting question. Do Jehovah's Witnesses read all books in their literal sense, or only the Bible? Hmm. Furthermore, are there any good customer reviews of the Bible on Amazon? I'm off to have a look. Oh - before I go, I must keep my part of the deal. Was it an elephant?"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This is a strange monologue about an old man &amp; a fish. The old man Santiago is down on his luck, having endured 85 days, without a catch. He believed that his luck will turn and continued going to sea. Indeed, his luck turned put for the better and he caught a huge Marlin, which he battles with care and respect. Finally after 3 days of struggle, he lands the Marlin with a sense of profound victory.However, on the journey back to the port, the dead Marlin was attacked and devoured by several schools of sharks, leaving a skeleton of the magnificent fish. The old man went to bed tired but without much despair.So what was the moral of the story? Your luck will turn out better if you are patient, but regardless of your attempt, you cannot avoid fate.Did I read that Hemmingway won a Nobel Literature prize on the strength of this novel? In my opinion, it was undeserving. But it was a good attempt."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This book is about a man who lived all of his life on the sea as a fisherman. He was an old man who fished alone in a skiff in the gulf stream.He had gone 84 days with out catching a fish.He went out to sea one day and cought the bigest fish which was 18 feet from nose to tail He stayed 2 days and two nights in the sea fighting the bigfish no food he would catch fish and eat them raw no salt."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Man, versus a fish;one will win, and one will lose.Still not sure who won."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"\\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" by Ernest HemingwaySantiago, an old man who has made his living fishing from an old skiff far out in the Gulf Stream has run into some bad luck of late. It has been many days since he has caught anything. Even the boy who had been helping him has been ordered by his father to work on another luckier boat. This isn't new to Santiago as he had previously gone 87 days without fish and caught plenty for many days to follow. Maybe his luck is about to turn again...It would appear that for those who found great joy in \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" found it in its allegorical aspect and the attempt by Hemingway to demonstrate a struggle of then modern man of biblical proportions. The actual story in and of itself is very simple as it relays the tale of an old man fighting the fish of his life after a long spell of bad luck.The Good: In no way am I trying to discredit Mr. Hemmingway or \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" or the merit of this book as a literary gem. Reading for me (for the most part) is about being entertained or connecting to the material in some way. I found this story to be a plodding story about a man trying to reel in a fish. I of course realize that the attempt was to demonstrate the struggle etc but as a story the book just didn't reel me in (pardon the pun).The Bad: At the opposite end of the spectrum I didn't find \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" to be a terrible read either. I just wasn't grabbed and pulled in either direction.Overall: While I feel no more than luke warm about \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" I think you should try it for yourself and see what you think. It is considered to be a literary master piece and is only slightly over 100 pages either way so it isn't a story that will demand hours of your time to complete."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Ok so in all fairness I am 25 now and I read this in high school at 18, but I detested it so much that I still wont read any of Hemingway's work. It droned on and on and I just couldnt relate, maybe now it would be different but I wont be finding out."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Great storytelling cannot be denied Hemingway. But what does the author want to tell us? What does he want to give us? Can it be validated as good or rather not valuable? It is a work of Nihilism though Hemingway\`s life maxim, which he revealed as his personal life\`s lie in the end of his life, to \\"never give up!\\" is opposing to this. The old man\`s battle for victory with the fish serves nothing even if the fight were not already the way which to go makes a sense of life. Hemingway negates this. With his suicide he devaluates his works or makes them more believable? Can somebody attribute meaning to meaninglessness? If Hemingway is right and life is meaningless, then also his works are meaningless.What should we have to believe? That life, how Hemingway thought, is senseless? For what then never give up? \\"One can be destroyed but one may never give up!\\" he lets his heroes say, who die or fail in the end nevertheless. And he himself does the same. That \\"never give up!\\" makes only sense, when it has a basis that is outside of oneself. The author never saw it that way. No matter where he turned to there was nothing to be hoped for. His works are covered by a thick layer of desperation and sinister melancholy. And beneath there is also no hope. One of his heroes says: \\"a dark way to Nowhere, which leads to Nowhere and again to Nowhere and again..\\"In \\"The old man and the Sea\\" Hemingway strikes a balance. Much tested, nothing won in the end. He regards his life like the old man who fights in solicitude with the fish on the Sea You think, you have something with the fishing rod in life yet in the end there is nothing left. The fight ends with the inescapable defeat, for the fish is caught but torn to pieces by sharks. \\"You are tired old friend!\\" he says. In this the perception of the futility of his acts is expressed. The fisher could hang the skeleton at the house front or feast over his triumph of the proper catch, but this also would be futile. Hemingway did not find any meaning there where he was looking for in his life. To search further he did not want.In his Nobel prize speech Hemingway said, that every writer of importance should have to deal with the eternity or the missing of it. But what is eternal in this world? What his father a Methodist church principal connected with eternity he rejected. Maybe because of that \\"The old man and the Sea\\" has no happy ending. And the end of Hemingway is perhaps also only a seeming end!"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"For barely 100 pages long, this thing that enjoyed worldwide claim is hardly a page-turner. It is so dry and uninteresting, full of repetation, boring description. The author does lack of the ability of using dialogue to tell a story. The dialogue or monologue is, at best, pretty weak. The book is certainly over-rated. The reason that it won the Nobel Literature Prize is what it claimed politically."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Although I did find the \\"waiting for interesting things to happen\\" bit of this read to be tedious, I think that is what Hemingway was trying to portray...how much patience and tedium a fisherman must endure just for those brief moments of excitement when he \\"outwits\\" a fish. The sad irony of course is that he himself is then easily outwitted by the sharks. It is depressing how all our hard work and accomplishment can be so quickly eaten away by theives. I agree that the reading was mediocre."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"A Boring BookErnest Hemmingway has a very unique writing style. He has bland word choice and his stories move slowly, it almost seems like he is trying to make the reader fall asleep. These descriptions of his writing are shown quite a bit in The Old Man and The Sea. The Old Man and The Sea is a boring book!Bland word choice fills the pages of The Old Man and The Sea. For example, \\"Eat them good now and then there is the tuna.\\" Hemmingway lacks the words to catch the reader's attention. This causes the reader to get tired of the story and drift into other thoughts. For instance, \\"But I will kill you dead before this day ends.\\" That sentence is filled with clutter. Hemmingway made that sentence complicated. Simplifying the sentence would make it easier to understand. If Hemmingway used less clutter in the book the number of pages would be cut in half.The Old Man and The Sea is a highly predictable book. The Old Man and The Sea lets the reader always see what is going to happen next in the book. In addition, \\"The shark was not an accident.\\" Throughout the entire story the readers have a sense that what is happening to Santiago is too good to be true. Don't watch the biography of Ernest Hemmingway before reading The Old Man and The Sea. The show gives away the ending of the story. That is no loss because there was no suspense in the book anyway. When you already know the ending of a story it ruins the rest of the book.To sum it all up, \\"The old Man was dreaming about the lions.\\" The ending was the same as what happened early in the book. Hemmingway's writing style in The Old Man and The Sea was very predictable and contained bland word choice and clutter. The Old Man and The Sea was a very boring book!"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I found this novel exceptionally detailed. The author let you get to know Santiago without writing a complete biography. I especially liked the fact that Hemingway gave a little information about Santiago's previous adventures. The conflict with the sea was a popular subject in the years previous to the writing of this novel. Yet Hemingway introduced his readers to a new side of the sea. Santiago saw the sea as a friend that harbored a brother. The sea gave people food, and was a very peaceful place. This is totally opposite to the sea in Mellville's Moby Dick. Personally I would recomend this book for anyone to read on a rainy day."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This is a classic work of literature. The Old Man and the Sea was an enjoyable reading experience, because it shows the indomitable will of a determined man. The man I am talking about is Santiago, who goes through many trials and tribulations while trying to catch the fish. The Old Man and the Sea is full of symbolism. Hemingway once said, &quot;The old man is the old man, the boy is the boy, the sea is a sea, the fish is the fish, the sharks are like all other sharks no better or no worse, and the rest of the is what you get out of it.&quot; but I believe he was kidding because you can't read this book and not find any symbolism. An example of this is the fish. I believe the fish represents what all of mankind strives for but few will reach, which is greatness. Santiago reaches greatness when he defeats the fish and beats the sea. Santiago and his struggle with the fish taught me a lesson about life. It taught me that anyone can do anything, but there is always a price to pay. Santiago's price was his health and time, but to him it was worth it. He got his prize, he got what he wanted, and was happy about it. I admire that."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Once started, unputdownable.

Look, Ernest Hemingway has a different style of writing. His style is unusual, but unique and refreshing...like a breath of fresh air. He writes simply, though he doesn't always get to the point straight off. It was relaxing to read this book - there aren't any confusing sub-plots - there's also hardly any dialogue. If you want to read a classic, this is the one. The Old Man and The Sea is easy to understand and you can read it in a couple hours. There's also a soul to this novel hidden between the lines and an aura that lingers after you finish it - for me, in any case. There's as much symbolism as you want - or as little. One message of warning: You'll either love the novel, or you'll hate it - I'm sure there are a few exceptions - including myself. I thought it was good and somewhat insightful, no more."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This book was so intense I was exhausted when I finished it but at the same time exhilarated by it's triumphant ending.

I was always trying to think what was going to happen next. Most of the time it had me wanting to now what was going to happen. When he caught the fish I thought he was going to get the fish on the boat easily. I don't think I would try that hard to caught the fish. When he describ the fish it drew a every vivid picture in my head. I didn't think he was going to live. When he finly caught the fish I thought he was going to make it back. I think for how old he was he strong to caught large fish and not be dragged in.Seth Hahlen"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"A great book but one that takes a lot of thought.

Most of Hmeingway's books are &quot;macho&quot; and kind of get boring with all the blood , gore, and masculinity. This story was different. Although it has aspects of adventure, it really was more a story of overcoming odds, and doing something you set out to do. At the end, even though his fish gets eaten by sharks, he at least knows that he did it, and could do it again. I wonder if the lions he dreams about stand for his hopes and dreams. At the end, he still dreams about the lions. He hasn't given up hope.

Thirty years ago it was a fishing tale. Today it is a moving parable of human existence."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This book proves Hemingway to be not only one of the greatest novelists of the past century, but also one of the greatest philosophers. This is the capstone to his brilliant career. Besides being eloquently written in Hemingway's concise, true sentences, it is the embodyment of a lifetime of thought on the human existance. Please do not attempt to read this work if you are a simple-minded person who is too afraid to pull your head out of the sand and examine the nature of the human experience. If you do, you will probably end up saying absurd things such as, &quot;I thought it was boring. It was all about fishing.&quot; It would truly hurt me personaly to see such a waste of a cultural treasure on such a mindless individual."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I read this book in two days, it blew me away. The barren language, the lack of detail. Descriptions only go as far as colors and rarely a metaphor. What Hemmingway achieves by this technique, is by using such limited language, there is more room for the core of the story to be exposed, which is, this old mans love for the sea and fish. The old man constanly refers to great baseball player Joe DiMaggio as, The Great DiMaggio. When in actuality, what this man achieves with courage and love is bigger and greater than any baseball player's heroics. This book is a classic."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea may be one of the best all time classical novels I have ever read. Set in the Gulf Stream, Ernest Hemingway thrillingly puts the Old Man to a fierce clashing struggle between him, the Marlin and his own will. A will that Hemingway amplifies as the Old Man's determination to survive on the sea and prove to himself that he is still not too old to catch a fish. Hemingway's detail description of the Old Man's skirmishing fight with the Marlin on the sea will make you screaming with sweat. The Old Man has gone for eighty-four days without catching a fish so a little boy which follows him on every fishing attempt has been taken away by the his parents, how sad. After moments of tears, the climax part comes in where the Old Man wants to especially catch a fish for the boy and proves to the boy's parents that he still has the ability to catch even a Marlin, of course which he does. I like Hemingway's style of language which is very easy to follow, but also maintain a level of depth in the meaning. For those fishing lovers out there, this novel is perfect for your taste. Overall, this is a worthwhile book to read so I extremely recommend it."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"does reading novels bore you? would you rather &quot;wait for the movie?&quot; well, if you've heard good things about &quot;the old man and the sea,&quot; but have never had the focus to read it, then you're in luck: it's in a slightly modernized film version now, and it's called &quot;city of angels,&quot; starring meg ryan and nicholas cage. crushingly tragic story lines will always have a place in our hearts. enjoy this fine novel."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I don't usually read much but I read this book really fast.

It's bad that I did it but how could one stop reading when one's heart is captured the first instance one lay one's eyes on the first sentence of the book? Pausing will only result in breaking the feel the book gives me and to continue later will not give me back the same feeling. I know that.This book is about an old Cuban fisherman, yes. But to me it is much more than that. It's about how one struggles in life just to live and also at the same time how one could appreciate what one has and treasure the pleasures that one is lucky to be bestowed from time to time. It's also about determination and perseverance, of how one should never let go without a good fight. For those who has been a warrior, this book will ring deep in the heart.The prose that Hemingway employ is extremely simple yet beautiful. Conveying beautiful messages in simple sentences is not easy but in this little novella, one can see ample demonstration on how a master of prose employs it so elegantly. Read it and feel good about it. If you're as unlucky as the old man one day, this book will surely be your best companion as it is as real and as good as it can get."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I, like many, have laboured my way through a number of books that are hailed as modern classics and have been left wondering why they are acclaimed as such. Therefore, it was with some degree of trepidation that I began reading the tale of Santiago, the ancient Cuban fisherman. Do not be put off by critics eager to impress upon you how they grappled with the religious symbolism and spiritual undercurrent. Instead Hemingway's crisp, clear style will have you loosening your collar as you bake in the hot sun on the Old Man's boat. In this slim volume you share in Santiago's recollections, friendships, joys and his frustration. Despite the brevity of this book, it is a must for anyone who wishes to enjoy one of the ultimate displays of power through the written word."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea is one of my all-time favorites. I love the contrast between the simplistic writing style and the deep message that Hemingway sends. I believe The Old Man and the Sea is about much more than an old man and his fishing tale. The Old Man and the Sea is a story about life and the victories and struggles it entails. Around the bend, after every defeat is a victory waiting to be tasted, and then another defeat will follow, and so on and so forth - the story of life. I first read this book over three years ago and I still find my mind wondering back to it every now and then. When I am faced with challenges and struggles, I think back to The Old Man, and I am reminded -- it is life."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This is a slim book full of moves that hit you without your lifting a hand to defend yourself.The old man goes out to sea, catches the biggest fish out there, and brings it back lashed to the side of his boat.

We have all been there.We have each of us chased and caught the thing we were chasing.Keeping the damn thing is another story: your new staff has loyalties to the boss you just replaced; the computer crashes; the SUV takes so much money to keep; and the house needs maintence. Little by little, the sharks start nibbling at your prize.Only the heroes rest. The sharks stay away from heroes. The sharks just circle the hero at a safe distance.This book is not a story about a fish. The book is really about the fighter, who moves and feints then jabs at the sharks closing in on him.After you have read this little book, forget about the fish. The fish is gone. They ate it. Just think of all the other things the book is really about."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Reading once again 'Old Man And The Sea' by Ernest Hemingway was simply a joyful reading experience that will stay with me for a very long time. The writing is eloquent yet raw. The reader experience humble yet filled with sheer power. The connectivity is filled with singularity yet there is a sense of one with the universe.There is of course so much that has been written and said about 'Old Man And The Sea' that I will not write a commentary about this marvelous book's movement; however, what I will say is this: there are books that are indeed worth returning to since they have a timelessness to the story, and, as the reader's own life experience grows, so too does the appreciation and understandings of the written story. In this compelling book, I have found that the meaning of this story so powerful and connected to my soul in few ways a book ever has.Do yourself a favor, go pick up 'Old Man And The Sea' and enjoy yourself. Though you may be holding a paperbook in your hand, you may soon come to realize your actually holding a mirrow, and you're peering into your own life."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Santiago, a fisherman, has gone 85 days without catching anything, not even a tadpole. But he knows that his luck is about to change. For last time, he went for 87 days without catching a single thing, and came back with a huge fish. This time, he believes his luck will be the best ever. So, come early morning, before the sun has risen, Santiago hops aboard a tiny fishing boat with his supplies, and sets out towards the middle of the sea. He fishes for hours without even the tiniest bite, until he feels something. Not a small something, but a great, big, giant something, tugging on the end of his line. So begins the fight betwen the old man and the sea. Santiago spends all day and night trying to reel the fish in, to no avail. When the fish finally does calm down, the sharks begin surrounding him, and Santiago is forced to try and make his way back to shore, before they have the chance to grab him or his fish.As an avid reader, my mother thought I would be interested in trying Hemingway's THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA, so she bought it for me for Christmas. Until now, I didn't have time to read the short novella, but I am happy that I finally had the chance to do so, as I enjoyed Hemingway's lyrical writing very much. The characters found within the pages of THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA are enjoyable, and bring the story to life. Santiago is a brave old man, who is determined to battle the sea, in the hopes that he will have the strength to bring home one of the largest fish ever; while \\"the boy\\" is kind, and does anything in his power to make Santiago feel good about himself. Readers who enjoy novels/novellas that give you hope, and lift your spirits will be pleased with Hemingway's THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA.Erika SoroccoBook Review Columnist for The Community Bugle Newspaper"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"One receives so real and immediate a sense of the harrowing experiences detailed by Hemingway's &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; that upon finishing the book, it is as though the reader has been given not only a vivid picture of the waning life of an elderly, impoverished fisherman and his monumental struggle against the sea, but has for an hour lived that life and partaken of that terrible struggle. It is a story that evokes not only admiration for its author, but a great respect and compassion for its relentless protagonist."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and The Sea is the story of an old Cuban fisherman named Santiago. Santiago has been unsuccessful at fishing lately. The book talks about his recent struggles. I enjoyed the book very much. I liked the simple story. The book was extremely powerful. I would recommend this book to others, but it is not for everyone. If you like long, complicated, suspenseful novels, this book probably isn't for you.The book contains a lot of symbolism. I think anyone can learn something fro this book."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea is a classic literary work. Hemingway was at his shining best when he wrote about the fearless old man, Santiago, and the epic personal battle with a hooked marlin. Here, unlike in Melville's Moby Dick, Hemingway's main character is both at odds with himself while seemingly being at peace with the natural world. Many time he describes the marlin as his &quot;brother.&quot; Hemingway is also a master of unconcious symbolic gestures. Many times the old man describes his wish for a young man to help him with the tasks aboard his small skiff. There is a young male character who had fished the ocean prior to the start of the text with Santiago, but if the reader has read such books as Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises and Farewell to Arms one would interprate this as another one of Hemingway's symbolic loopholes that leads us to a further understanding of the intristic nature of Santiago. In simple terms, The Old Man in the Sea examines the search for youth through the experiences of an old Cuban fisherman who examines his life while praising DiMaggio and cursing his lack of strength. But, all the while, never losing his confidence and spirit. A beautiful story."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"It took me a few hours to finish. Who knew a great book could be written in so few pages?"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"As a reader of many books I would have to say this is one of my favorites. A very well written book that goes through a three day ordeal for a fisherman at sea. Truly the most incredible part of this book is just the word choice that keeps a reader interested in the story. Hemingway, one of the best writers of his time, describes the pain and sufferings of an old fisher man at sea in such an inspiring way just goes to show this mans true brilliance.Its not a book that goes on for hours and hours to describe something small or utterly useless. it's a book that flows from page to page and is very even in description. The way Hemingway uses only a few characters and of course the main character the old man (referred to only a few times by the name Santiago.) Helps him paint a mental picture in the readers mind, of what these people could of looked like.The story revolves around mostly the old man on the sea fishing, but prior to his fishing adventure, Hemingway explores the town which Santiago lives in. A poor Fishing town with a small population in a Spanish speaking country. By adding this part a reader can get a feel for what the life of a character is like before he/she is a quarter of the way into the book.There are a few issues with the book (hence the four out of five grade) which include how the book bounces around and can become a little choppy at times. Also, a reader may become distracted at times from lack of interest or lack of details. Thankfully the two issues just stated do pick them selves up eventually and the book continues rather smoothly."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea is a beautiful novella about desperation and realization. It's both wonderfully thrilling and touching, often at the same time.The old man is a very interesting character, albeit somewhat eccentric. His long thoughts and speeches to himself are quite captivating, as is his determined nature. Hemingway did an amazing job truly making me feel how the old man felt. When he finally got a hold of the marlin I felt complete joy; when the realization that he was beat sunk in I felt complete despair.In addition to the touching narrative, Hemingway also created a detailed account of a fisherman's life. He showed the harsh time at sea, constantly striving to survive and the demand to succeed. We are also shown the modest and simple life of a fisherman, from the scrimpy meals to the shabby housing.Overall, it was a good read. Although it may have gotten a little slow at times, I recommend you not get frustrated and just keep in mind that you will be rewarded heavily in the end with quite the affecting conclusion."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I got this book as a gift from my brother in law in San Fransisco Airport for my birthday.I did not read this book on flight 1. I usually doze off 2. The book seemed to be a like a trivial short story.After I got home after a gruelling 18 hour journey, I opened this book in the middle of the night while fighting jet lag and could not keep the book down for 4 hours. It is captivating and thoroughly enjoyable.The relationship between the old man and the boy is something which has been very well captured. End of the novel, I felt like I should read more of short stories. If you like this book, you will also like books by Ruskin Bond, RK Lakshman and RK Narayan"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Falling into the same category as 90% of the reviewers here, I was first exposed to this book in high school. Even back then (despite the fact that I was forced to read it), it made a huge impression upon me. Over the years, this initial impression has only increased. So much so, that this has become the only book that I read on a yearly basis (and I read a ton of books). The story never gets old. This really is Hemingway at the height of his powers. The prose is simple but very effective. The descriptions are intense and alive. And what appears as a simple story of a poor and unlucky fisherman and his struggle with a mighty fish, is actually a metaphor for the hopeful and hopeless aspects that life dishes out on a daily basis. Symbolism abounds in this book. You've got the classic man versus nature, man facing his own limitations, man being beaten by forces beyond his control right at the moment of his triumph, and, in the end, the regeneration of man's hope and determination... just to name a few. Some people have voiced displeasure because Santiago isn't victorious in the end. He goes through this massive ordeal but ends up with nothing to show for it, in their opinion. But I don't know if I agree with that because sometimes life is about the journey and not the result. Besides, I just get the strong feeling that once he recovers his strength, Santiago will be going back out onto the ocean, continuing to struggle against the odds, and ultimately, continuing to live. And that provides hope for all of us. Simply put, this book is easily my favorite and one of the best books in the history of literature."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"It is a story about a fisherman and his friend who haven't had much luck fishing; in fact they were unsuccessful for over 80 days. But through the determination of the fishers they finally find a Marlin and go on a wild goose chase across the ocean to find it. They overcome obstacles and develop a bond over the simple act of fishing. The men end up proving to other fellow fisherman what a little heart can do, and end up coming back with more than anyone expected. This book is a wonderful example of what you can do if you try and don't give up. Near the end of the book they endure an unfortunate problem. This problem ends up being much better than they expected and take advantage of the situation. When you read this book Ernest Hemingway has a way with words that sucks into the action with immense detail on even the smallest things. The book is separated into 5 \\"chapters\\" or \\"days\\" in this book each one is a section of their journey. It is neat how Ernest does this because it gives you an easy to follow timeline and fits right in with the atmosphere of the book. I think this is a great book that everyone should enjoy because it is mix of action, adventure and drama so it provides most people with a great tale. Even if you don't like the water or fishing, you should still pick up this book for an awesome adventure."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This book is about an old man an his adventures upon the deep blue sea. The old man is a fisherman who susposedly has a ton of bad luck. His name is Santiago and he is very nice to everyone. His luck is so bad too that he hasn't even caught a fish in over 80 days. It is very heart-grabbing then in this sense because you start to feel bad for this guy and you hope that his luck will change shortly and he is able to catch a fish that will make life a lot easier for him. There is also this child who is extremely fond of Santiago bacause of what he has done for him. Santiago taught the child everything that he knew about fishing and the child has used it ever since. It is sad though because the child is not allowed to fish with the old man because of his luck. The child wants to fish with him so much though but he can't because of his parents and also because of the old man. The old man will not let him go fishing with him though because of his parents wishes. I would recommend this to everybody though because of the intense action that happened in the book between the old man and the sea. In fact, the people who should read this first is fishermen who happen to be down on their luck and that need a pick up."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Hemingway has long-been identified as a remarkable writer, and \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" is one of his best. Only Hemingway can pit three main characters together (the fish, the old man and the sea) and create a tale that is so intriguing it will keep you turning the pages until the very end.\\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" is a tale that shows the battle between a man and nature and the friendship between a small boy and an old man.Hemingway creates a story that does not fit within the boundaries of regular stories: the characters have no names, the descriptions and scene changes are very limited and it does not have a victorious ending and yet Hemingway weaves a tale that has stood the tests of time. Reader's will feel the old man's pain, joys, fatigue and despair."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This is a beautiful little book. It is my first taste of Hemingway and was a pleasing surprise. It is the simple story of an 85 year old fisherman. He has lost his luck, his young helper and his respect. He goes out to sea, alone, and encounters a huge Marlin. The rest of the story is about what happens. The language is economical and clear. The developing relationship between the old man and the great fish is gripping. The ending sends shivers down the spine.It has been said that Ernest Hemingway is at his best with short stories. This is more of a novella but a great example of concise writing. I would not normally be drawn to a story about a man and a fish but am so glad that I did not miss this one."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This is a book that not everybody will like. It is extremely slow, and it is kind of uneventful, but thats like saying \\"amazon is a site\\" Yes, at first, that is what it appears to be, but once you go deeper into it, you will find that it is way more than one might think. The Old Man and the Sea shows the dramatic story of an old man, and in it, you really get to know him, and he is such an interesting person. Hemmingway is such a talented writer, and this is a classic for a reason."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Hemingway really tells a great story and uses fantastic / simple language to do so much in this story.I really like the microcosm of the fisherman's battle as a symbol of life. This story speaks to the reader on so many levels.At the lowest level, it is a great story about a fisherman who is down on his luck and must strive against nature to find out whether or not he is just all washed up. At the highest level, it is the story of everyman who strives to do his best in life.A great story."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This book is excellent. Its about a very skilledold fisherman that lives in a fishing village in Cuba, and he doesn't have any luck for eighty-four days. On the eighty-fifth day, he goes out and fishes and catches a huge marlin. Since the fish is so big, the fish takes him out to the middle of the ocean for a ride. This is one of Ernest Hemmingways best books. He won a Putlizer Prize in fiction for Old Man and the Sea in 1953. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This is one of those rare novels that a fan can read and re-read every few years without any loss of enthusiasm. The story is a simple yet profound one about struggle, loss, and the human condition.

It's short, the language is simple and terse, so there's no excuse. It's a great read for all ages. I found the story fascinating, as an old fisherman takes his small boat into the big sea and tries to catch himself a big fish.

Read this book and enjoy a new look of life from a desprate man, and the enormous fish he tackles.

The book keeps you on the edge of your sit and keeps your attention throughout the entire story. While at times the story may seem a bit boring and repetitive, it has a wonderful message to whoever is reading it, to always be brave and persistent and it might pay off.People enjoy or dislike reading the book, The Old Man and the Sea, for many different reasons. Some individuals would say that Hemingway's novel was to low of a reading level and they would question how the story won various awards. The people who believe the book is bad they have their own opinion on why they feel that way. One of their biggest reasons why they dislike the book, The Old Man and the Sea, is because of the lack of problems or characters in the story. Another cause of people not liking the story was possibly the choice of words in which case were extremely easy small words that an elementary student could probably define in detail. On the other hand, there are individuals who believe this book deserved the awards it received and that it was an excellent work of fiction. A reason why some might perhaps enjoy reading the book is because the amazing smooth flow of the story from one paragraph to another with exceptional sentence fluency. This story can also be considered great by some because of its plot. In some cases the plot was fantastic and sometimes it was quite dull but overall an exceptional main idea and plot. In my perspective this novel was a bit overrated in a number of ways. I enjoyed the persistence factors of Santiago but some parts of the book were too crazy and unimaginable to understand at all.Several might agree with me when I say the plot of The Old Man and the Sea was pretty good. The story was basically about persistence, bravery, and courage among other things. Santiago and Manolin were the only real main characters. Santiago was an unrelenting fisherman and Manolin was a caring young boy. The main problems which they face were not getting any good big fish when they want to and the dangerous encounter with the vicious sharks in the Gulf of Mexico. The two are separated for some time while Manolin is home and Santiago is on the open sea. But with persistence and gallantry Santiago received what he dreamed of getting which was the biggest fish he has ever caught in his career. My favorite character was Santiago because the way he responded to not catching the big one and then when he did he knew that the hard work and patience was worth it. I could not relate to the main idea in this novel because I have never yet experienced such an event. Santiago is so much unlike me because I am not too persistent even though I'd like to be. I somewhat enjoyed the book, mostly about how Santiago went about his problems to overcome them and live on. In my viewpoint this novel was very enjoyable but strange at some points of the story but generally an outstanding tale of man vs. fate.Just like I mentioned earlier, some people enjoyed reading The Old Man and the Sea and some people disliked reading the story. No matter who read it and how they felt about what they read everyone has different opinions. I somewhat enjoyed reading the novel but I also have reasons for why I didn't quite think it was the best book I have ever read but in my mind it's a educational story which will teach you a few things about life."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the SeaThough extremely well-written, The Old Man and the Sea is a depressing and boring story. Sometimes I read a book and love it. Sometimes I start a book and can't finish it. And sometimes I read a book and wish that I hadn't. The Old Man and the Sea is one of those \\"I wish I hadn't read that\\" books. Hemmingway, the author with the infamous depressing style of writing, has crafted a very sad story with a disappointing ending. Nevertheless, the descriptions are absolutely wonderful the author not \\"telling\\", but \\"showing\\".In example, when Santiago says that \\"he wished that he had splashed the water in the boat and made salt\\", I couldn't help but see a rickety wooden boat with finely-grained salt on one of the seats. Little facts like that pop up all over the book, astonishing the reader that they can actually see what he wanted them to see! Like when Santiago is telling the boy about the lions in Africa, Hemmingway uses such fine explanation to show everyone what he means. I saw golden-brown lions lying on a sunny beach, snoring and keeping track of their cubs by instinct. The depression is still there, yes, but Hemmingway crafts his main character so wonderfully that he seems very real to the one reading the novel. Hemmingway describes ever aspect of everything he says; a sentence can't be read without a graphic description hanging on there somewhere. He paints a picture in the reader's mind better than any artist could have done, showing off his amazing ability of storytelling that is much envied by writers all over. The character \\"Santiago\\" is an n example of Hemmingway's descriptive novel-writing.The Old Man and the Sea a sad account about the struggle between a man and his fate. For example, Santiago's struggle with the fish leaves the reader feeling anxious and sad. I found myself cracking my knuckles and wanting to scream at the old man, \\"Hurry up and pull that fish in! This is driving me crazy!\\" Hemmingway tugs with the reader's emotions and knots them up like a fishing line, causing the reader to feel exactly what Santiago is feeling. Suspense is built throughout the story, and the reader will feel discontented and apprehensive until he or she has finished it. I wouldn't read the book more than once, nor would I recommend anybody else to. One will just feel miserable and wish that they hadn't.Finally, I'd like to remind anybody who is reading this that The Old Man and the Sea is a quality novel, and worth reading-but only once. That is, unless one likes reading sad, depressing novels that you wish they'd never read, go for it. But, warning...Hemmingway will leave the reader unsatisfied with the ending and eager to know what happened to the old man. Happy reading! (Or should I say, \\"Good luck\\"?)"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Although Hemingway is still regarded as the figurehead of everything that machismo and the American concept of rugged individualism is, was, and ever could be, this book is a surprisingly poignant and realistic look at the heretofore unseen, inner world of such seemingly superhuman men. This book is also a tender and moving review, a very real summing up, of what Hemingway perhaps once was - or wanted to be. It could also be considered the ultimate fish story with an unexpected, surprisingly triumphant twist to the &quot;one-that-got-away&quot; ending.Here, Hemingway explores the true concept of a winner, and unmasks defeat. As his hero shows us, being victorious is standing strong to the bitter end, and defeat cannot exist where the spirit has not been broken.Too, Hemingway shows us that tender youth need not be synonymous with vulnerability, and we can only wonder if the young lad - so devoted in his love and care of the Old Fisherman - does not represent a shadow of Hemingway in his younger years, his other self concealed behind the granite sense of self-existence that Hemingway passed on to a whole generation.Above all, however, this is the story of a quest - of how far man can and will go to achieve his goals, and, despite having his grand prize ripped bitterly from him, of being able to come to terms with such occurrences and find rest and pride not in the prize itself, but in having taken every step of the long, hard journey that led to that goal.Here, Hemmingway comes full-circle, melding the essence of rugged manhood with the physical, emotional, and psychological vulnerability, not to mention the values and ethics, which make such strength human. In my opinion, it is the poignant highlight of his career, and this book is more Hemingway as a human than any of his previous works.Masterfully and movingly written, this work has more than esthetic value to it, however. Read it and dare yourself to be every inch as human as its heroes, and you will be all the richer for the experience.- Benjamin Gene Gardner"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"First of all, I admit I'm biased here. I am a tremendous admirer of Hemingway's writing style. The language - unbelievably minimal, declarative, free of any irrelevance - is absolutely intoxicating. This, by itself, makes Hemingway a joy to read. Every sentence is so tight, so compact, yet they all say so much and create as vivid a picture in your mind as a photograph. Hemingway's writing at its worst is amazing.However, &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; is one of Hemingway's finest novels, fully deserving of the Nobel Prize. The story is simple and may seem boring to some, but the beauty of the old man's struggle with the marlin is heartbreaking and encouraging at the same time. Hopelessness and full awareness of defeat are contrasted with perseverance, determination, and an unwillingness to be destroyed. &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; brings home all of mankind's failures and all of mankind's successes in every sentence.I can't recommend this book more highly. Read it and stand in awe, both at Hemingway's astonishing command over the English language and at the dignity he brings to the failed in mankind. Brilliant in every sense of the word."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man And The Sea is a fabulous book. I greatly enjoyed reading it. I liked how the book kept a lot of things mysterious, and then told a little later or didn't tell at all. I also liked how unique this book is. I think this is a magnificent book and I would suggest it to anyone. In most books the human wins over nature, not in this book. The old man is defeated by the sharks. I would be heart broken if I lost a fish that big! Most books also have a happy,cheerful ending, I guess this book is just &quot;different&quot;, yet different is sometimes better. The mood of this book goes up and down a lot. The book starts out sad, because the old man has not caught anything in a long time.If you read this book, don,t stop there. It gets a lot better. Do not decide the mood of the book until you are finished with it, and do not judge it until you're finished."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Though I enjoyed reading this novel, I believe the price is a little high. The story is quite short and I have read better and longer books for less. It is very possible that I didn't fully understand the book, as I am only sixteen years old, but if I had I am sure the price would have been suitable. to sum up what I just wrote, because I hardly understand it myself, the older you are the better this novel will seem to you!"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and The Sea is Hemingway's shortest novel but in my opinion it is also his greatest. The theme of the book is when a man of achievement is seen as over the hill can he rise up to prove his critics wrong ? Santiago, the old man in the novel, is a professional fisherman who was once considered the best in his craft.He goes out every day but for 84 days has not caught a fish. He goes out again in the novel and he hooks a marlin which he says is the biggest fish he has ever seen.The struggle to vanquish the marlin and Santiagos thoughts during the struggle are the heart of the book.The Old Man and the Seais about the quest for excellence and the difficulty of achieving it the even harder job of maintaining it and the realization that humanity in the end must fade away for no one can stay on top forever. If this book were written in the 20s or 30s it would be radically different and not as good Instead, Hemingway gives us a masterpiece that shows much insight of one of mankinds existential questions and contributes greatly to the nations and the worlds literary canon"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Have you ever struggled so hard that you would never give up? Well that is what The Old Man and The Sea is all about. The author of the old man and the sea is Ernest Hemingway. He was one of our times best writers, and the old man and the sea is his best book. The Old Man and the Sea takes place in a small town out of Havana Cuba in the 1940's. The significance of the setting is it's in a small town of fisherman so the main economy comes from fish. The main character of The Old Man and The Sea is the old man he is also the protagonist of the book. Other characters in the book are the Boy and the Marlin. The Marlin is the antagonist of the story but the Marlin isn't a very believing antagonist because he isn't bad he is just fighting against the old man. The plot of the story is that the old man hasn't caught a fish in 84 days and he is really hungry. He decides to go out and he isn't coming back until he catches a big one. The old man sails out and twice he thinks he is close to the big fish but he keeps finding little fish. Finally he sees a few birds up on the horizon and he can feel that the big fish is below. He sees the marlin and he sinks down his line hoping the marlin will bite. \\"He bit it!\\" the unfortunate thing is that the old man sailed for 2 days trying to catch the marlin, he never gave up, and he kept trying. Eventually you know he catches it. He is very proud of himself but on the way back from the outing sharks go crazy. They shred the marlin to pieces, the old man tries to stop them but there is just too many. When he gets back to his village he goes straight back to his shack and sleeps.The book was like a really long fable. It didn't have to good of a story line it kind of just kept moving forward. Ernest Hemingway was really descriptive and detailed. Only on e of the greatest authors of our time could've of done this book because he used like 20 pages to explain one small thing. The theme of this story is even if you fail and fail again get back up and make your failures your motivation to try harder. This book leaves the impact that you have to keep trying and even when you win you might sometimes gain wisdom rather than a prize. This book I was really good and it kept you guessing and that is why I would give it 4 1/2 stars."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I read this book for the first time in high school. Like most other school reading assignments, I read it just to get through it. Recently, my son had to read it for his high school English class. I thought it would be the perfect time for me to read it again. I am so glad I did. What a pleasure it was to go back and reread this classic. Now that I am closer in age to the old man than the boy in the story, I understood the quest for the perfect marlin.

That book you opened when you were sixteen and still remember when your sixty. You may not be able to recall the whole book but parts of it never leave you. For all those that have read Hemingway's The Old Man and the Sea the feeling of heartbreak for the old man is universal. From the first page to the last you pull for this simple fisherman. If you've ever had a father who fishes you probably heard a story or two. Hemingway was a master. No story you dad ever told you can compare to what Hemingway put on page with this book. It's a story thats been told a hundred times but never like this. Find this book. Sit on your patio one afternoon and finish it. Then stick it in your library. When you glance up from your couch to look at the books on your wall, you'll smile when you see the spine of The Old Man and the Sea. Thanks Ernest, brilliant afternoon.Old Man and the Sea"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I finally read Old Man and the Sea, for the first time, taking it seriously, after years of ignoring the book and the author, as some boring mainstream pop culture hoopla. My stupid instincts said: Hemingway's stories were over-admired and misogynistic, about baseball and war with no real pizazz or pragmatism for escape; that my life would be better off without them. Boy, was I wrong.Old Man and the Sea is not about an old fisherman trying to catch fish, even though it really is just that too. Explaining the beauty of its decadent meter is like trying to explain how the multicolored facets give luster and depth to a fine diamond, or why the robustness of an aged Port with its subtleties of smoke and asparagus fall so well on the glass and tongue. As an adult there's a beauty in simplicity that makes more sense than when we are younger and more impulsive.Old Man and the Sea is a lesson in the appreciation of rhythm, like in the sounds of cicada approaching and withdrawing intensely while standing in grass near a tall tree'd landscape--in the flawless white powder covered back yard feeling smooth and blinding on the eyes in the morning crawl of a lazy day; in the whisper of an intuitive lover before climax, framing the moment into rapturous memories oft remembered before some nights of rest.In other words: as experience refines the palate, maturity and elegant simplicity are Hemingway's Old Man and the Sea.Here, a few lines that wrecked me into reverently triple reading them:\\"The old man carried the mast on his shoulder and the boy carried the wooden box with the coiled, hard-braided brown lines, the gaff and harpoon with its shaft. The box with the baits was under the stern of the skiff along with the club that was used to subdue the big fish when they were bought alongside.\\"Those very lines had me optimistic in imagining reading them to my future children before bed; they gave me hope for raising progeny in what has felt like a falling apart feeling world; with its poetry in a story about a man and his quest to catch the perfect marlin making the world seem lighter and less intense."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The cover image assured me that the book I needed to complete a classroom literature set was the one for sale. I received the book in less than 10 days. Great service."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea was my second experience with Hemingway, and I loved it. It was vastly different than The Sun Also Rises, which I read just before beginning The Old Man and the Sea.The writing was clear, sharp, and evocative. As perfect as the writing was, it was the story that floored me. I think that what makes the The Old Man and the Sea a classic is that each reader can find some unique reflection of his or her own life in the story. The Old Man undergoes a universal struggle, and we are with him the whole time, rooting for him, but in the back of our minds, knowing that the odds are against him.I recommend it highly. This one is going into my re-read pile."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Phew...........I just finished reading the tale of Santiago, the old man, and I've exhaled for what seems like the first time since starting the book last night. There is likely not much left to be said about \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" that you have not read before, but the story is so gripping, so timeless, and so well written that it deserves every ounce of praise from every person who reads it.Hemingway won me over as a young man when I first read \\"The Sun Also Rises,\\" and everything in between has been a hit for me, but I never decided to read this until last night, probably because of the diminutive size of the text, but I was gripped from early on. The thing that strikes me the most about Hemingway is the simplicity with which he is able to write, but the depth to the words when you look underneath the surface.The old man, Santiago, embodies so much of what every man longs for--that unwavering faith and belief in their abilities, and that sense of being up for the challenge, no matter how impossible it may seem, but giving it your all regardless of the likely outcome. I found myself, a grown man, with tears in my eyes at points of the book, just begging for things to progress in certain ways, and legitimately trying to breath with the anxiety caused in the final page turns (or Kindle clicks in my case). I do not want to spoil anything for anybody, but there are incredible life lessons about resilience, faith, and courage that every man, woman, and child could benefit from. I do find Hemingway to be a man's man with a man's knack for storytelling, and I doubt that there are many men out there who could read this without offering praise.This is a must read."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This is my 1st Hemingway book.It was awesome. It even make me moist my eyes. It is very breve story but enough to mark your soul. You can even smell and taste the salt. I will have to read more books from this classic author."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Ernest Hemingway is not considered one of the greatest American writers without merit. A recommended beach/vacation read for the upcoming summer! I enjoyed reading it near the ocean. The book's setting and the beach are a great combination!

What to say about Hemingway's The Old man and the Sea? It is a masterpiece of modern literature. Great book."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Amazing book! Highly recommended! It is an captivating story of an old Man fight a marlin, after 84 days when he did not catch anything."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"My book group gave me a chance to reread a novella I had read 30+ years ago. It held up well as a story of survival and strength."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Hemingway could say so much with so few words. The Old Man and the Sea is a very short novel, a novella really, but it is as fine a book as any Hemingway wrote. His blunt prose is so powerful I can feel the cuts from the line on my hands. It's a simple tale of a single trip by a fisherman, but it is heavy with symbolism the inherent struggle of a man's life to gather light and thwart darkness. I'm left with a strong desire to emulate the titular old man's quiet strength and gritty determination in the face of adversity."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This book is not necessarily meant to be sad, but it saddened me to no end. The Old Man and the Sea is the first Hemingway book I ever read - I know, shocking - and it made me realize what I've been missing out on.This is a very simple tale, approximately a 100 pages long, about an old man's journey on the sea. Santiago, the old man, has not caught a big fish in 84 days and has therefore been declared unlucky. In fact, his closest friend and student - only known as \\"boy\\" - was forbidden by his family from fishing with the old man due to his bad luck. However, that did not stop the boy from taking care of the old man each and every day, making sure he goes to sleep, he eats, he reads his paper and so on.On the 85th day, the old man is optimistic that this must be his lucky day. He sets off on his course and is prepared to catch the biggest fish, and he does. However, he does not realize how big this fish actually is, and is not strong enough to drag it overboard and is afraid of cutting the string, therefore he ends up being pulled by the fish far enough into the sea that he could not see the lights of Havana anymore. Throughout this journey, the old man reflects on his life and his physical and mental strengths, and his surroundings. He engages in some of the most interesting conversations with the moon and the birds and most especially the fish. He forms a bond with the fish he had caught, you could almost call it a friendship, in fact several times he would refer to the fish as \\"brother\\". As his body starts to fail him, the fish is also starting to give up the fight. However, the old man is so exhausted to the point of delirium that he eventually stabs the fish to death and pulls it to the side of the boat.On his journey back home, sharks are immediately attracted to the scent of blood and attack the boat in turns trying to have at the fish. The old man fights them off as much as he could with what strength he has left, defending his fish - his friend - with all his might, until he couldn't anymore. By the time he gets to shore, there is nothing left of the fish but its skeleton attached to its head and its tail.It is a short novel, yes, but one that will stay with you for much longer than you could imagine. The story of the old man and his bond with the fish he caught is very profound and very real. At the end, the old man's grief is not because he had nothing to show for his journey, but more like due to the loss of a friend. Something that he thought was so courageous and so beautiful was destroyed in the cruelest of ways.A very touching novel. Hemingway was able to tap into our emotions and delve into many layers of thought and contemplation in just a 100 pages. That is very impressive indeed.Also, I absolutely loved the role of the boy. I loved his dedication and love for the old man, the way he cared for him and nurtured him, how he never let go or gave up. He is a true model of how old people should be treated, and how every child should treat their parents. And as I grow older, I would love to have the strength, and determination and wisdom and optimism of this old man.Truly inspiring."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"There simply has never been a voice so well suited for a role. Donald Sutherland's reading of \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" is going to be one that stands the test of time. Sutherland is simply outstanding. Sutherland has everything, from top to bottom, which is what makes this audiobook a success. He has the flow, the sometimes ragged voice, a voice with power, a tempo that is ideal for this book's reading, and so many intangibles that cannot be expressed, only felt. What he does not convey in words, he conveys in pure aesthetic form, emotively driving the reader, as I imagine that Hemingway intended.Sutherland's performance in this book is so incredible that I will simply say this: Of all the audiobooks I have listened to, there is none better than this. This reading of \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" is the gold standard for audiobooks."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I remember watching this movie when I was a little boy and it made me so sad that I cried. When I read Hemingway's masterpiece, I was transported back to my childhood and my love for this story."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I started reading this book because it was assigned to my niece and I saw it in my Kindle queue. I had never read Hemingway so I was curious to see what the book that made him famous was all about.The story is simple yet deep. Hemingway wrote this short story in a way that you can relate to the character and experience his initial triumph and then the agony of his loss. The characters of Santiago and the boy are laid out so that you can feel the emotional bond between them. It's beyond master and apprentice and to a certain degree even beyond father and son.I did not see the religious allegory in this story. The old man's suffering and struggle in no way resembled Jesus' struggle. Even though the old man does say his hail Mary's he says himself that he is not a really religious man. To me this was the struggle of nature. A hunt among hunters of the same prey. A lesson in life and how it changes with age.Over all I thought this book was OK. I may have to read it again to see what all the fuss was about."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I saw this book at the library and thought, \\"Hey, I never read this Hemingway in high school.\\" I remembered liking the other required readings by Hemingway so I picked this up. It was a bit slow, but as Santiago fought with the massive fish, I became consumed in his battle. I cheered for him as he fought days and nights with the fish, through hunger, thirst, and pain. I cheered for through more battles with sharks. Ultimately, I cried for him when the fish was gone.I could not believe that such a simplistic story drew me in like this. Life does not give us what we want materialistically all the time. But if you give it a go and fight honorably for it, you gain something much more."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Hemingway's last novel (and IMO, his best novel) won a Pulitzer Prize, cemented his status as one of America's greatest talents, and was probably the deciding factor in his receiving the Nobel Prize. Very different from my second favorite Hemingway novel, the epicFor Whom the Bell Tolls, THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA is on the surface a simple tale about a simple man. Santiago's struggle to catch the fish of a lifetime and to get home with his prize makes a superb story on its own, a story that will be enjoyable to readers of any level. One man's tenacity and strength lead to his dominance over nature, followed by his inevitable defeat by nature. In the shallowest sense, it is a short but grand tale of trial, triumph, let-down, and peace, but underneath that, it contains truly powerful lessons and poignant commentary by Hemingway.THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA is a story about facing life's challenges, and not just facing them, but standing up against all odds, never giving up, following your dreams, and overcoming adversity. The dignity of the poor old Cuban fisherman represents the best of the natural man, living for oneself and refusing to surrender to the seeming inevitability of eventual defeat. No matter your dreams, you can obtain success with hard work and perseverance, but at the same time, that success is often fleeting.While the entirety is enjoyable, my favorite part of the book comes at the very end, as Santiago's fellow fishermen, who had often treated him with pity and disdain, come to realize the magnitude of his success. While not described in detail by Hemingway (see below), you can just picture the marveling attention the legendarily-big blue marlin garners from the Cuban villagers, and the respect the Old Man will receive in the future.The fact that Hemingway is able to present such an impactful and meaningful tale into such a short novel is a testament to the power of this writing. His \\"Iceberg Theory\\" of prose says that if a writer is good enough, he doesn't have to state things that should already be clear to the reader (or something like that). \\"The dignity of movement of an iceberg is due to only one ninth of it being above water.\\" With so much beneath the surface, THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA is perhaps the best example of this profound concept.Very highly recommended!!"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"If only I had read this book as a teenager. Not that I didn't enjoy it now, but as a teenager who was hooked on fishing, what an adventure story it would have been to my young eyes. Of course, I didn't fish in the Atlantic Ocean off the cost of Cuba, as Santiago did in this tale. I fished the streams, ponds, and lakes of the Adirondack Mountains. And yet, I know this yarn would have been spellbinding. It's easy to see why this book, published in 1952, played a big part of Hemingway earning the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1954. During my many years as a radio DJ, I often urged my adult listeners to leave books around the house where a child might pick them up and start the life-long habit of reading. This is just such a book. Now I need to go and get the video."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This is probably the best book ever crafted of this length. It is short, but extremely elegant. Hemingway's terse style truly shines through in this book and the imagery is outstanding. The story keeps you as hooked as the fish on the old man's line and you feel the frustrations and triumphs as keenly as he does. Simply beautiful and one of the best examples of why Hemingway is loved so. Well worth a go.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This is the best book that I've ever read, and continues to be my favorite. I can't say enough good things about it. Yes it is short, but the story is amazing. Well worth your time to read this book."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The simple writing style of Hemingway produces a most forceful and beautiful short story. Hemingway's style has always been straight-forward which in some stories has made for a plodding and somewhat cumbersome read.But \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" is a perfect tapestry of man, boat and fish and towards the end sharks. We feel tremendous sympathy for the fisherman and for the swordfish that he comes to kill.Hemingway's unequivocal prose brings full life to all the features of man and his elements - the sea, the weather, the boat, the fish and birds following the boat along with the passage of time. A remarkable and tender story."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and The Sea is a great book that tells a story of an old man and his way of fishing. Our hero in this book is not a King, a prince, a knight or a leader who has all the powers in the world, but instead we have Santiago, who is a very old, poor Cuban fisherman and we follow this simple man's struggle of his in this book. The author Ernest Hemingway uses complex signs and a great story line to draw readers into this story. With these techniques, he shows a story that applies to many overseas. One part of this book that I enjoyed was the old man, Santiago. His character, to me, helped me to become more interested in the story. Earlier in the book, the old man was struggling with a large Marlin (fish). Even with his body beaten and broken, he continued to fight the fish. The old man's strength to fight the fish helped me to understand his way of fishing. This is definitely a good book to read, not only once but many times over. This novel is easy to read, and it would be perfect for anyone that feels like they cannot read a lot of books because the authors make it too difficult. I would also recommend this novel to people who enjoy adventure stories, because this story is one long adventure. I would also recommend this book because Hemingway gives a good message in it everyone should think about."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Some say that the grammar in this book is incorrect, but this is purely personal opinion and preference. He tends not to put commas in where they are optional, and this could be part of his writing style and therefore isn't grammatically incorrect, but a stylistic preference. Hemingway never broke the rules: he just bended them a little. Other authors have broken grammatical rules for their own reasons, and a good example of this is Mark Twain with The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. He purposefully misspells words, uses non-standard slang and makes drastic grammatical errors to portray the character's point of view more accurately. Any review under a three on this book has either false information, personal bias or just plain ignorance on these matters. Some would say there's not enough action, but that isn't the main focus of books in general. A novel is simply a story with plot and characters told from someone's, author's or character's, point of view, and any book lacking in these (a.k.a. action, cheesy romance novels, vampire novels, they're all the same) usually lacks in quality. If you LIKE those kinds of novels, then you're going to hate this one, but if you're looking for something deeper, this is the book for you. Simply put, this is art."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Santiago is an old man. He was once a great fisherman, but no longer. The other fishermen ridicule him, or ignore him. Eighty days without a fish, and the parents of the small boy who helps him, Manolin, have forbidden him to work with Santiago any more. He is unlucky, they say, and the word is echoed around town.But the old fisherman does not mind. He knows that life is difficult, that not everything goes the way you wish it would. On the eighty-fifth day, he sets out into the water, alone, and hooks a great fish. 'Never have I had such a strong fish nor one who acted so strangely', he muses to himself, early on in the battle. For it is a battle. The fish he has caught is strong, has great endurance, and a cunning that Santiago admires.As time passes, he starts to talk to himself more and more. He muses on the strength of the fish, and how they are brothers. He desperately wants to catch it, so that he can return to Havana with some glory and enough money to sit and listen to the 'great DiMaggio' on the radio, in peace. But he also admires the fish, and gradually, he becomes unsure as to whether he has made the right decision in trying so hard to kill it.'Never have I seen a greater, or more beautiful, or a calmer or more noble thing than you, brother. Come on and kill me. I do not care who kills who.'Santiago is an old man, a man who has accepted his weaknesses and failures, but who also knows his strengths. He has a great confidence in his own abilities, but it is a weary, hesitant confidence that is difficult to explain. On the one hand, he knows that he has the capability to capture the fish. He has caught large fish before, and, thanks to the raw fish he has been eating, considers that he has the strength to keep going, for ever if necessary. But he protests and cajoles and pleads at his individual body parts to work, for them not to fail. 'Hold up, legs. Last for me, head. Last for me. You never went.' He knows he can do it, but, because of his age and the majesty of his 'brother', he is worried that maybe this time, this fish will be the one that got away.Hemingway's writing is sparse and effective. Sentences are short, sharp, and have very little in the way of flowery words or fancy punctuation. The writing suits the story very well, because Santiago is an up and down man himself. What you see is what you get, both in the characters, the setting, and the writing. There is also the interesting effect where, due to the simplicity of the writing and the sparse selection of characters, the story can be interpreted on many levels. On one, it is the story of man struggling and fighting for something that, once achieved, we cannot hold on to. On the other, it is the sadness and inevitability of age. Or the insignificance of the single man in today's group-action world. Or many other interpretations.The ending is sad, beautiful and completely appropriate. Could the novel have ended any other way? Yes, but I argue that if it had, then the message, the electricity, the purpose that Hemingway had been building for the previous 90 pages, this would have been lost with the easy, happy solution. Instead, we have man's failure in success, and Santiago's calm acceptance, and it is inspiring."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I haven't read classics since school and decided to take a break from commercial and contemporary fiction to read a few. I'm quite surprised that a story about a fish could have me wrapped up and engaged. This was my first Hemingway book and I enjoyed his simple storytelling style. Because it was straight forward, I was able to get into the old man's dilemma of not having caught a fish in months and then battling with this great marlin, only to have it attacked by sharks. I like that I was able to get into and feel his struggles within his mind and against his body. This was a very engaging classic."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"\\"The Old Man And The Sea\\" is a classic tale of man versus nature. Set in Cuba during the age of \\"The Great DiMaggio\\", the Old Man's quest after the fish is reminiscent of Captain Ahab's pursuit of the whale. The epic struggle between the great fish, the sea and the Old Man inspires our imagination. Hemingway entertains the reader with vivid descriptions and streams of consciousness which pain mental pictures of the Old Man's world. The reader is placed right in the skiff where he can see the Old Man struggle with the lines, smell the sea, hear the waves, feel the swells and share his respect for the foe.Throughout this book we savor the images, enjoy the action and admire the courage. This is truly a classic masterpiece by a word magician."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"\\"The Old Man And The Sea\\" is a classic tale of man versus nature.

Ernest Hemingway does a great job of telling this story. The story is packed with great meaning and written in a way that I think all ages can understand. His sentences are simple yet they hold such meaning without having to be complicated. A child could read this book and still understand the meaning.When I say that this book has very good meaning I say that with different perspectives of the book in mind. The Old Man, Santiago, has a great respect for many things in his life. The boy who works with him, the sea that provides with food when willing, and the great fish he battles with. He evens finds a place in his heart for those predators after his great fish.The boy who is probably 12 or 13 works with Santiago out on his small skiff. He even helps him when they are not out on the boat. He brings him food, water and the paper so they can discuss baseball from the day before. The boy looks up to him and Santiago respects him for everything he does for him.I especially admired the respect that Santiago has for the sea and the great marlin. Even though he has been cursed with bad luck and hasn't caught a fish for 80 some days, he still believes that he should have respect for the sea, because some day it will be good to him and provide all the fish he needs, which in the end it does but its costs him."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"One of the best ever, this is a book full of emotion, from the first page you can feel the Old Man's inspiration and determination. The book is not very long, it is just right, many times during the reading I stoped and imagined him at sea fighting the marlin and then the sharks, the old man talking to himself and remembering better times, when he was young, when he was stronger.The old man finds the strenght to come back victorious even in defeat.This book is a must read for all ages, simply a great short novel."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Santiago is an old Cuban fisherman. In the book He has the battle of his life with a ferocious marlin. He is a very poor man and he has not had much luck with fishing in the past 84 days but with the help of a little boy named Manolin, he gets through the tough days of his life. His adventure with the giant fish begins eighty-five days after his last catch. The Old Man and the Sea is an appealing and an enjoyable book because Ernest Hemingway is an excellent writer.The events and actions of this novel catch the attention of the reader as soon as they start the book. For example, Santiago was not angry with the other fishermen when they made fun of him. He is a good man and is so wise that being made fun of does not bother him. He is a good protagonist and a good character to read about. It helps to teach us to not let the little things bother us as much. The characters and their actions when dealing with controversy can be related to real life situations. For instance, the old man ignores all the laughing of the younger fishermen because he cannot catch any fish. This is like a student dealing with bullies and humiliation at school. These are some points that Ernest Hemingway made to interest to readers.I think The Old Man and the Sea is a great book to read. My favorite part of the book was the climax when Santiago defeats the fish or the antagonist. I would recommend this book to anybody who likes a good book. Because it is an easy read and has valuable life lessons that people can apply to every day life. Hemingway's original style and the characters in this book make it a very good book to read."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I read &quot;Old Man and the Sea&quot; nearly three years ago as part of a Meaning of Religion course, and for good reason. The depth of the writing and meaning in this book, in the midst of a simple writing style truly makes this book a masterpiece.

It's a truly beautiful and wonderful read."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"From a kids point of view, &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; was about as boring as it could be. There was about one hundred pages about a fish. Why would anyone care that much about a fish?

In the beginning it didn't even spark my interest. Because the book was written without chapters, it is kind of hard to tell whats what and whos who.

Even after I read the other people's comments I found a day of my Christmas vacation wasted and i wish I had never read it."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea is meant to be an adventurous story about and old fisherman and his adventures with the sea. For most, the story seems uneventful and boring. It may only appeal to those who are either def or blind. Anyone with a normal sense of sight or sound will find this story to be extremely boring and tiring.The plot of the book is too predictable. The exciting events are too few and far between. For example, (one of the main characters) only appears a few times in the book. Manolin isn't even that interesting. Lucky for the rest of us, he only appears a few times throughout the story. In addition to an already boring cast of characters, the old man (whom the book is focused on) is dull, weak and he avoids the potential for exciting events to take place. Also, the setting is not lively enough to fill the imaginations of the unfortunate readers. The time period is one that everyone can be fascinated with, permitting that the interesting highlights of the time period are used to liven the story. The location of the book is wonderful, but Hemingway over explains every little detail about the state of the place. Hemingway is an admired author who tends to forget certain characteristics of the plot, and over indulges other things in the story. The setting of the story is to the whole book, as alcohol is to Hemmingway.The Old Man and the Sea, only appeals to the def and the blind. Those of us with full or partial use of our ears and eyes can plainly sense that this story is uneventful. I especially was bored with the story. It was not an interesting topic. The only people who would be interested in the story are old fishermen. The poor children who are forced into reading this will find it unappealing. The story wasn't filled with action. Even someone who is into the topic will find the story too boring. The interesting events are too few and far between. Someone who has perfect vision or perfect hearing will still find this story boring and uneventful.In conclusion, The Old Man and the Sea is a boring worthless peace of nothing. Only the def and the blind consider it literature."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea wasn't very enjoyable to read. It seemed more age appropriate for readers around 45 and older. I find that at my age group, which are kids, are probably more into action and long adventures, then a relaxing trip made by an old man. That is usually what older people are into because that is always what they are talking about. I guess it all depends on what kinds of books you are into. I felt that The old Man and the Sea wasn't interesting at all.I found that the book The Old Man and the Sea wasn't an exciting or suspenseful story. For example, the quote, \\"Then came the same delicate pulling touch again,\\"42. Like I said before, not very exciting. Where's the suspense? In addition, \\"An airplane passed over on its course to Miami and he watched its shadow scaring up the schools of flying fish,\\" 71. See boring, sentences like this make the book not very exciting. Even for a long sentence that wasn't very suspenseful. The old Man and the Sea needs to be more suspenseful for the reader.I thought The old Man and the Sea was predictable, in most parts. For example, he said that the longest he has gone without a fish was 85 days, so then he goes on a fishing trip to find a fish. Right there you know he is going to come home with a fish. That makes the book no fun to read because the reader knows what is going to happen so then they don't want to finish. In addition, he fights a really big fish to match up his 85 day dead line. So the reader isn't going to give up because he has to make his 85day limit so he won't be a failure. He also can't give up because he doesn't want to be disappointed in him. All in all The Old Man and the Sea needs to not be so predictable.In conclusion, I found The Old Man and the Sea to be not very exciting or suspenseful. Because of reading this book I saw my friends falling asleep while reading it. To find out which age group fits this book and find it more enjoyable, people can find older age groups, have them read it and see what they say. We already know what the younger people think. Again it all depends on what kinds of books different people are into. Although reading this book makes people expand their horizons and stick with something even though they really don't like it."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Earnest Hemmingway received a special award for this piece The Old Man and the Sea. Although his book was boring and slow, the plot of the story was interesting and sometimes even exciting.Even though Earnest Hemmingway has been recognized for some amazingly written books in the past, this book certainly wasn't one of them. Throughout this story Hemmingway's style of writing is very repetitive. He over-used the phrase \\"He said, Santiago said, etc.\\" By using such repetitive words and language the reader could become easily bored and may even get annoyed. They might also lose interest in the story, and maybe in the author. However, there were a few things Hemmingway did well. When the story took a turn and got interesting, I quickly became hooked. I think if Hemmingway's writing style was like this throughout the book, it would have been more interesting and more liked by a larger audience. There for although Hemmingway's style was boring, it was simple and easy to follow.Many people would like this book but mainly the younger kids would prefer it. For instance the language used in this story is simple and easy to follow. I think that younger kids would enjoy reading this book because Hemmingway uses easy to understand language younger kids will become fans of his writing. Hemmingway's style of writing is easier for the younger audience to follow. He doesn't go into deep description and details. I think that younger people would prefer this book over adults. Hemmingway is a simple writer.Just because Hemmingway was awarded a special honor for this book doesn't mean it was great. Throughout the story Hemmingway was very repetitive with his word choice. He also used vague and boring language. I personally didn't enjoy the book because of its boring events, but that doesn't mean other people wouldn't feel differently."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This book was terrible I had to read it for school which may color my opinion... The man did not shut up about the stupid fish. Hemingway was one of those authors who never got to the point If he was going to write about a sruggle could he write about one in real life. Comparing life and struugle to a fish suggestts serious problems some of you will say it was the struggle with the fish that was important but it wasn't. Joe DiMaggio was a bad code hero because he lived in the characters fantasy. and heros have to be in real life to all of you having to read it for school invest in CLiff Notes if allowed it'll save you the time and annoyance."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"it could be single-handedly responsible for narcolepsy. But I guess since the bigshot Hemingway wrote it, we're all supposed to nod our heads and smile and say &quot;way deep novel symbolizing man's struggle against nature&quot; like subjects in The Emporer's New Clothes. Well, I for one will not call invisible talent talent just because it was written by &quot;literary&quot; royalty. Please, spare yourself the misery of this dreadful waste of trees. Hopefully, it is no longer required reading like it was when I was in school."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"What was the point in this book?

Yeah, happy day, good for him, but who cares?!"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I was very surprised at how fast this order was received. The book was in excellent shape. I have made a note oif this vender for future book purchases."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I do love the Cape Cod, beach type lifestyle, but I have to say this book was not one of my favorites. It had good parts, but I felt like it dragged on a little long at parts. Basically it just didn't really keep my interest throughout, which to me, is a major quality of a book. I can't say this is a book everyone will love because I didn't. But I did give it five stars because it is considered a classic and Hemingway is considered one of the best authors of all time. I also noticed that many books I have read before followed the same pattern as this, which to me in its own qualifies a book as a classic. Give it a chance, see if you like it. It may become one of your favorites, you may hate it. But at least you'll be able to say \\"I read The Old Man and the Sea, by Ernest Hemingway!\\""},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The book The Old Man and The Sea was an ok book. There was nothing that special about the book. I thought that it was kinda of boring. All it talks about is an old man and a little boy going fishing and they don't catch a big fish for a long time.The old man has gone fishing for 84 days without catching a single fish. It is on the 85th day when he finally catches a big fish. The old man goes out by himself and ends up catching a big fish called a Marlin. The old man was surprised that the fish was that big. The tail was a very pale lavender and it also had purple stripes all over its body. The fish kept pulling the old man further out into the ocean and there was nothing the old man could do about it. When he finally caught the fish he had to tie it to the boat because it was so big that it would not fit in the boat. But other fish,sharks start to eat the fish when he starts to bring it in to the shore. All that is left of the fish to prove that he caught a big fish was the skeleton of the big fish he caught. I thought that the book jumped around too much. I really had a hard time following it. I was getting messed up when he would say someone's name. I could never remember whose name was whose. Like the old man's name was Santiago and the little boy's name was Manolin."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man And The Sea was a great book that took me on a long journey through out the struggles of Santiago a Cuban fisherman that has naught had a catch in 84 days. The old man seemed to be very wise and would not give up. The old man had a friend named Manolin. Their friendship stays strong throughout the story.Santiago is a good man and Manolin is forbidden by his parents to work further with Santiago because he is bad luck. Their friendship goes on though and Manolin helps providing Santiago with food clothes and bait. The old man seems to have had a successful past with fishing this is told with his badly scarred hands and many wrinkles. Santiago is optimistic and does not give up on fishing and instead decides to go deeper into the ocean to catch fish.Santiago sets out early in the morning and sets out towards the deep sea to catch tuna. Hemingway describes the ocean with sensory details, telling how the ocean smells as Santiago leaves the land, how the ocean looked filled with see weed and how the fish sounded as they flew out of the water. I had a very good picture in my head of the ocean that Santiago was sailing into. Santiago seems very peaceful and respectful as he waits for the fish to bite, referring to the ocean as a female unlike most fisherman that would think of the ocean as masculine and capable of destruction.The old mans wait is over as he feels a fish nibble on his line. Santiago waits awhile as the fish keeps nibbling. This part of the book was boring because Santiago was just thinking about his friendship with Manolin and Joe Dimaggio. The struggle of catching this Marlin goes on through the night and into the next day. Santiago starts experiencing more problems that made me think he was going to give up. Hunger, sleep deprivation and pain in his hand had all made me think his struggle would soon be over and he would give up on this large fish. Santiago had finally won the battle and had caught the marlin. This made me feel like the struggle was all over but he still had not won.Santiago had started his journey back to land. Many sharks had attempted to eat the fish and the first one was successful in taking much of Santiago's catch. I showed he really wanted this catch because he had tried everything to catch this fish and to defend it against sharks. Santiago was a good man and felt sorry for the fish and was regretting that he had ventured out so far into the ocean. I felt frustrated for Santiago in the end because he was such a hard working old man and had some bad luck."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"THE OLD MAN AND THE SEAFor me and probably many other people, Ernest Hemmingway brings the thought of a great writer, one who won the Pulitzer Prize for his ability and talent to write stories. However, after reading his short story The Old Man and the Sea I have yet many doubts. The Old Man and the Sea is a simple worded short story that lacks in the ability to captivate its audience.The plot of the story begins with a persistent man, who has one thing on his mind, fish, but in the end the persistence is replaced with defeat. For instance, Santiago had been fishing persistently for eighty-five days without catching a single fish. To me persistence means pushing on towards your goal and not giving up easily, Santiago took this to a new level. It ended up being the persistent attitude that defeated him in the end. Although, Santiago had persistence, many people believed he had bad luck. An example of this is when he came back from an eighty-five day fishing trip without a single fish. Many times during the book it seemed impossible that Santiago has bad luck, but in the end it prevailed. So although Santiago is a persistent man who knows the concept of never giving up, his bad luck catches up top him in the end.This book is not a book that grabs hold of your attention, and leaves every word dripping with excitement. For example, Hemmingway's style is concise and uncluttered but not elaborate. This was not a book I enjoyed, not because it was simple, but because it wasn't exciting. I think someone who enjoys short stories, and the adventures of sea would enjoy this book more then someone like me who likes mysteries. In addition, to not being exciting, it is also choppy. There are many sentences that don't flow, or that don't grab your attention. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone who just wants to read a good book. I might recommend it to a person who wants to study a concise, uncluttered, simple worded book. In conclusion, I think this book was written for style and not excitement. It was a simple book, which made it easy to read and understand, but was not a book that captured my attention.After reading The Old Man and the Sea, it made me think why was this man known as a great writer? I also thought about the way Hemmingway described Santiago, and how well he portrayed the life of a fisherman, and all the different struggles that one might go through in order to make a living. I know now why Hemmingway won the Pulitzer Prize. It was because he had an amazing way of describing a life, much like Santiago's and though his books may be simple and not filled with as much excitement as other books, he has the amazing ability of taking someone like a fisherman, and making a story out of their simple, lives somewhat interesting. So even though I most likely would not read this book again, and I most certainty wouldn't recommend it to someone, I still have a great deal of respect for Hemmingway's ability to portray a life."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I really enjoyed this book! I found the story of Santiago and his quest for final glory enduring and inspiring. Hemingways amazing use of simple language to paint the most vivid and colourful pictures shows why he is considered an all time great. No word is wasted in any of his sentences, with even the word &quot;the&quot; playing a profound role in his ability to make you feel the characters emotion and experiences.Santiago is an old, fading fisherman living in a coastal Cuban fishing town. He is quite poor (in material possesion), but has a richness of character that is recognised by only him and his friend; a young boy.Santiago is down on his luck as he heads out by himslef to break his losing streak. He manages to latch on to an enormous Marlin, far stronger than him, but his experienced fishing skills and his will to survive push him to pursue the fish for many days and many miles out to sea. His struggle and pain are brought to you in a clear, precise way, while his obvious respect for the beauty of the fish is expounded during glimpses of its majestic fight.Hemingway seems to like fishing, as the theme comes into many of his novels. He describes the intricacies in understood detail, creating greater depth to Santiagos struggle. In the end Santiago wins his pursuit of the giant, beautiful fish and starts his journey home. It is here that we begin to feel the most compassion for Santiago as his fight continues; fending off scavenging sharks taking hits from his trophy piece. By the time he hits home (early in the morning) he is exhausted and all that remains is the skeleton of a legend.As I have mentioned, I found this book an inspiring tale of not giving up and pursuing ones glory. I have since reread this book beneath the canopy of palm leaves by the pristine Indian ocean of Western Australia. The white sands and surrounding scenary the perfect place to rediscover Santiagos glory.If you are not into Hemingway, I suggest this as your first. If, like me, you love Hemingway, then it would be obvious to suggest that you read this meaningful tale.

However, I think that a more thought out plot than rowing, fishing, and reeling was in order, especially from an author of Hemmingway's caliber. The story takes place in a fishing village in Cuba and focuses around Santiago, an old man that has not caught a fish in 84 days. He decides one day to go far out to sea in search for &quot;the big fish.&quot; When he finally hooks a marlin,it takes Santiago three days to reel in a fish, proving his determination. However, on his way back to shore, sharks eat the fish which is attatched to the boat. This is a great example of irony, but the message that I got from the book was never give up, and this event shot that out of the water and seemed confusing to me. It was a very detailed book and I would recomed it to college students or older."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I am no fan of The Old Man and the Sea, but it's worth publicising more widely the little-known story of its genesis.

Hemingway's vividly describes every aspect of the book from the setting to the thoughts of the Old Man. The story begins with the man ending a day of fishing in the gulf off of Cuba. This day was just like the last 84 days for the man, he had not caught a single fish. The man went out the next day with the same intentions as the as the day before and the day before that. He hoped to catch a large marlin that he might find in the deep waters of the gulf. He didn't know that he was to embark on the most significant fishing trip of his life. The main character Santiago is the old man that battles nature. The boy that assists the old man is the only important in the beginning and end of the book and not the climax. The book is short and goes into great detail about the old man's struggle against nature."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Before reading this book I was not a reader who looked for deeper meanings of books, but rather tried to take them at face value. This book changed everything! Ernest Hemingway's simple sentences managed to enchant a teenager who rarely cares to read. The enormity of what Hemingway does has been replicated by few in history. THe struggle of the old man against himself makes each of us examine more closley our own existence and helps us face the challenges that each of us are faced with.

Simply one of the best books I've ever read and certainly one of my top three favourites. Hemingway was awarded the Novel Prize for Literature and upon reading this one can easily see why. A great read for a lazy Sunday afternoon (not that it isn't important to find other time to read it). A short, simply and excellent read."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I actually saw the movie years ago but decided to read the book out of shear curiosity of the legend himself, Earnest Hemingway. The Old Man and the Sea is a classic tale of hardship described in terms that only Hemmingway knows how to do.The book is about an old Cuban fisherman who has had an 84 day streak of bad luck. The old man is respected, but has become a kind of bad luck symbol to the local fisherman of Cuba. The old man fish's day in and day out searching for the one fish that is going to break his unlucky streak and boy does he find it.Positive points: The struggle seems real, as if I was in the boat with him. I got the feeling that man and animal are one and the same, both the old man and the fish were after the same thing, survival. It's a story about beating the odds during the hard times of life (and it demonstrates this well).Negative points: The story is overly simplistic, which makes it extremely easy to read; however, there are some parts of the book that drag on a bit. I found myself thinking, \\"Come on old man, catch the dam fish already.\\"Conclusion: Worth the read, if you have the time."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I liked the book Old Man and the Sea. It was interesting, fairly well written, and easy to read. The theme of this book i8s that sometimes you can get caught up in something that may not be good for you, and you don't even realize how much it's affecting you until it is too late. The main character in this book is an old Cuban fisherman named Santiago.He is very stubborn and set in his ways, and he often forgets to eat.The other fishermen look down on him and thoink he is rather eccentric, but his best friend and former fishing partner, a young boy named Manolin, remains loyal to him and often comes to bring him food and support. Santiago views the boy with tenderness, and has no harsh feelings for the other fishermen.Baseball is his favorite thing, and his hero is Joe DiMaggio.During the course of this book, he begins to appreciate his homemore, as well as the boy and the other fishermen. He realizes the importance of having people to help him, and the value of friendship. The climax is when he catches the marlin and brings it home.

Or perhaps, with one of the themes of the book being perserverance, Hemingway was deliberately making his readers perservere at the book. From the reviews I've skim-read nobody seems to have mentioned the pessimism that seems to somehow parallel the hope in the book (the sharks killing the Marlin obviously). Don't forget that this was one of Hemingway's last works before he shot himself.

Though it's symbolic references may be partially interesting, what is the use of a book if it can't even keep you awake or inspired. Simplicity may be able to be used to an advantage in some cases, but i found that in Old Man and the Sea, the attempt was a flailing and defeated one.

This is a decent story of a old man taking on a big fish (a marlin) at sea. Duh. Right?Is the story that interesting? No. However, if you know a little about Hemingway, it seems as if this is almost autobiographical. Not in the normal sense, but that he was talking about himself getting older and not being able to catch the big fish. Maybe this is obvious, I don't know. But when this book came out Hemingway had not had a hit (had not caught a &quot;big one&quot;) for a long time. But it all worked out. Hemingway got a Nobel prize shortly after this.

Through out the book Santiago struggles with himself to catch a fishand his 84 days of bad luck are taking their toll. But Santiago is very persistentand still goes out every day for the love of the sport. Most people would give upafter all the bad luck but not Santiago. Then Santiago hooks a huge marlin andeverything takes a huge turn. Day and night Santiago struggles with the marlinbut thoughts of being the talk of the town keep him fighting. Santiago's innerstrength is what makes this story so compelling. Although the book is short andeasy to comprehend the story is very sentimental.I would recommend this book to so many people, young kids and adults.Above all odds The Old Man and the Sea won the Pulitzer Prize. Hemingway inmy mind is one of the most powerful writers of this time. He usessimple words and sentences to form powerful meanings. In 1954 hewon the Nobel Prize for his powerful style of writing. I feel that he won the NobelPrize for The Old Man and the Sea. Hemingway's most well knew and best storyis defiantly The Old Man and the Sea.

While one has to acknowledge that stylistically he was one of the most influential authors of the Century, it seems to me that his literary reputation really rests on Old Man and the Sea and the Nick Adams stories, everything else is just psychosexual, faux macho, posturing. That said, you could do a hell of a lot worse careerwise than produce one of the best novellas and several of the best short stories ever written.The Old Man and the Sea is another one of those texts that you were assigned in 8th or 9th grade, largely as a function of the author's stature and the brevity of the book (see also Of Mice and Men, Orrin's Grade: A+). And, of course, your teacher analyzed all the Christian symbolism, from the bleeding palms to the marlin carcass as Cross. Allow me to take a little different tack.I recently had the great displeasure of reading The Affluent Society (John Kenneth Galbraith)(Grade: F). Mr. Galbraith argued that as Western society reached the novel stage of being affluent, that is producing enough goods to meet the subsistence needs of every member of society, we would inevitably rebel against the notion of work, our work hours would dwindle, people would demand four or even three day weeks and many would opt out of the workplace all together. We now realize of course that this was the idle prattle of an effete twit. Instead, the past fifty years have seen the massive entry of women into the workplace (as a form of liberation no less) and folks working well past retirement age and the past five years have seen the government demand that even the chronic unemployed get jobs or lose benefits. How could Karl Marx and Galbraith and all those liberal thinkers have been so wrong about what motivates people? It is quite simply a function of their dependence on materialism. This blinded them to cultural and spiritual influences on mankind and they failed to reckon with these forces.Hopefully, nobody who has ever read The Old Man and the Sea could possibly fail to understand that, for most people, doing a job well, even, or especially, a physically taxing job, provides an abiding sense of gratification and self worth. Most of us are not alienated from our labor, we are challenged by it. Because of the dignity and grace that the old fisherman, Santiago, demonstrates in rising to face the challenge--his exhibition of hard won skill and his determination in the face of overwhelming odds--this book reaffirms the indomitable human spirit and reminds us of the possibility of encountering the sublime in every day life and in the most lowly of labors and laborers.There is more insight to the soul of man in the scant 127 pages of this book, than in all the volumes of Marxist/Socialist pablum spewed forth in the past 100 years. It is a fitting tribute, on the Centennial of Hemingway's birth, that we remember him for this great tale.GRADE: A+"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I read this book in high school, and decided to see what I'd think of it now (trying to keep the image of Spencer Tracy out of my head). Well, this is one very bad novel. What happened? The two main characters are so stereotyped and the writing is so 'precious' (almost as though Hemingway had been inhaling some VERY mellow stuff) that it seems as though it were done by a ghostwriter. I've read that the book is a metaphor for the negative responses Hemingway's later work was given by reviewers, hence the old man is Hemingway, and the sharks are the critics, but that doesn't relieve the bad writing of its 'badness.' It seems hard to believe that a writer that could capture so accurately the culture and world views of Spaniards, French, Italians, ex-pat Americans could depict Cubans as though they were cartoon characters, but that's what seems to be the case here. I'm guessing Hemingway was trying something 'experimental.' That's fine. It's fine if the experiment isn't a success. But with the books celebrity comes its use in curricula across the land, and it would be a lot better to introduce students, at least, to the Hemingway of the Nick Adams stories, which are accessible as well, but not to the point of such goofiness. However, I hear that 'A Rose for Emily' is still used in high school and colleges as a Faulkner introduction, so either the same teachers who assign both these 'losers' have no taste or they are getting even for the misery they experienced in grad school."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea by Ernest Hemingway is a story about quiet determination in the face of insurmountable odds that would overcome a person who was not as courageous as the novel's main character, Santiago. Santiago is a fisherman who has not caught a fish in eighty-four days and is beginning to feel the effects of being fishless for so long. He is very thin and weak, and had to sell most of his fishing equipment, and someone has to give him food for him to eat. The bright spot in his life is a boy named Manolin. Manolin used to fish in the same boat with Santiago, but after forty-two days of not catching a fish the boy's parents made him switch to a luckier boat against his wishes. The boy still felt obligated to the old man in a way a son loves his father, and takes care of him, making sure he eats, and had blankets to sleep with, and that sort of thing.Hemingway creates characters with a lot of depth like Manolin; he cares for Santiago even though he doesn't have to and fishes for a lucky boat. This is indicative of Hemingway in the sense that he likes to create characters through action and dialogue and not so much from digressing commentary on the side, you only get a feel of Santiago by how he catches the fish and what he says to himself as he is catching the fish. Hemingway also uses a lot of imagery throughout the book that allows the reader to get a sense of what he is talking about without a bunch of detail that most writers of his era used. The way Hemingway describes Santiago's Cuban town and Santiago himself are both good examples of this, a line from the novel reads, \\"That afternoon there was a party of tourists at the terrace looking down at the water among beer cans and dead barracudas.\\" This line clearly gives the reader a vision of the poor and disheveled town where Santiago lives. The Old Man in the Sea also was laden with symbolism that was subtle, yet just obvious enough to catch the reader's attention. The birds Santiago sees while fishing is the best example of this as they show freedom and prosperity, two things Santiago is striving for. My favorite character was Manolin because he is very dependable and is always willing to help Santiago.The character I felt I could most relate to was Manolin, \\"the boy.\\" He would rather have stayed on the boat with Santiago regardless of whether he was catching fish or not, but his parents would not let him, and a boy must yield to his parents. My father is much the same way, making decisions for me whether I agree with them or not, but I must go along with his wishes no matter what, because he is my father. And that is how Manolin and Santiago both feel, that Manolin must agree to his father's wishes simply because he's his father. Hemingway does this a lot; he creates characters the \\"every day person\\" can identify with.The book, stylistically, is not appealing to me because, even though I like the short-and-to-the-point works of writers like Hunter S. Thompson, Ernest Hemingway's style leaves too much to the imagination. I like to read a book where authors try out their ability to create beautiful language and Hemingway just does not do that. But, I felt he tried to get across a good lesson in the novel, and that was to have courage. A person cannot go through life always being afraid, and Santiago was the one of the most courageous characters I have ever read. So, I like it for its message, but not for the way it was written.This novel is an easy read, and would be perfect for anyone that feels they cannot read a lot of books because the authors make it too difficult. I would also recommend this novel to people who enjoy adventure stories, because this story is one long adventure. And personally, I would recommend this book because Hemingway gives a good message in it everyone should think about."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Somebody read me The Old Man and the Sea.

I knew there had to be some more to it because no one writes a book about a big fish and then it is destroyed. After have a long discussion with a friend, I relized Hemingway used the bible as his background. I couldn't exactly tell you how, but it ties in with God. If you read, you see that the old man's hands get hurt &amp; bleed, just as if they were nailed to a cross. I think the old man represented Christ. I'm not really sure what exactly the fish was, but as you notice the sharks keep eating the fish away. It now makes much more sense. I am sure when I return to school, my teacher will give a full explination. I would recommed you think the book over before you give such harsh judgement. He didn't win the Nobel Prize for an awful book!"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I really loved this book. I don't read much, but I heard it was goodand.

When I picked up this book, and found it to be written by Hemingway, I expected it be a superlative masterpiece of fiction, as is usually the wont of a renown author. However, this book disappointed me to some extent. The story itself was quite good, beautifully portraying one of life's great struggles in the form of an old fisherman's struggle with a marlin. But, the style in which the book was written was what really disappointed. I expected a fantastic, descriptive style, yet found a simplistic, and almost annoyingly abrupt one.

The old man and the sea may go down as his best. He was able to portray so many symbols in this story. For example the old man, Santiago was like Christ and his disciple was the little boy. Another symbol is the old man always dreamt about lions in on the coast of Africa, I think this resembled his strength when he was young and able to handle large jobs. The final symbol is the old man and the boy cared about nature. When the marlin was being attacked by the sharks, Santiago kept on apologizing to the fish for going to far out.Some people may not like the book because it is mainly an old man in his boat out at sea battling with a marlin.I really enjoyed this book and I fell that alot of other people would enjoy this book also. This book was so great it won Mr. Hemingway a Pulitzer Prize."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This book totally ganks. It is so gripping and so simple.

Santiago did leave me pondering the barriers I could break if I put only half as much dedication to my goals as hid to his, however the messege well taken, I still had to muster up alot of dedication to get to the last page.

But consider this : Hemingway probably does more with less than any author in history with this novella. Take a few hours to read it, then a lifetime to enjoy."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The novel, The Old Man and the Sea starts out on a very peaceful and smooth note. The story takes place in a small Cuban city on the coast however most of the action happens in the Gulf Stream. It seems to be a mostly poor town with the given descriptions. There are only two main characters in this book Santiago and Manolin. The novel is about fishing and the adventures Santiago faces while fishing, but it has an underlying message of pride, faith and luck. Mr. Hemingway goes into detail on the hardships old Santiago faces when he goes out to sea on the 85th day without catching anything. On his journey he encounters a giant Marlin and many sharks. He has some good luck and some bad luck on his journey through the ocean. This book though short is one of the main reasons that Hemingway won the 1954 Nobel Prize.The old fisherman Santiago had not been lucky at sea for over 80 days; this can be identified as the major conflict in the story. He had lost his everyday companion at sea, Manolin. Manolin's parents believed the old man to be a failure and wanted better things for their son. Although this did keep the two from working together it did not keep Manolin from seeing Santiago. Everyday Manolin helped Santiago bring his fishing equipment home from the boat. This shows his loyalty to the old man. Manolin always tries to do something to cheer Santiago up after an unsuccessful day; he buys him a beer or just sits with him and talks. They both enjoy talking about baseball and the great Joe DiMaggio. He is the only one in the story who really cares for Santiago. He is beyond doubt a trustworthy character.On the 85th day of not catching anything Santiago sets out like every other day. He goes to the Gulf Stream where most of the story takes place. Little does he know that he will catch something great today. After sailing far out in the gulf Santiago notices a man-of-war bird and he knows from experience that there has to be fish below, he spots a 10 pound tuna which he catches and uses as bait. This one catch can not even compare to what Santiago will catch soon. As Santiago is sailing along father and farther into the Gulf he feels a jolt at once and realizes that he has caught something big. After a while he realizes that he has hooked a giant marlin. He is overjoyed that he has caught it; but he prays to God that the fish stays on the line. At this point in the story Hemingway starts to disengage the reader by going into tedious details about the catch.After almost three days of being out at sea and being pulled along behind the fish, it starts swirling around in the water. Being extremely tired and fatigued Santiago tries with all his might to catch the fish but has a hard time doing it. Continuously the fish swims around the boat. On the third swirl the giant marlin starts going underneath the boat and it starts swimming away. This is the point in the book where there is the most action and excitement. Hemingway starts to engage the reader more into the story with this event. Although he did catch the fish it was not an easy task. It is pretty fascinating to read about how he goes about catching the fish. He realizes that now he has to tie the fish up to the side of the boat. He is overjoyed that he caught the fish but at the same time feels somewhat sympathetic towards it. This can clearly be identified as the greatest highlight in the story. He believes that the great Joe DiMaggio would be proud of him that day. There is an overwhelming ferocity of human spirit during this part of the book. This makes the book all the more interesting and exciting.Even though he has made a major accomplishment by catching the fish Santiago still has more adventures and hardships before he finally reaches home. The catching of the fish signifies that the resolution of the story has almost been reached. He will find trials and tests on his way that will make him a stronger person. He will do things he never in his life thought he would do. Santiago has a tendency to never give up and that is what makes him distinct. Most characters would give up and just go home. But Santiago has a goal and works towards it.While this book may look like an easy read it has a deeper meaning. Hemingway uses simple words to convey a very deep message. The novel was not just about an old fisherman going out to sea and catching a big fish. It is about his struggles and pride, faith and luck. Hemingway makes the reader look deeper than just the text of the book. He sends a message to the reader in this book. Pride is shown through Santiago catching the fish and killing the sharks. Faith is shown by Manolin having faith in Santiago and Santiago having faith in himself to catch the fish. Finally, luck is shown by Santiago actually catching the huge fish by himself with no help.Overall this was a good novel. It is simple but it has meaning to it. The whole story keeps the reader engaged and wanting to know what happens next. Of course there are some points in the story where Hemingway loses the reader, but for the most part it is engaging. It is a classic by Hemingway that has earned him much respect and credit. Although it only has two main characters the characters are very well developed and vital to the true meaning of this story. This book has many angles that any reader can relate to. For these reasons I give this book 4 stars out of 5. I believe this to be an appropriate rating, the reason being that this is a very well planned and thought out book.This Summary/Review was written by: Samer Ijaz"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Santiago is a Cuban fisherman version of John Wayne, who despite his bad luck has more determination and optimism than he deserves. Much of this novella is devoted to the struggle of catching a fish, then the battle of who will wear out first - fish or man? This battle lasts for more time than you would think possible, until Santiago recounts an arm wrestling match he had in his youth, and then you realize Santiago is not a quitter. You live through the physical pain of the catch and the gritty determination. To endure the pain, Santiago amuses himself with thoughts of the great Joe DiMaggio. And just when things look good, your heart sinks when predators arrive.This book is surprisingly easy to read, yet captures the heart of man. A must read."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"On a recent vacation to Mexico, I was looking for a book to read while sitting on the beach. Something short, something easily digestible, but not vacuous. I chose this book because it had been on my \\"list\\" for years, and the beach seemed like the perfect place to read it. I had no idea what it was about, besides an old man and the sea.It is a wonderful story. I could not get over how deeply you can look into the allegory. I'm not going to say anything specific about the tale. But now I know why Hemingway is a masterful author. Highly recommended for anyone, any time, anywhere. However, looking up from the pages to see the Caribbean Sea stretch out to meet the horizon makes it even better."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"My opinion of old man and the sea is that it was a pretty good book . It was short and interesting. The best parts of the book were when the sharks were attacking the marlin and tearing it apart while the old man tries to kill them. The main charicter in the book is very interesting. He is an old man who hasnt cought a fish in 84 days even though he is very precise. He thinks alot about baseball and talks to him self alot. I liked the fact that he hooks a large fish and then spends days brining it in only to have it torn apart by sharks on his way home. It makes you sympethize with the old man. The setting of the book was pretty good. It took place in havana. As for the fish itself, it was 18 feet long and the most beautiful fish the old man had ever seen. He tasted it and said it would be very good at the market. Overall i really enjoyed readint this book, its very interesting with the old man, the huge fish and what happens at the end when all the people see such a huge fish."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I'll make this short.This was a short, quickly read book and a very worth while read.

When I unwrapped the package and took a look inside the book I decided to read the first page to get an idea of how it was written. I sat in the same chair without getting up and read the entire story without stopping. I enjoyed it so much I bought several more books by Hemingway as well as a book about him. A fantastically talented yet troubled author, it's clear to me why he became so famous."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This is literature at its best. Hemingway's deceptively easy and simple writing stile makes this a pleasure to read. Sweet."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea is another one of those texts that you were assigned in 8th or 9th grade, largely as a function of the author's stature and the brevity of the book. And, of course, your teacher analyzed all the Christian symbolism, from the bleeding palms to the marlin carcass as Cross. Allow me to take a little different tack.I recently had the great displeasure of reading The Affluent Society. Mr. Galbraith argued that as Western society reached the novel stage of being affluent, that is producing enough goods to meet the subsistence needs of every member of society, we would inevitably rebel against the notion of work, our work hours would dwindle, people would demand four or even three day weeks and many would opt out of the workplace all together. We now realize of course that this was the idle prattle of an effete twit. Instead, the past fifty years have seen the massive entry of women into the workplace (as a form of liberation no less) and folks working well past retirement age and the past five years have seen the government demand that even the chronic unemployed get jobs or lose benefits. How could Karl Marx and Galbraith and all those liberal thinkers have been so wrong about what motivates people? It is quite simply a function of their dependence on materialism. This blinded them to cultural and spiritual influences on mankind and they failed to reckon with these forces.Hopefully, nobody who has ever read The Old Man and the Sea could possibly fail to understand that, for most people, doing a job well, even, or especially, a physically taxing job, provides an abiding sense of gratification and self worth. Most of us are not alienated from our labor, we are challenged by it. Because of the dignity and grace that the old fisherman, Santiago, demonstrates in rising to face the challenge--his exhibition of hard won skill and his determination in the face of overwhelming odds--this book reaffirms the indomitable human spirit and reminds us of the possibility of encountering the sublime in every day life and in the most lowly of labors and laborers.There is more insight to the soul of man in the scant 127 pages of this book, than in all the volumes of Marxist/Socialist pablum spewed forth in the past 100 years. It is a fitting tribute, on the Centennial of Hemingway's birth, that we remember him for this great tale."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I'm one of those who just revisited this novel after many years. I thought it a very good novel the first time I read it, and this time around it was even better. The writing and the characterization are phenomenal. Hemingway was one of the greatest short story writers of the 20th century, and this novel shows he was also one of the best novelists of all time.Anyone who finds this novel boring needs to look within themselves for the cause. The problem certainly isn't with this novel. It's exciting, moving, realistic, and a tale no one else could have told half as well.I'm extremly glad I came back to it when I did."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I gave this book, The Old Man and the Sea by Earnest Hemmingway, four stars because I thought it was a pretty good book for us to read in school. At first I thought it might have been boring because it is all about one man and 3 days of his life trying to catch a fish, but it was very intense and exciting mostly the whole book. Hemmingway did an excellent job making a fishing trip exciting. His writing was extremely detailed throughout the whole book which made it very easy to read. He shows this when he is describing the old man in the beginning of the book and says \\"The old man was thin and gaunt with deep wrinkles in the back of his neck. The brown blotches of the benevolent skin cancer the sun brings from its reflection on the tropic sea where on his cheeks\\" (9-10).Not only was the description very detailed, the characters were developed very well. I really liked how there was only two main characters in this book because that is all he needed to get the message across to his readers. He shows how developed the characters are when the boy, Manolin, say to Santiago \\"You must get well fast for there is much that I can learn and you can teach me everything\\" (126). This shows what the boy's relationship with the old man is like; they are close and really respect each other. He also showed the character development of Santiago when he says \\"I can do it as long as he can...\\", the he he is talking about is the marlin shark that he is trying to reel in (53). He is showing how devoted he really is to what he does for a living and how he feels about life in general.Originally I thought that the plot was going to be kind-of boring because it was just about one fishing trip over three days but it ended up being very exciting. I really enjoyed this book and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wanted to read a well written, exciting, short book."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Some interesting parts :But, he thought, I keep them with precision. Only I have no luck any more. But who knows? Maybe today. Every day is a new day. It is better to be lucky. But I would rather be exact. Then when luck comes you are ready.He was thirsty too and he got down on his knees and, being careful not to jerk on the line, moved as far into the bow as he could get and reached the water bottle with one hand. He opened it and drank a little. Then he rested against the bow. He rested sitting on the un-stepped mast and sail and tried not to think but only to endure.But you haven't got the boy, he thought. You have only yourself and you had better work back to the last line now, in the dark or not in the dark, and cut it away and hook up the two reserve coils.So he did it. It was difficult in the dark and once the fish made a surge that pulled him down on his face and made a cut below his eye. The blood ran down his cheek a little way. But it coagulated and dried before it reached his chin and he worked his way back to the bow and rested against the wood. He adjusted the sack and carefully worked the line so that it came across a new part of his shoulders and, holding it anchored with his shoulders, he carefully felt the pull of the fish and then felt with his hand the progress of the skiff through the water.I wonder why he jumped, the old man thought. He jumped almost as though to show me how big he was. I know now, anyway, he thought. I wish I could show him what sort of man I am. But then he would see the cramped hand. Let him think I am more man than I am and I will be so. I wish I was the fish, he thought, with everything he has against only my will and my intelligence.He was comfortable but suffering, although he did not admit the suffering at all. \\"I am not religious,\\" he said. \\"But I will say ten Our Fathers and ten Hail Marys that I should catch this fish, and I promise to make a pilgrimage to the Virgin of Cobre if I catch him. That is a promise.\\" He commenced to say his prayers mechanically. Sometimes he would be so tired that he could not remember the prayer and then he would say them fast so that they would come automatically. Hail Marys are easier to say than Our Fathers, he thought.Christ, I did not know he was so big.\\" \\"I'll kill him though,\\" he said. \\"In all his greatness and his glory.\\" Although it is unjust, he thought. But I will show him what a man can do and what a man endures.After he judged that his right hand had been in the water long enough he took it out and looked at it. \\"It is not bad,\\" he said. \\"And pain does not matter to a man.\\"It has more nourishment than almost any fish, he thought. At least the kind of strength that I need. Now I have done what I can, he thought. Let him begin to circle and let the fight come.\\"I have no cramps,\\" he said. \\"He'll be up soon and I can last. You have to last. Don't even speak of it.\\"The sea had risen considerably. But it was a fair-weather breeze and he had to have it to get home. \\"I'll just steer south and west,\\" he said. \\"A man is never lost at sea and it is a long island.\\"\\"Get to work, old man,\\" he said. He took a very small drink of the water. \\"There is very much slave work to be done now that the fight is over.\\"Then his head started to become a little unclear and he thought, is he bringing me in or am I bringing him in? If I were towing him behind there would be no question. Nor if the fish were in the skiff, with all dignity gone, there would be no question either. But they were sailing together lashed side by side and the old man thought, let him bring me in if it pleases him. I am only better than him through trickery and he meant me no harm.\\"But man is not made for defeat,\\" he said. \\"A man can be destroyed but not defeated.\\" I am sorry that I killed the fish though, he thought. Now the bad time is coming and I do not even have the harpoon. The dentuso is cruel and able and strong and intelligent. But I was more intelligent than he was. Perhaps not, he thought. Perhaps I was only better armed. \\"Don't think, old man,\\" he said aloud. \\"Sail on this course and take it when it comes.Perhaps it was a sin to kill the fish. I suppose it was even though I did it to keep me alive and feed many people. But then everything is a sin. Do not think about sin. It is much too late for that and there are people who are paid to do it. Let them think about it. You were born to be a fisherman as the fish was born to be a fish. San Pedro was a fisherman as was the father of the great DiMaggio.They had the scent and were excited and in the stupidity of their great hunger they were losing and finding the scent in their excitement. But they were closing all the time.He closed them firmly so they would take the pain now and would not flinch and watched the sharks come. He could see their wide, flattened, shovel-pointed heads now and their white tipped wide pectoral fins. They were hateful sharks, bad smelling, scavengers as well as killers, and when they were hungry they would bite at an oar or the rudder of a boat. It was these sharks that would cut the turtles' legs and flippers off when the turtles were asleep on the surface, and they would hit a man in the water, if they were hungry, even if the man had no smell of fish blood nor of fish slime on him.\\"Ay,\\" the old man said. \\"Galanos. Come on galanos.\\"Now, he said to himself. Look to the lashing on the knife and see if it has been cut. Then get your hand in order because there still is more to come.\\"I wish I had a stone for the knife,\\" the old man said after he had checked the lashing on the oar butt. \\"I should have brought a stone.\\" You should have brought many things, he thought. But you did not bring them, old man. Now is no time to think of what you do not have. Think of what you can do with what there is.I cannot be too far out now, he thought. I hope no one has been too worried. There is only the boy to worry, of course. But I am sure he would have confidence. Many of the older fishermen will worry. Many others too, he thought. I live in a good town.\\"Don't be silly,\\" he said aloud. \\"And keep awake and steer. You may have much luck yet.\\" \\"I'd like to buy some if there's any place they sell it,\\" he said. What could I buy it with? he asked himself. Could I buy it with a lost harpoon and a broken knife and two bad hands? \\"You might,\\" he said. \\"You tried to buy it with eighty-four days at sea. They nearly sold it to you too.\\"I must not think nonsense, he thought. Luck is a thing that comes in many forms and who can recognize her? I would take some though in any form and pay what they asked. I wish I could see the glow from the lights, he thought. I wish too many things.\\"The ocean is very big and a skiff is small and hard to see,\\" the old man said. He noticed how pleasant it was to have someone to talk to instead of speaking only to himself and to the sea. \\"I missed you,\\" he said. \\"What did you catch?\\""},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"\\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" is a narrative with a complex perspective. Although our class has differing opinions on the enjoyability of this novel, we can all admit that it is a great classic for a reason.It lacks spark and action -- or does it? While it might not be as exciting as \\"The Hunger Games,\\" it does explore morality in a subtle way."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This book was fine. I enjoyed the book and I was rooting for the main character. I was hoping that the main character will win the fight. I do not want to give too much information about the book. I hope you enjoy reading this book"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"There are a lot of negative reviews about the book being slow and possibly boring. If you've ever been fishing then you know you may go all day (or 84 days) without a catch or a bite. But if and when you get that bite, things can come at you quick and you fall back on what you know. If the fish is more than anything you've ever dealt with, your common practice is out the window and you wing it. Perhaps that is what Hemingway has put before us and I enjoyed this perspective. He does an excellent job in his description of Santaigo's experience, his pains, and his mindset throughout the book. Page 110 Santiago struggles with his own conscience to keep his head in the fight \\"Now is no time to think of what you do not have. Think of what you can do with what there is.\\" Those are the thoughts of a man with experience, knowledge, and grace under pressure.However, my biggest criticism has to be some of the symbolic meanings in the book. Many believe the end results of the old mans fishing journey tells us that through all of lifes struggles, we never give up... that it's worth it to fight. I can appreciate that, but I have a hard time getting over that for such an experienced fisherman, Santiago came unprepared for work. I understand this is no ordinary fish as Hemingway has explained, nor did Santiago set out for this big of a catch. But the old man continues going further out to sea, further away from his norm of how he fishes, without key pieces of equipment, without Manolin. Ofcourse if this does not happen, we will not have the same story, but it angered me to have to believe that Santiago would take things to the limit the way he does considering his age, considering his physical condition worsens, and how he never seems to consider the sharks until an hour after he has finally taken over the Marlin. So I get it, the \\"elements of life\\" reduce his prize catch to nothing. In the end all of the marvelors looking over the skeleton of the Marlin can only imagine what Santiago had to endure. If that end result is to be \\"celebrated\\" or seen as triumph, I guess it is just not for me. The older I get, the less risks I seem to take so I guess my attitude or outlook spoils my overall appreciation for The Old Man and the Sea. All in all, I have a great appreciation of Heningway's description of the ocean and fishing. The book left me wanting more of the lifestyle in the saltwater, but I can't consider this as one of my favorites. I can say that I came to appreciate it more after having read it a second time."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This the best book about a fish getting away that I have ever read. Every time I read it I wonder again if the fish is going to get away this time. And it always does. But that's the sign of a genius (Hermingway); when you read a book and think maybe it will end different each time. Personally I really like fish. Old men, not so much. But together, old men + fish makes for some good reading. Final score: Fish: 1. Old Man: 0. And it's really short!!"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Give me tales of unrequited love and I will weep, name you author of the decade; give me tales of overcoming tremendous challenges and I will cheer, name you author of the century. I am a sucker for hard-earned success and so are you. Aren't we all fishes in the sea lured by a story of triumph? Hemingway's novella is hard to dislike, but very easy to dismiss as simple because of its accessible style. The occasional description flashes out of a page, such \\"But she can be so cruel and it comes so suddenly and such birds that fly, dipping and hunting, with their small sad voices are made too delicate for the sea.\\" But really, it's about the characters--'people Hemingway has always been excellent at creating. The old man is crafted with enough believability--'despite his unexplainable clairvoyance--'for us to invest in his vicissitudes. I felt his victory as palpably as I did his tragedy. As for the boy: what do we do about the boy? It is hard to determine whether the boy possesses faux-complexity'as do the characters in \\"Hills Like White Elephants\\"'or true depth, as in the characters in \\"The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber.\\" I do suppose it is up to you to decide, as it should be.The prose is easy to follow, so is the vocabulary. The symbols, however, are difficult to interpret as they allow for us to push meanings onto them. Are we to look deep or is a cigar a cigar? As all good literature, THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA offers multiple levels of analysis. A shallow reading is satisfying'it is a good story'and an allegorical reading is satisfying."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea is an iconic short novel by one of America's most recognizable twentieth-century authors - equal parts compelling narrative and profound universal truth. Hemingway spins a tale that can be taken in at face-value, read metaphorically, or interpreted philosophically. Essentially, it is a man-vs-nature tale, but as it deals primarily with the old man, it comes across a bit existential - not the pessimistic existentialism of someone, like say, Kafka, but the optimistic existentialism of someone who knows what he must do and does it, and although the old man might not be in control of the outcome, and might even expect it to end badly, he refuses to abandon his task. The work is short, and can be digested in a few hours, but oh, what a beautiful way to spend an afternoon."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Classic Hemingway - great story, depressing ending. This book was published in 1952 and was his last work of fiction to be produced and published in his lifetime. The success of this book was a significant factor in Hemingway's selection for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1954. The book centers around an old Cuban fisherman named Santiago who has one of the great struggles against a giant marlin. For days he battles with this great fish and once he lands the prize and begins his journey back to land the story turns to his battle with the sharks who attack the great marlin which is strapped to the side of his little boat. Santiago does not win the battle with the sharks and returns home with only the skeleton of the great marlin in a quasi-victory to demonstrate not only his own personal achievement, but also the greatness of the sea itself."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This is the book that got me hooked on Hemingway! Truly a great work."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"A great story communicated in a non-traditional manner. Though some find Hemmingway depressing, I find that his method of delivering a message ensures that anyone, despite their background, can relate and grasp the meaning"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Ok, this is the first Hemingway I've read so I'm by no means plugged into his body of work. I will say that the tale is incredibly delightful. It somehow manages to be an epic complete with hero in a novella's length. It is a tall tale that is quite realistic. It has a tragic yet triumphant ending. The book shows the reader what is possible with your life and should be required reading in order to inspire people to live up to Santiago. I can't wait to explore Papa Hemingway some more!"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"On the outside, The Old Man and the Sea appears a simple tale of an old man in an epic battle with a giant marlin. On the inside, however, there lies so much more. Through a strong set of Christian symbols, Hemingway throws the reader deep inside the complex world of his religious beleifs. With this dimension added to the story, it is hard to stop thinking about what Hemingway actually meant with these symbols. In other words, the novel provokes a great deal of thought. Along with these symobols, Hemingway creates an admirable character in Santiago, the old fisherman. It is hard for a reader not to gain an emotional attachment to him, and this attachment makes the novel hard to put down as the reader is continuously pulling for Santiago to come out victorious. With the book's short lengh and simple diction, it is easy to &quot;fly&quot; through the pages. The reader's thirst for the ending is satisfied quickly, and Hemingway does an excellent job of keeping the reader genuinely interested throughout the whole thing. The novel forces the reader to look inside himself as he watches Santiago battle his internal impulses to give up his battle all together. With this, the novel has an inspiring quality which helps the reader learn a good deal about not only himself, but about mankind as a whole. I strongly recommend this book to anyone. It has everything from a good story line to a deep meaning all in just over 100 pages. With its short length, I suggest reading it twice, once to get the story, and once to go back an look closely at the symbols held within. It is by no accident that this novel stands as one of the classics of all time."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I think that this story is like a lesson, because the author tells us, about many things that we have to learn in life, like patince and bravery.The author is omniscient, but he doesn't give his opinion and I like this because I can to have my own opinion.I recomend this book because you will have a new point of view about how to survive in this world."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"What a glorious work. Not a wasted word. Not a single distraction. Stripped of all artifice and affectation. He leaves only the very essence - of art, of life, of creation.In reading the various reviews, it seems that many young people have read this work as part of their class curriculum. It pains me to see how so many of them have had their perception of it directed - no, constrained - to the wrong things. Their teachers should be ashamed of themselves. They have taken something exquisite and eloquent and unadorned, and coated it, suffocating its splendour with &quot;symbolism&quot; and &quot;interpretation&quot;. The Old Man and the Sea is not about symbolism. It's not about Christ parallels, or communing with Mother Earth, or the price we pay for ambition.It TELLS us, clearly and poignantly, what it's about. And we must have the humility to take it at its word. It's about struggle, and courage, and pity, and proving something to the only two beings that really count in the end - our Maker and our Self.There's nothing complicated in any of this. And Hemingway strives to reflect these simple, yet powerful truths in language that is likewise simple and powerful. He succeeds beyond measure.To properly understand this work, we must actually oppose modern teaching. We must resist the temptation to analyse. We must strip away bombastic complexity and artifice. This is a story about essences. It is set away from civilisation, in the majestic vastness of the sea, precisely so that there can be no distraction, no adornment, no artifice. Adding such elements does not further the understanding; it only pollutes.As is true of all great works of literature, this one is not for everyone. If your depth extends no further than low-rent thrills, then don't bother. You will find this book boring. Similarly, effete intellectuals need not apply. There's nothing here that appeals to cheap cynicism, nor to cowardice masquerading under the guise of sophistication.This story is a great man's parting gift to you and me. It speaks with pity and a deep sorrow to those lonely acts of courage, large and small, about which no one will ever know. Only our Maker and our Self. What a masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Honestly, I didn't enjoy it when I forced to read it in sixth grade. But hey, at that time I found Who's the Boss interesting. Now that I've matured, and reread this book 10 years later, I realize that this book is a true epic battle between courage of a man, and the forces of nature and age.Hemingway's greatest work, this 120 page novella can be easily read in a single sitting. In fact, it's more of a challenge to put it down than to keep reading.On the surface, this book is very touching and exciting - a man struggling to win over great odds. On a deeper level, it's a representation of human courage, survival, and instinct in its greatest form. It is a true multi-dimensional book.In other words, this is greatest novella ever written."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"If you like adventure, suspense, and excitement, then you should read &quot;The Old Man and the Sea,&quot; by Ernest Hemingway. This book, The Old Man and the Sea, is a very great book. Even though is only one hundred twenty-seven pages, it still fully explains itself. It is a very easy read for sixth through eighth graders. The reason I say eighth graders too is because I am one. But not only they or I can read it, but everyone can. If you are an parent or adult, I recommend it for you to read it to your children. If you are a procrastinator, then a highly recommend it to you for a book report book. It has large words to a certain extent, but if it is a non-heard word, it will tell what is means. In this book Ernest Hemingway uses a lot of figurative language. It was published in 1954, and won a Nobel Prize for Literature. It is one of the best classical novels written by Ernest Hemingway. It describes everything in detail so it is easy for you to picture what it looks like. If you were to read this book you could maybe understand figurative language clearer. This book is basically about a eighty-five year old man that goes out to sea and all different things happen to him while he is out there. Because of what he did it made him famous and everyone respected him for that. I hope that you would enjoy this as much as I did. If you are a Christian, like me, I think will help you to be a Christian because the old man never gave up and always prayed and ask God for help. If you are not a Christian than it still would be a good book for you to read."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Hemingway's The Old man and The Sea was an enjoyable book for me to read. I appreciated his simplicity in writing, and his to the point style. At first I was unclear about the purpose of the book and was unfufilled after finishing it, but after thinking about it in depth I began to appreciate the book more and more. Hemingway's simple language and uncomplicated storyline make the reader strive for the deeper meaning. This meaning is found within the symbolism of the story and anlysation of events. Within this simple story about a man who catches a fish are an array of complicated issues and deeper meanings. To me, Hemingway's genius is deeply apparent."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"So much of Hemingway's work paralleled his own life, this story is no different. Santiago the old man losing his ability to fish as he did in youth; Hemingway the aging writer without quite the literary prowess of his earlier years. Yet both of them are tied by the unpopular opinion that they have one 'big one' left in them. As the pages turn and the story unfolds, the reader discovers the poorly kept secret that they were both right. A lyrical story of poignance and import. An elegy for our greatest narrator. Well done."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This book is absolutely wonderful! To some it may seem like a simple story about an old man that is determined to catch a fish, but its so much more than that! When I read it for the first time, I felt Santiago's (the old man) pain. Every time that he got hurt or when the sharks were attacking his beautiful fish, I felt the weight of his trials and of his dispair at the end of the book. There is so much great symoblism in this book. It's not a weak book because Hemingway really knew what he was talking about and he definately had something to say about man's struggle with nature and human nature itself. This book is good because it takes hold of your emotions and senses, and makes you feel like you are actually there. I think that that's what makes good literature good."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"I am ashamed of some of my peers who denounced Hemingway and his Old Man. Within these few pages, Hemingway depicts the struggle of life and the war between man and nature brilliantly. His syntax is by no means &quot;choppy.&quot; Hemingway purposefully writes in the manner he does and that is what makes all his material beautiful. Anyone who puts down Hemingway,and especially this story, should be taken to the gallows. If you are young and do not like this, I strongly suggest storing it in your memory and picking it up when you are a little older...that goes for those young'ns who DO like it even...Its definitely a story that takes some experience to appreciate.

This review will tell what makes this book such a great edition to any bookshelf.This book is a very exciting and surprising. Truly this book was very shocking as shown on pg. 62 when the great marlin jumped out of the water into the basking sun. The book tells of an thrilling battle between man and fish. Another great event is when the old man is protecting his fish from the Galanos (sharks) because they can smell the raw bloody body hanging into the water. In fact, the book had breath taking events for instance, when the old man sees just how big the fish is and realizes he is going to be in for a fight of a lifetime. These are some of the great events that take place in The Old Man and the Sea.The Old Man and the Sea is a very simple book. Truly this great piece of work could be read by a 5th grader. The author Earnest Hemingway does not use figurative language at all in the book. The book has a very simple story line that is very easy to follow along with. That is what makes the book The Old Man and the Sea so easy to read.This book has a lot of great turn of events some small some big and some gigantic. Earnest Hemingway uses his great talents as a writer to make this book spin every which way. Some of the small turns are for instance, when the old man told his friend the boy that he was not going to eat but he ends up eating. A bigger event is that the old man is a very unlucky fisherman and on the day that he goes out on the sea he catches a nice size tuna before hooking his larger prey. The 2nd biggest turn of events was after the 86 days of no fish the old man catches the biggest marlin Havana Cuba has ever seen.Those are the elements that make Earnest Hemingway's The Old Man and the Sea such a good book.

Knowing that his persistence has paid off, he respects the fish and does everything not to hurt the fish. On his long trek home, Santiago's great catch is mauled by sharks and Santiago realizes even more how precious the marlin was.

I feel the book was good for both its time and style. The book fit its time well, considering how well Hemmingway described the technology and craftsmanship they had. Hemmingway's style was great in describing in detail everything that happened. The book was true to its theme, I thought, in saying that persistence pays off. Santiago proves while catching the marlin that persistence does pay off. Also with everything that's happening to Santiago, he kept working hard to achieve his goals. Hemmingway uses great descriptions in Santiago's problems, to say that persistence pays off.Hemmingway's way of writing brought out the story to make it seem somewhat real. Also his way of writing brought out the effects of the story in a great way. He used great detail, and made sure to accurately describe everything. He used descriptions that set the pace of the story and made sure the reader could picture what was happening.

This is one of the many things that the Man (Manolin) and the Nature (Marlin) share between each other or in other words, symbolize in each other. It's impossible for characters to just become alive. They must have a master or in stories point of view an author. The author of the book The Old Man and the Sea made the story a very intriguing book to read because of the struggles of Man vs. Nature keeps the story exciting with curiosity and interesting topics.The story has a lot of interesting facts and causes solid curiosity. But what facts are shown? What curiosity is given? How do the facts keep the book so interesting?Hemingway had the ability to take the story being so descriptive and making it feel like you were an actual character in the story. The fact that Hemingway has been so affective in writing and also has the capability of making one sentence from a kindergartens point of view into a marvelous story that is comprehensible for all ages.Hemingway keeps the story electrifying and energetic. The way the Marlin and Santiago are persistent keeps the story going. Man versus Nature is one of the key elements to the story. Being that the fish and man are both so persistent keeps the conflict between the two the main best moment in the novel. The book stays dynamic throughout the novel because of the author's potential in detailing his writing. The author's ability to turn a made up story into a well thought out story makes you feel like you're actually in the story, which is an incredible accomplishment. Having the ability to do so makes it interesting. Makes people wonder what else the extraordinary author can do.Relating to this story can be difficult. But with a writer like Hemingway and the ability to make the story more liable and related to life it's possible for all ages to relate to. Hemingway seeks for relationships between the Man and fish. I think this makes it easier for as an audience to relate towards the story. Santiago and the Marlin being persistent make it easy for the audience to relay towards the story.Hemingway's ability to judge the actions of Fish and man make it easy for us to relate. I think this makes it easier for us as an audience to relate towards the story.The author makes the story exciting because he uses clues from the Fishes actions and the Man's actions to make the story cause curiosity.

He also makes the story easy for the audience to relate to because he is able to judge the actions of the fish and Man.Hemingway's style of writing is unique and influential in many different ways. His ability to take an imaginative story and turn it into a masterpiece is unbelievable. In doing so, this makes me believe that The Fish (Marlin) and The Man (Santiago) share many things and in a way if you look at it in a different perspective.........are brothers!"},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Perseverance and determination. These are words that describe Santiago, the old man who is down on his luck in the book, The Old Man and the Sea. Santiago and his young friend Manolin haven't had the best of luck lately, but all of that is about to change. Ernest Hemmingway deserved the Pulitzer Prize for his wonderful portrayal of Santiago, the old man who just needed a break. Hemmingway's writing springs to life as this American classic grips the hearts of young readers, sucking them in to this novel with amazing force.The story of the old man and his trying heart is one that churns up raw emotion from readers from all walks of life. The story is that of an old man that has been down on his luck, it has been \\"eighty-five\\" days since the old man last caught a fish (19). Santiago and his young companion Manolin are starting to lose faith in the fish that they had been streaming in, the months before. On the eighty-fifth day Santiago goes out on his own, he finally finds a fish, not just any fish, but the most enormous fish in all the sea. This fish takes him on the journey of his life. Through ups and down, trials and tribulations, Santiago stays with the fish, and learns a lot about himself in the process. He becomes so obsessed with catching this fish that he puts his life on the line. Moreover, \\"Ill kill him, that fish, in all its greatness and its glory\\" as he becomes frustrated after many days at sea. To give away the end of this story would be like robbing Hemmingway of his right to surprise.Gut wrenching thrills and honest heart-tugging emotion are Hemmingway's toys; he plays with this masterpiece, making it a playground for great literature. For instance, \\"They were hateful sharks, bad smelling, scavengers as well as killers, and when they were hungry they would bite at an oar or the rudder of a boat\\" (108) Hemmingway wrote. The details are plentiful and make you feel like you are sitting in the boat being attacked by sharks along with Santiago. A young reader could easily fell as though they are a part of Ernest Hemmingway, almost as if they had with them a little piece of Hemmingway's soul, for it was always in his writing. He uses emotion in his writing to help the reader fell the spine jolting excitement and thrills that are displayed so often in Hemmingway's writing. For example, \\"The fish was coming in on his circle now, calm and beautiful looking, with only his great tail moving,\\" (91). The old man is emotional about the great fish; Ernest gets on to his characters making them feel true pain, his pain. This book is a joy to read and I would encourage others to do the same.While I was reading this book I felt as though I was in the sea right along with Santiago, feeling his pain and his happiness. I would recommend this book to anyone who was interested in great literature. I wholeheartedly thought that this book was a deserving candidate for the Pulitzer Prize."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Simplicity. This is the word that describes The Old Man and the Sea, a book with few, but meaningful, words. It is a glowing book because of its unique style that captures the reader's attention.There are many real life situations that help the reader relate to the position that Santiago, the old man, is in. The determination of Santiago when he is fishing is that of mine while learning how to ride a bike. For example, Santiago kills four sharks in order to help save the marlin, as well as his dream to catch this great fish. His struggles with the sharks are like those of everyday life. Along with determination, some readers can also relate to the guilt the old man has for killing the fish. For instance, Santiago is constantly apologizing to the marlin for ruining him. Many people do things that they regret, the way Santiago did. There are numerous relations that the reader can make with the characters in the book.The layout of the book adds to the interest of the reader. First, the story starts out describing the main character, and then tells about the struggles that he has. I feel that it is necessary to learn about the characters in a book before it gets to far down the road. This book has many things in common with other stories, but has originality that &quot;beefs&quot; it up. The rising actions lead to an exhilarating climax that takes the reader to another world. As soon as the sharks start eating the fish, Santiago's hopes and dreams of bringing the marlin in are destroyed. It is heartbreaking when the sharks eat the fish. The plot of the story complements the style of writing Ernest Hemingway uses.The Old Man and the Sea is a book that encourages the reader to pursue their dreams. It creatively adds to the plot of the story and helps the readers relate to what is going on during the book.

Although the book is in depth and very mature, it can be enjoyed by individuals of all ages. While experiencing this Hemmingway masterpiece, I was captured and intoxicated with the vivid images that his description threw into my mind. The Old Man and the Sea was well thought, organized and instilled a sense of understanding unmatched by that of even movies.The Old Man and the Sea was constructed in a way that can only be fully understood by an author of equal quality, but can still be felt by a reader that wants nothing more than a good book. For example Hemmingway has been to Cuba; several times he has also fished there very often. The Old Man and the Sea could have only been such a success with Hemmingway's experience. If the author would have been of no experience the book would lose; enthusiasm, strong voice, excitement and fluency, the book would have been a failure. Also giving the relationship with Monolin and Santiago, and how they couldn't, inspired a sense of longing. The longing that is sensed raises a question; of will that gap of longing be filled. This mere subtle fact of the book proves the books ultimate supremacy. The book is very short and descriptive; it is a good book for a reader that wants nothing else.To read The Old Man and the Sea is to fully experience and be Santiago fishing in the Gulf Stream for a marlin, the first catch in 84 days. For example words like \\"sudden lurch\\", \\"dark red meat longitudinally from the back of the head to tail\\". Words like these paint images in the mind, crystal clear and as it is pictured it is sensed, felt and experienced. This kind of description lifts the reader in the air and puts them at the setting it is the driving force of the books quality. Also Santiago has spent a great deal of time in his boat, about half his life. Events like these fully explain the characters personality. They let you know how they react to certain events, and what they think about various things. The Old Man and the Sea gives you a chance while at your home or work place, to visit Cuba for a dayThe Old Man and the Sea was well deserving of the Pulitzer Prize. The book The Old Man and the Sea was a milestone in American literature, it will for ever change the way I look at reading. Although at a low reading level the book has a mature feel making it a good read to all ages. The Old Man and the Sea is for the reader that desires nothing more than a good book."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea deserves every award it has received. Hemmingway uses his originality and personal experiences to create a literary masterpiece. The Old Man and the Sea is a classic tale of fate and determination, yet Hemmingway's style is what makes it so enjoyable to read.The plot provides a suspenseful journey through bad luck and hardships. \\"The Shark came in a rush and the old man hit him as he shut his jaws.\\" (114) This gives the reader a feeling like they are actually experiencing the same thing as Santiago. This makes it easier to relate with the characters. My favorite part of this intriguing tale was when Santiago came home and proved his skill with the skeleton of an 18 foot marlin. Satisfaction is one of the many feelings that overcome the reader after reading this book. Some feel satisfied, by an old man's dream to end an 86 day record.The author uses his characters in a unique way to express a deeper meaning. Such as, how Santiago and the marlin symbolize each other. The marlin symbolizes Santiago in his will and determination to never give up. The marlin fights through hunger, pain, and his stubbornness to not let go without a fight, which is not unlike Santiago. Yet another symbol is the vulnerability between the attacking sharks and Santiago. Santiago is vulnerable to the harassing fisherman and the sharks are vulnerable to Santiago's beatings. Unlike many authors these days, this book doesn't give you the literal meaning. Instead, Hemmingway makes the reader think and react to the story. This in turn, makes it exciting.I would defiantly recommend this book to anyone that wants to read a heartfelt adventure of an old man against his luck. Hemmingway's style adds to the excitement and drama of this epic tale, by using deep meanings and an unusual plot."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Shark attacks. Hunger strikes. Desperation for food. Problems like this occur almost all of the time in Ernest Hemmingway's The Old Man and the Sea. Even though the story seems like it would be exciting, it is not the fastest of stories. The story that The Old Man and the Sea creates is slow but well written story.The story of Santiago is slow. For example, when the marlin was dragging him he kept repeating words about how he wished he had the boy, Manolin, with him and how he loved the marlin. It was so slow during these parts that I distinctly remember trying to keep myself awake. When the marlin jumped, I didn't realize the significance of it because the story was so slow and tedious. The only parts that had some real action in them were the shark attacks. I was so excited during these parts, both for Santiago and for the sharks, that I woke up most of the way. The description of the attacks was quite vivid and brought some sort of art to the destructive nature of the sharks. Even though the story was quite slow, it did have a few exciting parts that I enjoyed.The description of everything that happens is enormously creative. One of the pest descriptions of the whole book is that of the marlin. The way that Hemingway tells about the movement and color of it is captivating. I like how he \\"shows\\" the stripes on the marlins back and the sail fin that has on it's back. Santiago is also depicted very well. The way that Hemingway describes the face of Santiago is awesome. I was able to form a picture in my mind of what he looks like including the sun-burned eyes. The reason that this book won a Pulitzer Prize is obvious; it is wonderfully descriptive and well written.I love the way that Hemingway writes even if it is a bit slow. It is marvelously descriptive and has a wonderful choice of words that it to make it that way. Even though I liked the book, I would not read it again and don't plan on reading more of Hemingway's literary works. This book is very creative, but I would not want to be a writer like Hemingway."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea is one of Hemingway's best pieces. This book has been so well written that a fourth grader could read and comprehend this glorious book. The Old Man and the Sea is a fantastic story about an old Cuban fisherman who has years of bad luck and his enormous catch. This basic plot alone can not make a great novel. However, Hemingway found a stimulating way to add detail without overwording his ideas. This is a very important part about his style of writing that i like because of the ability to read a simple plot book without fighting to keep your eyes open. What i like also about Hemingway's writing style is how modern day society still relates to the society in his books. For example, the old man's will to catch the fish: even while the fishing line is cutting his bear hands, has no food to eat, harch weather conditions, and isolation from other people. This can be related to people that are willing to give up spending time going out to study day in and day out for a test so they can go to the best college. I believe what I enjoyed most about reading this book is that he was ok with sleeping in a one-room hut, that he was ok not catching fish in a long time, and that he was ok that people completely disregarded him. The las thin I liked about this book is the way Hemingway switches betwwen reality, the old man's thinking, and the old man's subcontinents. All in all I think this is a great book for anyone to read."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea is one of Hemingway's best pieces.

Many will already know the general plot of this story as the heroic struggle of an man past his prime against the elements and tribulations. I think the irony of the story is that the old man was defeated neither by the fish nor by the sharks, just as he was an undefeated arm wrestler in his youth. Still, he was forced to reconsider in his old age that dreaded question. \\"And what beat you, he thought. 'Nothing,' he said alound. 'I went out too far.'\\" Therefore, did the man defeat himself or was it simply Fate that pinned him? In the end, the boy cries, and there are only those African Lions of the dream world."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This is a story about a simple man, with simple ideas, with a simple life, with a simple, elemental encounter with the natural world: he catches a massive marlin that he battles unsuccessfully to bring to market. It is a tale of success in the midst of failure, of quiet stoicism and courage, and refusing to give in to the challenges the world throws at him. Most of all, it is a story about courage.It is an excellent tale of how a man can overcome great tasks and survive terrible tragedies, while still having a will that is not defeated but rather presses on. The great task in this story is catching an extraordinary and noble fish.A story of an elderly fisherman who catches his greatest fish after days of bone-wearying battle only to lose it to sharks.After heading out to sea, he realizes he is in for a greater challenge than expected. The old man, Santiago, encounters a battle with a great creature of nature and the elements. But, it doesn't end there. The struggle to get home after being beaten by the elements is the greatest challenge of them all. The old man shows his endurance and determination by remaining calm in the face of danger.Santiago of Hemmingway is the oldest fictional fighter I have read or heard of to date . That fact makes him at least one of the inspirations to all the writers or real life warriors to follow him ."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The Old Man and the Sea is one of my favorite books.

The author seems to take great strides in telling a fish tale that could symbolize many things in life. This could symbolize man's battle and relationship with nature, man's determination, the shortcoming of men in realizing their dreams, and even the life of Christ. If you want to read a book with many level of symbolism, pick up this book. If you are like me, and you are more interested in a good story, there are many others that I would suggest picking up. If you are into both symbolism and story, pick up some George Orwell or the Bible.

This book demonstrates good morals, such as determination, perseverance, and believing in yourself. It also showed friendship that was very strong, it almost felt like a children's book.

However, I do not believe that Hemingway intended to entertain the reader, nor did he intend to put them to sleep. What he was trying to portray to the public was a much deeper theme than that of man against nature. True, that was included, but the theme excelled beyond that of those parameters. As a personal opinion, I believe that he took us to the depths of human nature and provided us with an incredible microcosm that touches on many aspects of life. To me, he was trying to express that everybody has an impact on the rest of humanity. Some people that take the time to recognise the worth of that one person can see some of the majesty of the individual. (Manolin, Martin) However, others, through ignorance and self-sightedness can deprive society of that same insight. (the tourists) The symbolism is incredible. Yes, Hemingway's style does not appeal to everybody, but through it he strived to emphasize certain things. The simplicity of the style indicates that Santiago's struggles happened to a real person, and not so much to a fictional and unapproachable literary figure. So, to the people that felt that the book was boring, please don't degrade it because it is difficult to understand. Truly, it is a very deep work that is difficult to grasp. However, please try and see the &quot;method to the madness&quot;; you may find that it is a great work after all.

Upon getting the fish to take the bait, he engages in a three day struggle, in which not only nature, but his old body work against him.Then as the fish wears down, he is reeled in and killed,leaving Santiago the winner. But despite his victory, the great fish is devoured by sharks, as if the sea was spiting him for taking one of her great creatures."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"This short novel was the winner of the 1953 Pulitzer Prize in Fiction. It was required reading in one of my high school English classes and is still required in many schools over thirty to years later. Many believe it was the publication of this book that assured Hemingway of winning the 1954 Nobel Prize in Literature. This book is a parable of man's struggle with the natural world and the inherent dignity of a man. An old Cuban fisherman named Santiago takes his small boat out into the Gulf of Mexico and has a battle with a giant marlin and with several sharks. He has to deal with his own weaknesses, with nature, with loneliness, and with his own mortality. It is a great novel and a reader can get much out of it with a little effort. I also feel that I have to respond to some of the comments from those earlier reviewers who rated the book with low scores. The book isn't about fishing. It's about man. Hemingway hadn't written a book for ten years. But, as soon as this comes out, he picks up a Pulitzer Award and the Nobel Prize! An earlier reviewer from Kansas (May 30, 1999) commented that Hemingway was no Jack Kerouac or F. Scott Fitzgerald. I love both those writers; but, they weren't even nominated for the Nobel. And, to the Canadian reviewer of March 29, do you actually think that Philip Pullman himself would classify his works, as enjoyable as they are, greater than those of Ernest Hemingway? But my most impassioned response is to the bizarre comments of the reviewer of May 11, who awarded &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; five stars. After reading his comments, I went through all of the earlier comments, attempting to find what he was referring to. Except for grammatical errors (such as ending my previous sentence with a preposition) or spelling mistakes (such as misspelling mispelling), I saw nothing crude or offensive. Don't we have freedom of expression here? Even though I may disagree with others comments and opinions, they still have this right. And, more power to them (and to amazon.com). But, what I found most bizarre from reading this person's comments was that it would appear, from reading his last sentence, he awarded the book five stars yet hadn't even read it! At least those who gave the text a low rating had actually read the book."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"The reason that I gave this book three stars was because it was a good writing.

I liked the way the author made the story a little more interesting, the way he explained the old man being there for three days and all the details he had in that section.

That is why I gave the book a three because there were some good points and some bad points."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"A great, simple tale of a man at sea. Brimming with Hemingway's brilliant symbols, this short novel is a must read.After reading it, I couldn't help but feel that the fish represented Hemingway's writing.

The sharks seem to vividly recapture the vicious criticisms shot at Hemingway from all sides following his most recent defeat.By the time the old man(and Hemingway) reach shore, there is nothing left but a few tales for the villagers.

My favorite part of the book was when he used his harpoon to kill the first shark, a mako, that tried to eat the marlin because mako sharks are supposed to be the fastest sharks in the world and are very big. I was quite interested that an old man could kill one. I learned that marlins can be very big and that you have to be careful if there is a lot of blood from it because it will attract many sharks including makos and shovel-heads. The old man would not give up hope while trying to catch the marlin. If you don't stop trying, it can pay off.

Indeed this book is rather boring if you don't catch the subtleties of the story, and I don't think a lot of young people do or can catch them.I think teachers teach TOMATS in school for two reasons. One, it is short and uses simple words that all kids can read. Two, it employs the elemental conflicts of Man vs. Nature, Man vs. Himself and, to an extent, Man vs. Man (in this case, the village society), which are all pretty easy to explain. In other words, I think teachers teach this book to kids because it is easy to teach.But it is only ostensibly easy for kids to read. It is a story for adults. It is not an easy story, its plot is not overt, and it is not even really a fish story. It is a subtle story of the relationship between the old man and the boy, which relationship I think only some high school kids will be able to grasp fully. It would be most easily understood, I suspect, by adults with children.I urge younger readers who hate the book to put a reminder on their iPhones to read TOMATS again when they are 25 (the age at which I read it the second time) or even at 30 years old. At that point it will take them 2 hours to read, and they may discover a completely different book.Anyway, I think it's an excellent book, as others have expressed better than I could."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Wonderful reminder of a great writer.

At the same time, its still Hemingway and it has a very boisterous, adventurous quality to it.

Hemingway was America's leading author in the field of sports and adventure from the 1920s to the 1950s.Hemingway's novel takes place in Cuba during the early 1950's. The story shows us the determination of one old fisherman who struggles to regain the confidence and respect of his peers in a local fishing village. The novel also tells the story of a boys love for the old man (Santiago). The boy looks out for Santiago and deeply cares for him.The novel is a breath taking tale of Santiago fishing far out to sea off the coast of Cuba. The old man is by himself in a sixteen foot wooden skiff battling the odds of nature, physical endurance, and mental fatigue. It is a mental game between the giant Marlin he hooks and himself. As the old man respects and admires the fish, but he knows he must kill it and bring it back to the village. The suspense and action brings you to the edge. You can actually feel the physical pain the old man suffers from Hemingway's detail description on how the fishing ropes are cutting his hands to shreds.Santiago is an old poor fisherman who is past his prime and has not caught a fish in eighty four days. He has lost the respect of the younger fisherman as they laugh at him. The older fishermen feel pity for him. The young boy and the old man are like father and son. They use to fish together but as the old man's luck changed for the worse the boy's parents made him fish with a luckier fisherman. The separation between the old man and the boy is heartbreaking. As the story prevails with the old man longing for the boy's company while out to sea. The boy is overly concerned for the old man's well being and safety.The morning of Santiago's eighty fifth day of fishing he sets far out to sea to break his bad luck. The current takes him further out to sea then he wants to go. The following day Santiago hooks a large fish that pulls his skiff for several days. The battle between nature and man begins. Bear in mind that Santiago had this large marlin hooked and was fighting the fish by holding bear rope. It is mind boggling to think of such a technique as today's fisherman use advanced rods and reels. The struggle between fish and man continues for days.As the days go on and Santiago keeps his grip on the rope, he must eat and try and sleep. It is survival of the fittest and mind over matter. The pain that Santiago suffers from the tension of the fish is overwhelming but he blocks it out and continues the challenge. Hemingway makes you feel right there, inside the boat. It is quite obvious that Hemingway must have experienced something similar in his life. The detail that Hemingway narrates about the open sea and the wild life that inhabits it is no other then someone who has experienced it themselves.As you read on with great anticipation Santiago finally conquers the big marlin. With a great twist and nature's fate Santiago's victory is short lived or is it? On his long way back the sharks attack his marlin. Santiago is helpless as they overwhelm his efforts. The old man finally arrives back at the village with the fish's skeleton tied to the side.Hemingway does not make Santiago a loser as many may think. The old man is actually a winner. As the village people see the eighteen foot skeleton in the morning, they have new admiration for the old man's conquest. Most important the boy and the old man are a team again. The two would be happy as the old man would no longer be alone on the sea. The old man's luck had changed he had beaten the biggest fish he had ever seen."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"What a great story, but the introduction gives it all away.

I love Hemingway's style of prose, but I have to admit that I just didn't really like this novella very much. It would have been much better as a short story in a collection or anthology instead of a full novella. I'm not saying its bad, its just that I had high expectations because I love most of Hemingway's other books(For Whom the Bell Tolls is my favorite), but this felt weak and repetitive. I dunno, read it for yourself and find out. Nothing is wrong with the binding or the paper or the printing.

He's had bad fishing luck for many days. Most the story is his fishing trip alone on a small boat. He struggles and faces obstacles without complaint. There is a dignity to him. I cried in the scenes with the boy. The boy knows the old man has no food. The old man says he will eat later. He does not ask for help. The boy brings food and they quietly eat it. The boy loved and cared for the old man with such respect and esteem. That really pushed my buttons. I've never been loved like that. It's the way an ideal parent would love a child.My two emotional reactions. I was sad to experience the old man's struggles and pain, yet I was inspired and admired his determination and actions. Then I cried as I watched the love from the boy. A slight comfort came in the way one feels after crying.This book was the catalyst for Hemingway winning the Nobel Prize which probably influenced me to give it 5 stars.NARRATOR:Donald Sutherland was wonderful.DATA:Narrative mode: third-person.

The young lady is an avid sailor and is going to the Coast Guard Academy, so I thought the book appropriate and one that would remain in her personal libraby."},{"Title":"The Old Man and the Sea","review":"Short but brilliant novel. In my own opinion the muddled mess our education system have made of this book is a shame. If you aren't patient enough for a less than 100 page novel, don't bother picking this book up and misinterpreting its importance. Simple, elegant and filled with Hemingway's genius."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Best of Paris (Lonely Planet Encounter Series)","review":"This book had a number of problems, including wrong address information for several sites, mislabeled maps, etc. The suggestions made were as per usual with LP guides, excellent, but when the map and direction goofs adding so much time in looking for things in the book or on the wrong streets, the advantages of having a pocket guideare quickly lost."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Best of Paris (Lonely Planet Encounter Series)","review":"...then this book is a must-buy. Much information is wrong and/or outdated. I'm convinced that the author(s) didn't actually spend any time visiting the places in this book; rather, they either copied verbatim every press release they got, or took payment for placement in this book.When I travel, I want insider information, and accuracy. This book provides neither. Example: The once-famous Le Caveau jazz club (recommended as one of \\"the best,\\" per this book) is an overpriced tourist trap, that claims to present jazz, but its music is anything but. Prepare to spend $20 euros on lousy beer and corked wine. Or, better yet, just avoid anything this book recommends. The \\"Amelie Cafe\\"? (les deux moulins) -- bad coffee, lousy service. skip it. Yes, I know Europe is different, but every other place we visited had better wine, coffee, etc.Avoid lonely planet. And while you're at it, skip the \\"let's go\\" series, too. We did far better with Frommer's, and Access is always on the ball, but Access tends to recommend the higher-ticket items/places."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Best of Paris (Lonely Planet Encounter Series)","review":"The content is the typical LP-fare, well enough if you don't have that much time in Paris. But the maps (which you need to make this book useful) are of a so lousy resolution that they get all fuzzy and illegible on an iPad. There is always a link to the google map, fine - but mobile internet abroad is horribly expensive and therefore not a legitimate alternative for a decent offline-map in the book itself. The navigation inside the book could be better as well, in an e-book it is plain annoying to have to follow two or three links for a detailed description, and the bookmarks can't be named but show only the first few lines on the bookmarked page (so if you have bookmarked it because of a recommendation further down the page you will not recognize your own bookmark). Therefore: hands off the e-book version!"},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Best of Paris (Lonely Planet Encounter Series)","review":"I had to reference other books- Lonely Planet France had more to add- and funny how the two books have different opinions on some things (like which store has better chocolate?) And don't plan to use the map on this one- its miniscule. The only advantage is- its small and easy to lug around versus other travel books."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Best of Paris (Lonely Planet Encounter Series)","review":"Just wanted to comment on the crappy the lonely planet tour guide for Paris. I found this particular edition exceedingly difficult to navigate and to contain several aweful suggestions, especially the restaurants. The guide doesn't flow well, and one quickly finds themselves turning pages endlessly trying to coordinate location with destination. I have always been a devout lonely planet traveler but now it looks like something has changed and overall it seems to me that the writers have not traveled to the places using their guides or at least considered following their guides, i.e. they have not thought about walking a mile in our shoes. I would suggest going it alone over going with Lonely planet. However, you judge, give it a try, see how crappy the Lonely Planet Paris guide really is, support what appears to be corporate greed and a lack of investing in fact finding when it comes to travel guides."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Best of Paris (Lonely Planet Encounter Series)","review":"I love this book! I'm going to Paris for a couple of months this summer and I went to Barnes and Noble and sat down with a stack of about 10 different Paris city guides... and this one was the best. It's full of great color pictures and a ton of cool sights and restaurants and things I'd never heard of but can't wait to try. Buy this book if you need a Paris guide!

The book is organized very well and most of our itinerary we took straight out of the book. It also has great maps that made it easy to navigate the city (with the heart of Paris being able to be discovered on foot). I also bought the Lonely Planet China and have so fat found it incredibly useful. LONELY PLANET ROCKS!"},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Best of Paris (Lonely Planet Encounter Series)","review":"The Lonely Planet Encounter series of travel books is my favorite, and the Paris edition is no exception. It's THE book to have if you plan on being in Paris for a few days and need the best highlights of the City of Lights.It's broken up into easy-to-understand sections, based on the most popular Paris neighborhoods. The easy-to-read maps are also wonderful, as they show the best in restaurants, museums, shops and more, and clearly ID Metro stops that make getting around Paris a breeze.Finally, it's the perfect size--it easily fits into a cargo pocket or back pocket of a pair of jeans...no bulky book here.I only wish Lonely Planet would publish more cities in this format, especially Rome. But if Paris is on your agenda, you must buy this book!"},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Tantric Sex, 2nd Edition","review":"If you are on this page and intend to buy this book it means that either you already know some things about tantra (in this case I suggest you to discover deeper meanings of tantric love by reading other books) or you want to make a change in your life and bring something new and meaningful.

Reading this book will make you become more interested in this field and willing to discover new valences of what 'sex' can be."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Tantric Sex, 2nd Edition","review":"I absoultely loved this book for the many practical suggestions given. It's written in terms a lay person can understand even if they've never read anything about Tantra. Not only does the author explain the complete scope of Tantra, she gives you quick blurps of things you can do to get started on a Tantric path. This book is written in a style that allows all readers to comprehend a concept which could truly save our world. People need love and often want to connect with their loved one in the deepest of intimate ways. Let's face it, we all want to know more about we can have magical sex but most of the time it feels like there is something missing, like there must be something more. You will learn what \\"the more\\" is. Sex is something we think about often but rarely have a place we can talk openly. How is one to learn those very things that could give you the kind of sex in your life that you desire? Reading this book has the potential to change your life in a big way.If you find your attention wanders and you really aren't in to reading for long periods of time, you can pick up this book and read for as little as 5 minutes and get something out of it. I doubt you will be able to put it down after 5 minutes though because the content is stimulating and leaves you wanting to know more.This book is written in a style which makes it possible for anyone to comprehend the concept of living Blissfully. It could help bring us to world peace if we could all learn how to come from our hearts. It will teach us how to make love from our hearts. It will also help woman overcome old programing that sex might be anything less than our birthright. This book truly makes the connection between sexuality and spirituality. WOW"},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Tantric Sex, 2nd Edition","review":"This book is easy to follow and gets you started in the tantric practice easily. The content is sequenced in a way that flows, and actually makes it easy to follow through the learning stages. Dr. Judy doesn't leave out the spiritual part, neither does she overwhelm you with it, as I've seen in other Tantra books that are a bit \\"hippie\\" and over the top. Spirituality is very much a part of this book, though understated.I was pleasantly surprised to find a Tantra book by Dr. Judy - I have been a fan of hers since the '90s when she was on Love Phones. I had no idea she had any knowledge of Tantra. I love the way she breaks down the concepts - easy to digest for the greenest of novices, but with enough interesting content to feed the more knowledgable readers. Kudos to Dr. Judy for bringing Tantra to mainstream America :)----------------------------------------------------Re: the guy complaining that this is not \\"real\\" Tantra: this books is meant to bring Tantra to the mainstream, not to get devotees to an ashram. Keeping that in mind, it fulfills its purpose.As for the poorly-written, one-star reviews above, please note: the purpose of writing a review is for (guess what??) THE BOOK. That's why the guidelines say \\"Your review should focus on the book's content and context.\\" You should not be reviewing Amazon's technical flaws or Dr. Judy's perceived character flaws here. Unfortunately reviews such as these lower the avg rating of books that deserve better, and all for nothing because they arent' even about the content.

It will allow you to explore the limits of your sexuality, and trust me...the results are mind-blowing.

Because books and schools that teach SEX make alot of money.They have taken something beautiful and turned it into trash. I know, I studied the same distorted teachings before I found out how off the mark it was. These people manipulate lonely people for money.Tantra is a path to walk, not about sexuality, except about uniting the male-female within, or the yin-yang, dark-light, etc.It's about becoming a whole person and none of these people do anything but distort Tantra to make money off it selling SEX!!Read here if you want more information about healthy Tantra:http://anunda.com/tantra/sacred-tantra.htm"},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Tantric Sex, 2nd Edition","review":"This is a not a review of the book. I met this woman over 20 years ago, just about when she was looking to break into radio talk. She struck me as someone solely interested in making a name for herself, with the least interest in the people she was advising.

I read it and it was amazing. I have been to Oxford on many occasions for many visits and such, but there was a ton of information that this book had that the average visitor would not know.

Anyone can have a fragmented life in today's conditions compared to decades ago. But, Lindberg discusses the topic in relation women. She offers some solutions for becoming more collected, calm, and centered - especially creative activities for onself. It seems to be good advice for anyone but this is only a small part of the book. Her analogies to sea shells didn't add anything for me. Her comments on feminism in the last chapter, which was added in 1975, give the impression that this is a book for feminists.If you want reading about calming your life, a good way to start is to read books by Albert Ellis. Two good ones are A Guide to Rational Living and How to Make Yourself Happy and Remarkably Less Disturbable. Another good book is A Guide to the Good Life by William Irvine."},{"Title":"Gift from the Sea","review":"Not what I thought it would be. I like a plot from real life or from a good creation. Not much on philosophy."},{"Title":"Gift from the Sea","review":"I ordered this as a new book, but the one I received had a handwritten note in ink from a mother to her daughter on the first page. In addition, the book was very small, not the size of the usual softcover books I previously ordered."},{"Title":"Gift from the Sea","review":"Listed as a 'summer read' in a local magazine list - I hadn't heard of this book. I picked it up and finished it from one afternoon into the next morning. And -- there was nothing surprising or new to be found here in the book - the pace at which its written and the uncomplicated natural way Lindbergh examines her life and her impressions of life's stages will have me passing this book on to many people in my life."},{"Title":"Gift from the Sea","review":"I think mrs. Lindbergh thinks too much. She is educated to the max, andenjoys intellectual musings. She seems to be concerned about people not spending enough time alone, especially women. I think this book would have been better if given to my wife for a gift, that she could read at the beach while camping. I do not recommend it for men."},{"Title":"Gift from the Sea","review":"Excellent service; received book immediately and in excellent condition.

I received a book without the sleeve. This is not what I had purchased."},{"Title":"Gift from the Sea","review":"This book was last months book club read. While I think Anne Morrow Lindbergh was ahead of her time, I enjoyed her daughter's introduction to the book more. It was worth reading but it wasn't my favorite type of book."},{"Title":"Gift from the Sea","review":"This book came very highly recommended by two friends who are avid book readers. However I hate to admit that the book did not move me as much as my friends claimed that it moved them. I was more interested about the background references to the author's personal life and how the book came into being. That I would have read voraciously. The book is short but I don't intend to read it again to see what I missed. I believe a book either moves you or it doesn't. This particular book despite other rave reviews did not move me despite my great affinity for the sea and women writers. I wonder if perhaps if the book would have touched me differently if I read it in the beach rather than on a plane which I did."},{"Title":"Gift from the Sea","review":"Wow! What a great book. It was like taking another walk with my grandmother -- something I haven't been able to do since she passed away in 2002. While some of the specific details of Lindbergh's essays are out dated, they still spoke to me. The metaphor of the sea shell is a simple but powerful one. I ended up reading the book in the course of about half an hour."},{"Title":"Gift from the Sea","review":"I have read this book at least twice and find that each time I pick it up, although in a different stage of my life, I extract a whole different meaning. It's beautifully written by an elegant, educated woman who dared to speak the truth long before saying exactly how you feel was fashionable. She dared to elegantly express her feelings knowing full well what the ramifications for doing so could be. This book is a treasure and a wonderful gift that continues to give every time its' pages are turned. Enjoy!!!"},{"Title":"Gift from the Sea","review":"This is a book about life and living.

As a woman surrounded too much by the world,bombarded by too much information, mis-information, andnon-information I could read and reread this guide to theinner self year after year on a deserted island and nevergrow tired of its many gifts.

I will never let go of it, and often give it as a gift to other women. It reminds me to keep things simple and pay attention to what's important in life.

It is a quick read, but the author's thoughts may linger and continue to inspire you."},{"Title":"Gift from the Sea","review":"When I left home for college in 1978, my mother gave me a copy of this book. Some twenty years before, her mother gave her a copy of Anne Morrow Lindbergh's sweet musings of life as a woman. A few years ago, I bought a copy of Gift From the Sea to give to my own daughter who was leaving home for the first time. That this book speaks to multi-generations is part of its allure. People from my mother's generation will recall the Lindbergh's public tragedy of a kidnapped and murdered son. Although AML doesn't speak of this in her book, the knowledge of this awful event and what it must have meant to the author colored my perspective as a reader, adding to my respect for her essays. Gift from the Sea has become a legacy in my family; someday I hope to give copies to my grandchildren."},{"Title":"Gift from the Sea","review":"Gift from the Sea is a beautiful story about the author's summer of solitude on the shore.

It provides much food for thought and is a source of inspiration through her personal musings and easy flowing prose.

Obviously others have the same life experiences to consider and learn from."},{"Title":"Gift from the Sea","review":"I would not have believed that any book written in 1955 about women's problems could be so absolutely relevant today, and not only that, but says exactly what I believe about aloneness and solitude and how combined with nature, such solitude can truly refresh the soul. Deserves many re-readings. And what a novel idea, having many different types of shells represent the stages and relationships in a woman's life. It echos so exactly that line from \\"Bridges of Madison County\\" - \\"Once a woman marries and has children, her life becomes one of details.\\" How baking biscuits can be creative and renew the spirit."},{"Title":"Gift from the Sea","review":"I purchased \\"Gifts From the Sea\\" not sure what to expect, and as I write this I find myself unsure once again, but this time about how to describe it - let me give it a try...This beautifully written collection of \\"essays\\" has to do with the lives of women, and how many facets of our lives can be understood through the reflection of the various gifts from the sea - namely sea shells.Anne Morrow Lindbergh takes the reader on a journey with her to a private, and very personal beach vacation that took place sometime in the early 1950's. She went on this vacation by herself, in order to take time to relax & reflect. During this time, she noticed that each type of shell that she picked up had a \\"gift\\" - a way of looking at life that helped her to understand herself & other's better.She discusses the various periods in life that we all (or at least most) tend to go through, and what can be learned by each. One of the most important of which is to learn who YOU are.Overall, I would highly recommend this book to any woman who feels overworked &/or underappreciated in any area of their life - you may find a better understanding to your issues throughout these pages..."},{"Title":"Gift from the Sea","review":"I am enjoying this book as I pick it up and read a chapter or even a few pages at a time. It is thoughtful and thought provoking. I use it as a form of meditation. I read a few pages and let it speak to me.

Now I read it every Spring/Summer as a reminder of what's really important in life. Each time I read it a gain another helpful insight into myself and a perspective on my life. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to live a simpler, more meaningful life."},{"Title":"Gift from the Sea","review":"This book is thought-provoking and meaningful. It is deceptively simple, bringingto mind that old adage: 'big things come in small packages'.Lindberg examines women's need for solitude and inner focus. She discusses howwomen are often faced with competing demands and expectations on their livesfrom family and society. This creates conflicts and it is often the personal needsthat give way to the needs of others.This is the second time I've read this book and I know it will not be the last time.It is so easy to identify with her observations of how modern life fragments anddraws energy away from our centers. Lindberg explores how we need to focusand gain strength from solitude, aim towards being whole and reject demandsthat conflict with our most important goals. To do this, we must prioritize andaccept the importance of making time for ourselves.As a clinical social worker and marriage and family therapist, I find that this isone of the books I most often recommend to my female clients.

It is indeed as relevant today as it was fifty years ago and probably even more pertinent in today's fast paced world where we fail to slow down give ourselves alone time to comtemplate our lives.

There's a peacefulness that settles over you as Anne Lindbergh talks about shells, and oysters and the sand and sea.Interwoven with the talk about the sea are her observations on life. How modern gadgets complicate life, rather than simplify it.

I was quite the surprised when I opened the package, expecting it to be the novel but found the journal instead!At first I was upset and then I started looking it over. Now I really want the novel even more. It is a wonderful journal, Because of it's age I don't know if I will actually use it, for fear of messing it up. I am glad now that I have it though, and that I got it first. Otherwise I might not have ordered it at all. It is well worth it... Now for the novel :-)"},{"Title":"Gift from the Sea","review":"This is one of the best books I've ever read. In concise, philosophical and thought-provoking language, Anne Morrow Lindbergh provides the reader with wonderful revelations of what it's like to be a modern woman. As the wife of Charles Lindbergh, she certainly felt the constraints of public engagements and social events, as well as the demands of being a wife and busy mother of five children. Perhaps that is why she was able to provide such a keen insight into the value of solitude and creativity.Often, in our \\"busy-ness,\\" we forget about maintaining and growing as individuals. Every man, woman and child needs time alone, every day, in which to nourish his soul. What joy can be found in creative tasks, even if they are as simple as arranging a vase of flowers or baking a batch of cookies. Women, by their very nature, wish to give. Sometimes, we give so much of ourselves that the well runs dry.Anne Morrow Lindbergh used her valuable vacation time on a remote island to replenish herself. There, she embraced the simple pleasures such as watching the ebb and flow of waves on the beach, collecting shells on the shore and strolling on the sand beneath the twinkling stars. She didn't need curtains to shelter the windows, cooked simply but well, and performed household chores only as necessary. She lived in the present, like a dancer perfectly poised in the here and now. In this special time, she found her center, replenishing the wellspring of who and what she was.Rarely have I read such a wonderful book! Every woman should own a copy for her personal library and if men seek to understand the true nature of women, they should read it as well. I applaud Anne Morrow Lindbergh's foresight and her rare ability to put into words what I feel deep inside my heart."},{"Title":"Gift from the Sea","review":"My sister gave me this book on my 60th birthday. I had just moved to the mountains of North Georgia seeking solace from the craziness of the work world in over populated Florida. Sitting on my deck in the quiet of the forest was the best place to read a \\"Gift from the Sea\\". You don't need to read it all at once. As a matter of fact, I stopped reading it because life, even here in the mountains, got demanding. On the morning of my first day of retirement I picked it up again and started to read where I left off. There is a \\"master plan\\" because I started to read chapter 6, entitled Argonauta and it couldn't have been more appropriate for the phase of my life I was now entering. It is \\"the gift that keeps on giving\\" and is a book you will read over and over and give as a gift to your most treasured friends and family members.

Gift+Sea+Anne+Morrow+LindberghThis book is a treasure. Someone recommended it to me. Did I read about it on Oprah's Book website?? Anyway, it's a book I will always keep. The book is filled with priceless knowledge about the complexities of being a woman. Also, ideas about marriage, friendships and other relationships not being the same ole, same ole but changing entities in our lives.\\"And then how swiftly, how inevitably the perfect unity is invaded; the relationship changes; it becomes complicated, encumbered by its contact with the world.\\"There is so much in this little book I did not know. So much I want to ponder about on difficult days and easy, happy days. The book is about lives ever changing, renewing themselves. It is about me becoming comfortable with myself in order to enjoy solitude and in order to better love the people in my life. The book is truly a GIFT from the SEA.\\"When one is a stranger to oneself then one is estranged from others too.\\"I had a friend who sent me sea shells all the way from Virginia to Tennessee. She is no longer with us. I couldn't help but remember her while reading the book and looking at different seashells. After reading Anne Morrow Lindbergh's book, I will never look at sea shells in the same way. I never knew they owned such a deep story to tell about my life.\\"There are other shells to help me, to put in the row on my desk. Here is one I picked up yesterday.

Although it was written many decades ago, the challenges and issues faced by Anne Morrow Lindbergh are the same ones faced by women in today's crazy, bustling world. In fact, although women in Siberia, Cameroon, or Ceylon might not have her specific set of circumstances, they can still identify with Lindbergh's ponderings about a woman's life, her obligations, her relationships, and her needs. She lived in an upscale suburb of Connecticut and was the mother of five children, and yet there's something in her writing that can touch the souls of women everywhere whether in a grass hut or trailer beside a busy highwayThe chapters in Gift from the Sea center on Lindbergh's musings during a two-week vacation at the shore. Leaving husband, children, and house behind, she lives in a bare beach cabin without heat, telephone, plumbing, hot water, rugs, or curtains. She finds simplicity beautiful and longs to take it home to Connecticut when her vacation ends.Lindbergh takes a shell at a time and describes it in relation to other things in a woman's life. For instance, the moon shell reminds her that quiet time, solitude, contemplation, and \\"something of one's own\\" is needed. The double-sunrise represents the pure relationship found in early stages of friendship and marriage, and she reminds the reader that there is no permanent return to an old form of relationship since all are in the process of change. The oyster bed symbolizes the middle years of marriage and family, especially as the home itself grows and expands to accommodate the growing family.I first read this book when I was a young mother and could readily understand Lindbergh's comment that saints were so rarely married woman because of the distractions inherent in raising children and running a house. \\"Human relationships with their myriad pulls--woman's normal occupations in general run counter to creative life, or contemplative life, or saintly life.\\" Now in midlife, I can better understand her affinity for all the shells as reminders that each cycle of the wave, the tide, and the relationship is valid."},{"Title":"Gift from the Sea","review":"Wonderful book every woman should read. A great read about the ever changing stages and relationships in life and how to let go and embrace the change rather than hold on to the past."},{"Title":"Gift from the Sea","review":"I read this book about 40 years ago (and several times after that). I love how Mrs. Lindbergh spoke to any woman about life, love, children and loss. I seemed to have lost my copy during a move a few years ago and decided to replace it after all these years. It's as relevant today as it was 40 years ago and I can apply to my life today. She writes clearly and passionately.

In this book, she describes her vacation at a beach in New England. While there, she ruminates on the struggles that women face in marriage, parenthood, and life in general. She uses different kinds of sea shells to describe the phases of a woman's life. I first read this book more than 15 years ago and I have read it many times since. Although it was first written in the 1950s, many women reading it today can relate to what Mrs. Lindbergh has written in the book. One reason I have enjoyed this book is my admiration for Mrs. Lindbergh who, after living through the agony of having her and her husband's first child kidnapped and murdered in the 1930s, was able to move forward with her life along with raising a family with Mr. Lindbergh."},{"Title":"Gift from the Sea","review":"It is a timeless book of great wisdom, beautifully written.

That warning quickly went out the window when I picked up 'Gift From The Sea.' I grew up by the sea, and the words of this book sounded like an anthem to my soul. I have always recognized the intrinsic wisdom that swells like the tide when one hears the sea; allows its soft rush to sooth the tumult of one's heart. I felt that I read the words of a kindred spirit. Each essay was like a letter from a long lost friend. Her words were not so much teachings as gentle proddings to awaken the knowing soul within each of us. &quot;Gift&quot; reads like a psalm - melodic, reverent and quietly enlightening. Thank you for this prayer of a book and for bringing the smell of the sea to a city-stranded beach dweller."},{"Title":"Gift from the Sea","review":"This book somewhat flows the way a woman's life does.

The book has some wonderful insights about life in general, although I did not agree with all the conclusions. However, isn't that the reason we read--to learn new things and to challenge our current way of thinking. The book is about the reflections, while vacationing alone in a seaside house, of a woman living in the first half of the 20th century. A woman who lives in the upper class society (the top 1% in todays parlance). While many of her observations are valid, it would be interesting to know if she was able to live out her observations/reflections when she returned to the \\"real world\\" and if not, why not. As I said, this is primarily a woman's book, but an introspective guy might like it. Finally, the end of the book is poorly written--it seems to me that the author was not sure how to wrap it up and so just meandered to a close--thus, the 3 stars. The updated version of the book which has an introduction by the author's daughter really adds nothing to the originally other than giving some background info on the author--who was apparently an amazing woman. As the book continues to sell after all these years, it apparently speaks at a deeper level."},{"Title":"Gift from the Sea","review":"I'm afraid I'm going to get into trouble for writing this review because I believe I may be critical of one of the darlings of American Literature, especially a woman who was such a pioneer. For the most part, Gift from the Sea by Anne Morrow Lindbergh, the wife of aviation legend Charles Lindbergh, is a poignant meditation of a woman's life, her role, her place in society, her demands of motherhood, wifedom, and her needs for solitude and inward contemplation. Lindbergh writes from her own experience while spending time alone in a cottage on an island far from her mainstay life. Each chapter is the name of a shell on the shore that she collects and that inspires her musings on life. She also discusses her feelings on approaching middle age.Though the book is well written, and well thought out, I found it at times to be bizarre and disconnected from the real world. Lindbergh spends time alone on her cottage, near the shore, away from her husband and five children. At times she actually advocates being away from one's children for as long as a month. Now I know Thoreau did this or something similar when he lived in a tiny log cabin in the woods alone for 2 years and 2 months, but he was not married and had no children. I find this type of experiment quite detached for a mother, and I can't say if she began this habit when her children were young, but to advise such a thing to me was strange.Lindbergh makes many analogies between seashells and life and though at times I found it poetic and moving, all the pieces didn't connect for me, and I felt these analogies forced. I also couldn't help that she was writing from a place of privilege (was she really making her children's beds when she was born into a privileged life and married to a famed aviator?). Her message is engaging--find time as a woman to cultivate your inner life in your own space, similar to what Virginia Woolf preached in her essay, A Room of One's Own. But Woolf didn't have any children; Lindbergh had five. You don't go to a cabin and leave your husband when you have five children to tend to. Why would you have five children then? Could a middle class woman who has everyday childcare and household responsibilities really do this?Another bizarre clip: she keeps mentioning love affairs, and how if we as women don't cultivate our inner life, we may be rushing off into a love affair. She had mentioned this several times, peppered throughout her book. A woman who has normal family responsibilities does not easily rush into a love affair, as far as I know. But then again, who knows? I only have one young child myself. Gift from the Sea is a sermon that's quite original. As a woman of privilege, Lindbergh could speak this way, but many other middle class women couldn't live this Thoreauvian life she depicts by the sea. A cottage on the sea, by the way, is probably very expensive too."},{"Title":"Gift from the Sea","review":"This is THE book for your feminine lifetime. It is not only a journey.... it's an adventure... and a healing. (+ reality check!)"},{"Title":"Gift from the Sea","review":"The life of a woman is complex. There is more to it than an average woman might realize. Anne Morrow Lindberg is definitely one woman who does not easily overlook all that is included in the life of a woman. In the same way she does not leave aspects of the sea unobserved. In her book, Gift from the Sea, Anne Lindberg examines various articles of the sea and not only sees the objects as what they logically are, but also as how they relate to a woman's life. The book is beneficial because it has a good scientific focus while still retaining a profound literary outlook and it's detail and description is sensible.In the novel, Lindberg describes things such as shells and then cleverly uses her observations as analogies for life. The inclusion of the life comparison is how she attains the literary outlook that is present in the book. After describing the moon shell's \`smooth circles winding inward to the tiny core', Lindberg then states that it is a reminder that we must be alone even for an hour or a few minutes a day to remain in touch with our core. The observing of the double sunrise and how it has a hinge binding two shells together is ingeniously used as a metaphor for relationships.The book is not very difficult to read because it uses everyday terms and an extensive scientific background is not necessary to follow along with the author. Because Lindberg's diction is not difficult to understand, she can focus more on explaining each item and the description of each is more rational. Because Lindberg is not tedious in her describing of objects the reader's attention is kept throughout the book. They are illustrated until the reader has a clear picture of the item in their mind. Just as she has done this she goes into comparing the object to life and the reader is able to see how it relates to their own life as well.Anne Morrow Lindberg has written an enjoyable yet significant novel which many woman would enjoy reading. Her diction is colorful and to the point and does not allow the reader to lose interest or the desire to read on. The scientific focus is evident but not in excess, she has achieved a perfect balance between science and literature in her book, Gift from the Sea."},{"Title":"Gift from the Sea","review":"As the book progressed I found it tiresome.

That aside, the majority of the book that I actually read was absolutely fantastic. It made me think about who I am on the outside in contrast to who I am on the inside. It was absolutely intellectually stimulating. I would recommend this book for all ages."},{"Title":"Gift from the Sea","review":"My grandmother gave this to my mother. When I was in my mid thirties, my mother passed it on to me. Originally written in 1955, Anne Morrow Lindberg has captured a timeless understanding of the stages of life that women experience. Using the metaphor of the shells she finds on the beach one summer, Lindberg provides insight on topics like love, marriage, motherhood, the loss of identity, the subtlety of living and finding meaning in even the smallest events of life. Outstanding! Since I don't have a daughter to whom to pass this on, I only hope I can convince as many women as possible to obtain their own copy--or two: one to underline and keep on their nightstand, another to pass on to their best friend, mother or daughter."},{"Title":"Gift from the Sea","review":"I first listened to this book on CD and was surprised at how much I enjoyed it. It is pretty much just the musings of a wife and mother about her life and relationship with her family. She talks about her need for alone time, simplification of her life, and her marriage.

Anne Morrow Lindbergh's writing is as timeless as Shakespeare's. Although our society is much different now than in the 1950s, her thoughts are still as appropriate--in some ways even more so. From a literary standpoint, her use of shells to describe stages of life is remarkable!

In an all female college and a world that was both torn apart and boiling with changing roles, I found solice and an inner peace with the words that I must have read dozens of times that first year. Our challenge was to enter a world that required all the inner balance that we could achieve. The book for more than 35 years has been an inspiration and emotional challenge to me.I used the book's message as a theme, and quotes from it as chapter markers in the yearbook I edited for my college and it has been a standard 'right of passage' high school graduation gift to every special young lady in our family and among our friends.

She will restore your soul."},{"Title":"Gift from the Sea","review":"This little book is highly enjoyable. It is a unique form of self-help book. It doesn't bombard you with endless words about this or that problem (alcoholism, codependency, self-esteem, etc.) but gives the reader the desire to return to the basics of life. Isak Dineson wrote &quot;the answer to everything is salt water: sweat, tears, and the ocean.&quot; In those quiet moments of life, a simple act of contemplation on the basic objects around us can be so rewarding, so freeing. This is what Anne Morrow Lindbergh does in this little book. It is as much a book about prayer, as it is about the lives and issues of women. I am proof that one need not be a woman to enjoy this book. I enjoyed Lindbergh's ability to touch the numinous in so few words, to shift quickly in her meditation between the tangible reality and the intangible truth contained therein. I recommend this book to anyone (but especially a woman, Lindbergh's audience) who wants to understand just what at the core of one's life is truly important."},{"Title":"Gift from the Sea","review":"Gift From The Sea was first published in 1955 and was the best-selling nonfiction book of the year with 80 weeks on The New York Times bestseller list. I'm discovering it for the first time. It's simply lovely and is deserving of this new 50th Anniversary edition of 130 pages.It is obvious that the sea and the beach were an integral part of Ann Morrow Lindbergh's life as her writings are full of references to them.Gift From The Sea is a woman's poetic reflection about the challenges we all face in our relationships with our family, friends, the world and ourselves. They are her thoughts and ideas but are universal when thinking about the human condition.The introduction is written by Anne Morrow Lindbergh's son Reeve. Even 50 years after it was written, it continues to be fresh and filled with wisdom. It's a book to be read, savored and read again."},{"Title":"Gift from the Sea","review":"I am an author myself.

That a middle-aged Caucasian woman, writing during the 50's, could strike such a deeply-felt chord of sisterhood with me, a 30-something African-American woman living at the brink of a new millennium, is truly the mark of a gifted writer. We \\"enlightened, liberated\\" women of the year 2000 think, with a fair amount of condescension, that we have \\"progressed\\" so much from that time period. And yet, the issues Mrs. Lindbergh addressed are still very much with us today: how does a woman fulfill the roles of citizen, artist, wife/partner, mother, career person, friend, sibling/relative, and balance all of that with the time and self-commitment for spiritual/emotional nurturing?I have a quote from this precious gift posted on the wall at my workstation; it is a state of being I seek as a humble pilgrim on life's journey:\\"...I want first of all...to be at peace with myself. I want a singleness of eye, a purity of intention, a central core to my life that will enable me to carry out these obligations and activities as well as I can. I want, in fact - to borrow from the language of the saints - to live \\"in grace\\" as much of the time as possible...By grace I mean an inner harmony, essentially spiritual, which can be translated into outward harmony...I would like to achieve a state of inner spiritual grace from which I could function and give as I was meant to in the eye of God...\\"This is a must read for women everywhere!"},{"Title":"Gift from the Sea","review":"Not a book to race through! To be read slowly, alone, savored, re-read, meditated and mused on, with contentment. And if you can't find contentment, it will find you -- in Anne's words -- her gift from the sea.Anne Morrow Lindbergh's thoughts are woven around her impressions gathered from her ocean-side stay away from society and civilization -- from people and things -- from noise and confusion -- from musts and don'ts.What Anne discovers in her solitude at the beach, she offers to you the reader by way of her journal. The tiny shells she held and studied provide lessons to her and all of us.Anne's musings about life, relationships, love, busy-ness, aging, simplicity and solitude came to me several years ago at a time I was re-assessing many things in my life. Like a grace, her words soothed me and helped me quiet my turbulent thoughts, and to gather my inmost spirit to bind the wounds, to fill myself with the good already all around me and to go forward.I realized I could slow down my pace, choose my own path, ask for and expect some peace and quiet and harmony, because these gifts are there for all of us to enhance our lives.Although written from a woman's perspective, Anne's gift from the sea is for all of us who hunger for the slower pace, the garden path, the sanctity in God's every creation down to the intricate sea shell in Anne's hand as she coddles it, examines its artistic swirls and ridges and colors, and listens to the lessons -- the homilies -- within its delicate curves.A keeper of a book. You'll go back to this one, like to a favorite vacation hideaway or armchair by the fireside or corner in the garden under the stars. It'll be an old friend, a comfort and blessing.Take a deep breath......Can you just smell the salty tang of those soft breezes off the ocean"},{"Title":"Gift from the Sea","review":"This title was a recent selection for a book discussion group that I helped organize for my library. As the only male in the group, I felt somewhat compelled to offer token protest to the selection of this classic example of a &quot;woman's book,&quot; but actually I was intrigued by it. Everything I had read about &quot;Gift From the Sea&quot; praised its meditative quality and I had to admit that the promise of that rather appealed to me.I wound up reading the bulk of the book on Mothers' Day, which seemed quite appropriate, given that among the many issues Lindbergh addresses here is the need for mothers to find a balance between their own needs and those of their children and husbands. The need for time to one's self, a &quot;room of one's own&quot;, the need for a spriritual dimension to one's existence--well, it seems so obvious that these needs have to be met if a woman--if any human being--is to be fulfilled and to be able to meet her (or his) responsibilities with joy rather than with dread. But the lessons that Anne Morrow Lindbergh taught in 1955 still need to be voiced in 2000--perhaps more than ever. Lindbergh seems prescient when she speaks of the dangers of the &quot;life of multiplicity&quot; which had already taken root in the immediate post-War era. We know all too well that it has not gotten any better in the past 50 years and that women's lives in particular have become more stressful and, to use Lindbergh's word, &quot;fragmented&quot; in the past half-century.What distinguishes Lindbergh's book from today's current crop of self-help or New Age sprititual books though is its lyrical quality. Her careful, belletristic prose is soothing and, yes, meditative in and of itself. Reading it seems to bring about the very centeredness and balance that she seeks to describe.Although she includes no bibliography (and rightly so, as this is not a tract), I would hope that many of her readers would be inspired to seek out the works of some of the writers she quotes in the context of these essays. She does the world a great service in suggesting how Rilke, for example, whose poetry may seem impenetrable at first, can actually speak to the concerns of our own lives."},{"Title":"Gift from the Sea","review":"Based on its reputation as one of the seminal works of Feminism and a callow belief that the author was merely riding her husband's coattails to fame, this is a book that I have pretty studiously avoided. As it turns out, that was a colossal mistake on my part. This little book contains more interesting and compelling thoughts on the nature of human relationships, particularly the marriage relationship, than just about any other book I've ever read.It's not possible to address them all here, but here are two ideas that I found particularly striking. Here is a passage describing a quality marriage:A good relationship has a pattern like a dance, and is built on some of the same rules. The partners do not need to hold on tightly, because they move confidently in the same pattern, intricate but gay and swift and free, like a country dance of Mozart's. To touch heavily would be to arrest the pattern and freeze the movement, to check the endlessly changing beauty of its unfolding. There is no place here for the possessive clutch, the clinging arm, the heavy hand, only the barest touch is assign. Now arm in arm, now face to face, now back to back - it does not matter which. Because they know they are partners moving to the same rhythm, creating a pattern together, and being invisibly nourished by it. The joy of such a pattern is not only the joy of creation or the joy of participation, it is also the joy of living in the moment. Lightness of touch and living in the moment are intertwined.When you love someone, you do not love them all the time, in exactly the same way, from moment to moment. It is an impossibility. It is even a lie to pretend to. And yet this is exactly what most of us demand. We have so little faith in the ebb and flow of life, of love, of relationships. We leap at the flow of the tide and resist in terror its ebb. We are afraid it will never return. We insist on permanency, on duration, on continuity; when the only continuity possible, in life as in love, is in growth, in fluidity - in freedom, in the sense that the dancers are free, barely touching as they pass, but partners in the same pattern.The only real security is not in owning or possessing, not in demanding or expecting, not in hoping, even. Security in a relationship lies neither in looking back to what was in nostalgia, nor forward to what it might be in dread or anticipation, but living in the present relationship and accepting it as it is now. Relationships must be like islands, one must accept them for what they are here and now, within their limits - islands, surrounded and interrupted by the sea, and continually visited and abandoned by the tides.This image, of a loving couple as partners in a dance, not gripped in a hammer lock, but tracing a unified pattern via different steps, just seems profound to me. We all know people who demand of love that it be unchanging, or demand of a partner that they do things in lockstep; these people are never happy and we immediately recognize their relationships as unhealthy. At the same time, we recognize the good marriages around us as the ones where each partner is confident enough in the other to have faith that their separate paths will remain intertwined and will lead to the same place.The other section that truly brought about a personal epiphany, was when she says:...marriage, which is always spoken of as a bond, becomes actually, in this stage, many bonds, many strands, of different texture and strength, making up a web that is taut and firm. The web is fashioned of love. Yes, but many kinds of love: romantic love first, then a slow-growing devotion and, playing through these, a constantly rippling companionship. It is made of loyalties, and interdependencies, and shared experiences. It is woven of memories of meetings and conflicts; of triumphs and disappointments. It is a web of communication, a common language, and the acceptance of lack of language, too; a knowledge of likes and dislikes, of habits and reactions, both physical and mental. It is a web of instincts and intuitions, and known and unknown exchanges. The web of marriage is made by propinquity, in the day to day living side by side, looking outward and working outward in the same direction.As I read that, I was reminded of some of the marriages i've never been able to fathom, from my own grandparents to that most analyzed relationship of our day, the Clintons. The notion of the years together creating a web and of reaching a point where you, the couple, are within, looking out in the same direction, seems to me to go a long way to explaining such marriages. Think of how completely the Clintons are entangled within their own unique web, how insular their world must be, and, so long as they do work in the same direction, their relationship at least starts to make a little sense.There is much more here besides. I approached with trepidation, fearing a chick book, and found instead a marvelous exploration of the human condition in general and of the extraordinarily complex nature of marriage in particular. It is a book that anyone will benefit by, especially actual or prospective husbands and wives.GRADE: A+"},{"Title":"Gift from the Sea","review":"Anne Morrow Lindbergh could teach today's modern woman a wealth of knowledge on fulfillment and the balancing act of motherhood, wife and self. She has come to understand, the importance of finding peace and happiness within yourself, before you can share those qualities with others. Anne was, indeed, in her simplistic approach to life, a woman light-years ahead of her time. She had discovered, long before self-help books were fashionable, the ultimate joys and pleasures of a simplistic lifestyle, the richness of spiritual well being, and the importance of inner peace.Written in a unique, vibrant, flowing style, this book says in a lot less words what dozens of other self-help books set out to accomplish in long-winded, psycho-analytic terminology. &quot;Gift from the Sea&quot; is truly a gift from the soul of a woman with great wisdom and inner beauty, and one which you will long remember. Another book I would highly recommend is, &quot;A Year by the Sea&quot; by Joan Anderson."},{"Title":"Gift from the Sea","review":"I had no idea, when I found this book in a little beach bookstore recently, that it was written in 1955. Had I known, it probably would have dissuaded me from buying it. I now know how fortunate I am to have not known!I believe that books, words and people come into our lives at the time they are most needed, and Gift from the Sea certainly fits that bill for me. While small bits of it may be dated, most of it speaks as clearly and truly to modern day woman as it would have to 1950s women. In fact, with so many women in search of their most authentic self these days, it may even be MORE relevant to today's woman! It is a delicate and thoughtful essay on solitude, couplehood, inner peace and the wonder of nature. I can't imagine anyone not being inspired and uplifted by reading it. Truly, a gift for the soul."},{"Title":"Gift from the Sea","review":"&quot;Gift From the Sea&quot; is the kind of book that makes you want to leave your life for a couple of days and find the existance that Anne Lindbergh seemed to be living in when she wrote it. When I began reading it (by accident), I felt that she must have found some secret passage into my own soul and put its meaning into words I could never even dream of thinking. Her approach is incredible- because it seems as if she took no approach. She just sat down and wrote what seemed to pour uncontrollably from her own soul. She is heroic in her honest, simple view of life and its possibilities. It is a book I advise every woman to read at every stage of her life to remind her of the opportunity she has as as woman- to not only be equal to the opposite sex, but to also delve deep within herself to be what she was created to be."},{"Title":"Gift from the Sea","review":"For anyone -- but most particularly any woman -- in search of self and her place in the world this book, written in 1955, is a must read. It so fully articulates the inner struggles so many women today try to come to grips with-- while at the same time it illustrates that as much as we would like to believe that much of what occurs in our lives is a new occurence, the fact is that there truly is nothing new under the sun, that these struggles just persist from generation to generation.This diary is so timely throughout that it is at times almost spooky. Hear Lindbergh, for example, conjure up images of the impact of today's Martha Stewart at a time when Martha Stewart was just 14 years old and still a very long way from Lindbergh's consciousness or that of the general public:&quot;Here I live in a bare sea-shell cottage. No heat, no telephone, sweeping and clearning here. I am no longer aware of the dust no plumbing to speak of, no hot water, a two-burner oil stove, no gadgets to go wrong. No rugs. There were some, but I rolled them up the first day; it is easier to sweep the sand off a bare floor. But I find I don't bustle about with unnecessary sweeping and cleaning here. I have shed my Puritan conscience about absolute tidiness and cleanliness. Is it possible that, too, is a material burden? No curtains. I do not need them for privacy; the pines around my house are enough protection. I want the windows open all the time and I don't want to worry about rain. I begin to shed my Martha-like anxiety about many things. Washable slipcovers, faded and old -- I hardly see them; I don't worry about the impression they make on other people. I am shedding pride. As little furniture as possible; I shall not need much. I shall ask into my shell only those friends with whom I can be completely honest.&quot;And listen to her speak directly to women of both the 20th and 21st (and probably the 22nd) centuries when she writes:&quot;With a new awareness, both painful and humorous, I begin to understand why the saints were rarely married women. I am convinced it has nothing inherently to do, as I once supposed, with chastity or children. It has to do primarily with distractions. The bearing, rearing, feeding and educating of children; the running of a house with its thousand details; human relationships with their myriad pulls -- woman's normal occupations in counter to creative life, or contemplative life, or saintly life. The problem is not merely one of Woman and Career, Woman and the Home, Woman and Independence. It is more basically: how to remain whole in the midst of the distractions of life; how to remain balance, no matter what centrifugal forces tend to pull one off center; how to remain strong, no matter what shocks come in at the periphery and tend to crack the hub of the wheel&quot;I can barely in a few quotes pay this book the respect it deserves. Suffice it to say that I highly recommend this book. In fact, I suspect it is going to be my goal in 2002 to put it in the hands of many friends, family members and acquaintances!"},{"Title":"Gift from the Sea","review":"As a man I immensely enjoyed this 'woman's' book. Mrs. Lindberg uses masterful metaphor to tell her tale of inner discovery. Her level of insight kept my attention throughout this short memoir. I will go on the record and call this a man's book also. There are so many lessons that cross the gender lines. I believe that I also have a better understanding of women in general. Her relationship advice is sublime. I have included my favorite quotes:\\"Duration is not the test of true or false.\\"\\"There is no one-and-only, there are just one-and-only moments.\\"\\"Neither is the answer in dissipating our time and energy in more purposeless occupations, more accumulations which supposedly simplify life but actually burden it, more possessions which we have not time to use or appreciate, more diversions to fill up the void.\\"\\"Saint Exupery said 'Love does not consist in gazing at each other but in looking outward together in the same direction.'\\"Five Stars"},{"Title":"Gift from the Sea","review":"This book was given to me by a family friend after the birth of my first child. My initial thought was &quot;like I have time to read&quot;, but I put it on my nightstand. Finally, when the baby began sleeping through the night, I would read a few pages before turning in myself.What a soul-refresher this little whisp of a book turned out to be! I had to look a few times at the author's name, and the date the book was first published, to convince myself it was really THAT Lindberg and THAT old. But everything she says, and she says it so beautifully and poetically (even given the circumstances of her own life)holds true today - and most likely as long as women exist on this earth.Sometimes it is hard for women to do for themselves because they are trying so hard to do for so many others. This time, take the time for yourself, and read this book."},{"Title":"Gift from the Sea","review":"I saw an original copy of this book in a beach house I rented on Mother's day and my Mom told me I would like this book. I started to read it at the beach house and loved how relevant it was fifty years after it was written. When I got home I bought a copy of the 50th anniversary edition for myself, my sister and my friend and I loved every minute of reading the book.A great read for any women looking for ways to add inner stillness to her life!"},{"Title":"Gift from the Sea","review":"My original copy of Gift from the Sea was a gift. I loaned it to a trusted friend, but when she moved away, so did my copy. It was several years before I gave in to the need to reread it and ordered another one. Every chapter speaks to some part of a woman's heart. While not meant as a spiritual book, Gift from the Sea burrows deeply into the psyche of every woman. One woman's reflection on her journey may not sound like something you would read. We can all think of a few women we'd like to know a little LESS about. However, Anne Morrow Lindburg connects each facet of her journey to a shell she finds in her daily walks on the beach. It is a charming read and will fill your soul."},{"Title":"Gift from the Sea","review":"Something on a listmania list made me think of this book. I would say it has been at least 40 years since I first read it, but I too marked my copy with pencil marks and underlining, the first time I ever did that to a book. This was probably the book I re-read the most, from my teens into my early twenties. As a teen, I was an avid fiction reader and of course the non-fiction that came with school but this book opened my eyes. I don't even remember where I got it. I just know that as a teenager this book influenced the rest of my life. My original copy is probably packed away somewhere in one of my boxes but I am going to buy a new one and reread it. This was the book that also started me on a journey of keeping a journal. I can't even express in words how Anne Morrow Lindbergh inspired me! At the time I read the book I had never heard of Charles Lindbergh and of course, knew nothing about the Lindbergh kidnapping. My mother also read the book and I think it led to the beginning of our first woman-to-woman talks; that is adult-to-adult (even though I hadn't quite reached that adult level myself). I learned that my mother was more than just a mom. This book also greatly influenced my faith in a higher power."},{"Title":"Gift from the Sea","review":"These pages of truth and inspiration are worthy of keeping close at hand and reading often as the author, the late famous Anne Lindbergh, is knowledgeable about stages of life that females find themselves in and her awareness and beautiful descriptions of passages of living are very sweet to read. The smallish book is wonderful in its presentation and makes you just want to go down to the sea and find your own motivation and meaningful reasons for the life we lead."},{"Title":"Gift from the Sea","review":"This book is a gift from Anne Morrow Lindburgh to all of us. It's words, insight and knowledge are timeless across generations and decades. All ages can relate and understand the lessons and the compassion eminating from each page.

She was definitely a forward thinker."},{"Title":"Gift from the Sea","review":"Great Book and makes a wonderful gift to busy moms. Wished the book jacket was in better shape when I received it."},{"Title":"Gift from the Sea","review":"Anne Morrow Lindbergh writes of finding peace in an uneasy world. The peace she seeks and seems to find is in her inner world. She knows she will return to the hectic and often chaotic life she shares with her husband and five children when she leaves the beach. It is interesting to read this account of a slice of her life 50 years after she wrote it. Athough she writes of devotion to hearth and home, it is clear that she is foreshadowing the feminist movement still some 20 years away. Perhaps she is seen as the anti-feminist, putting her husband(and possibly a cheating husband at that)ahead of herself but clearly she is aware that there is more to life then being a mother and a wife. She is seeking balance so that she may continue her role as nurturer but also incorporate the equally important roles of artist, friend and citizen. We continue to search for that balance today and this book gives voice and hope to that struggle. Her intelligence and gentleness shine through in her prose."},{"Title":"Gift from the Sea","review":"I read this book once a year, and it speaks to me differently every time. The wisdom is timeless, and nurtures my soul.

This is one of those books that you can read over again at different ages and stages in your life and find totally new gems that you missed before.I picked this up after readingThe Aviator's Wife: A Novel, because I wanted to know more about Anne Morrow Lindbergh, who was perpetually in the shadow of her famous husband."},{"Title":"Gift from the Sea","review":"This book was a book club selection, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.

I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Gift from the Sea","review":"I picked up a Gift From The Sea after reading the historical fiction novel The Aviator's Wife by Melanie Benjamin, which is loosely about the life of the author Anne Morrow Lindbergh. I learned from The Aviator's Wife that Anne was a smart, poetic, insightful and strong woman. This definitely shows through out the book A Gift From Sea. Her interpretation of shells along the beach comparing them to a woman's life as we grow, marry, have children still keeping our individuality as strong women.What I like about a Gift From The Sea is that it is a book that can be reread over the years and you keep learning from it. I feel that this first time that I have read it, that I am (at 35) still an infant in my years and have yet much to learn from this world. I feel as Anne's daughter Reeve said, in the intro I have that, it is a book that should be read once a year.The interpretation of the shells found along the beach, and comparing them to life, was sometimes lost on me but still interesting.In the end this a book I am keeping. I hope to return to it possibly once a year to reread. As much as I learned from it there is so much more that I will learn from it through the stages of my life."},{"Title":"Gift from the Sea","review":"I liked this book so much I have given it as gifts to many friends.

How significant for a woman of that time to wax lyrical on the need for female solitude and independence.This is a tiny sweet little book whose narrative is framed by the beauty of nature and the complex lessons of shells. I loved her description of the day shared by lovers, from waking in the morning to walking and working and watching the stars. Her lessons were perfectly applicable and inspiring.Essentially, Lindbergh is also suggesting that women slow themselves, which has become more relevant in this epoch. On bad days, she suggests baking biscuits, something which warmed my heart.The only limitation of this little work is that it, at times, is restricted by the constructs of its periods. For example, as Lindbergh suggests in the 'Reopening' of the work, women are even still a long way from the equality she initially describes. My only other minor complaint is that she occasionally simplifies the intricate complexity of relationships.But even still, I am off to bake some biscuits."},{"Title":"Gift from the Sea","review":"I had purchased and read this book years ago, and my most recent purchase was a gift for a friend going through a life passage.

It warms my heart to feel a shared human connection with this woman, who is very different from myself. This book, a short, intimate meditation on how to successfully and joyfully manage the different stages of adult life, has proven itself to be universal. To read it is to affirm what we have in common with others.We live in an era when many of us (particularly the brown people of this world) have access to more wealth than any of our ancestors. This potential affluence is definitely a good thing, but it also comes with complications and challenges. The pursuit of money and achievement can also lead to materialism and self-absorption, which ultimately decays the spirit and destroys the family. This book can serve as a guide of how to manage these pitfalls with grace. There are elements of Anne Morrow Lindbergh's life that I don't necessarily support, but this book represents the best of what she has to offer. I highly recommend."},{"Title":"Gift from the Sea","review":"This book awakened me to the real nature of women. I am a man who was really not in touch.

I will reread every year now. Both inspirational and insightful."},{"Title":"Gift from the Sea","review":"Heard GIFT FROM THE SEA (Random House Audio) by Anne Morrow Lindbergh and read by Claudette Colbert.This was the 50th anniversary edition, and it contained an introduction by the author's daughter that I found help in that it gave some background information on the acclaimed writer and mother of five.In this book, Lindbergh shares her observations about youth and age; love and marriage; peace, solitude and contentment that she set down during a vacation by the sea . . . as she notes:* I began these pages for myself, in order to think out my own particular pattern of living, my own individual balance of life, work and human relationships. And since I think best with a pencil in my hand, I started naturally to write . . .She then shared her thoughts about the beach:* The sea does not reward those who are too anxious, too greedy, or too impatient. To dig for treasures shows not only impatience and greed, but lack of faith. Patience, patience, patience, is what the sea teaches. Patience and faith. One should lie empty, open, choiceless as a beach--waiting for a gift from the sea.And, also, oyster beds:* Yes, I believe the oyster shell is a good one to express the middle years of marriage. It suggests the struggle of life itself. The oyster has fought to have that place on the rock to which it has fitted itself perfectly and to which it clings tenaciously. So most couples in the growing years of marriage struggle to achieve a place in the world. It is a physical and material battle first of all, for a home, for children, for a place in their particular society. . . . In these years one recognizes the truth of Saint-Exupery's line: \\"Love does not consist in gazing at each other (one perfect sunrise gazing at another!) but in looking outward together in the same direction.\\" For, in fact, man and woman are not only looking outward in the same direction; they are working outward. (Observe the steady encroachment of the oyster bed over the rock.) Here one forms ties, roots, a firm base. (Try and pry an oyster loose from its ledge!)I found GIFT FROM THE SEAS beautifully written and surprisingly soothing . . . yet it is not for everybody; in particular, it is definitely more a woman's book, and I'm not sure how many males would even want to read it.In addition, I think some readers might have trouble relating to the author . . . at the time, she resided in the upper 1% of society and as a result, could take advantage of many things not ordinarily available to most Americans."},{"Title":"Gift from the Sea","review":"Gift From the Sea is one of my favorites. At various stages in my life, I have read it over and over again. It is a timeless classic. A major reason why it is such a favorite, is that it relates to the ocean/sea, which is my favorite place. Not only that, Anne is a very strong woman; a wonderful example for women. This book is a great gift to give to female friends and relatives."},{"Title":"Gift from the Sea","review":"When I received the book, I was a little dissapointed. It is really small. However, when I started reading, it was great. I love the sea, and therefore loved the connection of shells to her stories.

We have developed our curriculum using Scripture, up-to-date examples, Anne M. Johnson's reflections on Ms. Lindbergh's book in her \\"Return to the Sea,\\" and more, bridging the 55 years for today's women. I have been so pleased to be able to find multiple copies at reasonable prices so that we are able to have them available for each participant. We love the various inscriptions, personal notes that others have passed on in these used editions."},{"Title":"Gift from the Sea","review":"I'm a bit surprised to see this little gem of a book described as being primarily aimed at women. It struck me as being more in line with Marcus Aurelius' Meditations and the Essays of Montaigne. In a way, I think Ms. Lindbergh's writing is even better: more poetic, and less chatty. And her vision encompasses contemporary issues those fellows never experienced. Even though it has a 1955 copyright, this book has a very modern sensibility. (Not modern as in loud and decadent, but rather modern as in addressing issues of technological acceleration and information overload.) And she is no slouch in the wisdom department, either. Her vivid delineation of the several stages of life, and especially her insights into middle age make for though-provoking reading. I imagine she would make for a very wise and reasonable traveling companion. This book isn't just for the gals, guys. It's just plain great writing. It's a skinny book, too.

I am grateful she expanded her reach with these words to include any of us who care to take a brief break from our everyday routines to read this slim, very accessible volume.A couple surprises - I found this title in the Christian Inspiration section of the bookstore. I had previously read \\"War Within and War Without\\" in which I discovered Anne Morrow Lindbergh didn't regularly attend church. I had thought she was one of those \\"iconic\\" Christian writers - instead in these pages I discovered a woman who deeply knows the tenets of the Bible and uses them, integrates them in her life without being preachy about it.That is a good way to sum up the entire tone of the book - using metaphors from the Ocean itself, AML opens her own heart - and ours - to an entirely new way of seeing. Her writing voice is clear, concise. She says absolutely everything that needs to be said and nothing more.Her writing is like the perfectly sized meal. Satisfied, not satiated, with plenty of space to breathe, converse and make new discoveries about the entire experience.In the closing chapter, written for a new edition of the book twenty years later, AML writes of being \\"astonished\\" about the impact of this volume \\"written to work out my own problems\\" was still being read and appreciated by so many readers - and continuing for another generation... and now, continuing still to future generations.AML's daughter, Reeve, also scribes a heartfelt introduction for this fiftieth anniversary edition which allows us another view into the life of the woman who left these words for us, more than fifty years ago... yet feel as if they could have been written five minutes ago.This book makes me hungry for more. I now have two AML books under my heart. I will now read more, as well as books by her children. (One note that probably means nothing else to any of you, but the copyright was reissued in 2003 by four of her children. My heart literally leaped in reading those familiar names. I actually exclaimed \\"Land! Jon!\\" outloud. And then, \\"Where is (daughter) little Anne?\\"That is what the writing of Anne Morrow Lindbergh does, in a nutshell. She makes you care, not only about her and her life, but about life itself."},{"Title":"Gift from the Sea","review":"Anne Morrow Lindbergh crafted this classic of lyrical meditations while on a private beach retreat on Florida's Captiva island, away from family and work. The book remains as fresh and meaningful today as when it first came out over a half century ago. Though most known as the wife of famous aviator, Anne was very accomplished in her own right as the first licensed woman glider pilot int the US, the author of 13 books, including Hour of Gold, Hour of Lead, in which she shared her pain at the kidnaping and murder of her infant son. In it, she wrote, \\"I must write it all out, at any cost. Writing is thinking. It is more than living, for it is being conscious of living.\\" Anne died on February 7, 2001 at the age of 94. Gift from the Sea, has sold more than three million copies during the past half-century, and has been translated into 45 languages.Lindbergh wrote this inspirational book for herself \\"in order to think out my own particular pattern of living, my own individual balance of life, work and human relationships. . . . \\" It became a bestseller among all who find the complexity and demands of life and work eroding their idea of who they are, why they are here and how to regain a more peace filled life. Of the beach and peace, Lindbergh writes: \\"Here there is time, time to be quiet, time to work without pressure, time to think, time to watch the heron, watching with frozen patience for his prey.\\"The beach is not a place to work, to answer long overdue letters, or read a half dozen books or even to arrive with the intent to do anything. At first it is a place to rest and descend into apathy:One is forced against one's mind, against all tidy resolutions, back into the primeval rhythms of the sea-shore. Rollers on the beach, wind in the pines, the slow flapping of herons across sand dunes, drown out the hectic rhythms of city and suburb, time tables and schedules. One falls under their spell, relaxes, stretches out prone. One becomes, in fact, like the element on which one lies, flattened by the sea; bare, open, empty as the beach, erased by today's tides of all yesterday's scribblings.During the second week her mind comes alive, and wanders and turns over like the gentle waves and a life that had drifted away with the ebb and flow of doing and being comes ashore as lessons from the sea. The gifts are in the form of rare sea shells that find their way up form the ocean floor like lost dreams and are deposited upon the sandy beach awaiting discovery and careful study which Anne does each evening..Each chapter of the book is titled for a different sea shell. A Double-Sunrise seashell, a Moon shell, an Oyster shell, or even an Argonaut all serve as metaphors through which Lindbergh reviews her life and obligations to work, family, marriages, children and career. In coming across a deserted Channeled whelk shell that was once home to a hermit crab, who mysteriously ran away and left his only shelter, Anne wonders about her own running away and how in comparison to this pear shaped beauty that winds in a gentle spiral, she sees her life as untidy, barnacled, a barely recognizable shape that now seeks the grace of inner peace.But I want first of all . . . to be at peace with myself. I want a singleness of eye, a purity of intention, a central core to my life that will enable me to carry out these obligations and activities as well as I can. I want, in fact - to borrow from the languages of the saints - to live \\"in grace\\" as much of the time as possible. . . . By grace I mean an inner harmony, essentially spiritual, which can be translated into outward harmony. I am seeking perhaps what Socrates asked for in the prayer from the Phaedrus when he said, \\"May the outward and inward man be at one.\\" I would like to achieve a state of inner spiritual grace from which I could function and give as I was meant to in the eye of God.The adaptable and tenacious Oyster Shell was her choice to represent the difficult middle years of marriage about which she writes:. . . marriage, which is always spoken of as a bond, becomes actually, in this stage, many bonds, many strands, of different texture and strength, making up a web that is taut and firm. The web is fashioned of love. Yes, but many kinds of love: romantic love first, then a slow-growing devotion and, playing through these, a constantly rippling companionship. It is made of loyalties, and interdependencies, and shared experiences. It is woven of memories of meetings and conflicts; of triumphs and disappointments. It is a web of communication, a common language, and the acceptance of lack of language, too; a knowledge of likes and dislikes, of habits and reactions, both physical and mental. It is a web of instincts and intuitions, and known and unknown exchanges. The web of marriage is made by propinquity, in the day to day living side by side, looking outward and working outward in the same direction.Ths is a book full of timeless insights, one that explores in exquisite language and imagery what is most important in life: a time to oneself, the need for spirituality, the dangers of \\"a life on multiplicity,\\" balance, creativity, inner strength solitude, intimacy and independence, and the shedding of masks. Gift from the Sea transcends gender boundaries and is like reading the shared confidences of a special friend. And of course, it makes for ideal beach reading,\\"The sea does not reward those who are too anxious, too greedy or too impatient,\\" she writes. \\"To dig for treasures shows not only impatience and greed, but lack of faith. Patience, patience, patience is what the sea teaches. Patience and faith. One should be empty, open, choiceless, as a beach waiting for a gift from the sea.\\""},{"Title":"Gift from the Sea","review":"There is much to gain by reading this book.

This book would be a great gift."},{"Title":"Gift from the Sea","review":"This is Anne Morrow Lindbergh's masterpiece.Ms. Lindbergh was a great writer. She had the ability to make a few words say a lot, to express the transcendant through the mundane. In none of her books does she do a better job than this one. In all of her writings Ms. Lindbergh shares a little part of herself; in this book, she shares her essence. One tends to feel, while reading her book, that one is receiving the confidences of a dear friend.Decades ago, after a brief perusal of Gift from the Sea, I concluded that it was a book for women. For years I gave away copies to female friends as Christmas gifts. More recently, I took a closer look and realized that it transcends gender boundaries. This book is for everyone who longs to find and maintain their spiritual center in the midst of a busy and hectic world. Take Gift to a quiet place in nature and read it alone. If you're like me, when you get to the end you'll want to whisper a word of thanks to the author.Richard Salva--author of Soul Journey from Lincoln to Lindbergh [UNABRIDGED]"},{"Title":"Gift from the Sea","review":"20 years or so ago this book stunned me with its timely message for women and artists. Recently I heard Anne Morrow Lindbergh's youngest child, Reeve, discussing the 50th anniversary release of her mother's book. She said her mother's sister thought Anne had gone to Captiva alone, intending to \\"write herself out of her marriage, but instead had written herself back into it.\\" Intrigued by this personal insight I took up my old copy and have started reading it again.I am now a few years older than she was when she wrote the book at mid-life. I amazed at how the book holds up, how relevant are her words to modern life and Feminism (with a captial \\"F\\" as she writes it), and her spot-on advice to artists of all media. Recent revelations that her American hero husband was a secret world-class philanderer, fathering at least seven illegimate children with three different European women, make the veiled anguish she must have been experiencing all the more poignant.Without whining or humbling herself, the author conveys with grace her personal truths, wrested in the quiet solitude of beachcombing. A spare and simple writer who yearned for a simple life, she must have been often overwhelmed by the complexities of her own. The seashell analogies are thoughtful and lovely, simple and clean as her writing. But this simple book of few pages requires a long and gentle read, made so by the inevitable introspection it will provoke. I hope that Anne Morrow Lindbergh achieved the inner peace she sought, because her simple words have surely been a gift to others."},{"Title":"Gift from the Sea","review":"First written in 1955, this book was written on a brief solo vacation by the author. Amazingly the author used the imagery of shells as a symbol of the different stages in a woman's life. The author composed some meditations for the various stages of life: youth, aging, love, marriage, solitude, peace and contentment. Especially memorable was a section of \\"simplifying one's life\\", and to take to to reconcile our personal needs without feeling guilty about doing something for us.For those of you who are not familiar with this lovely book, the author was a mother, and wife to pilot Charles Lindbergh. Although the book was first written some 55 years ago, the message is still important to today's modern woman It is important to finds personal fulfillment in life. You must find the right balance and inner peace within yourself, before you can share those qualities with others.This little gem of a book should be read by every woman trying who tires to do everything for everyone.

We need to find out what it means to us. What is the purpose? Where do we go from here? Anne Morrow Lindbergh did just that when she went to an island beach alone for two weeks and, while there, wrote a book called \\"Gift From The Sea.\\" Anne made the transition to her retreat by leaving behind a New York suburbia house, five children, and the many other hats she put on to fulfill her role in the community and as a wife. She not only went to the beach to write, but also to find and shape her life.What she found was even more valuable. It came to her as a gift from nature without requiring anything from her in return. The gift nature gave Anne was the gift of seashells. She went on to write in the most eloquent and descriptive language about the shells she found. She described how each one related to her life and how the simplicity of the beach was transformational. In her book, the \\"Moon Shell\\" represents the encumbrances we experience in life by its attachments. The \\"Double-Sunrise\\" shell exhibits the qualities of how we love, and the \\"Argonauta\\" distinguishes the final freedom we have to be independent, while still loving another person.The \\"Moon Shell\\" is representative of a snail shell in which its inhabitants leave to gain freedom. Anne's life had paralleled this type of escape, if even for only two weeks. When she looks at this shell, she sees the beauty of the simple lines - unlike her life in New York - which she compares to being a shell covered in barnacles. Her life had grown complicated and she felt like she lost the simple shape and design of her life in many ways. Anne was a business woman, a mother, a wife, and a member of society with many social duties. Her life was scattered and frantic. She felt like she had to wear a mask - so much so - that in doing so, she lost herself. Perhaps the \\"Double-Sunrise\\" shell would help in her journey to find her true shape and nature.The \\"Double-Sunrise\\" shell is the type of shell that is double winged. With its amazing pink and peach hues, if you found one on the beach, you would see that the color and magnificence of the lines were simply remarkable. Just like first love's beauty, Anne remembered this feeling as she gazed at the shell. It symbolized feeling at one with another person - so that if they left your side for a just a moment - it would mean utter death. Looking at the shell, she remembered feeling her heart beat simultaneously with another, and knowing the love was so strong that nothing else mattered. This was the kind of love Anne first remembered when looking at the shell. After questioning if this type of love was real, she assessed it was as real as anything in the world could be, even if only for a brief moment in eternity. Practical love and duties would eventually take over - she muses - as she comments on the other shells and forms of love and marriage.The ultimate shell she eventually finds is the \\"Argonauta.\\" The \`Argonauta\\" shell houses rare creatures that are not fastened to the shell at all, and Anne is looking for this type of freedom to shape her life. Yes, we can have a house, a body, a family, and all of the things the world gives us, but to become so undeniably detached from them, would be achieving perfect freedom. This is an evolutionary process that usually only occurs once we have come of age. She relates the process of the trees coming from the same source. They are individual, yet together, as their branches reach out and touch each other, each branch being the same, yet intrinsically different. As with the changing tides, the \\"Argonauta\\" shell will remind Anne of the changing tides and cycles of life."},{"Title":"Gift from the Sea","review":"This book is a gem of feminine insight and should be required reading (I truly hate that term, but in this case, it is valid)for women over 30. Not to mention women who plan to reach 30. I recall having this book forced down our immature throats injunior high English class, when the book first came out to critical acclaim in the late 50's. This seemed ill-advised, as the subject matter, plus lack of plot and character development or even characters in the first place, proved quite beyond the limited literary appreciation of the class.Half a lifetime later, while perusing the dusty shelves of a used book store, I came across a copy of that almost forgotten book, presented so enthusiastically but naively by my long-ago English teacher. Now, as an adult, I decided to give it mature consideration; Ic can't believe what a treasure I had in my hands--how I had missed these pearls of human wisdom for decades! But it is never too late to recognize a jewel between covers.The author felt impelled to take a retreat on an almost deserted island--perhaps to reflect at lesiure upon her roles as daughter, sister, wife, mother, woman and human being. As she strolls carelessly along the soothingly indifferent shore, she can not resist picking up vairous shells--all gifts, as it were, from the sea. Considering each type at length at days' end, she realizes that these various shells represent the the different stages of a woman's life. The bivalves, like butterly shells, remind her of the marriage bonds; the chambered nautilus reflects her home, which needs more rooms as the family expands. For Lindbergh each shell fills a special niche in the multitudinous roles which is a woman's privilege to perform. So I invite all thoughtful, sensitive women to plunge their hands into the foamy surf and contemplate the gifts from the sea...of Life. Don't be afraid to recall the stages of your own past, for all personal struggles have validity in one's private destiny. Lindbergh's gift to humanity is a her tender but timeless insight."},{"Title":"Gift from the Sea","review":"\\"I begin to understand why the saints were rarely married women,\\" Anne Morrow Lindbergh writes. \\"The problem is not merely one of Woman and Career, Woman and the Home, Woman and Independence. It is more basically: how to remain whole in the midst of the distractions of life; how to remain balanced, no matter what centrifugal forces tend to pull one off center; how to remain strong, no matter what shocks come in at the periphery.\\"Using the illustration of shells from the sea, Anne Morrow Lindbergh clears away the clutter of life, pares it down to its most simple form, that of an internal life that lends clarity to the externals. Each section of the book is a different shell, and a different lesson learned. Peace within one's self, simplicity, clarity, joy, the validity of each cycle and era of a lifetime, strength, and wholeness are just some of the lessons she imparts.In about 50 years things have not become any less complicated, and this short, simple little book is even more relevant to our busy and noisy modern lives. The lesson one takes away from the book is not how to get rid of all the things, but how to find a calm, still center within one's self to maintain sanity, and that need never change, no matter what the distractions might be."},{"Title":"Gift from the Sea","review":"Anne Morrow Lindbergh was ahead of her time when she wrote Gift From the Sea.

Having lost her first child to kidnapping and murder, it must have been very difficult for her to find a purpose to start over and bear other children. One reads between the lines and realizes that only in going deep within in solitude can one's soul be healed. One must give herself/himself time and not rush into busyness, looking for new relationships, new books to read, movies to see, or hiding your emotions, you have to play the whole thing out or you will perish. There are many situations we have to die to, to lose control of, and not try to possess. We have to detach ourselves, not by becoming indifferent but compassionate. Only then will we find peace of mind and soul. Anthony De Mello in his book: Sadhana: Way to GodSadhana, a Way to God: Christian Exercises in Eastern Formalso explores with us the joy that comes from detaching ourselves from any preconceived endings.

The Lindberghs had a summer cabin on the beach. Anne relished the time she spent at the cabin alone, free from the worries and petty details of raising five children. One summer, she decided to write out her daily meditations, and the result is found here in this slim book.Inspired by the seashells she found washed up on the shore, Lindbergh has arranged the book in chapters based on analogies with types of shells. Although the writing was produced in one particular summer in the 1950s, the topics of the chapters are timeless. The chapter on simplicity has become a classic in the simplicity literature, and some readers may already be familiar with its content through encountering excerpts elsewhere. Besides simplicity, Lindbergh also discusses the need for taking time for oneself to rest, and how this need is particularly strong for caregivers (like mothers of small children). She reflects on the types and stages of intimate relationships, and ways to nourish closeness between partners. When I first picked up the book, I figured I would read it cover to cover in an hour or so and move on to something else. But the content of the book was so thought-provoking, I soon put the brakes on, slowing my reading pace down to savor every word. The book is short and simple, but very profound."},{"Title":"Gift from the Sea","review":"I can only echo those who rave about this book.

A source of inspiration to read over and over."},{"Title":"Gift from the Sea","review":"I picked up Anne Morrow Lindbergh's &quot;Gift From the Sea&quot; with a good deal of trepidation. The Oprahfication of America has too often brought the sexes into warring opposition. So much so that when men or women write about what it means to be men and women, they can't seem to resist taking backhanded swipes at the value of one another. At the time, I did not know that &quot;Gift From the Sea&quot; was so old...I figured it would be the same stuff we see too much of today rehashed in pleasant warm-fuzzy, faux spiritual fashion to fit the market. I stand corrected.Mrs. Lindbergh shows herself to be an author of deep insight, intellectual honesty and true caring. As she reflected on each shell she found on the beach and related them to life not only as a woman (although it is a central theme) but as a human in our modern times (it still fits--even fifty years later), I was swept up into her thoughts and dazzled by her soul.Lindbergh finds much worth in what we are when all the noise of our surroundings is stripped away. She seeks to cling to this essence and bring it to bear as she reenters to tempest of everyday life. I can relate to this.&quot;Gift From the Sea&quot; reminds me forcefully of what David said in the seventeenth Psalm. He cries out to the one who has made him. He asks that God keep him as the apple of his eye--to allow him to seek shelter in shadow of his wings. This is a cry for protection but also for a wholeness we all lack, whatever the age we live in. I believe Morrow Lindbergh's words echo this. David concludes with these words:&quot;And I--in righteousness I will see your face; when I awake, I will be satisfied with seeing your likeness&quot; (v. 15).May we all! I recommend this book."},{"Title":"Gift from the Sea","review":"Anne Morrow Lindbergh was as introspective a woman as I have come across in my reading.

I liked the Alison Weir book very much as well, but this is the best of the three recent books on the subject (the third, by David Starkey, is a disappointment -- short on detail, long on irritating editorial comments). If you are going to buy one book on the six wives, this should be it."},{"Title":"Wives of Henry VIII","review":"Although it's easy to say that Frasier did a good research and wrote a book very well arranged that tells the story of all Henry VIII's wives in an interesting and well organized prose, there was one thing that bothered me through the book: she takes deeply takes sides and emits judgments on the people's attitudes all the time (specially if they are women!).Frasier might have written a book about all the woman that wore the crown behind the second Tudor monarch, but early on it's easy to see that she likes Catherine of Aragon the best and considers her as the one true queen, alongside with Jane Seymour. She shows little sympathy toward both Howard girls (Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard), and paint them in a very bad light. Her dislike of Catherine Parr is also notable, and although her claims make it seem that it's because of the fake feminist side she's usually shown to have when Parr was actually a very traditional lady; her treatment of other women make it clear that Frasier has very little feminist tendencies herself.The book is good fun, but not to be taken as any close to absolute true, since it departs from the natural academy idea of being impartial to sit judgment not only on the King's wives but also on his lovers. Fraiser treatment of Bessie Blount and Mary Bolyen show them not only as lightheaded girls, but also as promiscuous that slept around the court (or, in Mary's cases, courts), and deserve no respect whatsover. While Catherine of Aragon is a saint that never touched her first husband 'because she was too young', she claims that Catherine Howard was sleeping around, some 40 years later, while having the same age (not to mention that both Bassie and Mary seem to be around their late teens as well during their affairs with the King, the same age that Catherine and Arthur were when married). In short, Frasier seems as biased as some of the ambassadorial reports from those times.The one wive that escapes with a fairly unbiased portrait is Anne of Cleves, although, considering her marriage lasted only a few months and that she was smart enough to ensure her safety afterwards, she's still shown as a neurotic and jealous woman that wishes to come back to her former post by the time the King married Catherine Parr.Still, it's enjoyable and readable, but not nearly the best about the subject, even for beginners."},{"Title":"Wives of Henry VIII","review":"I have come late to history in my life, and I owe my current interest in English history to my mother, whose genealogical research has found my ascendants to include Charlesmagne, Alfred the Great, Ethelred the Unready, Edward III, Margaret Plantagenet Pole, Ursula Pole and Henry Stafford. It truly is a treat to read such vivid accounts of my ancestors-- particulary St. Margaret Pole, who was viciously beheaded at the age of 70 by Henry VIII for opposing the divorce of Katherine of Aragon-- and who was canonized in the 19th century as the \\"Patron Saint of the Sanctity of Marriage!\\"Maybe this is a small point from a non-historian, but what is Ms. Frasier's obsession with royal names? The book has sentences like: \\"When Queen Catherine was told about the affair, Queen Catherine knew that something had to be done about it.\\" We get it: she's a queen! And why the change of names and spellings for the wives that are commonly known otherwise? I had never heard of \\"Anna\\" of Cleves before reading this book but I had heard of \\"Anne\\" of Cleves. \\"Catherine\\" Parr is spelled \\"Katharine\\" in her own contemporary portrait which is included in the book. Everybody else knows Henry had 2 Annes and 3 Catherines but no changes are necessary to distinguish which is which, especially if you stop saying \\"Queen This\\" or \\"Queen That\\" and just use their last names.I am glad I had the fortitude to get through an historical work like this and it help enrich my growing knowledge of the English part of my American ancestry."},{"Title":"Wives of Henry VIII","review":"The book is well written and it brings you back inside the story."},{"Title":"Wives of Henry VIII","review":"The author, Ms. Fraser gives the reader a look at what lifewas like at the time of Henry VIII.Ms. Fraser connects the people in the book not only to thehistory of England, but to that of the world.Furthermore, she goes into the reasons that King Henry hadso many wives. These reasons are much more complex, andfascinating than you would think. If you want to learnmore about history in which the people are examined in depth,this book is for you!"},{"Title":"Wives of Henry VIII","review":"I came to read this book in a roundabout way; having recently finished Alison Weir's THE CHILDREN OF HENRY VIII, I was anxious to read her other books, namely The Wives. I ordered it from the library, they got it mixed up, and sent me Antonia Fraser's look at the Tudor wives. Her examination is good, but not great. I really got the feeling she was treating her subjects as Royalty with a capital R; everything that came out of their mouths is taken to be honest and geniune. Nope, no hidden motives here, no manipulation or greed or blood thirsty obsession with power. When it does exist in Fraser's Tudor world, it is played down as being less important than more kindly royal virtues. Apparently all everyone was trying to do was be the best darn little kings and queens they could. Like tragic heros, by trying to do good for England, they bring about their own demise. Conversely, Weir's biographies show how growing up in a environment of cruelty affected Tudor England's elites; in the fifteenth century, you either became psychopathic, learned to play the game, and thrived, or you crumpled like a wilted flower while others stomped on you. Fraser's biography lacks that sense of ruthlessness which was so important in that time of which she writes. It's an intresting read for the information, but does not give us the intense flavours of Henry's court."},{"Title":"Wives of Henry VIII","review":"I'm not a historian, nontheless I found the book highly enjoyable. Most of all I liked Fraser's style. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Wives of Henry VIII","review":"While this book does cover facts,its boring. And I am deeply into tudor history.It was a very slow read and took me much longer to read than any other book I have read.I found it very dull and would not recommend this to one who enjoys tudor history, even though it does give you alot of facts.Unless you have a test on king henry VIII wives, its a disappointment."},{"Title":"Wives of Henry VIII","review":"I love English history, especially the period from King Edward IV's reign through the Tudors. I am also a big Antonia Fraser fan. So, before I picked up this history of King Henry's hapless wives, I knew I would enjoy it. And I am not disappointed at all.Ms. Fraser writes with great elegance, and her usual wit, about the five women who married Henry VIII and how their lives impacted their times and history. She also describes each of these complex women, their unique characters as individuals, (not just as wives to a king), their motivations and ambitions. She outlines the ascent and decline of each of the women and how they related to one another, their peers and families...and to the King.Much of the book is about Catherine of Aragon, but that is to be expected. She was married to Henry for 24 years, and prior to their marriage, she was wed to his older brother Arthur, a cause for future problems for the realm and much heartbreak for Catherine. Queen Catherine is portrayed most sympathetically, and that is my inclination also. She was a noble lady, raised to serve as Queen, who loved Henry, almost as much as she loved the Catholic Church, which he was to break away from and use against his wife and their daughter Mary. I have always wondered how Henry's character, his country and history would have changed if Catherine had born him a healthy son. Catherine was a strong woman of great faith, and nothing she ever did justified the treatment she received. One of the most poignant sentences in history, is one of Catherine's last. As she lay dying, she dictated a letter to the husband who had so ruthlessly abandoned her. She bid her scribe to write: \\"Lastly, I make this vow, that mine eyes desire you above all things. Farewell.\\"Anne Boleyn is an extremely well-educated woman, and very independent, especially given the times. And Henry is obsessed with the idea of possessing her. Anne plays his obsession to the hilt. Fraser describes her complex and ambitious nature, as well as the politics of her downfall, with great skill. Poor Jane Seymour's mild manner was a temporary, but welcome, relief to Henry after Anne. However Queen Jane's narrative is brief, as was her life. She died after birthing Henry's only living son.Anne of Cleves, perhaps the most politically astute of Henry's wives, certainly the one with the best survival skills, was thrilled to be cast-off and allowed to keep her head.Unfortunately, the naive and beautiful Katherine Howard, Henry's \\"blushing rose without a thorn\\" went the way of Anne Boleyn, because of promiscuity, lack of savvy, and church politics.Catherine Parr, a woman of extraordinary intellect, was one of only eight women whose writings were published during the reign of Henry and his father. She was fortunate to become aware of a plot against her before she met the same end as Queens Anne and Katherine.Ms. Fraser draws a lavish portrait of court life with its moral and political intrigues. She details the struggle for international power, and clearly explains England's break with Rome and the beginning of the Protestant Reformation.This is a superb and very readable history, that has been meticulously researched. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Wives of Henry VIII","review":"Antonia Fraser's 'The Wives of Henry VIII' is a wonderful account of the lives of the six women who married the controversial Tudor king. Fraser has written extensively on many subjects, but is particularly interested in British royal history. Her writing is clear and accessible, and almost invariably interesting.Fraser says 'the six women have become defined in a popular sense not so much by their lives as by the way these lives ended.' Largely, they became identified (as most historical figures do) as stereotypes. Fraser's stated intent in the book is to examine the real women behind the stereotypes, to find the human strengths and frailties behind the historic labels.Divorced, beheaded, died...divorced, beheaded, survived-Catherine of Aragon-DivorcedStereotype: Betrayed Wife, bigoted CatholicReality: a learned woman, politically astute, perhaps not entirely blameless in the break-up (but then, what can one expect? Divorce was presumably out of the question given religious and political considerations, so might she have felt safe to be more forward than anyone should be with the formidible Henry?)-Anne Boleyn-BeheadedStereotype: Temptress, Protestant activistReality: she was more Protestant because the Catholic church wouldn't recognise or grant the divorce. She played a demur and devout character in court, but then, could she have publicly appeared as anything else, given the unprecedented events going on about her and because of her? She didn't have a chance to build up a power base, and suffered greatly for it. Indignatio principis mors est. Little known fact: Anne was actually divorced from Henry on the eve of her execution.-Jane Seymour-DiedStereotype: the Good Woman, Protestant yet CatholicReality: 'Jane Seymour was exactly the kind of female praised by the contemporary handbooks to correct conduct; just as Anne Boleyn had been the sort they warned against. There was certainly no threatening sexuality about her.' Henry would look back on Jane as the wife with whom he had been uniquely happy. She died as a result of the stress of childbirth (a not uncommon fate of women of any class), Henry's only legitimate male heir.-Anna of Cleves-DivorcedStereotype: Ugly Sister, Lutheran and CatholicReality: an interesting and difficult marriage to put together. 'Paradoxically, the King in his last forties, gross, no likely object of desire, was far more difficult to please than that handsome boy of 1509, ready to fall in love where policy directed him, whom any girl might easily love in return.' By this time, of course, Henry had a reputation of being at the least an unlucky husband. Solemn, looking older than her age, Anna was almost instantly disliked. Perhaps this saved her from a worse fate, if Henry had come to know her and then fall out of love with her.-Katherine Howard-BeheadedStereotype: the Bad GirlReality: Katherine was expected to produce the 'spare' to the heir produced by Jane. 'Katherine was, on her own admission, one who knew how to \\"meddle with a man\\" without conceiving a child.' Her affair with Culpeper not discreet enough, Katherine suffered the fury of Henry, who blamed his Council for forcing on him 'a succession of such ill-conditioned wives.'-Catherine Parr-SurvivedStereotype: the Mother FigureReality: not well educated but not unintelligent, a caring but politically astute person. 'As for the King himself, it was remarked that as Bishop Gardiner pronounced the now familiar words of the marriage service, an expression of real happiness crossed that bloated face.' She had taken as her motto 'To be useful in all I do.'Fraser goes into detail about the lives, and the aftermath, what became of these women, even to the extent of recounting the period neglect and restorations of their graves. Speaking of Catherine of Aragon, she writes: 'It is rare to find the Queen's grave without fresh flowers placed upon it. Nothing is known about those who over the years have performed this touching act of respect. One can however safely assume that, whatever their own religious view, they agree with this estimate of the character of Catherine of Aragon: loyal, pious, courageous and compassionate.'"},{"Title":"Wives of Henry VIII","review":"This book is certainly worth reading. Lady Fraser writes eloquently, incorporating historical facts with modern wit. The attention bestowed on the usually transparent Queens Jane Seymour and Anne of Cleves is admirable, and the attention paid to the proud Queens Catherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn is deep and thorough. I would say that anyone interested in Henry's Queens would find this book more attractive than any other on the same subject, for Fraser's wit and thorough research make her book entertaining as well as informative."},{"Title":"Wives of Henry VIII","review":"A few years ago David Starkey wrote a book on Henry VIII's three wives which received much publicity. It was even turned into a PBS documentary. I read that book and while I found some of his research compelling, his arrogant style and dubious conclusions irritated me. The book is overlong (880 pages), and lopsidedly devoted to Catherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn. Out of the 750 odd pages of actual text, a whopping 600 are devoted to Catherine and Anne! In particular, Catherine of Aragon's seven years of being the sort-of-fiance of Henry VIII after her first husband's death is chronicled in excruciatingly boring detail. Starkey is also fond of making pronouncements such as \\"In short, it rewrites history.\\" Henry's other four wives are mentioned in a rushed, careless way.Antonia Fraser's book is half Starkey's length but it's quality, not quantity, that counts. Whereas Starkey holds most of Henry's wives with a fair degree of contempt, Fraser is more sympathetic. You can tell she cares about her characters, even Henry. She too draws some conclusions that I might not agree with (her insistence that Catherine of Aragon's first marriage was not consummated for instance -- I'm on the fence about that one), but overall her book rings true. She surmises, for instance, that Henry and Anne during their 7 year courtship probably used coitus interruptus as birth control. She details Catherine of Aragon's sad descent from a plump and spirited bride into a lonely, embittered woman is poignant. Her style is witty, engaging, and heartfelt. After reading her book I felt like I knew the queens as old friends. The book is beautifully illustrated with a section of photographs for each queen.But more importantly, she devotes much care to Henry's other four wives, and not just Catherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn. She follows their stories all the way to the end. In Starkey's book, Anne of Cleves is shuttled off to become Henry's \\"sister\\" after a disastrous short marriage. And as he writes, \\"that was that.\\" Fraser by contrast mentions that Anne of Cleves continued to occasionally visit the court, developed rather expensive tastes, and hoped to be \\"taken back\\" as Henry's wife after Henry beheaded the sweet but careless and indiscreet Katherine Howard. She mentions Henry's children's relationships with their stepmothers -- Mary and Anne Boleyn were openly hostile to each other, but Mary liked Jane Seymour and Catherine Parr, Henry's last wife. Elizabeth too was fond of Catherine Parr.I should say that I am not an unqualified admirer of Antonia Fraser. Her most recent work, on Marie Antoinette, I thought veered into hagiography. But none of these faults are in evidence in this book. For a more detailed look at Henry's most fascinating wife, Anne Boleyn, Eric Ives' study is considered definitive, but for a more general book about Henry's wives, I would consider Fraser's the book to get."},{"Title":"Wives of Henry VIII","review":"I have read many books on the life and wives of Henry VIII. I thoroughly enjoyed the almost conversational tone of this book. The footnotes were very helpful in answering questions provoked by the text. I was particularly interested in the exploration of the wives personalities, strenghs, and weaknesses. Katherine Howard, an often overlooked wife, was made real by the author. A very enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Wives of Henry VIII","review":"Antonia Fraser has certainly written more enjoyable works but nonetheless, The Wives of Henry VIII is worth taking the time to finish, especially if you're not very familiar with the subject matter beforehand. She does a fantastic job of laying down facts as with all her historical works but she also injects her own rather 'forgiving' viewpoint regarding the intentions and motivations of the people about whom she writes. Fraser has a wonderful way of exposing the core humanity of characters that most of us have been inclined to view as ruthless, inhuman monsters. I would suggest, however, that one read other not quite so tame opinions because the 'truth' usually lies somewhere in the middle of the extremes."},{"Title":"Wives of Henry VIII","review":"The triple threat of Elizabeth Longford, Antonia Fraser and Flora Fraser (Mother, Daughter &amp; Grandaughter)have been providing us with readable yet fairly scholarly biographies for decades. All of them are well researched and certainly admired by historians and non-academics alike. This particular book is a handy all-in-one guide to Henry VIII and his six wives. It is by necessity, rather shallow, as his marital woes had and have very important ramifications, and this volume cannot begin to address these issues in depth. Overall, a great read about a fascinating man at a fascinating time. In truth, the women are not nearly as well fleshed out, with the notable exception of Katherine of Aragon, largely because their stories just were not as important as that of their husband to contemporary writers, so their lives are not as well documented. The extent 16th c. materials have been mined for individuals biographies of each woman, and they do each deserve their own book. (Many such have been written, even about poor Catherine Howard.) This is a good book for a first look at Tudor England. I like Lady Antonia and all her biographies, and those of her mother and daughter. I just wish she would stop writing those shabby mysteries."},{"Title":"Wives of Henry VIII","review":"As a beginner to the life of Henry the VIII this book gave me an excellent insight to his 6 extrordinary wives. It was interesting to see how these very different women coped with everyday life in the court of Henry not to mention the trials of being Queen. Ms Frasier does an excellent job of bringing the Queens to life in an easy to read format. A great choice for anyone interested in this era."},{"Title":"Wives of Henry VIII","review":"This was the first Antonia Fraser book I read and from the \\"Divorced, beheaded, died, divorced, beheaded, survived\\" I was hooked. I read it after hearing her speak at Peterborough Cathedral about Catherine of Aragon. The book looks at Henry VIII's from his wives' perspective. What drove them to marry this man especially after he beheaded Anne Boleyn. Also, it is great introduction to Tudor England."},{"Title":"Wives of Henry VIII","review":"I have always been fascinated by English history, particularly Henry VIII. Fraser did not disappoint. Usually I find history books dry and dull. I was initially put off by the length of the book, but the author writes so well that I couldn't put the book down. She makes it seem more like a novel than a history text. I felt like I was right there with each of Henry VIII's wives. The book is meticulously researched, and she clearly shows the differences between the women in the King's life, and helps the reader to understand his motives. All the events are put in context of the sociopolitcal landscape of the times. As a result, I found myself seeing how complex the King was and not being able to hate him, even though I hated his actions. I highly reccommend this book to anyone who is interested in the history of the British monarchy."},{"Title":"Wives of Henry VIII","review":"This book may be thick and long, but it's so interesting and informative, you'll be sorry when you're done with it. It great to dive right into the Tudor court and get to know all the characters. Henry VIII may have gotten a bad reputation for being brutal and crazy, but he didn't start out that way. It's easy to see him as a young, athletic, scholarly, enthusiastic prince and king before injury and illness made him crazy. This book gets into the heads of all the major characters with their original writings. Such a fascinating story; you can't make this stuff up!"},{"Title":"Wives of Henry VIII","review":"This was an interesting read. A new way to look at history. I left my first copy of this book on a plane, and it was so good, I needed to replace it."},{"Title":"Wives of Henry VIII","review":"I've read numerous books on Tudor history and this is one of the best. The subject is difficult to follow at times, due to the nature of the family relationships, which can be hideously complicated by virtue of the inbreeding involved in 16th century European royal families. It is interesting to note that every one of Henry VIII's wives were related to him and to each other through ancestry dating back to Edward I.I've recently read several books from this period written by Alison Weir. While I found many of these to be revisionist and quite dry in their style, I thought Antonia Fraser did a superior job in detailing the history of the era in a style more friendly to the reader.Most readers are familiar with the history of Henry's first two wives (Catherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn). Far more obscure are the backgrounds and life histories of the next four Queen consorts. As Fraser points out, each of the wives have been neatly pigeonholed, however the truth and the entire story is never as simple as the legend. Most interesting to me was the story of Anna of Cleves, Henry's fourth wife and the only one married for political advantage.Divorced (Catherine of Aragon), beheaded (Anne Boleyn), died (Jane Seymore), divorced (Anna of Cleves), beheaded (Catherine Howard), survived (Catherine Parr) is the old school child rhyme utilized to keep the various queens straight. The story of each is fascinating in themselves and even more so when read through the prism of 16th century English politics and royal intrigue."},{"Title":"Wives of Henry VIII","review":"Great book about the many interesting women married to the famous Monarch. Ms Fraser is a great writer breathing life into each one of the Queen's, showing their vulnerability as well as strength. I will be reading more by this author."},{"Title":"Wives of Henry VIII","review":"This is an excellent source for historians, for Fraser provides a colorful, accurate, entertaining look at the six women who helped make British history."},{"Title":"Wives of Henry VIII","review":"No novel can top this. A power hungry, lustful monarch with no male heir tears the very religious fabric of his country asunder to win a mysterious, young and seductive woman. If anyone in history felt loved to surfeit, surely Anne Boleyn did in 1533 as Henry VIII defiantly broke the centuries old tie with the Vatican merely to marry her. Who would doubt the strength of that conviction? Here lies the pinnacle of drama, which even Shakespeare could not resist. Best, or worst, of all, it actually happened. Power struggles that kick any contrived soap opera or melodrama right in the rump ensue in court as well as in the bedroom. The abandoned Catherine Of Aragon, Henry's wife and Queen for twenty years, publicly falls to her knees and pleads her case. After all, how would it feel to have your spouse go to such historical lengths simply to get rid of you? Could anyone feel more unwanted? Not only that, all of this gets paraded before the world. Divorces originating from a fling with the repairman pale starkly in comparison. So what brought about this nearly mythical series of events? Well, the usual answers: power, greed, lust, dynasty. Also entitlement. As the superb book \\"The Wives of Henry VIII\\" points out, King Henry felt indubitably that the will of God justified his position, his actions and his motives. No one, especially the \\"common people\\" would stand in his way. The tale of Henry VIII stands as a quintessential tale of absolute power absolutely corrupting. As such, it remains breathtaking, appalling and hopelessly irresistible to the present.Of course, things don't end there. The show is just beginning. The unbelievable drama continues through four additional wives. After Henry has Anne Boleyn beheaded for committing two supposed \\"crimes,\\" namely, not producing the required son, trumped up charges of adultery and incest and \\"meddling too much in the affairs of state,\\" Jane Seymour, the love of Henry's life quickly supplants the disgraced Anne and grants Henry his supreme wish: a male heir. Then, even quicker than her rise, she dies from infections sustained during childbirth. Many women in pre-industrial times perished this way, even Queens. Poor Anna of Cleves then gets called to fill the marital gap in the lonely, and increasingly obese, King's life. Unfortunately, and despite Holbein's famous wooing portrait, Henry makes it all too clear that Anna of Cleves pleases him not! The marriage remains unconsummated, and Henry leaps almost immediately into the arms of the somewhat reckless Katherine Howard. Unfortunately for her, her lust nearly matches that of the King. And although the King may have dalliances, the Queen definitely cannot. Medieval double standards sadly apply. So, after a full written confession, another wife loses her head. Then comes the only survivor, the highly literate and bravely subversive Catherine Parr. She has religious reform in mind, but when the King gets wind of this, he signs her arrest warrant. Only by completely subverting herself and her dignity does this final Queen manage to keep her neck from bisecting. If all of that wasn't enough, this book gives extremely detailed accounts of the rises and falls of the families who followed their relatives to the top. This book does not recommend being related to a fallen Queen who has ignited the King's rage. As the Queens fall so do the families in many cases. Some of the accused go in unthinkably nasty ways; ways which make mere beheading seem like a philanthropic gift. Though the book focuses on the lives of the women - the author even calls them \\"victims\\" - the life of the greatly expanding King and his times welds the narrative together. Henry VIII doesn't come across here as a kind and gentle ruler. He appears ruthless to the extreme in the pursuit of his goals. He manages to survive rebellions such as the Pilgrimage of Grace of 1536-7 and obliterates anyone who displeases him. His execution of the elderly Margaret Countess of Salisbury, hacked to pieces by an inexperienced executioner, stands as one of the most gruesome and reprehensible acts of his reign. In the end, only his own girth seemed to stop him.This book delves deep into the lives of Henry's wives as well as their back stories. Realpolitik splatters across every page. These were brutal times indeed. Prepare for disbelief at the depths of human cruelty and horror at how easily family members abandon each other once they fall out of favor with authorities. Prepare also for thick reading as the maze of details and intrigues pile up over the years. Most of all, prepare to be mesmerized by one of history's most stunning tales of love and death. Very few historical personal dramas live up to this one. The corrosive lure of power seeps from the story and engulfs those helpless to stop it, which ends up being most people. Those who envy the royalty of the past will face a stark reality here: most of the sons and daughters of the powerful ended up as tools for their families' political advancement. Henry himself tried to marry off his Daughter Mary (who ended up as Queen Mary I) to the Emperor Charles V for pure reasons of power. Even those born into privilege can become pawns. Even the King, though the most free to express his will, was held in chains of tradition and global politics. And in the end his grand plan for an even grander shrine to himself falls through. The remains of Henry VIII rest beneath a simple slab shared by his wife Jane Seymour and the executed King Charles I. His wives, even his \\"disgraced\\" ones, have equal or better aesthetically pleasing permanent resting places. The epilogue discusses the fate of the six Queen's graves in the intervening centuries. Fortune played a heavy hand even in the tumultuous tales of their corpses. Some were forgotten or were hiding in plain site. This book, and similar ones by other authors, helped reignite the stories of these women of ages past. In their time they were expected to serve as baby machines and keep quiet. In retrospect, most of them rose above these limiting expectations and challenged their times and even their King. They lost, unfortunately - such were the times - but the spirit of their challenge lives on in this fascinating and completely engrossing book."},{"Title":"Wives of Henry VIII","review":"Unlike the whiney reviewers who complain that books like this one has too many words and people in it or isn't as \\"exciting\\" as The Tudors on Showtime or a Philippa Gregory novel, I found this book to be a very stimulating page turner as far as historical biographies go. You need to have at least half a brain to be able to fully enjoy this book. If you have the attention span of a toddler and the reading comprehension of an elementary school student, you might find this book to be a difficult read. I enjoy Antonia Fraser and she does have a tendency to be very dry in spots, but for a true lover of Tudor history the facts are much more exciting than the fiction. I enjoy historical fiction myself, but I recognize its place is to entertain rather than educate. Philippa Gregory has said in interviews that she gathered a lot of her information for her novels from reading Allison Wier and Antonia Fraser's biographies, among others.Antonia Fraser presents a very sympathetic portrait of Katharine of Aragon that is kind without completely taking her side in all things. She explains the royal divorce in clear terms that are easy to follow, even though at the time it was very complicated. Even people who are not fans of KofA will feel sorry for her when her chapter reaches its end.Anne Boleyn is portrayed as someone who basically would have been a wonderful wife if she'd been married to a very different husband. Her temper and moods made her just too feisty for a man like Henry VIII to handle, since he was used to getting his way all the time. Antonia presents the argument that for as long as Anne knew Henry before they were officially married, she should have known better than to get on his bad side. Antonia Fraser is slightly less sympathetic to her plight since she could have avoided it if she'd been more tactful. She is very fair in her assessment of her character and she does bring up a lot of Anne's good qualities that are ignored in historical fiction today which would have you believe a very one-dimensional view. In fact you find that Anne and KofA had more in common than it might seem at first glance, since she was actually very pious and very generous to the poor.Jane Seymour doesn't get much of a chapter, maybe because so little is really known for sure about her and because her time with the king was so short. The description of her elaborate funeral is very detailed and there are other interesting details included in the chapter as well, but the character study is not as fine as with the other wives. But again this is probably because so little is actually known.Anne of Cleves is one of my favorite of Henry VIII's wives and her story is very richly detailed. A lot of biographers of Henry and his wives leave off talking about her after their divorce, but the fact is that she was still very much involved in his life as well as the lives of the royal children. The book includes two very good pictures of her as well.Katherine Howard is portrayed as foolish and ignorant, which she undoubtedly was, but Antonia Fraser makes the argument that it was more because of the times she was living in and all that wasn't really completely her fault. When I imagine her in my mind I see her the same way I see these stupid pop stars that are always in the tabloids for getting in trouble because they did something stupid. That is kind of how she is portrayed, as a silly girl who thought she wouldn't get caught. Also she states that a portrait that many claim to be of Katherine is not actually her, but is more likely to be Elizabeth Seymour. There is still some scholarly debate over the portrait today, but this book was written and originally published quite some time ago so more details than what are offered in the book may have come to light since then.Catharine Parr's chapter is very interesting to read since this was the time when Henry VIII was at his all time worst. His illness made him very unpleasant to be around and you get the sense of feeling sorry for her that she had to be married to such a spoiled man. It certainly makes one grateful for modern medicine, and makes modern husbands look almost like saints in comparison to this royal one.Although this book is about Henry VIII's wives and not solely Henry VIII, there is a lot of information about him as well as other people in the court. She presents Henry in a very sympathetic and human way. He is not cast in the light of the barbarian lecher many biographers see him in. Again, she shows us more than a one-dimensional character of someone who had many bad points but also many good ones. She gives the reason for a lot of his actions as being done out of fear, because of illness, and because he was just raised to be very spoiled and indulged all his life. She shows us his downward spiral as being due to his many illnesses and pains, but gives no excuses for his self-pitying and sometimes tyrannical behavior.All together this book was a very good read and I may pick it up again and re-read it sometime in the future, but I do not recommend it for those who are expecting a storyline with dramatic scenes and romantic nonsense. If you want women running around in gardens with fancy dresses on and men in tights with lances and swords, go read something else. If you want the bald truth without Hollywood glossing over the raw information, then you might enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Wives of Henry VIII","review":"I have read several of the books on the six wives of Henry VIII, however this one by Lady Antonia Fraser is the best, and contains more interesting material than any of the others,"},{"Title":"Wives of Henry VIII","review":"With the recent popularity of Tudor fiction, it is refreshing to read a clear-cut comprehensive biography of the six women who are often inadequately portrayed. Fraser's chronology is smooth and the transition from one woman's history to the next is succinct. While the book sometimes gets bogged down with politics and family lineage, the mood is decisively set for 16th Century scandal. While Henry VIII is a notorious historical figure, known for his tyranny and serial matrimonies, the women in his lives are often stereotyped based on their demise. But there is more substance to Catherine of Aragon, Anne Boleyn, Jane Seymour, Anne of Cleves, Kathryn Howard, and Katherine Parr and Fraser does an adequate job of exploring the depths of their hearts and minds.One interesting aspect I had never considered before, which Fraser discusses in the epilogue, is biological fate. Would Henry have found it necessary to divorce Catherine of Aragon if she had been successful in producing the much desired male heir? Thus, would Anne Boleyn have simply been a royal mistress? The same could be said down the line. Would Anne have met her doom so soon, if at all, if she had given birth to a prince? There are so many fascinating details in this book that often get overlooked in narratives of Henry VIII and his wives and it is a thorough and intriguing look at one of the most fascinating periods in English history."},{"Title":"Wives of Henry VIII","review":"This book is extremely well written, although I do think that sometimes Lady Fraser gets caught up in the minutiae. I love the illustrations, with the close-ups of each of the queen's personal heraldric badges. This book will definetly go to England with me when I go study abroad, it's a new take on the lives of the wives of one of England's most well-known kings. Family trees are extremely helpful."},{"Title":"Wives of Henry VIII","review":"A good book to read to get an overview about what went on with Henry and all those wives. Those who enjoy history and detail will enjoy the perspective Fraser always provides. This one is not to be missed if you enjoy British history."},{"Title":"Wives of Henry VIII","review":"As I described it to my friend, Fraser's work reads like a novel with footnotes. There's definitely research, and she has an excellent grasp on what she is saying, but as a biography of the wives, there isn't much of the usual dense analysis to grapple with. Fraser's strength as an author is in the narrative. Her narrative is lively and well informed - her background in writing novels definitely comes through. She is also successful at ensuring that she has given you all the background information to attempt to explain the context - it was, after all, more than just a husband's wandering eye. This work of popular history is definitely accessible and entertaining, and even though you might already know how it ends, the narrative still keeps you coming back to it, waiting for the next high emotion scene where heads will quite literally roll.For those of you who enjoy history, this will be a delightful, easy read.If you are considering going to see The Other Boleyn Girl [Theatrical Release] or you're a fan of the Showtime seriesThe Tudors - The Complete First Season, or even if you aren't, I would definitely recommend picking up Fraser's book. At the very least the book will allow you to be watch such recent Hollywood hits and say, \\"Hey! They totally got the timeline and context wrong on this whole situation.\\" It will also probably make you wonder why Hollywood has bothered to change the story at all - when the real one is dramatic and entertaining enough on its own."},{"Title":"Wives of Henry VIII","review":"A much beloved English teach introduced me to the books of Antonia Fraser in high school, and she has been my benchmark of excellence in non-fiction ever since. Before reading, I knew very little about each of the six women discussed in this book, aside from the bare details of their lives and deaths. Not only did this book educate me, it made me feel that we were old friends.The prose of this book flows very naturally, making it feel more like fiction then biography, though the facts of the matter are clearly well researched. While she does take liberties at times, she always makes it clear that those passages are only possibilities, and that they are based on known facts. All matters, large and small, are used to get a hint of the true character of each woman and to move them away from their tired stereotypes. The book also contains a well selected group of illustrations.In short, this is my favorite of all of Antonia Frasier's books, and I'd recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Wives of Henry VIII","review":"Antonia Frazer makes history alive and completely interesting. This book separates fact from fiction regarding the Wives of King Henry VIII. There are many pieces of information regarding Henry and his wives that historians disagree upon. Frazer discusses WHY she came to the conclusions she did and discusses the alternative viewpoints of other historians. This detail in particular really impressed me. (Of course, it was a little disappointing, however, to discover that Katherine Howard didn't actually cry out her love for Thomas Culpepper from the scaffold, though!)This book provides more than a brief overview to all six of these fascinating women. It really discusses their lives--as related to Henry and to the times-- in much detail, covering many important points while clarifying misconceptions and legend from fact."},{"Title":"Wives of Henry VIII","review":"For those who say history is boring. Better than reading a novel, with real characters sometimes going beyond the imaginary. An amazing study of the six wives, and the power crazed king they called husband. Used every means imaginable to justify ridding himself of one wife, to marry another. Even to the point of falsely accusing one of commiting incest with her own brother (Anne Boleyn), and having her beheaded. A powerful study of the British monarchy, and one of its most shameful periods."},{"Title":"Wives of Henry VIII","review":"I agree with the other reviewers that Lady Fraser gives an excellent historical account that delves into the lives and personalities of these women. But just a warning for those of you who are not scholars of British History, this book is very tediously detailed (obviously very well researched). While I don't consider myself a speed reader by any means, I can usually finish a 450 page book in 1-2 weeks. It's been almost 3 weeks and I'm only at page 150. There are so many names and titles of people included that it's very difficult for the average reader to keep everyone straight and I find myself reading paragraphs over again to try and figure out who's who and who is important. I wholeheartedly agree that Fraser gives an excellent insight into the lives of the women, and I am determined to finish the book because I am intrigued by their stories and getting to know their persons. However, as an average reader, I prefer a more &quot;watered-down&quot; version that doesn't include every Duke and Earl and cousin's wife, etc. that was alive during the same period."},{"Title":"Wives of Henry VIII","review":"I thought that this book was excellent. It was interesting and informative at the same time. It brought across the flavor of the period very well, and you also learned many new things while reading it. It is useful for research, but is also a good book to read for enjoyment. The author obviously did much in-depth research for this book, and it shows. The author was a skilled writer, so you could picture in your mind all the people, clothing, food, and places that are described in this book. I also thought the bibliography at the end was very thorough. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Wives of Henry VIII","review":"As a lover of history, I couldn't help being fascinated by this intelligent, scholarly and well-written book. Myths are destroyed by thorough investigation and sensible interpretation of historical fact, and the personalities that emerge out of a long-vanished past are as interesting and complex as the times in which they lived. Fraser's almost day-to-day account of the King's marital life makes it hard to believe that all of these things took place five hundred years ago."},{"Title":"Wives of Henry VIII","review":"If you are familiar with the subject matter, this book does not cover fresh territory, outside of a few obscure details here and there. Lady Antonia Fraser's writing, as always, is fresh, engaging and broad in perspective; although she does not delve into details, nothing is lost. But she must cover a huge expanse: each of Henry VIII's queens reflect him and his needs (indeed, women then were wholly dependent on a man's favour) at different stages of his life and kingship. Which brings me to a poignant note: the most complex and intriguing queens (Katherine of Aragon, Anne Boleyn, Katherine Parr) suffered at his hands and could not exercise their considerable talents unless permitted. But that is a modern perspective and irrelevant.What Lady Antonia does best is reveal these women, their personalities and abilities, in the cultural, social and political context of the time. This book is a superb introduction not just to Henry VIII's wives, but Henry himself: vicariously we see the man through the women who both intrigued and repulsed him. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Wives of Henry VIII","review":"Of all the tutor biographies I've read this is my favorite. Antonia Fraser does a marvelous job. She takes detailed fact and presents it as the amazing story it truly is. Catherine of Aragon Henry's first wife is often only mentioned as the queen replaced by Anne Boelyn few authors forget to mention that Henry and Catherine were married for two decades before Anne became queen. And the often-skipped (or merely summarized in one sentence) Anne of Cleves is portrayed not as &quot;the ugly one&quot; but as an innocent princess who truly did not know what her brother had gotten her into. The more popularly written-about Anne Boelyn, Catherine Howard, and Catharine Parr are also thoroughly examined and Fraser goes to great lengths to go beyond the stereotypes in favor of a more accurate picture. All in all the book of course is not flawless but definitely worth the time it will take to absorb all this information."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"This is a superb history, not only well written, but extremely important to understand that moment in time.

Intricate detail on the personalities and inability to think strategically that led to catastrophe. The story exemplifies the adage, \\"those who do not study history are doomed to repeat it.\\""},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"This is, or rather was, a very influential book in one of humanity's darkest hour: the Cuban Missile Crisis. It was influential because Kennedy actually learned something from this book: how little is the control that leaders have over a crisis once they have unfolded, and World War I is a classic example.To serve its purpose a history book should teach us lessons that we can apply or that we can use to judge current events. To do so, it should try to illustrate a point with accurate facts. It does help if it is also well written.Barbara Tuchman was a master in her trade and this book is one of the best books that I have ever read. Everyone knows how World War I started and how it ended but Mrs. Tuchman provides the details, the insights and the description of people long dead.And because of its superb prose this books actually works as a thriller: at one point I started to wonder if the Germans would be able to succeed in their attack.A great book by one of the best historians."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"The subject of the beginning of World War I was fascinating to me in the first place with all of the politcal intrigue and alliances involved. Barbara Tuchman certainly exceeded my expectations with a history written almost in novel form. This is no \\"just the facts\\" rescitation. The book is well researched and very difficult to put down. I recommend it to anyone even slightly interested in the political or military seeds of WWI."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"TGOA was not the easiest read, but am certainly more knowledgable about the events leading up to, and first month, of WWI. It is startling to see why an Austrian prince being shot in Serbia lead to the greatest war in history up to its time. Czars, Kings, Generals, and Kaisers are all intertwined in a a new school war fought in old Europe. America is hardly mentioned, due to its late participation in the war and (lack of) foreign policy by President Wilson. Tannenberg, Moise, and Alsace will all become familiar locales by the end of the book as well as French \\"elan\\".

All in all, a must read for anyone who likes to read."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"This book is especially worth reading now as we are about to leave the 20th century. Are we any less rigid or less arrogant in our thinking than the British, French and Germans were at the start of this century? This book not only offers insight into the root causes of the first World War but some interesting thoughts about our own time. One reader thought Barbara Tuchman was unfairly critical of Germans. I am of German ancestry and frankly, the Germans were as arrogant as she says they were. This arrogance is the same danger we Americans face now with our technology. We, too, are in danger of making the same mistakes that the Germans did. Let's hope that it doesn't take two major wars to deflate our outsized national ego. Let's hope we don't elect an insecure bully (and dumbkopf) like Kaiser Wilhelm II to be our president."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"One of the most detailed book about war, it brings vivid image to the readers and brings them to the first historical month of the WWI.

The author does a great job a bringing you up to speed with the state of mind for each of the major players in the early days of the war. The book then moves more or less chronologically through the eve of Marne in great detail. I also like that the author does not take sides. For example, she presents the horrific treatment of Belgium civilians in a matter of fact way but still drives home the terribleness of those actions. The only deficiency (unless this missed it in the notes and sources) is the lack of complete translations for the large number of French phrases used in the book; some of the more obscure are translated but not all.

It is because Tuchman has both the gift of the well researched historian who gets her dates right, and the gift of the story teller who understands that history is not about dates, it is about the human experience.Tuchman is one of the best selling and most highly regarded historians ever. Years from now when the great historians are numbered, on the list with Herodotus will be this woman. If she is still alive I only have one request: keep typing."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"I have given this great book only 4 stars instead of its deserved 5 stars in order to register my level of enjoyment rather than my rating of its absolute merit. I was very fascinated by the build up to the war and can't wait to read about this aspect in more detail in her prequel, The Proud Tower. Tuchman explores the pre-war strategic planning by both rivals Germany and France of marching through Belgium. I did not know so much forethought had gone into the invasion of Belgium nor the eventual historic struggle put up by the Belgians. I also found the discussion of various pre-war militaristic ideological witings enlightening and found their relation to Germany's later Nazi ideology chilling. I was previously unaware that the French had exploited Bergson's notion of elan for militaristic ends. I was also intrigued by other behind the scenes maneuvers and the way in which non-combatants were caught up in the war. What lowered my enjoyment of the book was the long passages about specific troop maneuvers and debates about these maneuvers between the various generals and military strategists--its just a matter of personal preference but I was bored by some of the detail of this aspect of the war. Great book but large sections not exactly to my taste--my shortcoming --not Tuchman's."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"Deals with the opening phase of World War I,how France withstood the onslaught of German armies.Infact ,power politics and some of the rash steps taken by the German monarch Kaiser Wilhelm who torpedoed Bismarck's policy of conciliating the British precipitated the outbreak of hostilities in Europe.Early period of the 20th century ,Europe was divided into two hostile power blocs,perched above an ammunition dump just waiting for a spark to set it aflame.Unfortunate train of events in this direction commenced with the assassination of Austrian heir apparent Archduke Franz Ferdinand by a Serbian nationalist on June 28, 1914.This had a domino effect which pushed feuding European powers one after another on the road to war.Germany invaded France on August5, 1914.German armies marched through Belgium and Britain was drawn into the conflict since London had pledged to uphold Belgian neutrality.More precisely because it wanted to contain Germany's hegemonistic urge.This was in tune with Britain's balance-of-power policy which it steadfastly pursued right from the time of Tudor monarchs.Tuchman has narrated the course of the war and how it unfolded as the days passed by.Germans were able to stop the Russians at Tannenberg but gross ineptitude of Jr Von Moltke botched much-touted Schlieffen manoeuvre.Allies were able to turn the tide in the Battle Marne but war degenerated into ruinous attrition.Military operations bogged down,Western front streching from Switzerland to North Sea stagnated then petrified.Tuchman's book is impeccably and meticulously researched.Also very racy that you are inclined to read it one lap."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"Whoa! I loved this book. I like Keegan's books, too. It's hard to say which is best. Tuchman describes a lot of personalites. Keegan has more relevant facts and explore strategies better.

Mrs. Tuchman is clearly one of the most talented authors to ever put pen to paper. She takes the events that most history text books have reduced to boring drivel and makes them very real and very relevant to modern times.Mrs. Tuchman's accounts of German inflexibility and Allied complacency lead one to the inescapable conclusion that not only was the war entirely avoidable, but once started needn't have been nearly as long and bloody as it turned out to be: The German refusal to halt war preparations once they began simply because it was too inconvenient. The French failing to anticipate the German sweep around their left flank. The naive Belgian insistence on nuetrality even in the face of imminent attack. The British refusal to commit enough troops to make a real difference. The failure to update tactics to match the new technology on all sides, but particularly the Allied side. It all adds up to a colossal failure of both political and military leadership that would ultimately cost millions of lives.One other effect of this book on my thinking is that I felt much less sympathy for the Allies than I had before reading it. The arrogance and incompetence of the French in particular make it very difficult to feel sorry for them. I now question whether this was a war in which the U.S. should ever have become involved. After all, our entry was instrumental in the defeat of Germany and the subsequent Versailles Treaty. As we all know, the seeds of the Second World War were sown with that ill conceived document.At the very least, this book will make you think critically about the monumental events of the time. It is most enlightening and, I must say, as entertaining as any fiction novel I have ever read. This book is a must for all well informed citizens of any country."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"\\"The Guns of August\\" is the classic, Pulitzer Prize-winning story of the events leading to and including the outbreak of the Great War in Europe in 1914. Delving into the broad military and political issues of the time, Tuchman paints a portrait of a conflict whose fuse had been lit years prior to its beginning, with historical figures whose characters are described in memorable detail and come alive in the history as players in a drawn out historical drama. The book provides an excellent account of the situation in Europe in that summer in 1914, what the beligerants expected and what actually occured on the battlefield in the first month of the war, with clarity that is never difficult to follow. The lessons drawn from the outbreak of the war remain extremely relevant to this day, and \\"The Guns of August\\" continues its unparalleled preservation of them."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"One could not ask for a more compelling slice of history than this instant classic. Tuchman's most acclaimed work unveils the foreboding summer of 1914.

At times, the book almost seems too detailed and dense. The late Ms. Tuchman could certainly turn a phrase and while she was a wonderful writer, the sheer wealth of information provided by her historical overview is a bit daunting at times. Guns of August presupposes a decent familiarity with the subject matter and thus readers new to the outbreak of WWI might very well find themselves a bit intimidated early on. Those brave enough to forge ahead and persevere, however, will find themselves richly rewarded.Ms. Tuchman was blessed with a keen sense of observation and she admirably manages to seamlessly blend her insightful historical commentary with a comprehensive review of the persons and events responsible for the outbreak of hostilities in 1914. Perhaps most entertaining of all is Ms. Tuchman's dry, biting wit which is usually aimed at the Germans but which also occasionally skewers other victims as well. Her exhaustive treatment of the subject matter, while interesting and informative in its own right, certainly provided me with a deeper understanding of the how WWI came to reshape the European continent, usher in the 20th century and set the stage for the far more sweeping conflict of WWII. Any serious student of WWII should appreciate this invaluable primer.The book's faults are few and relatively minor. Given the rather large cast of individuals covered, some sort of character index would have been much appreciated. Persons mentioned in passing early on are often referred to again hundreds of pages later with little or no reminder of who they are or what positions they occupy. Also, the book would have benefitted from both more and better rendered maps and illustrations."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"Ms.Tuchman gives a very detailed description of the chain of events that preceded the start of the War,followed by a thorough account of the first month and a half of it, culminating in the famous \\"Battle of the Marne\\". She intertwines the description of events with riveting comments of the military and political leaders of the times, focusing on the main protagonists, France, Germany, Russia and England. She is incisive, opinionated and sometimes quite a judge of character but seems to have conducted extensive research judging from the vast bibliography and footnotes. History is made by human beings, called to make decisions so monumental in scope and so dire in their consequences that when we read of them we can't help but ponder about the world we live in. It is a very good book which helps gain tremendous insight on a tragedy that was to mark the world for the next 90 years."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"In this relatively short and highly readable expose' author Barbara Tuchman narrates her readers through the complex series of events leading to World War I (WWI). She describes the events, personalities, and personal and professional shortcomings of the key participants that caused the world to slide into our first global conflict. The result was a tragedy almost beyond comprehension.Tuchman describes the series on treaties and alliances that were designed to prevent war. Unfortunately, no one foresaw the impact intense nationalism and inept diplomacy would have on Germany after the Franco-Prussian War. This was matched by France's obsession with recovering the Alsace and Lorraine provinces leading to her unlikely alliance with Russia. Likewise, Britain could not endure Germany's development of a naval fleet. Pleas to stop or limit the build-up were ignored. German diplomacy had succeeded in alienating the two largest powers on the European continent and the largest sea power in the world. Peaceful, prosperous Europe was a power-keg waiting to explode. Austria's invasion of Serbia sparked the inferno. WWI was on!Tuchman then narrates the first month of the conflict. Factors such as war plans, poor communications, unexpected resistance, leadership failures in both the military and political arenas, mistrust between allies, events Clausewitz would call collectively, \\"frictions,\\" would all come into play. The result was an end to the possibility of the short war both sides envisioned. WWI would drag on for four long years costing millions of lives and billions of dollars. \\"Paradise\\" was indeed \\"Lost\\" in August of 1914.President John F. Kennedy read this book when he saw his nation sliding into Vietnam and became determined not to let the same thing happen. He died before he could prevent it. Today's political leaders could benefit from Tuchman's analysis. Could it happen again? Former Defense Secretary Robert McNamara and Professor James G. Blight think so. In, \\"Wilson's Ghost: Reducing The Risk of Conflict, Killing and Catastrophe in the 21st Century,\\" they outline a plan to preclude a future nuclear holocaust. Reading and understanding the events described here are essential to preventing another such tragedy. The \\"Paradise Lost\\" this time could be all life on this planet."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"When asked how many troops the French would need from the English in the event of a general war Foch, a French General, stated only one. One? Well, He also said that &quot;we will make sure he is killed too.&quot; Shocking? Perhaps, but understandable from a general who was to lead France in its bloodest war up to that point in history.Foch's attitude also reflected a realistic appraisal of his English allies. Upto the point of dead soliders, English's attitude had reflected an extreme reluctance to enter on any side during a European War. It is the sad fact of history that, more then any other war, WWI could have been avoided if a few more leaders were willing to be a little bit more clear about their priorities, goals and intentions. Even so, the length and time of this war, could have been limited greatly, except for some of the most unsually and costly mistakes in history.For example, Turkey, later a German ally, was initially on the fence. They had, in fact, ordered two boats from England before the war started. Churchill, when war was close, held up these boats, which had already been paid for Turkey. Germany then was able to convice the Turks to join their side, after Germany delivered two boats. Boats that the English could have sunk.The Germans, on the other hand, had a strong strategy which almost won the war. Last minute nerves from a worried Kaiser, overconfidence in one smug general, and the redeployment of troops to a &quot;royal&quot; one; may have cost them the war. But for all of these things happening, Europe today could have been a German Empire.Tuchman's genius is showing how history really works. Most history books are written with an air of predestination or fatalism. I have seen histories that say WWII was lost the same day it began or that WWI was inevitable and it was also inevitable that German would lose. Phooey! Must of the time history is not like that. A little thing can make a great difference. The Guns of August shows us alot of these &quot;little things.&quot; As such, after reading it, you can appreciate how close that war was, and how different it could have worked out. In addition, Tuchman's eye towards drama, her skill at writing, and placement of interesting quotes from world leaders make the Guns of August the most compelling historical story I have ever read. I literally put all else on hold until I could finish this book. Indeed, I routinely looked at her sources and have since examined other records to see if Ms. Tuchman's book was accurate. It is. It is just that she is a skilled writer and this is her best work. Read it."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"The late Mrs. Tuchman, who passed on in 1989, was one of the most &quot;popular&quot;--the in the best sense of the word--historians of the 20th Century. She and The Durants shared the honor of enliving histriography's prose--often far deader than its dramatic personae--with not only writing of genius, but a moral center, a sense of right and wrong and possessing the courage to say so. Few novelist's rival Mrs. Tuchman's ability to plunge the reader into dramatic situations; indeed, some of the most dramatic events in mankind's history in the month of August 1914.Anyone who accuses Mrs. Tuchman of anti-German bias has an allergic reaction to the truth.While &quot;guilt&quot; is an amorphous term of little meaning, there can be little doubt--as Sir John Keegan puts it--that Germany started the war. It was &lt;i&gt;Germany&lt;/i&gt; that turned a bilateral war between Austria-Hungary and Russia into the conflagration that destroyed Western civilization and gave impetus and fertilized with blood such noxious weeds as Bolshevism and Nazism allowing to flourish and prepare for a second, conclusive round of the war the Kaiser's foolish arrogance created.Mrs. Tuchman largely avoids the larger issues of the war and focuses on her main subject: the Western Front's first climactic month--August 1914. This month has proved more pivotal in the history of the human race, the reality that you and I live in no matter where you live on the planet. By contrast, the Napoleonic Wars were little more than a reshuffling of human pawns upon a chessboard, rearranging the deck chairs of the Titanic, if you were.Mrs. Tuchman accurate describes the corrupt chaos of the Third Republic of France, a government everyone hatred but no one dared attempt a coup against for fear of the devil one DID know might come to power; of a Germany, who, in Caprivi words, got in everyone's way, frightened everyone and achieved nothing. At the head of all this was a man who, however much more intelligent and better educated than his cousin &quot;dearest Nicky&quot;, little less a fool than that cousin; she flatly depicts the moral paralysis of British politicians more concerned with keeping power and &quot;reform&quot; and aghast at the idea of plunging Britian into the type of coalition war she had assiduously avoided since defeating and murdering the &quot;Orge&quot; decades before. She shows the careful balancing act that the realistic Cabinet members (Gray, Churchil et al)were forced to walk amongst their ministerial colleagues in order to bring Britain into the war against a Germany now on the march. Mrs. Tuchman's descriptions of these Cabinet meetings (and to a lesser their French and German equivalents) are as agonizing as the actual events themselves had to be. Only Gray and Churchill, with the longer perspective of history, realized that such mighty concentrations of wealth and military power could not be defeated in a month, a season or a year. As the drive to Paris begins to falter and finally fail, Mrs. Tuchman shows us the few hearts who realized exactly what the victory at the Marne--though this reduces none of the glory of French and British arms--portended.Do not be fooled by a historian willing to take a moral view and willing to denounce evil, incompetence, self-aggrandizement and fools to the sunlight and expose them. Mrs. Tuchman does exactly that. And we can see that, tho' gone these fifteen years, the sting in her words still reaches the tenders spots of those who would cast gauzy revision over the facts. Sir John Keegan's excellent, if telescoped by size restrictions, &quot;The First World War&quot; takes the same position as does Mrs. Tuchman on the &lt;b&gt;fact&lt;/b&gt; of Germany's responsibility, more specifically of William II's responsibility, for the First World War and all of that which followed.Any attempt at controversy aside, read this book, if for no other reason than the beauty of its prose and the majestic example of a monograph it presents."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"I'll be the first to admit that the problem lies with me. I am not a \\"war book\\" fanatic. By that, I mean that I want to understand why a war is fought. This book starts out great with that. Then, It quickly becomes a book that describes the battles bit by bit. I understand that many people do love such descriptions. I do not. This book is, I'm sure, excellent for such a reader. I gave-up. To be honest, it did do a great job in one area. I have never understood why the war was fought in the first place. As far as I could see, it was fought because of alliances. Country A had to fight because they were in an alliance with Country B, who was in an alliance with Country C who attacked Country A, and so forth. Well, in fact, this is the absolute truth. To make it even worse, this was all done on purpose! The 19th Century minds had decided, after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, that this would stop future wars, as it would work as a buffer against such fights. In another miscalculation, all of the \\"experts\\", on all sides, guaranteed that the war we now call World War I would be over within 3-4 months, absolutely 6 months at the most. I would have loved to read more on this type of thinking, and less on the battles. As I said, this is my fault, and not the author's."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"I saw this book on the shelf many times, picked it up, cracked it open and immediately put it back. It looked too intimidating. Every page had copious details. But, convinced by others reviews, I eventually bought it. And now I'm recommending it to you. It's an awesome experience. Like an encyclopedia with flare, the author produces one great page after another until the very end. It's important when browsing this book to consider it one page at a time begining with page one because the material is so grandiose. It's war through a big pair of binoculars. Tuchman could have left the Goeben chapter out, but it's still ok reading. But the rest of the book and it's principle characters are great! I would have liked more closure on the lives of each during and after the war, but that's me being greedy. Just a great read about a war for which there are no more soldiers alive to help us remember why."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"I found it a slog to get through the buildup to the battles and the battles themselves, and would have preferred a broader treatment of the whole war.

This is the first book I attempted to read that covered World War I and I was beyond disappointed. Barbara Tuchman actually succeeds in turning a non-fiction into what seems like fiction by making events way too dramatic and focusing on unimportant dialogue. In what was the worst omission of history I've ever seen, she actually only dedicates 3 pages to the murder of Archduke Ferdinand, which was the even that set off the war. She gives no history of the tension between Serbia and Austria. In fact, this book is very lacking in history in general and way too abundant in useless drama. For true history buffs, this book is a waste of time. For people looking for the cheesy Hollywood version of World War I, then this book is for you."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"A little difficult to understand having such little knowledge of the events before reading this book.

I read this book because JFK had read and recommended it from what I have read."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"The Guns of August is one of the worst history books ever written. B. Tuchman displays an arrogant and absolutely violent anti German bias in her examination of the war. This isn't history in any sense, it is pure propaganda.The Germans of WWI were not the Nazis of WWII. The Germans did not fight like beasts and they did not murder, torture or otherwise disobey the rules of warfare as understood at the time. No reputable author who has reviewed the war accuses the Germans of anything like the depravity Tuchman ascribes to them. Keegan, SLA Marshall and numerous other key historians simply do not report the war as Ms. Tuchman does because they do not swallow propaganda as truth.A truly worthless book that slants and taints history in the worst possible way. The author's motivations for such drivel cannot be known, but the fact that it is there is not disputable. Historians do, by the very fact that they are human, slant history to fit their unstated and often unexamined assumptions. But no historian should ever willfully bend the truth to fit his or her world view, or be so dumb as to not know they are doing it. The best historians strive to avoid bias, but openly admit that it is there. The key is making one's best effort to avoid it.If you really want to know about World War I read John Keegan.

My knowledge of WWI was limited to everything that I hadn't forgotten from High School History classes (which wasn't much), and I was eager fill this gap in my knowledge-base.Well... I have to warn potential readers that this book definitely doesn't flow with excitement.

Here and there throughout this book, she labels the germans with many derogatory names and depicts them as just plain evil - and bear in mind this is 1914 history (not nazi germany). Such hateful bias is deplorable in history books. So in the interests of trying to understand why a gifted writer would write such hateful things into her work, I read the author's biography and found she was jewish (American) who was an adult (in america) during the years of the holocaust - which may explain this slant. The book was enjoyable - well written with the BIG exception that it is very one sided and the late author's contempt (hatred?)for Germans comes out in full force here and there in this book. In this regard, it wasn't deserving of the pultitzer prize it won."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"I agree with the many other reviewers here who cite this biased work as slanted propaganda. While the author clearly has a degree of crafty writing skills - such are certainly applied here in a biased manner -which provides an end product of twisted versions of events during World War I. Apparently done so for the sensationalistic impact of storytelling from the British perspective. I would respectfully request you look elsewhere for a more realistic and truthful account of the war.

Initially, its length - 440 pages - did not seem unreasonable.But on pages 216-219 (hardcover edition), the text collapsed into an astonishing sinkhole of multiple editing failures, the greatest of which was the violation of the indispensable advice above - \\"what to leave out.\\"This dismaying trend continued until I eventually staggered to page 309, the conclusion of the Battle of Tannenberg.By then, instead of being able to simply read, I was constantly forced to edit what I was reading (inserting critical missing commas that must follow introductory phrases at the start of complex sentences, marking up redundancies, etc.).The literary triage system alarm sounded; there are other promising books that have arrived in the mail. GOA went back on the bookshelf, with its seven final chapters left unread.Other notes:---When Belgium was invaded by the Germans in 1914, \\"on August 18 [,] von Kluck's leading troops reached the [River] Gette...\\" Had a notable battle of WWI been fought at that location, the post-war speech honoring the fallen soldiers would have been known as the \\"Gette's Burg Address.\\"---Can books be separated at birth?With the example that follows - even though the chronology instantly invalidates the premise - the inclination is still to say yes, it is possible.Tuchman's brilliant writing style, abundant talent & critical faults - made evident in 1962 - are, in an astonishing & innocent coincidence, identical to those of Margaret Leech Pulitzer, whose acclaimed Reveille In Washington was published in 1940.---But a history published in the same year as GOA also deserves mention: Cornelia Otis Skinner's superb Elegant Wits & Grand Horizontals.If you managed to finish Guns of August (perhaps with the assistance of a month-long DWI jail term, which frees up all sorts of time for catching up on your recreational reading), make \\"Elegant Wits\\" your next book.Discover what the French - primarily those residing in Paris - had been up to in the comparatively docile 1890s.This time, you'll be reading the work of an equally creative author who knew the inestimable value of getting to the point."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"Tuchman is a believer in the \\"Great Man\\" view of history: that is, history is not predetermined by larger forces. Instead, great men in a position of power have the ability to change history if they have enough imagination and courage to do so. Hence, she sees the stumbling of statesmen into war as an inexcusable abdication of responsibility. Statesmen did not have to say yes to the military men who claimed that the inability to change intricate mobization plans dictated policy and foreclosed last minute efforts at diplomacy. Most interesting is her analysis of the failure of the Germans to act on the suggestion that the war be fought exclusively in the east. Such a strategy might have kept England out of the war entirely, and may have motivated France to be just as passive as it later was in September 1939. But we'll never know. Tuchman persuasively argues that mobilization schedules were not quite as inflexible as advertised and that, moreover, a successful military strategy must always plan for flexibility.On the subject of the path to war, the book was disappointingly summary. Much of the book is, instead, devoted to the stumbling around of the military men in the first month of the war. The best book on the path to war is Laurence LaFore's \\"The Long Fuse.\\" LaFore has a similar view of Tuchman that, to use his brilliant phrase, the war was the result of a \\"failure of the imagination.\\" But he also sketches out the larger forces at work. I highly recommend LaFore's work as the better work.Still, Tuchman's book is excellent and her dicussion of the military campaigns of August is very interesting. Her essential thesis is the obtuseness of the Germans in not seeing how politically disastrous their Belgium campaign was. And she criticizes the Germans for transferring forces, in a fit of panic, to the East. Even though the Russians were foolish in their rush into battle, the move was politically astute: it rattled the Germans and, according to Tuchman, may have diverted enough crucial forces to change the path of history.Tuchman provides a very unflattering portrait of British weakness and dithering -- and credits the French commander Joffre in finally shaming the British to make a stand of the Marne. She criticizes the French for their romantic obsession with the need to take the offensive, which proved disastrous in the early campaigns. Indeed, the French attitude bordered on the ridiculous -- including sacrificing heavy artillery for fear of bogging the offensive down and clothing their men in ridiculous red pants that created great targets for the Germans.The Germans are admired for their efficiency, but the Generals were too inflexible with strategy and lost sight of Clauswitz's dictum that war was \\"politics by other means.\\"Tuchman writes beautifully, which allows her to portray men and events compellingly. One example is when, in discussing Ludendorff, she notes the absence of any fond tales of comradeship from his younger days. He's a humorless martinet. A \\"man without a shadow\\", writes Tuchman.An excellent and gripping narrative."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"A very well organized page turner, detailed and insightful. The book narrates parallel events in different chapters as in modern TV documentaries with vignettes. There is a great richness of detail and suspense is maintained even though we know the outcome of it all. It provides a context for the beginning of the war, shows how once certain preparations and inertia takes place events become almost inevitable. After providing this context the book moves into the narrative of the first month or so of World War I. At the end it provides a hint of the Marne that will reverse the events. Much of the material related to the first month of the war itself and the overall German plan traced back to Von Schlieffen is presented in another masterful book called \\"The Campaign of the Marne\\" by Sewell Tyng first published in 1935 and re-published in 2007 by Westholme Publishing. I recommend that you read Mr. Tyng's book if you read the Guns of August. Mr. Tyng's book covers the military aspects in the Western Front covered by the Guns of August and then continues to the Marne and the German retreat. Mr. Tyng and Mrs. Tuchman arrive at different conclusions regarding the contributions of key leaders namely those of General Joffre and Gallieni. Although Mrs. Tuchman's book is more recent and may have benefited of new documents or findings Mr. Tyng's position seems to be less contrived. I could not find any reference to Mr. Tyng's book in Mrs. Tuchman book published about 30 years later. Maybe there is a reference or maybe Mrs. Tuchman did not consider Mr. Tyng's book a primary source. Still anyone who read Mr. Tyng's book would have been profoundly helped in writing Mrs. Tuchman book. Mrs. Tuchman' s book also describes events that did not take place in the Western front, namely events in the Russian front that took place at the same time as well as naval military aspects in the Mediterranean that related to the German navy and to Turkey. Mr. Tyng refers to the events in the Russian front as they affected the German armies in the Western front. In summary, The Guns of August is a great book and now one of my favorite books.

It is a great and wonderful book."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"This is one of the most commanding books I've ever read. Who would have thought that the story of World War I would keep you up all night. This is a masterpiece. I've bought and given 40 copies to friends. Read it and pray for peace. Pray for leaders who know when to back down in the face of uncertainty. Read it and thank all that came before us to give us our wonderful world."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"This is the first book by Tuchman that I read. It was recommended to me by a close friend whose reading choices are full spectrum. I read it cover to cover non-stop. Barbara T. has not only a gift for investigative reporting, a skill critical to historians, but has also a novelist's sense of storytelling. A fine combination that makes history come alive and jump off the page."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"Being a 'boomer' I always thought WWI was ancient history, about on a par with the Peloponnesian War, but I was interested to find the roots of WWII deep in WWI (although this book is just about the first month of the war). Michael Dobbs in 'One Minute to Midnight' got me into this book by mentioning that Pres. Kennedy was so impressed with it (it was originally published in 1962) that he sent copies to all his advisers and top military leaders, although I think Dobbs actually did a better job of demonstrating the risk of accidental war.My complaints about the book and the reason I gave it only 4 stars are twofold. First the author assumes everyone is trilingual. And secondly, at least in the paperback edition that I got, the maps and figures are atrocious."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"The Guns of August is among the best works of history I've read. Barbara Tuchman combines good critical sense and historical research with fine writing and, most importantly, wit. Seldom have I laughed so often when reading something so tragic.Tuchman's book covers roughly the first month of World War I, from early August through the opening of the Marne Offensive in early September 1914. She begins with the background and lead-up to the war, which she does an admirable job of making digestible to the average reader. Most works of history would bog down in the muck of diplomacy and political intrigue, but The Guns of August trips lightly over the months leading to war. Tuchman sets up the belligerents one by one, describing their motives and aims and the plans they had for mobilization in the event of war. Then, thanks to the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand, which she treats in one paragraph, all of Europe explodes into open war.The Guns of August offers a good look at what brought about the ugly years of trench warfare on the Western Front. When the French and German plans--treated as inalterable gospel by their planners--both failed, the result was four years of stalemate and attrition. The course of the entire war, it seems, was decided that fateful August and September.Tuchman describes this all with refreshing energy and a wry sense of humor. She excels at characterization--she not only introduces the reader to the important figures of history, she lets the reader know a few telling things about them. A number of Prussian army officers are either \\"wasp-waisted\\" and smoke cigarettes in jade holders, or have buzzcuts and rolls of fat at the back of their collars. French General Joffre looks like Santa Claus and one would have to move heaven and earth to disturb his routines of lunch and an early bedtime. The result is not only entertaining and informative--these people have personalities and are not just more names of dead men--but important to Tuchman's narrative. \\"Character is fate,\\" she says, by way of the Greeks, and indeed she shows that, in the tragic opening month of World War I, some men measured up and others didn't, and the world had to live with their decisions.The end result is a work that puts humans and decisions at the forefront, which I found incredibly refreshing in this reductivist era of victims and passive tools of this or that environment. The Guns of August is an enjoyable, well-written, and insightful work of history written by a sharp-minded and keen historian.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"Of course the writing is amazing but this edition is a wonderful possession. The book I bought (library binding) is great! Book is built like a tank, great binding, good paper, and an attractive cover and spine design. If you are gifting this book this is your edition, a really beautiful job by the book manufacturer to complement what is no doubt a truly remarkable book of the 21st century!"},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"In a song Bob Dylan wrote \\"The First World War it came and it went. The reason for fighting I never did get.\\" I like Dylan, never understood how WWI grew out of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand; then I read The Guns of August. This book is the story of the incredible stupidity, miscalculations, ignorance, and arrogance, that lead to the death of twenty million people, by the rulers and politicians of Europe. In effect it tells how you get from the assassination of one man in Sarajevo to everyone in Europe killing each other, in little more than a month. War may be to important to leave to the generals, but peace seems to suffer at the hands of politicians. Barbra Tuchman,won a well deserved Pulitzer Prize for this book; which is easy to read, thoroughly researched, and well documented. She has been criticized for favoring various nations and individuals, You as the reader can judge this for yourself, but remember critics don't usually reference and footnote their comments. Another criticism of the book, it is more literature than history, why can't history be well written and interesting?This book covers an extremely complex period very well, it deserves more than five stars."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"A fine acount of the start of war and of the minds and attitudes of the major players. Excellent detail is both a blessing and a curse, sometimes making the going very slow. Few books address the personalities and interpersonal conflicts of the leaders on both sides as well as this book."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"This portrait of World War I's origins and beginning days is in penetrating as well as eloquently written. This book sheds light on a subject which Americans especially lack knowledge, and does so in a memorable and intelligent style. At the very least, this book teaches the reader dozens of new vocabulary words, as well as rather interesting ways to put them together in sentances and paragraphs. Perhaps the only shortcomming was a slight lack in character devolpment, but this is attributable to the lack of character evidence since the play was mainly based off historical information."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"The Guns of August is an epic history of the first month of the first World War. Many history books are little more than forums for boring professors to argue with each over historical theories or to prove thier own brillant historical thesis and explain their \\"insights\\" in condenseding fashion to a \\"less educated\\" audiance. Let me use this forum as an oppurtunity to tell all of these authors who write these types of books, histography SUCKS!! Take a lesson from Tuchman and write history with some emotion, like you have some blood in your veins. Nobody cares about long winded discussions about how other historians wrote history, and why they wrote it the way they did, and what affect their writing of history had on history, and on and on and on. The study of history is supposed to be about studing history, not studing historians. Somehow historians have gotten their role and history's role reversed, historians are supposed to study history not use history to study themselves and the history of their profession. Historians themselves are not interesting, but history is. Anyway, back to the Guns of August, Tuchman is a great writer and this book almost seems like a novel execpt for the fact that all of this actually occured. Tuchman is a narrative historian who explains the facts and what happened and when. She writes with a lot of personality, (God Forbid) and inserts her own opinions throughout the text. She takes the reader through a time portal until the reader feels that he side by side with the leading statesmen of Europe who are making uncertain decisions on incomplete information that will affect the lives of millions of people who have no say in anything. The reader will feel like they too are marching with the doomed French teenagers who thought war to be a game, and find out that War is, especially modern war, nothing but a contest of attrition and they are disposable meat. The myth of glory and glamor that conceal the truth about war is quickly dispelled when these French troops attempt to storm entranched machine gun positions with single shot rifles and bayonets. Diplomacy failed because each nation feared that by trusting the other and halting preparations for war they would leave their own nations in weakened circumstances that could be exploited by their enemies. Their are numerous times when the situation could have been brought under control but no one had the guts to risk a military disadvantage by seeking to dely the war. For example,the French,British and German all had elaborate military contingency plans based on their enemies movements. If the Germans mobilized by this hour then the French must be mobilized by this hour. If the Germans did this, then the French must do that, and vice versa. This kind of strict adherence to pre formulated military doctrines is the most insidious trap in human history and if Tuchman has a point with this book beyond telling a great story it is to express this. Their are no pretentious lectures on why this or that happended and how it was all the result of impersonal historical forces which she then goes on to name. The reader is presented with the facts and left to draw their own conclusions because Tuchman does not tell them what to think, (imagine that, allowing readers to think for themselves because perhaps the historian does not understand everything as well as they might think). As for those who say the Germans are treated unjustly in this book, what planet are you living on? Without a doubt Britain and France were imperialist oprressors but the Germans were the worst of the worst, except maybe for the Russians. This book is a page turner despite the fact that it is history and the reader knows how it will turn out. World War 1 is understudied and a lot of the information she provides will come as news to many readers. Tuchman paints historical potraits of battles, individuals, events, etc. She is a creative genuis that uses history as her artform. Many acadmics are well read but small minded and almost all lack imagination which Tuchman possess in vast quanities. This book is an example of history the way it should be written. The Germans in this book had a plan that was so much better than the French and their fighting tactics where contemporary and not outdated. It is a mircle that the Germans did not conquer Paris in 1914. This book is so full of suspense it is unbearable, at times the scope of what is occuring will hit the reader all at once like a ton of bricks, and I constantly thought, how in the world did she manage to write this difficult story this well. The atmosphere is so well transmitted to the reader that he or she can practically smell the gunsmoke, hear the footfalls of the seemingly unstopable German army on the march, and see the supposed great men who rule nations tremble with indecision in the corriders of power. Tuchman has a flair for the dramatic and often ends chapters with famous quotes that sum up what has occured beautifully. After reading this book the reader will understand World War 1 in a way that surpasses intellectual comphrension, the reader will posses a viseral understanding that hits them in the heart, in the stomach, that colors their soul. This might seem like overstatment but believe me, the best way to understand an event is to experienc it first hand, and this book is as close as anyone can get to doing that."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"Having read and thoroughly enjoyed Slam Marshal''s concise history of the Great WarI was hoping to find great detail of the origins of the conflict. Incredibly, this book totally ignores the machinations of Count Berchtold and the sequence of events in the Austrian-Serbian arena that WAS the basic cause of the Great War. Anyone reading the book is led to believe that war-mongering Kaiser Wilhelm (who the text inexplicably refers to as \\"William\\") was to blame. The bias of the authors is pretty transparent : they repeat Allied propaganda about German atrocities, not that the Germans didn't commit their share (along with the French). The Kaiser may not have exerted as much effort as he should have, after learning of Austrian diplomatic duplicity, but then, none of the other countries' leadership did any better. Needless to say, if Bismark had still been running Germany's diplomacy, the war would either never have happened or would not have involved the entire continent.I consider this book almost unreadable, especially as a history of the opening month of WWI.I found myself skipping page after page of irrelevant personal description of each and every character. And there are plenty of characters involved, I can tell you.The book finds fault with most of the characters, and considering the level of mediocrityof WWI commanders and national leaders, that pretty much is accurate. But the authors present King Albert of Belgium as a bona fide hero, for refusing by force the passage of the Germanarmy thru a small section of his country's border. With heroes like Albert, a country hardly needs enemies. His claim that he was protecting his country's neutrality and his belief that if the German army marched thru a part of Belgium soil his country would somehow become a vassalof that nation displays both paranoia as great as that ascribed to the Kaiser, and very loose thinking. Fighting France's enemy cannot be considered a neutral action from Germany's standpoint and armed resistance guaranteed his country's ruin. If this was the great honor the authors contend, it was bought as an inhuman price in human lives and four years of serfdom.In considering the book's treatment of the military actions, there are noticeable gaps in logic and coverage. Kluck's opportunity to envelop the British early on, eliminated by Bulow'sfaintheartedness about his flanks, is never mentioned. And some of the text is just plain laughable, as when Kluck is portrayed as not nervy enough to halt his exhausted troops, whilejust one sentence later, it enumerates the many reasons he thought of for not doing so. The authors have this very bad habit of thinking they can read the minds of their characters. They also committed the sin of referring to von Moltke's war plan as \\"Schlieffen's Plan.\\" The two have little in common, one being a single envelopment and the other a double envelopment. The fact that they both prescribed more or less the same paths is due to the fact that there are none other if one wants to move an army from Germany to France.This is a very wordy book - Where Slam Marshall's wonderful WWI text can provide all the pertinent information in a few pages, Guns of August requires several chapters, and leaves the reader confused as to what is happening when. The history takes a back seat to the reams of irrelevant gossip about each and every new character that appears on the stage.By far the best part of the book is at the end, but, unfortunately, that's a relativething. This is far and away the most irritating historical text I have ever attempted to wade thru. A good editor would have reduced its size by at least 75%, by my estimate. Marshall was an infinitely better writer, with succinct verbiage and deadpan humor and could turn a phrase in a manner that this book cannot.Far and away the best thing about the book is the fact that I bought the Kindle edition for just a few bucks. Was still more than it's worth,unfortunately"},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"At the time \\"The Guns Of August\\" was written the Second World War was still a fresh wound that had not yet healed. As a product of its time Tuchman's book carries a definite slant in favor of the Allies - although it must be remembered that the First World War was initiated by the Germans just as the Second World War was - the revisionism of trying to make these wars \\"blameless\\" has come and gone, and recent works have taken the guilt of Germany on directly (see \\"Burden Of Guilt\\" by Daniel Allen Butler).In the 1950s very few writers would have made the case for Germany being swept-up in the tide of events: the view was that Germany caused that tide, and to a certain extent this was true: the policy of \\"encirclement\\" enacted on the part of France and Britain was not clearly a prelude to conquest, but it was a policy of isolation that just about any nation would have found intolerable.Tuchman's prose and thoroughness are the attraction here: the prelude that explains the background to the conflict sweeps you along in such a way that the reader feels caught-up in the events. The message is simple: the War was almost inevitable given the politics of the time. But it was the lust for conquest that was a holdover from the 19th century that brought first Europe and then the world into a wholly 20th century struggle that no one was prepared for.The detailed narrative of the first month of the War (the \\"war of maneuver\\" that became the trench stalemate) is very much told from the perspective of the British Expeditionary Force, as most histories of the early stages of WWI in English are. The fault of British General French for his inability to deal with his allies and his inability to understand the scale of the German assault is not shied-from or whitewashed.Tuchman's book is an excellent introduction to the subject of the Great War. John Keegan's or Hew Strachan's historical overviews of the full conflict are a good follow-up. From there a wealth of works on specific battles (\\"The Price Of Glory\\" by Alistair Horne, \\"1914\\", \\"1915\\", and \\"The Somme\\" by Lyn Macdonald) will take the more interested reader into the day-to-day details of one of the most horrific wars in all of history, fought for the most nebulous of goals, and with the most shattering of outcomes."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"I see this is well reviewed (at least in other editions) and probably for the reason that this is a very well researched and peicing together of the events that brought about the first world war and an even more comprehensive exposition on how the first part of that war played out. That alone is a 5 star service to the understanding of history...as this not only explains it, but does it very well so we can see the events as they unfold in all three nations without being confused. I admit sometimes not being able to keep track of it all, (probably due to some lazier or rushing through it reading habits than on the part of the writer) but it was gripping all the same and sometimes a real page turner...not bad for a historical war expose'But this book does something which few if any books I've read does, and it shows the mindset of three nations and the people that run those nations: Germany, France, Great Britain, and to a lesser degree USA. One thing that became stikingly apparent is how the mindset of the Nation of Germany was really the same in WWI as it was in WWII (and apparently the same as the war of 1870...which I shall have to read about at some point) and one could just see how nothing had really changed from the war I'm more familiar with (WWII) and the causes of WWI....even to how the war progressed and to how they treated the people who they overran.The take away value of this book I think is to these \\"peace at any costs\\" people...these \\"I love everybody and there should never be any war\\" people. This book shows vividly that there are always going to be peoples and nations that have these incredibly agressive streaks permeating thier societies who cannot NOT be talked out of war when they are determined to have a war, as they will find any excuse if they think they are stronger or strongest to validate such a war even to the deliberate deception of their own and other peoples to justify their \\"cause\\".It shows the need for these beligerants to be accounted for in how diplomacy takes place and how defences are created even in times of peace and how one , as much as one hates war, must be prepared to fight one against the ever present agressor nations when they get too aggressive and turn to bullies. People want to stop bullies but wear pink to do this? all they do is bully those who refuse to wear pink. what nonsence.Though this is a frank unvarnished look about the first world war it is also a timeless peice that shows the way peoples tick and how one needs to prepare to match an ever present threat and is applicable in all times and places where aggressive people dwell. Yes peace is good and a blessed time, but when a country and it's people get compacent there will always be some people that will want to destroy them and take over. Peace loving nations and people should always have this in the back of their mind in how they live and create their societies to always be able, willing and ready to fight back, and not be unrealistic about expectations they place on other peoples and their mindsets. the old \\"can't we all just get along\\" wishfull thinking is blown out of the water with this book. well worth reading and considering."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"I doubt any writer has done better in capturing the almost bizarre alliances and events that threw the world into war in 1914 more brilliantly than Barbara Tuchman did in this lucid and very readable account. Her ability to focus on the decision makers and analyze their thinking brings into full relief the shared responsibility of both military and political leaders of both sides for the numerous miscalculations and blunders at the outset that led inevitably to the trenches and a long drawn out stalemate with it's well known horrifying consequences.It struck me while reading this that WWI provides the some of the best examples of the long reaching consequences military decisions can have. So much of the 20th century might have turned out differently but for the events described so well in Tuchman's book. The convulsive events that brought old Europe with it's incestuous aristocracy into the modern era were set in motion as described in these pages and the obvious coda a generation later was to finish what was begun here."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"I had lost my copy of this book in an airport on a recent trip.

Never has a book so infuriated my sense of justice then when reading about the deeds of the nobles and their chosen leaders who lead their countries into the Great War. An entire generation wiped out because of the delusions of a few men who believed in the nobility of war. This book should be a must read by any leader, be they President, Prime Minister or King, who believes in the need for war. I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to understand some of the defining moments that have shaped our world."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"How do you critique a book given almost universal acclaim, and the winner of a Pulitzer prize? The answer would have to be \\"Very carefully\\". I tend to prefer the shorter and more concise works, but found myself immersed in this very detailed and excellent analysis of the origins of World War I, aka The Great War. However, in spite of the slowness of reading, I thoroughly enjoyed it. Let me say, if you happen to be of German descent, which I am, you might NOT like this book. It is not complimentary to German leadership and priorities, or even to the tendency of the German people to be docile and obedient to their leadership. However, her analysis of the average German citizen's obedience is not presented as her opinion, but rather is presented as the reported opinion of the German leadership themselves. Still, I found it to be a reasonable and interesting assessment of the causes of the Great War, and not at all derogatory. As a historian, Tuchman provides details and analysis that goes beyond normal historical writings. She has done her research, and organized it very intelligently. The result, to me, is an analysis that showed the errors, foolishness and military gaffes of all sides. Many historical writings concern themselves with WHAT happened. Tuchman tells us why, and how it happened, and helps us understand the years following 1914 in ways that simple facts do not.Tuchman's style of writing is also to be commended. I found it interesting and entertaining. She is an excellent wordsmith, leading me to investigate other of her writings. As the result, I am now reading a book written 4 years before The Guns of August entitled The Zimmerman Telegram, concerning events that led the United States into the conflict in 1917.I highly recommend The Guns of August for anyone wanting to do more than just KNOW history, but also UNDERSTAND it."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"I have read many historical fiction books such as Colleen Mccullough's First Man in Rome series, the Alexander the Great Trilogy by Valerio Manfredi, Tides of War and Gates of Fire by Steven Pressfield. All these books and more have made me a fan of history. Like other history aficionados, I have also enjoyed watching television documentaries on various time periods in history shown on PBS, the A&E;, and History channels. Though, as many other casual history admirers, the one thing I was never motivated to do was to go to the non-fiction sections of a bookstore or a library and buy or check-out a book on history. This was due to the belief that a history book had to be dry and without energy or passion. A book that I happened to read all but showed me wrong regarding my previous views on history books. The reader of this article may ask, why I picked up a history book now after all these years. A good question indeed. The answer is that it was a suggested extended reading option from a Western Civilization course. I decided to take the risk and invest my own spare time to read this book. Well without further delay and added suspense let me move to the point of this article, and that is the Guns of August.The Guns of August, written by Barbara Tuchman, 1963 Pulitzer prize winning non-fiction book is a wonderful book describing the events of the first month of World War I. The Guns of August is a great example of how history should be done and depicts history with beautiful literature. Mrs. Tuchman captures the readers right off the bat in the first chapter with her description of King Edward's funeral. She creatively weaves in the background to the impending catastrophe of World War I by describing all of the royalty and dignitaries that are present at the funeral parade. The first paragraph in the first chapter is well written and representative of her literary skills.So gorgeous was the spectacle on the May morning of 1910 when nine kings rode in the funeral of Edward VII of England ..After them came five heirs apparent, fourty more imperial or royal highnesses, seven queens-four dowager and three regnant The muffled tongue of Big Ben tolled nine by the clock as the cortege left the palace, but on history's clock it was sunset, and the sun of the old world was setting in a dying blaze of splendor never to be seen again.Mrs. Tuchman does not imagine or use her creativity in figuring out what was on the minds of people, she instead tells the reader exactly what the historical figure said or if she does not know she tells the reader so. She conveys the private emotions and the thoughts experienced by the great minds during that tense first month of the war, quoting from sources such as memoirs and autobiographies. Her ability to inject quotations from sources while maintaining her fluid prose style is amazing. She uses her creativity and imagination in weaving the facts together in a story. Last but not least what adds to the reading experience is the author's cunning ability to show connectivity between historical people and events. One of the great scenes in the book is depicted when King Albert makes his speech declaring that Belgium will not surrender to Germany. Meanwhile looking on is his son, who later as King Leopold III surrenders to German forces in 1940. Although at times some of the descriptions of the troop movements could seem tedious reading, the author provides detailed maps and studying these maps for a few minutes gave me a good understanding of the military strategies.Based on my overall wonderful experience of reading the Guns of August, I would recommend it as a must read for all those casual history lovers who have always awed at the thought of picking up a history book. Although it is a book focusing on the first month of World War I, in my opinion it is a good book to be read in introductory Western Civilization courses to make the students aware of how creative writing history can be. This may at least inspire more students to read more history books, and then maybe a few of those would go on to become the next great Barbara Tuchman. For now, at least for a casual lover of history such as myself I will settle myself with the conclusion that reading a history book can be lots of fun."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"Barbara Tuchman has added a perspective that will prove invaluable through time. This is one of the best books I have ever read.Not only is it essential reading if one wants to understand World War I and the geopolitical and military situation that influenced the remainder of the 20th Century; but is also a book that gives extraordinary perspective and life to the individuals who guided and influenced Germany, France, Britain and America during this pivotal moment in History."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"While many of the other reviewers say they were unfamiliar with WW I prior to reading Barbara Tuchman's book, I can't say the same. I grew up in France in the fifties and sixties, bathed in memories from that war. I remember holding in my hands as a child a shell casing with a flower motif carved into it by my grandfather in the trenches. I also remember reading special issues of \\"L'Illustration\\" magazine from 1919 with photographs of the war and a crudely patriotic commentary. The events of August-September 1914 itself were dramatized on national radio on their fiftieth anniversary in the summer of 1964, by a daily show recounting them as if they were news. Names like von Kluck, von Bulow, Lanrezac, Joffre and Gallieni are therefore so familiar that reading about that subject was the furthest thought from my mind, until my curiosity was aroused by a comment attributed to JFK in the movie \\"13 Days\\" on similarities between the Cuban missile crisis and \\"The Guns of August.\\" The minute I picked up the book, I was fascinated by the new perspective and new insights it contains on those events. What Barbara Tuchman writes combines deep research with cautious inferences and a superb writing style.Another reviewer, Linda Linquvic, found the photographs of all the \\"elderly generals very similar.\\" That they were all in advanced middle age, however, is quite significant. They were not dashing young men, and this war coming late in their careers was their only chance to make their mark, which is clearly one reason they were so keen to fight it. On close examination, the photographs also reveal a contrast between the athletic, horseback-riding German generals and the overweight French generals dedicated to 3-hour lunches. The irony is that, in September 1914, it is the chubby Joffre who eventually outsmarted his fit German opponents steeped in Clausewitz; the tragedy, that millions would die in the ensuing four years."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"The answer can only be no...but all the same, I feel compelled to write a short review about this excellent piece of historical work. This is the second book written by Tuchman that I've read and is indeed a timeless masterpiece. I thought beforehand that I knew something about WWI, but all I knew after reading this book is how little I really knew.The narrative is fast, although one is doubtful of this in the beginning of the book-after all it deals with 30 days on 440 pages, but she keeps the narrative fast and flowing throughout.One of Tuchman's strong points is character description. The best example of this is in the descriptions of the often eccentric and always outspoken Kaiser, who ecchoed the sentiments of Germans and quite possible the true cause of the war when he said \\"All the long years of my reign, my colleagues, the Monarchs of Europe, have paid no attention to what I have to say. Soon, with my great Navy to endorse my words, they will be more respectful.\\" A vivid description of characters is essential in books on historical matters, and this is one of the places were Tuchman gets it right. The description of the Tannenberg battle stood out, with exciting, fast narrative and the ususal Tuchman trademark of descriptive characters that took part in that decisve battle (Tannenberg saw the signifcant introduction of Hindenburg and Ludendorff to commanding position in the war, although because of the short span of the book, we -sadly- can't see what effect this has on the western front later in the war).Thuchman's (self admitted) strenghts lie in the narrative of the story she's telling and her excellent writing skills (she has described herself as a writer first and historian second) and in this book she is at her best, flexing her literary muscles so well that the reader hardly can put the book down. How often can one say that after reading history?"},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"This book shows how leaders can easily and often make the wrong decisions (often costing many lives) simply because they refuse to believe the truth that is staring them in the face. Germany obviously wanted the war and was looking for any excuse to start it. This is an excellent read both for its history of the first month or WWI and for its look into the leadership of the various countries involved."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"I have finished reading the great First World War book, The Guns of August. Barbra Tauchman wrote this wonderfully constructed book over a period of time, which is seen throughout all her books, to which she dedicates accuracy and objectivity. This book is an intriduction to the events leading up to the Great War. She clearly lays out the objective of all sides and gives her typical through analysis. Her appreciation of the event is illustrated style of the book's flow. This is a very enjoyable book and I strongly recommend this book for anyone who would like to read a nice, quaint and easy-to-understand book of the events leading upto the Frist World war and the first months of the conflict."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"The Guns of August didn't earn a Pullitzer for nothing, it is a great literary account of the facts of the beginning of WW1, the way in which we're approached to the persons, the events, the consequences is simply superb. If you love history then you mustn't miss this book."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"Barbara Tuchman's account of the outbreak of the First World War is the definitive book on the subject. From the political crises and entangling alliances that characterized Europe in 1914 to the &quot;damn fool thing in the Balkans&quot; that set the war machines in motion, Tuchman provides insight and clarity to a complex situation.Tuchman goes beyond the superfluous details of the alliances and actions which brought the war about to bring about a deeper understanding of the prevailing attitudes in each country. She explains the German approach through the expansionist philosophy of Hegel and Nietzsche, along with the ideas of Clausewitz on how to fight a war and deal with conquered enemies. Also the political culture in France (where government was rapidly changing, especially with regards to mandatory military service), and the English policy of sending only volunteers abroad, and only when enough replacements could be brought back from remote outposts all over the world. These and many other meticulously resarched details provide a fascinating depth to the story.Also very interesting are the studies in character of the main players in the drama of August 1914. Joffre, French, von Kluck, and the German Kaiser (among many others) are studied in detail, in an effort to understand the decisions each made through the first month of the war. To her credit, Tuchman doesn't place thoughts in anyone's head; reasons for action are given in the individual's own words (as recorded in journals or official histories), or when the reason is not clear, Tuchman gives a number of possible answers puctuated by the fact that we can't be sure exactly what anyone was thinking.This is a brilliant book. Thorough from the battles on the western front to the well-intentioned if ill-conceived Russian offensive at Tannenberg, along with an interesting subplot with the German battle cruiser Goeben, the intricate detail, along with Tuchman's reader-friendly writing style, make for some great reading."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"My professor adores this book and had me read it to understand WWI. I think for someone who is just starting to understand this period, it is ABSOLUTELY not the first book you should read. There are just too many names and places covered rather quickly in this short novel. For the slower of the bunch (i.e. me), you might be able to get what, and how, but not the why and deeper intrigue that war time stories often have.However, if you are already an expert on the topic, I suspect you'll absolutely love this piece (as my professor does). I just need to cover the basics first."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"This book describes one of the most incredible examples where rigidity of thinking and planning led to events spiraling totally out of control. It also demonstrates how it is a very rare occasion that the consequences of a war are anywhere close to the belief of the people that started it. Although the events of 1914 were almost a century ago, this has been demonstrated once again by the American invasion of Iraq.When Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife were assassinated at Sarajevo on June 28, 1914 no one considered it be a major crisis. When the blustering started among the leadership of the European nations, the common belief was that it would all be resolved. However, as Tuchman describes in such excellent detail the rigid nature of the plans and the fear of being preempted led everyone to the same conclusion, \\"all out war as soon as possible.\\" Personal relationships no longer mattered, most of the members of the royal families were closely related, yet that only slowed the process slightly.When the juggernaut of war started to sprout, it was also fed by the frenzy of the masses, nearly all of whom cheered lustily for war. Few stopped to question what was happening and those that did were easily brushed aside. Or in the case of the French Socialist leader Jaures, assassinated. For the moment, militaristic and nationalistic fervor swept the continent and only the blood of millions of men was able to wash it away.This book should be read and reread by any person who aspires to national leadership of a nation. I have heard that American President Kennedy had read this book and that is one of the reasons why he stayed so controlled during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Once you read it, you will understand that what appear to be simple events can be escalated by a series of mistakes, all of which would in isolation be small. The rush for war can be a powerful one and as the American presence in Iraq demonstrates once again, a miscalculation regarding a war can be a very costly thing indeed."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"This is not a complete history of WWI, just through the end of the first six weeks. Well written, but Tuchman assumes that we all can read French (lots of French quotes throughout, with no translations), and that we all know what transpired in the remaining years of the Great War.Perhaps people were familiar with the Miracle of the Marne back in 1962, but today it's rather obscure, and I would like to have read more about it, rather than it being an epilogue to the book.Still, it's an interesting and very detailed account of the period covered, and good reading. I just wish it had been written a little less high-handedly, and didn't end so soon."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"Sadly, good books covering World War I are terribly hard to come by. You'd think that, by now, there would be scads of them, but the reality is that this book is truly a diamond in the rough. It is nothing short of amazing how Tuchman guides the reader through such an immense amount of detailed information about the war, and in such a relatively short volume. If it is true that we are doomed to repeat the past if we fail to understand it, then this is one book that everyone should read."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"This is a very interesting book. It is a piece of nonfiction, yet it captures the reader in an intense and suspenseful plot that makes the distinction between fiction and non-fiction impossible. The book concentrates on the first month of the war because after August the war became a stalemate which lasted for four long years. Tuchman's writing style completely involves you with the story; her views are very objective, as she writes from both sides' point of view.As opposed to a normal history book, Tuchman investigates the major people of the war to find a reason for the events that occurred during August of 1914. Because of this, the reader is left with a greater understanding of the topic. Furthermore, Tuchman's writing style is very detailed yet comprehensive. This means you'll actually understand what's being said, unlike what sometimes happens with a fact after fact textbook.The Guns of August can replace any textbook on the First World War. There are many citations from actual documents of that time, which raises the credibility of the events.After reading this book, it is startling to realize how much power men can achieve. One decision made by a tired man on a late night could cause hundreds or thousands to die. The motives of such men is what drives nations to war, and soldiers to death.All in all, this is a great piece of work. Tuchman has opened a new view on this influential event, a view that is seen through the eyes of those who made the event happen. The Guns of August makes for an enjoyable, factual, entertaining, suspensful, and surprising read."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"Tuchman's book is a classic for several reasons. If one does not know much about WW 1, her book is a terrific place to begin. For me, it answered two of the key mysteries of the war: why did the assassination of the Austrian heir apparent so quickly develop into a world-wide conflagration; and why were the Allies so angry at Germany that they imposed reparations that crippled it for years, ultimately leading to WW 2? Tuchman handles both issues wonderfully, in fact, devoting 2 chapters to each of those issues. In so doing, she brings the key characters of the drama to full life, most interesting of them being stubborn Sir John French, leader of the British Expeditionary Forces; French General Joffre with his numerous insecurities; brave King Albert of Belgium; and indepedent French General Lanrezac. Once again, Tuchman reminds us all too well that history is made up of personalities. There are times in which mediocre people rise to unusual challenges and become heroes. There are far too many other times in which people of stature and position sink miserably into mediocrity. World War One was one such occasion."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"The perfect book. It reads like a novel, but as they say &quot;truth is stranger than fiction.&quot; Ms. Tuchman has written THE historical masterpiece on the beginnings of what has to be the most confusing conflict in history. World War I will shake the ruling classes foundations to the ground. Monarchies will no longer reign supreme in its aftermath, communism gains a foothold it will not relinquish for 80 years, England bleeds herself white, France never is a world power of magnitude again, but why?.... This book explains how the worlds most powerful industrial societies allowed everthing they held dear to be destroyed. This book doesn't take sides, it explains why the sides began the war juggernaut a rolling. In detail, with passion, and in a moving manner. This war more than any other can be directly attributed to arms proliferation and a diplomatic status quo. The diplomats from all sides fumble and it kills millions. The generals use 19th century assault tactics in the face of 20th century firepower. In five weeks time, which the author has descibed perfectly, step-by-step, the western world begins and cannot stop the &quot;War to End All Wars&quot; Ms. Tuchman may no longer be with us but this book will make her immortal."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"This is a very entertaining and readable book about the first month of WWI. The scope is basically the assassination of the Archduke in Sarajevo to the eve of the Marne (and includes the Battle of Tannenburg on the eastern front). Because most of the action occurs in the western front at this stage of the war, the book concentrates there. It develops the Schlieffen Plan and the French war plans (Plan 17) and explains how the high commands of both countries attempt to carry out these plans irrespective of what the other side is doing.Tuchman does not assign blame. She tries her best to give all sides of a disagreement in policy or action. This even-handed account is most welcome. The best example of this approach is her treatment of Lanrezac, commander of the French 5th army from the start of the war to a few days before the Marne - she points out that he was the man most essential to preventing the Germans from turning the French flank in the early battles, but then agrees with his dismissal at the eve of the Marne: &quot;He was not the man to lead the offensive.&quot;The only person she completely villifies is Sir John French, leader of the BEF. Although I get the impression that she would have forgiven his follies if only he hadn't written a book after the war full of inconsistencies and, to use Tuchman's word, &quot;lies.&quot;Most importantly, the book is very well-written, enjoyable and clear to read, and even witty. Unfortunately, there are some spots with vague allusions to historical events and people without explanantion. While a practising historian probably finds this humourous or helpful, it is murky for an amateur. This is a minor point, though, and on the whole, this book is stellar. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"A bit curious that I enjoyed Tuchman's &quot;The First Salute&quot; more than this book, as Salute is generally considered her weakest, and August her strongest. I felt a bit disarmed because I do not have a good understanding of the previous war (1870). Also, the book ended a bit abruptly rather than continue into the beginning of the French reversal and trench warfare that would ensue. A good read, but I needed more to put a cap on it. I feel like I only got half the story.Tuchman has a way of digging into a person, and getting to the nut of their situation, their crisis, and how they chose to resolve it. What I enjoy most is that she often leaves the &quot;why&quot; question to the reader, which is appropriate because no one save the characters themselves really knows the why. Still, she neatly frames the entire issue, and then tosses the why in front of you, giving you pause that continues even after you have finished the book. A nice habit of hers. She also seems to have a keen insight into the issues that plague a commander in the field (also in Salute), the intangible factors that most authors and readers ignore. The meddle that some of the Generals she wrote about showed is impressive, and Tuchman has a talent for presenting that in a very human way; refreshing in the glare of &quot;Action&quot; films and books where officers are shown as uncaring army drivers.I recommend the book, but suggest a review of 19th century European history first. Even an hour's worth of review will prove very useful prior to reading this pup. It's a shame Barb didn't do it herself (as she did in Salute) and include it as a foreward.&quot;A Distant Mirror&quot; covers an entire century. That should be enough to keep me happy. I'll think I'll read that one next."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"This book has been sitting on my shelf for a very long time. I'd heard and read about what a great work of history this was even 40 years after its first publication, but I just never found the time to sit down and read it. Now that I have read it I can say with confidence that it does meet the heap of praise that is plastered across it's covers (front and back) and in its first pages. Mrs. Tuchman writes so beautifully in the first 100-200 pages as well as in the afterword that it turns what could have been a rather boring start about battle plans and diplomatic tensions into high drama and studies in human fallibility. Her quick biographical paragraphs on key political and military figures adds a touch of gray to these seemingly black-and-white personalities. In fact, \\"The Guns of August\\" has two things which are, sometimes, conspicuously missing in current histories: 1) an elegant writing style that would make Shakespeare proud, and 2) a true sense of objectivity. Mrs. Tuchman almost never adds her own opinion to why people made the decisions they made, employing the rarely used \\"he could of done it for this reason... or this reason... or even this reason.\\" However, her elegant style does desert her in many of the battles she writes about as her, admittedly, weak grasp of military strategy turns her prose into a \\"just the facts, ma'am\\" style. Also, it would have been nice if she could have written about the struggles of the average \\"men in the trenches.\\" But by the time she reaches the big battles that make up the bulk of this work, foolhardy plans that Mrs. Tuchman had written about early in the book have been set in motion, adding that inertia of tragedy that makes her work a true classic. Every fan of modern history should pick this up and fall in love with it, not to mention every politician and military leader in Washington who claims to love the troops."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"Written in 1962, this is a fascinating history of the beginnings of WW1 and is the result of a vast amount of research. It's all true, and all documented, and even though it's a dense read, the huge cast of characters springs to life. This is the story of a war that changed the course of history. And it's also a story of the men who make the war. The reader gets to see the blunders and the madness and the personal feuds. And the humanity of the imperfect human beings who make the decisions that result in slaughter.There are maps in the book describing the battles. There are also photographs. But I must admit that I barely looked at the maps. And I found all the photos of the elderly generals very similar. What I did love though was the sweep of the story as well as the many details that go into waging a war. Previously, most war books I've read had to do with the experience of the soldiers. But this book is about the experience of making decisions, often based on folly. And it opened my eyes to how vulnerable the ordinary person is to the whims of the generals and the forces of pure chance. Ms. Tuchman also had a sense of irony and humor and sometimes I found myself laughing out loud.The narrative of the month of August 1914 is described hour by hour. Belgium has to make a decision to accept an awful defeat or willingly allow the Germans to march through their neutral territory. There are alliances in place that are just waiting to be broken. The Russians come into the war. So do the British, even though it is with much reluctance. The basic war is between France and Germany, almost a continuation of the defeat the French suffered at the hands of the Germans during the Franco-Prussian War in 1870.Before I read this book, I didn't know much about WW1. Now I do. It was a war that defined the breakdown of the European nobility and set the stage for the next war, which was even more horrific. It taught me a lot, especially about how many people wind up dying because of the quest for power. It saddened me too because this quest for power is basic. So is the folly of mankind. The only thing that has changed is technology.This book is a masterful work. It lays the groundwork for an understanding of the mechanics of war. I might not remember all of the names of the generals or the battle plans. But I will always remember the feeling of being right there, watching the decisions being made, marching for miles in spite of fatigue, handling the big guns, making courageous decisions that sometimes led to disaster. And, especially, knowing that this is the true face of war. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"What Barbara Tuchman has done here is something precious few historians are able to do. With her stunning prose and fathomless knowledge, she brings to life that first fateful month of World War One. The historical figures she describes seem more like a collection of characters from an action novel. More than once I found myself saying &quot;Did they really do that?&quot; Ordinarily I can only read about 75 pages at a time before I start to lose interest and need a break. This book I began one morning and didn't put it down until I finished it. Tuchman kept my interest throughout and at times, though I knew the outcome, I found myself sitting at the edge of my chair wondering what would happen next. Even some of the best novels do not have this kind of power.As for the book itself, it covers only the first month of the war. Though it does go into some depth of the war's origins, the main focus is on the movement and action of the armies from mobilization day until stalemate is reached. Tuchman's research is exhaustive, and this is the definitive work on that period. When the book was finished, I was disappointed only because she didn't continue. I wish I could give this more than five stars. If you have any interest in history whatsoever, regardless of your field, you must read this book, because this is what history should be!"},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"Although we think of the First World War in terms of the stalemate and carnage of the trenches, for the first few weeks of combat, it was a war of movement. The battlelines shifted daily and the British and French came closer to disaster than I realized before I read this book. It's a gripping story, which Tuchman tells superbly. The political and military leaders come alive, the maps are clear, and even though you know how the story ends, you can't put the book down. Tuchman is also a reliable: I didn't find any factual errors. My complaints are minor. I agree with the previous writer who thought that the book ended too early: the war of movement in the west really ended with the French counterattack on the Marne, which is not discussed in the same detail as the campaign that led to it. Also, while Tuchman, presumably legitimately, dismisses the story of the angels of Mons as a legend, she should have told us what the legend was. Overall, however, I thought that the book was great, and I strongly recommend it even to those readers who think they know the story after reading such popular histories of the First World War as those by John Keegan or Martin Gilbert. You'll be surprised how you learn."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"Barbara Tuchman (1912-89) captured the 1962 Pulitzer Prize with this gripping look at the opening stages of World War I. Tuchman begins by examining the pre-war politics, military plans, and inept diplomacy of major European nations. Once hostilities begin, she focuses heavily on Germany's attack through Belgium and Northern France - an offensive that just missed defeating France outright in 1914 and altering the course of history. The author exposes military stupidity, German atrocities in Belgium, and shows how this conflict opened as a murderous war of movement rather than as the entrenched stalemate that followed. I'd have liked fuller coverage on competing theaters of war, and wish that Tuchman hadn't stopped at the Battle of the Marne. Still, this is compelling history. Most importantly, the author shows how new technology and bungling politicians that failed to control their eager militarists plunged Europe into needless disaster. No wonder President Kennedy referred to this book during the Cuban missile crisis.Tuchman was one of a few readable non-historians (William L. Shirer, John Toland) who outdid the stuffy academics. I particularly liked her coverage on Belgium's dilemma: either let the Germans march through, or fight them against overwhelming odds - you have 12 hours to decide. \\"The Guns of August\\" is gripping, tragic history at its finest."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"First, I really enjoyed this book. I believe Tuchman did a masterful job of giving life to the people and events that led to WWI. This book is well worth reading, but only for what it is: half-history, half-literature.This is not the place to start if you want to understand what led to WWI. The author does have a distinct anti-German bias that glosses over most of the complexities that influenced Germany's actions. Given when the book was written, this bias is understandable, but it does affect its historical value. Moreover, Serbia and the Hapsburgs are essentially footnotes in this book when in reality, they are essential for understanding the causes of the war. When you ignore Serbia and Austro-Hungary, well, all you're left with is Germany acting like a belligerent punk under the hand of the man-child Wilhelm II.Also, Tuchman definitely prefers some individuals over others. For example, she gives Sir French pretty short-shrift in comparison to Lord Kitchener when in reality, there was more than enough incompetence to go around (not that I would have done any better than they).I do whole-heartedly recommend this book, but only as a halfway step from history to fiction, perhaps sandwiched between A World Undone and All Quiet on the Western Front."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"Europe in the late summer of 1914 was more than a powderkeg poised to go off; it was prewired and preset demolition awaiting the excuse of a match. According to Barbara Tuchman in this insightful and descriptive period piece of history, each of the potentates involved in the coming world war had a battle plan, a series of objectives, and a relatively good sense of what the other powers would do in the conduct of hostilities. Yet each disregarded the potential contingencies that might arise from the efforts of opposing forces, and descended pell-mell in the unbelievable madness of total war based on a combination of factors ranging from arrogance, overestimation of capability, personal animosities, ambition, lack of imagination of what could happen as a result, and of course, sheer ignorance.Tuchman's magic in employing the written word to advantage shines here, as her narrative weaves together the elements of a world in transition, empires ruled by Kings, Queens and Kaisers living in the past, out of touch with what advances in technology and tactics meant, and not recognizing that these revolutionary changes in technology, demography, and battle techniques would plunge the world into a nightmare conflict that none of them could foresee, contain, or manage, once it started.In many ways the first world war marks the true demarcation point between the old European world of tradition, chivalry, and empires, on the one hand, and the frightening new world of tanks, machine guns and mass exterminations. Prepared and propelled by visions of glorious conquest in a battlefield characterized by Kipling and &quot;the charge of the light brigade&quot;, what they got in its place was the horrifying nightmare war of extermination in trench warfare, infantry slaughtered anonymously by artillary, tanks and rapid fire weapons the troops had no effective tactics to protect against. So much for the old glory.Yet all that lay ahead, in the weeks, months and years of bloody battle, of the excruciatingly costly struggle for new territory turned into a useless bloodbath for mere feet and yards. Here we are dipped deep into the boiling cauldron of people steeped in the mystique of the past, trying to win glory and fortune through warfare, and never understanding that the very attempt itself would result in the ruin of everything they knew and treasured, for the nature of the protracted conflict did indeed change everything, and Tuchman winds her way through the book with dazzling description and highly readable prose.This is a wonderful and memorable book, typical of Tuchman's engaging and often humourous writing style, detailing as it does the ways in which old and outdated perspectives try ruinously to force themselves and their designs into an abrasive future, at the expense of everything traditional, local, and familiar. It is a valuable snapshot of a moment suspended in time, lovingly restored, taken of a world in violent transition at that very moment as we first stepped off the threshold of the past into the bloody abyss of the 20th century."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"Focusing on the period immediately prior to the beginning of World War I, Ms. Tuchman has written an engrossing account of the events and characters which combined to propel the world into a bloody, disasterous, and wasteful conflict. The people who participated in these events -- from Kaiser Wilhelm and his adviser the odious Holstein, to Winston Churchill, Woodrow Wilson, and many less well-known individuals -- reveal themselves in excerpts from personal diaries as well as in published reports and state papers. The events themselves, leading as they did to the most horrible and all-encompassing war the world had known up to that point, are related in such a way as to make the reader keep turning the pages to find out what happens next. But one of the most interesting results of reading about this time period, is noticing how incidents which occurred in the early part of the 20th century resonate even now in news reports from Eastern Europe (Bosnia, Serbia, Greece and Turkey) and North Africa (Algeria, Egypt, and Ethiopia). At the time I read this book, I knew very little about World War I, and the book prompted me to go on and read more about that era. Ms. Tuchman's carefully researched book is a classic, and belongs on every discerning reader's bookshelf."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"I just finished Tuchman's &quot;Guns of August&quot; and I won't bore you with another in-depth analysis (you can read other reviews for that) but will make a personal, emotional pitch: I was so caught up in her storytelling that I had a hard time separating myself from the book. I read pages beyond the point of exhaustion, read on the train to and from work, read walking home from the station, read in bed, in the kitchen, in the bathroom, on the sofa, during meals, on my lunchbbreak... I think you get the picture. It's become sort of humorous, my attempting to engage my friends in excited, animated discussion about World War I - and they look at me funny when I do so - but what can I do? This book is terrific.History telling as Tuchman does it rivals any great suspense novel I've ever read for sheer engagement. You want to get hooked? Buy this book."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"Barbara Tuchman's account of the 30 days of August 1914 can be viewed as a prism of events before and after this pivotal month at the start of the WW1. There are many views as to whether this War was an inevitable manifestation of tottering monarchies, deadly new technology, colonial rivalry and and the still very prevalent romance and chivalry associated with War. WW1 forever debased that latter notion, but sadly did not put an end to war. Although this can be read as a stand alone piece it is better put in the perspective of it's precedent, the war itself and its aftermath. John Keegan's new study 'World War One' is highly recommended, and perhaps Clausewitz's classic study of causes and tactics 'On War'. Tuchman does not present an ideological or chauvinistic perspective. Her strength is in her objective narrative rendering, and her character insights, including the llumination of some lesser known figures who played a key roll in events. Excellent, readable history with the drama and immediacy of a novel. You'll have trouble putting it down."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"A detailed account of WWI. The analysis of the origins and opening days of the Great War are interesting and well written. Deserving of its status as a classic."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"Tuchman is \\"a writer of wit and grace\\" according to the New York Times. \\"She has a sardonic sense of humor and an original mind.\\" I found her book about how WWI evolved, both compelling and repulsive. I gulped it in, as though inhaling halting breaths, engrossed in the horrific sadness of it all, putting the book down with a heavy and ponderous sigh, then picking it up again, needing to learn more. Tuchman's writing flows gracefully and she knows just how much detail to bring into this sweeping tale of a \\"tragedy of errors\\". Newsweek said it best, I think: \\"Tuchman is able to evoke both the enormous pattern of the tragedy and the minutiae which make it human\\" in what must surely be one of history's saddest moments."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"The Guns of August is an amazing read. I won't get into the overview of the book as others have done a great job of this. I just want to add that this is the book for those who might be curious about history--about how history is created by those who make the decisions of war and peace-- but have shied away from historic tomes from a dread of boredom or intimidation.This book is the cure. It reads as quickly as the best thriller only it's richer and, it's real. Ms Tuchman's prose is witty, amazingly detailed yet the words simply fly to create the tension, the events and characters of August 1914 and the events that lead up to the war. Her characterizations are genius. In fact, I have other WWI books I'm trying to get into because GOA whets your appetite to learn more about post-August of this unique war. But the writing is somewhat dreary after the brilliance of GOA.There are countless memorable actors but the most poignant for me, was the Russian General Samsonov, a kindly, decent general who tried his utmost yet was done in by the inadequacies of the Russian war machinery; unlike many leaders who would try to lay blame elsewhere he joined his soldiers in the hopeless fighting, ultimately killing himself when all was lost. And his story is just a small chapter.Read it, you will not regret."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"This book is a very in depth book on the lead up to and first month of the first world war, well researched so well you can almost imagine being there. If it wasn't so serious it would be amusing when you read about the incompetence, ego's, petty squabbling, dated tatics, failure to see the obvious the list goes on."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"Barbara Tuchman was a great writer. Getting that point across, clearing the obvious out of the way is important because this book, while beautiful in language, is, ultimately, a rather dry chart exploring the nuances of a number of early battles of World War I. With an arsenal of sourced statements and the playground of actually experienced history, Ms. Tuchman has managed to construct a dire renunciation of politicians, generals and other assorted leaders at their most blindly self-indulgent. This is a book about proud people suffering failure and not coping very well with it.No doubt other reviewers have said (likely since its first publication in 1962) that these same things apply to the present day. To me all that says is that politics are inspired by selfishness and greed and that war is an imprecise, inexact and usually unexpected, bloody business, and that is goes on throughout all of human history. The lessons we might learn--were one of a mind to seek them--really have more to do with the limits and the exploitation of modern technology and how fanaticism, the inability to reconcile perceived insults and the general mass disagreeing, frightened citizens can cause confusion, indecision and too great a reliance on a mythologized vision of righteous war. This book, a wonderful, informative, entertaining look at the dawn of a now increasingly forgotten 'modern age', does more to dispell the myth of honor among soldiers and the never-was belief that there are actual rules to war than any two minutes clip filmed from a battle zone after the fighting is finished on whichever-leaning biased newscast your might personally align with. This is an objective, all-encompassing critique of every side (at least publically involved) of an issue and an attack on the equal and opposite returns of hypocrisy.A masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"What else can one say about this book; it is every bit the classic that it is billed to be. The subject matter is every bit as relevant today as it was when it was first published. I couldn't help but draw parallels between the events leading up to WWI and the events surrounding the current crises in the Middle East. Read within the context of today's environment, the book has many insights to offer.I hope that the world has learned some of the lessons that were so difficult to learn during the early stages of WWI, such as preparing an entire nation(s) for war, not just the military, entering a conflict with clear strategic objectives that are shared by allies, and adapting strategies and technologies to gel with the conflict at hand.This book is for every student of American/European/Military history."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"Barbara Tuchman details the first month of the Great War (WW1) with a detailed eye to the huge movement of men in what was to become &quot;the war to end all wars&quot;. Never before had such huge armies clashed in the field, the German buildup and advance through Belgium and on to France was a huge undertaking. The general concept of the First World War is the static line which developed early on in the war, but at this early stage it was a very mobile and tactical war, and the chances of Germany overrunning all of Europe were very high indeed. Tuchman explores the viewpoints of the leaders on both sides, political and military, as well as showing the cost of war, especially by neutral Belgium. As always with Tuchman, it is a readable and very well researched book."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"The Guns of August wonderfully illistrates the first 30 days of WWI. Barbra Tuchman lays down the early foundation leading up to the entaingling alliances, and the personalities of WWI. I would recomend this book to any history enthusiest."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"This book should be required reading for anyone studying the First World War and the evolution of governments and world politics in the 20th century. It is a thorough account of the events and alliances that led to the war, the wrong impression the German government had of the probable British reaction, the split in the British government over the question of British involvement, and events leading other countries into the war. It was a case of miscalculations, bad judgement, and blunders that led nations into a war that forever changed the world. What the German government thought would be a short war turned into the long war that destroyed monarchies and empires, left the Kaiser in exile, and the Czar murdered along with his family. Ludendorff's copying Stonewall Jackson's tactics in shifting an army to defeat the Russians at Tannenberg, Von Kluck's exposure of his flank and the French and British failure to fully capitalize on the error, and the British failure to prevent the German battle cruiser Goeben and the light cruiser Breslau from entering the Dardanelles, are all discussed in detail. This book is well researched and well written. It is rare to find a book on history that holds your interest and attention as this book does."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"This is a book full of detail, but never ever boring. My only recommendation besides &quot;read it now&quot; would be that the reader already have some minimal background about the start of WWI or military philosophy/strategy. Otherwise, it can get overwhelming trying to figure out who some of these people (e.g., Clausewitz) are. Nevertheless, an excellent read!"},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"Although it sometimes seemed a bit of a chore when I was reading it, I look back on it as an excellent book! It really portrayed the dependence of the outcome of the war on that series of battles leading up to the first Marne.

Its a few hundred pages of mainly dreary inconsequential facts with an occasional page or two of something you actually want to know."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"I didn't even bother to finish this book because, although i tried to read it and fell asleep on pretty much every other page, the writing was convoluted and stuffy, the \\"action\\" (was there any?) was slow, and I just couldn't bring myself to care about anything this author had to say. A unanimous vote by the AP Euro class I was forced to \\"read\\" this for took the book off the reading list for next year's class...although we would have loved to make the following classes suffer the same way we did, we simply could not bring ourselves to stuff this ridiculous book down any other poor students' throats.Mr. M......You were a cool teacher, but I don't know if I can ever forgive you for letting this haunt my entire summer."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"While it's been a while since I read this, I clearly remember that it was superb. Tuchman's ability to bring history to life is unsurpassed.I'd strongly recommend this book to anyone with the least interest in the subject of WWI. While just using the war's first full month, BT gives us a clear view of that world and its people who became involved in the incredible machine of death that was The Great War.I would also suggest Keegan's \\"The First World War\\" for a fuller description of the war in its entirety."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"I picked this book up after having read it decades before. The writing and analysis remains as crisp as when I first read it. I believe the strengths of the book are in the great amount of details provided about the military blunders that occured on both sides during the first month of WWI. Its really an always-topical cautionary tale of how egos, a reluctance to engage in diplomacy, all coupled with the fog of war, can play havoc with the best of plans. The weakness of the book is in getting a better sense of the German perspective other than with Tuchaman's occassion expressions on the essence of the German people. Tuchman does give equal play to the German strategy but she falls into far too much stereotype about the German \\"character\\". While she doesn't dwell on it, she seems all too comfortable in explaning German acts as part of the German belief that efficiency trumps humanity, as an example."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"Tuchman's knowledge of the subject (origins and beginning of WWI) truly is impressive. Her skillful research and writing abilities are prevelant from the beginning of the book, and it is of no surprise that this book is a Pulitzer Prize winning book. I read this book simply because I wished to know more about The Great War. This book, although it mainly deals with the first month of WWI (August, 1914) is priceless in that it sets the stage (the key to understanding WWI) for the war that revolutionized modern warfare. If you enjoy military history you'll love this book."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"The Guns of August covers the first six weeks of World War I by telling the story of the leaders and generals of Germany, France and Great Britain. The book catches the human side of the beginning of the war through vivid and powerful writing. Emotion and power flow from the pages as we follow the German march into France and the French and British halting of their advance. It is not a mere recitation of facts about the war but it weaves facts into a narrative that grips you, it makes you ask, &quot;what will happen next&quot;, even if you know what happened next."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"I picked out &quot;The Guns of August&quot; because I felt I needed to learn more about our first world war. As soon as I picked it up to start I never stopped reading until the last page. Barbara W. Tuchman made a non-fiction book feel like a thrilling novel. I never thought I would really enjoy a non-fiction read until I found &quot;The Guns of August. I can't wait to read another of her riveting books."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"The first month of WW I is vividly recreated here, and explains why the great nations put themselves in a mortal stalemate that was to last four years. This book is profoundly serious and informative, and gives the reader a clear picture of what happened in those dread times. It describes the armies of all nations at war, their preparation, their morale (or lack of) and the stupid proud of the leaders. INcridible."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"Like she always did Barbara Tuchman again succeeds in bringing history alive. Combined with craftmanship that's all a reader really wants"},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"This book deserves its lofty reputation. Contrary to my expectation when I picked it up, although true to its title, The Guns of August is not a history of World War I, but of only its opening month, preceded by a background summary. This is an unusual approach to the Great War, although the author herself alluded to it as stemming from her fascination with the \\"aura\\" of that one month in which so many illusions were dispelled and in which everyone could feel the old order of Europe coming to an abrupt end. The book opens with an account of the famous 1910 funeral of England's King Edward VII, at which virtually all of Europe's royalty was present and looking very much like the big inbred family it was: not exactly a happy family, but one no reasonable observer could have imagined to be on the verge of a self-inflicted bloodbath. Mrs. Tuckman treats us to a novelistic account of the pageantry, but then immediately takes us behind the scene to the jealousies, fears, and ambitions that lurked on that day. We read about the German Kaiser, bristling with Teutonic chauvinism and at the same time poignantly aware of being snubbed by his royal peers, whose gossipy letters and diary entries made clear the low regard in which they held him and his nation. In a few short pages the author thus sketches out beautifully the psychological roots of the coming war. Still in background mode, she moves onto the pundits of the day who believed that rising prosperity and economic interdependence spelled an end to European war. She contrasts this with steely insight of the military planners in all countries, who seemed not only to consider war inevitable but to know exactly how it would unfold once the fighting got underway. The fatal error the all had in common, however, was the universal belief that the war would be short, won by whomever seized the initiative in the beginning. This \\"cult of the offensive\\" gave rise the treacherous hair-trigger environment whereby even a minor and accidental aggression would inevitably escalate as the players leap to deny their enemies the all-important early initiative. The \\"damned fool thing\\", as it was described in anticipation by Kaiser Wilhelm, turned out to be the assassination of the Austrian Archduke by Serbian nationalists in June of 1914. Mrs. Tuckman doesn't dwell on this at all, and she gives no more than a clipped summary of the resulting skirmish between Austria and Serbia that set the whole clockwork mechanism into motion as alliance commitments were triggered: Russia leaping to Serbia's defense, drawing in Germany, and then France, and then England, all in turn. She brushes past all this in her hurry to get to what really interests her, which is the titanic early struggle between France and Germany. Once this is underway, she writes like a trained military historian - which she in fact was not - and describes the flow of warfare in commanding detail. Interwoven in all this are telling portraits of key military and political figures among the major combatants. She neither lionizes or demonizes anyone on either side, portraying all of them as limited human beings struggling with circumstances which dwarfed their abilities. The closest thing to a hero in this account is King Albert of little Belgium, whose principled and unexpected defiance of the German juggernaut in the opening days slowed it down just enough to make what was in the end probably the critical difference. The author also has a soft spot for General Gallieni, military governor of Paris, who seemingly alone within the panicked French military, recognized that the overextended and over-confident Germans were vulnerable. Rallying subordinates, peers and superiors alike to counterattack at the critical moment, he is portrayed as launching the maneuvers that drove the Germans back from what they assumed was to be the fast and tidy victory foreseen by their planners. This would have been a much neater and more satisfying story, of course, had it happily ended at this point, gallant Frenchmen glowing in triumph over the surprised and beaten Huns. Unfortunately, as we know, all these heroics accomplished was to set the stage for the years of monstrous carnage that were to follow. Mrs. Tuckman does in fact bring her account to an end here, saying later that describing the intricacies of the entire war were beyond her abilities as a historian. More likely, she was simply bored by the prospect of recounting the interminable and grim stalemate that unfolded in the trenches of France. Considering herself a writer first and a historian second, she was able to shrug off the disciplines that bind academic historians, and she wrote about what captured her imagination. This selective focus is the book's main limitation, but it's also the quality that makes it more coherent and readable that more comprehensive histories of the War. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"The book is a good account from the military and -in a lesser extent- political point of view. But, what about the society? It is missing. No mention to the people and their attitude towards the war. In some extent, I find the book very \\"traditional\\" (kings, generals, battles...), but nothing else except prominent individuals. That is why I consider it a partial overview of the war."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"This is the single best book about the Great War that I have ever read. No other author has ever managed to clarify the causes of World War 1 to me so wonderfully, and no other book has explained how and why the Western Front became so deadlocked and so terrible so fast. The book is exceptionally well written, and should be part of any reader's curriculum of study for understanding the Great War."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"I read this book here in Brazil.I'm an agronomist and I live in Ceara, a Brazil's state.This book is excellent, about this subject.And I must tell you, this book isn't a book only about military history, even having many battles described on.This book also doesn't describes all World War I, but before the war and his begining.The World War I had many bitter results.One of them was the seeding of World War II.The Soviet Union and marxism as a political and genocidal force, began because of World War I.The european colonial empires became all weak.The fall of Othoman empire rooted both the creation of Israel, as the creation of Iraq.Having so many results and tens of million of deaths, World War I must be explained at first why it was made.There's many theories, about the causes of that war.Two absurds theories were preached, and some stupid believes on them.One is the marxist theory and the other is the malthusianist/eugenics theory.Lenin claimed that World War I was did, because capitalist's wills.The rich went to his political leaders, looking for a war and then to the World's markets money and dominance.The malthusianist/eugenicist theory claims that too many fertility rate, put Germany and the World into a terrible war.This theory is preached on book \\"The Woman and the New Race\\" published in 1920, less then two years after the end of World War I.Both theories are a fraud.There's nothing showing any capitalits's will, to a terrible war.In fact between 1893 and 1913 there was the biggest economic, social, educational,scientific, etc. growing in World's history, the mankind ever saw.Any big industry such as steel, car, ship,etc. hadn't nothing to win whith such war.And the War wasn't begined by capitalist and democratic countries, but for neurothic kings and absurds believes.If the war between Austria and Servia stay as a limited war, no World War couldn't ever began.The Kaiser's decision to invade Belgium,Russia and France was the really beginning of the World War I.When Belgium was invaded, England declared war against Germany.And the Kaiser wasn't following for rich's interests, but from your own feeble mind and prejudices.In fact Andrew Carnegie, gave a check to the Kaiser of Germany.The Kaiser could have all the Carnegie's fortune, if the Kaiser decided, not make that war.The Kaiser refused all the money, a very big fortune.The other theory, the malthusianist/eugenicist theory is also a fraud.The Germany in 1913 and 1914, had one of the smallest fertility rates in the world and Germany wasn't at any unemployed rate up to 3%.Economic growing, in Germany, between 1873 and 1913 was far bigger than any other time ever seen before.In fact, in 1960 decade, when Germany was at the so called \\"german miracle\\" , the majority of old age people in that country, claimed that before 1914, there was the best part of his lifes and country.In this book you can see, the real cause of that war and in fact, of all wars the mankind ever saw.At first there wasn't democracy or free instituitions in places such as Germany, Serbia or Russia.At second, Germany was under the leadership of a neurothic figure, the Kaiser.He wasn't mad or anti-semithic as Hitler, but even so, the Kaiser was a despicable.And his army was bigoted and full of then modern weapons.A despicable and powefull leader + a big and modern army = a terrible war.This book has utility today, when this time is just history?Yes, because human mentality is ever the same in all times, situations, tecnologies, religions and weapons.If you don't believe, you can see Islam and his tirants in places such as Iran.All looking for war.A war who won't give them no money, no power, no advantages, no territory.Nothing except destrution, death and defeat.Even so, they are looking for war, because absurds believes and neurothic/lunatic leaders gave them his destiny.The Kaiser can became Hitler, Stalin, Saddam Hussein.The German Kulthur can became nazism or socialism and them Islam.Germany can became Soviet Union and them Iran.With the advance of time, the names changes, but the absurds and results are, ever the same."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"&quot;Early in his administration, President Kennedy asked his cabinet officials and members of the National Security Council to read Barbara Tuchman's book, &quot;The Guns of August&quot;.

Mrs. Tuchman used fine detail in describing the positioning of the leaders and units of the start of \\"the war to end all wars.\\" Humans will never be able to live in harmony with themselves or their environment because they persist in holding fast to an anthropocentric perception of themselves."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"This is a tremendous accomplishment, a story of how separate decisions emerged into tragedy, and of the continuing ability of our Paleolithic minds to blind us to reason."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"The late Mrs. Tuchman, who passed on in 1989, was one of the most &quot;popular&quot;--the in the best sense of the word--historians of the 20th Century. She and The Durants shared the honor of enliving histriography's prose--often far deader than its dramatic personae--with not only writing of genius, but a moral center, a sense of right and wrong and possessing the courage to say so. Few novelist's rival Mrs. Tuchman's ability to plunge the reader into dramatic situations; indeed, some of the most dramatic events in mankind's history in the month of August 1914.Anyone who accuses Mrs. Tuchman of anti-German bias has an allergic reaction to the truth.While &quot;guilt&quot; is an amorphous term of little meaning, there can be little doubt--as Sir John Keegan puts it--that Germany started the war. It was &lt;i&gt;Germany&lt;/i&gt; that turned a bilateral war between Austria-Hungary and Russia into the conflagration that destroyed Western civilization and gave impetus and fertilized with blood such noxious weeds as Bolshevism and Nazism allowing to flourish and prepare for a second, conclusive round of the war the Kaiser's foolish arrogance created.Mrs. Tuchman largely avoids the larger issues of the war and focuses on her main subject: the Western Front's first climactic month--August 1914. This month has proved more pivotal in the history of the human race, the reality that you and I live in no matter where you live on the planet. By contrast, the Napoleonic Wars were little more than a reshuffling of human pawns upon a chessboard, rearranging the deck chairs of the Titanic, if you were.Mrs. Tuchman accurate describes the corrupt chaos of the Third Republic of France, a government everyone hatred but no one dared attempt a coup against for fear of the devil one DID know might come to power; of a Germany, who, in Caprivi words, got in everyone's way, frightened everyone and achieved nothing. At the head of all this was a man who, however much more intelligent and better educated than his cousin &quot;dearest Nicky&quot;, little less a fool than that cousin; she flatly depicts the moral paralysis of British politicians more concerned with keeping power and &quot;reform&quot; and aghast at the idea of plunging Britian into the type of coalition war she had assiduously avoided since defeating and murdering the &quot;Orge&quot; decades before. She shows the careful balancing act that the realistic Cabinet members (Gray, Churchil et al)were forced to walk amongst their ministerial colleagues in order to bring Britain into the war against a Germany now on the march. Mrs. Tuchman's descriptions of these Cabinet meetings (and to a lesser their French and German equivalents) are as agonizing as the actual events themselves had to be. Only Gray and Churchill, with the longer perspective of history, realized that such mighty concentrations of wealth and military power could not be defeated in a month, a season or a year. As the drive to Paris begins to falter and finally fail, Mrs. Tuchman shows us the few hearts who realized exactly what the victory at the Marne--though this reduces none of the glory of French and British arms--protended.Do not be fooled by a historian willing to take a moral view and willing to denounce evil, incompetence, self-aggrandizement and fools to the sunlight and expose them. Mrs. Tuchman does exactly that. And we can see that, tho' gone these fifteen years, the sting in her words still reaches the tenders spots of those who would cast gauzy revision over the facts. Sir John Keegan's excellent, if telescoped by size restrictions, &quot;The First World War&quot; takes the same position as does Mrs. Tuchman on the &lt;b&gt;fact&lt;/b&gt; of Germany's responsibility, more specifically of William II's responsibility, for the First World War and all of that which followed.Any attempt at controversy aside, read this book, if for no other reason than the beauty of its prose and the majestic example of a monograph it presents."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"First, I would like to admit that I became curious about this book because of the movie &quot;Thirteen Days.&quot; President Kennedy has always been one of my favorite heroes and so when his character mentioned the book in the movie, I became intrigued. I now understand why this book was so important to President Kennedy during the Cuban Missile Crisis.Barbara Tuchman has done a masterful job in making clear to the reader that historical events take place because of accidents and blunders. It is sad to realize that an entire generation (no exaggeration folks) of people died in World War I because the leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Russia (both civilian and military) were so misinformed and imbecilic. Each of the leaders believed that he knew exactly what his adversary was going to do, even when facts wereproduced that showed his perceptions to be mistaken. For example, the Chief of Staff of France believes that it doesn't matter how many soilders Germany concentrates in her right flank, opposite Belgium, since it makes his plan for an offensive against the German center that much more likely to succeed. He even strips troops from each of his flanks to concentrate in the center of his lines, leaving too few soilders to oppose the German war machine. The outcome, in a matter of days, Germany takes over Belgium and then proceeds to crush every French army it meets in a matter of weeks.Each of us would like to believe that the leaders of our countries are intelligent and rational people. That during an international crisis (like war), because of their extensive schooling, experience and training they can handle themselves in a calm rational manner. We are wrong. It is becoming more apparent as I study history, that the leaders of our societies are just as failable to inpatience and irrational behavior. This literally keeps me awake at nights worried that something like the events of August 1914 could happen again. I hope this book becomes required reading for anyone mad enough to become the leader of thier country."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"A lively recollection of origins, decision makers and eventsthat led to World War I and a vivid development of the firstmonth of this war. Once you read it you will never forgetJoffre, Galieni or von Kluck in the Marne battle or the battleof Tannenberg and the Masurian Lakes which made Hindeburg thenational hero of the Germans."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"The story for pre-WWI Europe is amazing. Both sides were convinced they knew the other's plans...and felt a compulsion to repeat the war of 1870....to set things right. As we know now, the burden left on Germany by that war set the stage for the next war.The shipper delivered as promised, and the condition of the book was as expected."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"The Guns of August is a masterpiece of history! This is the explanation of how an assassination in Sarajevo sparked a world-wide conflagration that consumed millions of lives, that still resonates today. As so aptly described in the book, the alliances that bound the players of each side to aid the other, in a heap of &#8220;jackstraws&#8221;, that could not be moved without bringing whole structure down. The book also reveals how unnecessary this war was and how blindly each side willingly blundered into it. The result was the loss of a generation of young men in Europe, the bankrupting and destruction of royal dynasties, and the beginning of a communist regime that threatened world peace for over half a century, all for nothing. This war, World War one, which taught the world nothing, made the next war, World War two, an inevitability. It has been said that President Kennedy made the Guns of August mandatory reading for his staff. They were supposed to learn its lessons and apply them in the future. Who knows, maybe this book prevented an unfortunate reaction to the Soviet provocations in Cuba in 1962, and thus prevented a global thermo-nuclear war. Thus the lesson is that there has never been a bad peace or a good war."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"Before reading this book, my knowledge of World War I was minimal. The Guns of August was an excellent way to learn significantly more about the events leading up to the War and the first month of battle. Tuchman's writing is a great combination of information, story telling, and wit.I highly, highly recommend reading The Guns of August. It has been awhile since I've read a nonfiction book that I found impossible to put down at times; this one certainly fit that billing."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"The Guns of August deserves its standing as a classic of historical narrative. Barbara Tuchman describes the opening month of World War I with grace, intelligence, cutting wit and an appropriate amount of moral outrage. She maintains masterful control of a sprawling story that spans the European continent and involves a massive cast of villains, idiots, heroes and people just caught up in tumultuous events. The book is an education. I never knew, for example, that the British navy's inept pursuit of the German cruisers Goeben and Breslau helped set the stage for the problems we still face in the Middle East. Tuchman is a connoisseur of military folly. And she has plenty to work with here: the German military's planners, meticulous about schedules and geography, but astonishingly ignorant about world politics and bereft of simple decency or any sense of proportion; the French high command, filled with generals who spend more time seeking scapegoats for defeat than fighting the enemy; and an exasperating British commander who seems determined to stay as far away from the fighting as possible. Oddly, this book, which had been on my reading list for about 35 years, wasn't what I expected. Perhaps because I'd heard that JFK gave copies of The Gun of August to his advisers during the Cuban Missile Crisis, I thought it would describe the failed diplomacy that led to war _ a story well told in Robert Massie's Dreadnought but only touched on here. Guess I should have paid more attention to the title. Duh."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"Extreamly well written. One of the best books on the orgins of the war. I didn't know that Germany prior to WW1 was already thinging of expanding it borders. This is way before Hitler was trying to do it."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"In line with the majority of reviewers here, I greatly enjoyed and heartily recommend this book. Although it was written nearly fifty years ago, it reads as freshly as anything published today. Tuchman's writing is top notch and completely gripping, the pacing is near perfect, and the characterization of the key players is deft and entertaining. Anyone with more than a passing interest in World War I should read this, without question. A few particular comments:- While at least one review ofA World Undone: The Story of the Great War, 1914 to 1918makes an unflattering comparison toThe Guns of August, I read the former book first, and I'm glad that I did.A World Undone: The Story of the Great War, 1914 to 1918is a wonderful comprehensive overview of the war from start to finish, and having this background madeThe Guns of Augustmore enjoyable as an in-depth study of the first month of the war. In particularThe Guns of Augustdoesn't do much to explain the reasons behind the outbreak of war. I suspect that this is an artifact of the age ofThe Guns of August- when it was published, people were probably much more familiar with general history of the war, given that so much first-hand knowledge was still in circulation. I doubt that today the average American could tell you who fought in the war, or when, so the comprehensive background preparation is more necessary.- The book contains more of the standard military movement-type information than I could keep track of. I'm sure that military history buffs won't have any problem with this, but I can't keep the XX Army and the XIV Army straight, nor do I have a photographic conception of German/French/Belgian border geography, so at some points I had to just let these passages wash over me.- While the entire book is of extremely high quality, it's the last two chapters that stand out as truly extraordinary. The entire book is a lead-up to the climax of the penultimate chapter, which is really a thrilling read (even when you know what's going to happen!). The final chapter is Tuchman's chance to wrap up and draw conclusions, and I found this to be an extremely moving and powerful piece of writing.Recommended without reservations."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"Many of the Kings and Queens of Europe were related and many wanted to add some land to their holdings. But to make this unwise was the several agreements that countries had with each other. Russia with Serbia, Austria with Germany, and others who were pledged to come to the defense of the other if attacked. Germany had developed plans to invade France, and France had plans to defeat Germany. And in the early 1900s, Europe was a powder keg needing only a match. That happened with the assassination of the Archduke Frederick by a Serbian.There had been a lot of posturning by the armies, but now it was war. And such a foolish war at that. There was no winner, only losers. England, Germany and France lost most of an entire generation of young men. There were battles that killed tens of thousands of men in a single day !The detail and facts reflect the author's concern for accuracy, and to her research ability. She was privvy to quite a lot of personal correspondence between the leaders and this is woven into the fabric of her writing.The Guns of August is one of the most complete works of the events leading up to the days of August when Europe exploded."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"The book to read if you are interested in the Great War but don't know where to begin: All those trenches and meaningless battles can seem a slog from such a remove in time. Barbara Tuchman captures the essence of \\"war-as-folly\\" with piercing wit and an unrelenting focus on World War I's first month and change.In the aftermath of Edward VII's death in 1910, the jackstraw pile of alliances that made Western Europe was kindling for holocaust. For Germany, there was the opportunity to finish the work started in 1870 when France was made to submit to their will. For France, there was a shot at redeeming honor lost with the German-occupied territories of Alsace and Lorraine. Sucked into the resulting maelstrom was the rest of Europe; hapless Belgium, honor-bound Great Britain, and unstable Russia.All this Tuchman writes of with cool detachment and a sense of overwhelming loss that serves as \\"The Guns Of August's\\" thematic undertow. \\"In 1914 'glory' was a word spoken without embarrassment, and honor a familiar concept that people believed in,\\" she writes.Published in 1962, \\"Guns Of August\\" not only documents history but became history, too, when U.S. President John F. Kennedy reportedly referred to it as the basis of a cautious approach to the Cuban Missile Crisis. When crisis hits, Tuchman points out, a \\"go-slow\\" approach may be preferable to reactionary measures, however understandable.\\"Guns Of August\\" is criticized by some for being anti-German. I can see the point, but can't concede the factual basis of her observations regarding both the warlike character of the German high command and the atrocities inflicted by its troops on Belgian and French civilians. There would be many victims of World War I, but Germany's embrace of \\"Schrecklichkeit\\" warface to induce fear made them stand out as unprincipled aggressors and hardened attitudes against settlement.There was plenty of idiocy to go around, and Tuchman finds it in a cast of memorable, singular characters. Sir John French, the commander of the British forces in France, has to be dragged into doing his duty by the French commander Joffre, whose own foolish unwillingness to concede to reality early on nearly dooms France entirely. The Russians fight bravely in the East, but with such lack of coordination that the Germans annihilate them in detail. Meanwhile, even the better commanders, like France's Lanrezac and Germany's von Kluck, become casualties of events overtaking them beyond their capacities. Only Belgium's King Albert emerges as an unalloyed hero.Does \\"Guns Of August\\" present the whole story, in pure, reasoned style? I wonder, yet it gave me a hunger to learn more, and in the process raised the war above the mud and mess with which I long associated it. Tuchman distinguishes herself throughout the book as a teller of the Great Story, and by its end I felt a sense of the exhaustion that left Europe bloodier, if not wise enough to avoid a repetition that was just as deadly.I'm not an unalloyed Tuchman fan; her reductivist tendencies elsewhere have put me off. But here, she makes fine use of her reasoning skills and her organizational powers to deliver as worthy a work for her century as Homer's tales of Troy and John Ford's takes on the Old West. Proceed with caution, but by all means, proceed."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"You do not need to be a student of history to read this book. Anyone wanting to read a fascinating, incredible, and true story will find this book to be an excellent choice.For anyone who wants to try and figure out why this world is the way it is, WWI is a very good starting place, because this insane war warped the world perspective in ways that are still affecting us today. WWI is the breaking point for world order. Before it, Europe (and thus world power) was controlled by five families, who held autocratic power over the majority of the worlds people, commerce, and resources. The war destroyed their power, and allowed democracy to rise up in their place. It also turned the United States into a major world power.No one tells the story of the beginning of that horrible tragedy better than Barbara Tuchman. She is the accepted leader in WWI history and \\"The Guns of August\\" should be the first book on the war that anyone reads. From the funeral of Edward XII to the end of the failed German opening offensive, this book reveals the tensions, passions, and incompetent stupidity that sent a generation of European youth to their graves.I bought this book from Amazon in 2007. It is still on my bookshelf, worn and well-read. It was a replacement for an earlier copy that I wore out."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"Anybody looking to learn more about WWI should start with this book. Offering a detailed, day-by-day account of the complex first month of WWI would be challenge enough for most military historians. Barbara Tuchman not only surmounts this challenge - she simultaneously weaves a compelling, suspenseful narrative with novel-like elements.The principle protagonists of the Entente and the Central Powers - the commanders and political leaders - are intimately portrayed, with their individual strengths and flaws shown to have worldwide ramifications. The theme of a dying old world with its romantic - if deluded - notions of combat, harshly confronting an uber-industrialized new world is transcendent throughout.Tuchman wisely avoids outright assertions, instead demonstrating the true tragedy of this war is that it happened and that it dragged on. She documents numerous occasions in which war could've been avoided outright, or ended with decisive action. Individual flaws, the fog of war, and nationalism were all to blame for keeping the massacre going. I rarely call history books page-turners, but this book surely is one."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"I have always wanted to read Ms. Tuchman when it came to this Pulitzer Prize winning work about the first month of WW1 and some interesting events prior. By far this is a fantastic work and anyone who wants a different take on WW1 that is not rundown with a Phd historian or over saturated work with thousands of pages will enjoy this work. My only issue was my decision to buy the mass market edition, although smaller and easier to take with you, the maps in this edition are much harder to decipher. In addition, some of the phrases Ms. Tuchman uses in her quotations from the many leaders and military personnel that are introduced to us in this work are not translated into English and she does not always provide the translation in parenthesis. Otherwise add this book to your history bookshelf because it is on mine."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"In this seminal work, Barbara Tuchman provides a clear and well written history of the events and currents of thought which led to the disastrous First World War. Starting with a description of the monarchical-familial ties of many of the leaders of the European states before the war, Tuchman also describes the philosophies of war and battle that drove the French and German warplanners. It was the plans these thinkers created -- the Schlieffen Plan for Germany, offensives in Alsace for the French -- that led directly to the later stalemates on the Western Front, and years of trench warfare. There are not many leaders who come out well in Tuchman's story. French, German, Russian and English military leaders all come off as barely competent or so self assured they are unable to see the folly in what they are doing. The book is also powerfully describes the suffering of civilians, especially Belgians, at the hands of the Germans. The British leadership, while well meaning, comes off as shrinking in the face of war.Focusing on the first month of the conflict, August 1914, Tuchman's work is not a comprehensive history of the entire war years. But she does lay the groundwork for what was to come. This is a great place to start for those interested in learning about \\"The Great War.\\" I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"I first read this book in high school literature class. It was good then & better now. I own it in paperback form, & have read it several times since then. It is a fast paced book about the first month of ww1, hence it's title. It doesn't go into all the complex political, ethnic, & other pressures that caused the war in very much depth. However, the writing is great & it introduces us to many figures in the war. As well as several of the early battles & terrible, stupid mistakes made by both sides. This book is a classic & has stood the test of time."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"For the non-histiorian, there is no better writer/historian than Barbara Tuchman and no better Introduction to her artistry (and I think of no better description of her writing than \\"artistry\\") than \\"The Guns of August . . .\\". If you are looking for a way to get into the fascinating world of historical non-fiction, Ms. Tuchman is prolific and her interests span many historical eras and topics. She is sometimes controversial. Her conclusions may be somewhat dated. Academic historians sometimes find her writing too simplistic. All of the above, while sometimes accurate, are what makes historical writing so much fun. Start with Tuchman, start with \\"The Gun of August\\" and you will find yourself transported to events we are still trying do deal with, learning about legendary personalities who were real people with real peculiarities, and mysteries that are as fascinating as anything Conan-Doyle, Cristie, or Rowling ever contrived. The really wonderful thing is that the world of Ms. Tuchman is our world. Hop on. This train will take you to destinations you cannot help but be captivated by."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"SUPERBLY written, however, naming off 55 generals at one point, and their specific strategies, positions, and timelines, without much contexet or reminder of who is who, you are left guessing about which countries general's and politicans we are talking about, as you are only told once. Great Britan, France, Germany, Belgum, Russia, Austria etc... If you have crayons and a pad and can keep up, this is the standard by which all historical empirical documents should be compared.Needs to be made into a documentary."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"Ever since I was a kid, I've been fascinated with World War One and the huge transition point it represented in history. Despite knowing a good bit about the subject, I was still very impressed with The Guns of August. Tuchman accomplishes what few history writers pull off, which is to make readers forget what they know about history and see its drama unfold through the eyes of people at the center of events, who didn't know what would happen next. The book's very detailed, but has the sense of narrative of a novel.Tuchman opens, with a fitting sense of moment, at the 1910 funeral of King Edward of Britain, where the heads of future belligerent states gather on still-cordial terms. From there, she sets the stage with a portrait of Europe as it stands in the early 20th century, and the policies, mindsets, histories, and cultural attitudes that shape each country's leaders, as they look towards a war that everyone is certain will come. She captures the relationships and self-fulfilling expectations that drive those leaders towards fateful decisions, like players in a Shakespearian tragedy, and the gears and wheels of military plans inexorably grinding forward while diplomats search in vain for the \\"halt\\" button. Then comes the tremendous drama of the war's first weeks, when vast armies are in motion, the fate of nations hangs in the balance, and choices are made that will come back to haunt both sides. While there are probably better \\"academic\\" works on the war and books that better capture the horrors of trench warfare, I don't know of any that so well explains the key players and the flow of events, while conveying the excitement, fear, hope, and desperation that gripped each country as the crisis exploded. It was hard not get a little caught up in the emotions of events, such as the brave defense of Belgian forts, even knowing that initial success wouldn't last against overwhelming forces.Is Guns of August a perfect work? Probably not. Like all historical writers, Tuchman has her biases, and seems to put primary blame for the war on Germany. In her version, they're aggressors who blindly refuse to put aside preset invasion timetables, even when the option of avoiding war with a less menacing France seems at hand. Other historians probably have more subtle pictures. Also, Tuchman covers politics and battles in equal levels of detail and some readers might get bored with the play-by-play descriptions of maneuvers and clashes that fill the latter half of the book (though I enjoyed that part myself).However, the positives far outweigh the negatives. As a chronicle of a crucial forty days in human history, The Guns of August remains fresh and alive even half a century after its first publication (when much was still in living memory). On the audiobook experience, I thought that the narrator did a good job with French, German, and Russian accents. Apparently, there's another audio version out there, but I don't know how that compares.PS. If you enjoy this sort of narrative history, I recommend seeking out Dan Carlin's Hardcore History podcast, which is more informal, but driven by a similar enthusiasm for recreating the moment of decision.4.5 stars"},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"Earlier this year I read Ulysses Grant's celebrated autobiography, which was heavy on strategy, dealing with the confusion of a battlefield and the conflicts among offices. The Guns of August covers the first 30 days of The Great War and highlights many of the same types of problems. Indeed, many of the logistical and reconnaissance problems Grant faced in the 1860s were not much different from those in the early days of the European war. Even with aerial reconnaissance, radio and the automobile, armies became lost and enemy movement was a bit of a guessing game, underscoring that war is as much of an art as it is a science in tactics and organization.The Russians are the unsung heroes in this tale. As is typical for the country, corruption, cultural conservatism and poor organization caused their invasion of Prussia to crumble. But even as the Russians were fleeing the field, their honorable commitment to their French allies and early aggression was enough to panic the Germans into diverting military resources to the East from those set aside for invading Belgium and France, and that set the stage for an eventual French and British victory that would turn back the German invasion of France - though \\"victory\\" in this sense should be loosely applied as it did not lead to the destruction of the German army, which eventually put a halt to its retreat and dug in to begin four years of horrific trench warfare.There was never the decisive victory for either the Allies or the Central powers.But in the first 30 days of the war the expectation on all sides was triumph. Years of preparation hardened the German and French generals' view that the war would unfold as they had planned it, blinding them to any new information that contradicted their expectations. In this book, we meet the German and French strategists, Continental kings and princes, British policy makers, and the Russian oligarchs who plan the invasions, the defenses and the material support. There is also an interesting chapter on the naval campaign in the Mediterranean, but most of this story takes place in the military field headquarters.\\"Guns of August\\" is an excellent introduction and foundation piece to the First World War that can can be built on with Keegan's \\"The First World War\\" and Stevenson's \\"Cataclysm: The First World War As Political Tragedy\\". It is well written and does a very good job describing the hopes, fears and disappointments from all sides in the war's early days. It provides a clear back story to Germany's decision to invade Belgium and France, but only gives a little insight into the causes of the broader war, with Austria-Hungry, the Ottoman Empire and the U.S. playing only minor roles."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"Title: it would take enormous nurve and self-regard for an amature to review this famous prize winning work about the beginning of the First World War. It is a great book. I first read it in the 1960s when it was published and decided to read again as we near the century mark of the Great War. I read it as a companion to Tuchman's Proud Tower which is a study of European society in the last years of the 19th century and the early years of the 20th; her quest was to try to discover what it was about that time that lead Europe, in the height of its power and creativity, to lose its mind. The Guns of August, is the exploision of that disease. It is a great read and an ever important event for our leaders as well as we who think nothing can go wrong."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"The Guns of August is a brilliant and scholarly work primarily about the military buildup prior to WWI and its denouement In the ensuing war. While I was impressed by Mrs. Tuchman's scholarship and erudition, I was surprised and disappointed that there was so much emphasis on military statistics and relatively little on the economic and political roots to \\"the war to end all wars\\""},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"I found the book to be an excellent exposition of the lead up to World War I. In particular I was appalled by the approach and attidudes to the start and potential consequences of the war by the generals on both sides of the conflict. Is it any wonder that this resulted in the carnage that followed."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"This book has been held in the highest esteem since its publication in 1962. JFK handed it to Harold Macmillan as a gift and as a primer for what world leaders should NOT let happen. It won a special Pulitzer Prize. It became a perennial best seller, for which Tuchman was snubbed by some scholars, perhaps in a pique of jealousy, for not producing a \\"serious\\" and dryly didactic work. Tuchman herself was grateful that she never got a PhD. She considered herself both a historian and a lover of words. This rare combination propelled her to work out an amazingly readable page turner. By her own account, she worked on the first paragraph for 8 hours, wanting it to move the reader to turn that page. The reader then really gets to know the generals, the leaders, the cultural conflicts, and the daily events that led up to the awful bloody slaughter of this war. Tuchman also indicates pointers toward Round Two just 22 short years later.Highly detailed yet clearly engaging, this account is about only the crucial first month of the Great War, the War to End All Wars. According to the German master plan, Germany was to conquer Europe and end the war in just 39 days. Every blunder, every key personality, every communication foul up, and every strategic move of the Belgians, the British, the French, the Russians, and the Germans are given in chronological order so that events move along as if in real time. The reader is caught up in all the drama and headlines of the day.At last, WW I is made understandable and real. Once you read this book, you will know what it was all about. For anyone who loves to learn and who loves history, this book is a requirement. Sometimes no words can do justice to a great work and that is true of this invaluable masterpiece. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"Great service from Amazon in U.S.I was not familiar with this book nor with the excellent writer, Barbara Tuchman. It's a fabulous book and everyone in Europe, the Americas, and the rest of the world should read it. It should be required reading for all advanced secondary school students. The powerful message it conveys is that men with power will expect that others should give their all to keep them in power. For several million human beings it meant the supreme sacrifice. They gave their lives in an insane 4 year war that coerced the leaders of too many nations into blindly diving in. Their countries, their people, their intellects, their economies suffered horribly. And perhaps the worst result occurred some 20 years later in a more devastating, disastrous war that resulted in the deaths of some 60 million mortals. Barbara Tuchman clearly shows us how fallacious pride and thinking can cause such disaster to so much of the world's people. Tuchman makes it painfully clear that the suffering and loss are incomprehensible."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"I read The Guns of August hoping to learn about the casuses of World War I, and what I took from this book far exceeded my expectations.As the title indicates, the focus of the work is August 1914--the first month of the war. Early on, Tuchman describes the confusing relationships between the various aristocrats of Europe. Rather than focusing on the usual suspects when one asks \\"What caused WWI?\\" (such as Archduke Ferdinand's assassination), Tuchman unravels the web of treaties and alliances that pulled everybody into the mix.Her account of the strategy and tactics of the first month seem solid (though I am no authority), but I was disappointed by the maps. They are very basic and added little to my understanding of the overall strategy.Her strength, though, is juggling the various players and presenting them in a manner that is not confusing but illustrates the relationships between events.Tuchman's writing is a pleasure to read. She draws on a vast vocabulary and I read most of the book with a dictionary handy--she chooses her words precisely and even for me (an English teacher), it helped to look things up. The book was challenging but not overwhelming. Overall, the book has the feel of a well-written novel rather than hard-core history.Again, I felt that I got a great deal from the book. Not only do I have a better understanding of the forces that led to the Great War, but I have a strong desire to learn more about it."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"I began this book with a minimal amount of background on WWI. Barbara Tuchman has turned the period leading up to the war, and its first 30 days into a read that is as pleasurable to read as 'The Lord of the Rings,' and yet it is informative and complete. She has a lyrical mastery of the language and the ability to bring the humanity to the players, both statesmen and military commanders that is extremely rare. I felt that I got to know them as more than just the issuers of orders; I understood their motives and the interpersonal issues that affected their conduct. When I began the book I was somewhat skeptical, but now I regret that she did not go any further that the first month of the war. If all history were this well written, I would give up fiction."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"Should be required reading. Not just an explanation of how the origins of WWI, but of the end of past millenium, and the beginning of our modern history.Told as a terrific and thrilling story.Cannot recommend enough for history and non-history students, political science buffs, and the curious. Fantasitc insight into timeless themes of people, cultures and politics."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"This is history written not from the author's notes, but rather from her intimate knowledge of the subject. In this wonderfully well woven book, the stage leading up to WWI is set and the story of the first major campaign is told in detail. I would have really enjoyed reading her retelling the story of the entire war, but I am content with having gotten a great opening lecture."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"Tuchman is absolutely the best historian/writer ever, and &quot;Guns of August&quot; shows from its first chapter why it won the Pulitzer. I was mesmerized from the beginning with the way that Tuchman spins her all too true tale of the folly of &quot;The Great War&quot;. She illustrates how the &quot;war to end all wars&quot; was nothing of the kind, but rather the terrible omen of the destruction of humanity which threatens us well into the 21st century. Particularly useful is the way in which Tuchman illustrates the fateful decisions which occurred on a day by day basis between all the combatants, criss-crossing between cabinets, rulers and battles until you will feel that you riding on some great, horrific wave you wish you could stop. The destruction of Belgium is so painfully portrayed that I wept while reading it. Tuchman turns the first month of the war into s thrilling, dark, mesmerizing trip through time. &quot;Guns of August&quot; is the ultimate historical account of WWI."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"This detailed military history covers the prelude to and the first month of World War I. Tuchman gives what almost seems like an eye-witness account of the events and personalities involved in the outbreak of war. Her narrative style makes the people and events real to the reader, as the world stumbles into a war that brings with it the destruction of the old order. An outstanding feature of this book is the language itself. Tuchman uses words so skillfully that the words themselves are haunting and memorable. The vivid images created in the reader's mind from her descriptions stay long after the book is finished. This is how history should be written"},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"The book is fantastic. If you have already read World War I books this is a great supplement. It illuminates many of the reasons and rationale for the inception of the war. She goes into wonderful details about the cast of characters on all sides of the war. Love it.The only bad part about this is that the Kindle version SUCKS! It's difficult to refer to maps or look at pictures, and I think that, until they get it fixed, I'm not going buy any history books for my Kindle."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"These words are just as true today as they ever were. When I started this book, I was expecting to read about how WWI started. What I got was even more than I bargained for, and left me even more confused. This folly of missed chances and blind loyalty to outdated battle plans left me apalled and angry at both sides.Politically, both Germany and France, and to a lesser extent, England and Russia, should have recognized the coming peril, but did little or nothing to stop it. Rather, their mistrust of each other, combined with their dreams of empire, left much of Europe in ruins, and ultimately sowed the seeds of WWII.Militarily, both France and Russia seriously underestimated the enemy, and instead of preparing for a modern war, relied on grandiose and naive notions of Elan (Esprit-de-corps) to carry the day. The French army even had the audacity to wear red uniforms into battle. This proved to be an unfortunate and costly choice.This book has modern implications, as even today, nations are locked in conflicts, both militarily and politically. My hope is that all of the nation's leaders read this book and if they don't see it as an example of how to stop a war, at least see it as a way NOT to fight one."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"Guns of August is a gripping account of the French and German preparations for an inevitable war (which turned out to be WW I), and of how those preparations failed or succeeded in the first month or so of the war. The Germans succeeded more or less in their blitz into France, closing their pincers in on Paris within weeks after hostilities began. However, timely assistance from the British and the Germans' failure to follow their own plan prevented immediate success, eventually allowing the Allies to push back and defeat the Germans. The detail, magnitude, and audacity of the German plan are appropriately given much ink. I doubt that anyone with a serious interest in history could read this book in any more than a week's time. You will be astounded in reading Tuchman's treatment of the daring plans of both sides, their costly mistakes and misjudgments, their perception of war as inevitable and noble."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"Barbara Tuchman's Guns of August is a superb achievement. I would strongly recommend it to historians and those curious about the initiation and maintenance of a war of epic foolishness and wasted human life.Tuchman points out that the origins of the war were numerous but that considerable evidence exists that the military planning and deployment process on all sides over-ran and dominated the policical diplomatic statemanship of all parties involved. Once military deployment began, weak and ineffective statemanship could not stop the thunder roll of young men willing to die for this senseless misunderstanding. This is a view similar to Henry Kissinger in his book Diplomacy. Kissinger and Tuchman's analyses have much in common. Kissinger reveals that Bismarch was able to build a modern strong German state that was wasted in a senseless war after his death. Both Tuchman and Kissinger point out that convoluted alliances between Germany and Austria, blindlessly followed upon the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand and his wife Sofia, created a domino effect. Germany responded with horror that a Slavic revolutionists would assassinate a Germanic Prince and even though Bosnia agreed to all conditions prior to invasion, the Austrians decided to invade to recover pride. This act was viewed with contempt by the Russians who wished to come to the aide of their Slavic brothers and their entry pulled France, then England, and finally the United States into the vortex. If anything, Guns of August would warn all nations not to rush into war.Both Kissinger and Tuchman point out that the American Civil War was the first modern war in which amazing technical fire power totally over-powered those that used the machine gun technology and those that fell under it's aweful power. There is very little evidence that any of the European military leadership studied the American Civil War and the tremendous loss of human life to the machine gun technology, a technology that they would implement without new strategies for infantry in the face of these killing machines.Remember that John Kennedy at the time of Cuban missle crisis had Barbara Tuchman's Guns of August as a warning at his bedside. There is a reason this book is a text book at West Point. Every President should read this book and analyze the very slippery slope of public sentiment, prejudice and misplaced patriotism, and our amazing ability to fool ourselves and underestimate our enemy.In Robert Grave's Good Bye to All That, we see that this war destroyed the rigid class system in Europe, as aristocracy drove first the peasants and then their own sons into the mouth of death. The aristocracy of the European nations were immediately made officers and the serf and farmers were enlisted men who had to follow the orders of the upper class inexperienced fools. Tolkein honors this patterns in the character of Sam in The Lord of the Rings, the loyal helper and valet who stands beside his better, Mr. Frodo.At the Mercedes museum in Stuttgart, I saw the Mercedes Limo that drove Kaiser Wilhelm around Amsterdamn after the fall of Germany and his forced abdication. I wondered if he ever knew the tremendous loss of human experience that resulted due to his poor statemanship, oversized ego and paranoia.The war centers around the Western Front and the German effort to sweep around the front, through Belgium, and onward to a quick victory in Paris. It is the invasion of Belgium that pulls the English into the struggle. But we must also not forget the terrible war crimes committed by the German troops upon the common citizens of Belgium and northern France. I found myself repeatedly angry at the military and national leadership on all sides, for they seemed caught in quicksand. Before they came to their senses, an entire generation of young men were destroyed.But if anger is what you need to read, try Dalton Trumbo's Johnny Got His Gun. In the end Tuchman recognizes that human insight is extremely limited and the ability to see several steps of consequences is beyond most human comprehension. This is particularly true if military rank is a result of class rather than ability.England and France remained politically intact after the war, but German began the steps into dark Nazism while Russia began her steps toward Bolshevism. The Czar and his family were killed, the Austrian emperor was forced to abdicate as did Germany's Kaiser.Tuchman would not support Lenin's assertion that World War I was a result of capitalistic societies at war over trade and profits.The war began August 4th and by August 29th there were 260,000 French deaths.At Waterloo an infantry soldier couldifre twice a minute. The machine gun fired six hundred rounds a minute. The Wesern Front stretched for 475 miles with 10,000 soldiers per mile. The front consisted of 3 trenches sometimes separated fromt eh other side by less than 10 yards. The trench system, defended by machine guns in trenches could only be overcome by assault, a horrible stategy. Artillery was suppose to open up the path through the trenches but was dismal at this task. In the summery of 1916 more thatn 50,000 British troops died walking into German fire, without advancing the front by a single foot. I am so sad when I think of 8 million young men, ages 17-20, dying in the blood and mud, because of diplomatic entangled miscalculations, erroneous intelligence, and manipulated nationalistic patriotism.I can not recommend a better book on World War I than Tuchman's Guns of August. No doubt there were multiple contributions to this tragedy, but man's lesser nature and cognitive limitations certainly carry the lion share of causation."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"In this day and age, one of the most calamitous wars in history is largely full of myth and misunderstanding. No one really understands what made World War I happen and what echoes it had. In fact, had WWI not happened, it is doubtful WWII would have either.An outpost of the Austro-Hungarian empire, Sarajevo, is the focal point for the June 1914 assasination of the Emperor's nephew, the Archduke Franz Ferdinand which would end more than 4 years later at Versailles on Armistice Day, 11 November 1918.Before the calamitous battles of Ypres and Verdun, the Marne and Mons, there were the effects of the assasination. Tuchman takes you into the world of politics, France's Plan 17 and the von Schlieffen plan to sweep into Belgium and into Paris in about 6 weeks. 6 weeks to glorious victory turned into more than 4 years of hell. Trench warfare was the norm. Both sides launched new weapons in order to break the gridlock of the Western Front. Campaigns like the tank and Gallipoli, flame throwers and aerial combat were born on the battlefields of WWI.To completely understand this war, why it started and what it meant, Tuchman's book is an essential read. You will find yourself in awe of Tuchman's writing prowess and sucked into the political maelstrom that was unleashed between that hot day in 1914 when Gabriel Princip fired the shot that embroiled Europe in a devestating hurricane of destruction and when the guns finally fell silent in 1918.I highly recommend this book to anyone, but students of WWI and those interested and intrigued by it will find it an essential and classic read. A must own book."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"Barbara Tuchman writes about history like no other writer I know. She is (or was) apparently just as happy as I am about the fact that she is not a \\"real\\" historian. Of course the niceties of that argument may be fought about for hours. But like Farley Mowat and T.C. Lethbridge, among others, Tuchman is an attacking, uninhibited sort of individual who doesn't care a fig for what a scholarly establishment may or may not think about a particular subject (and like Mowat and Lethbridge, she gets away with it). This is a very good beginning to a work about history which has to fall into line with ten thousand others on the same subject (there may have been more books written about the American Civil War, but I doubt it).To tell history in story form, and still have it remain non-fiction, is an art. What to include? What to leave out? Why focus on this aspect, when so many others are clamouring for our attention? Tuchman answers these and many other questions even as she writes, by creating a panorama for us, so that we may dwell on an individual aspect for a time, but not lose sight of the whole. With this kind of confidence around, brought to bear by the sheer mastery of the prose as well as understanding of the subject, writer and reader get on very well together. Another Tuchman touch is to maintain authorial integrity without annoying the hell out of us at the same time. Even when she is commenting in no uncertain terms about a particular event, we can accept it as reasoned and therefore coherent, rather than simply intrusive or even sarcastic. She usually gets a laugh out of us - we both know she's right - and goodness knows there is so much matter available, so much silliness going on.It's a book that is both easy to read, and immensely pleasurable (even though it includes a grimness at times, that one might expect), and it is difficult to see how you could come away from it without a much better idea of why the guns of August spoke."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"It's hard, upon reading this book, not to get swept up in Barbara Tuchman's stunning prose. It begins with the words &quot;so gorgeous was the spectacle on the May morning of 1910 when nine kings rode in the funeral of Edward VII of England that the crowd, waiting in hushed and black-clad awe, could not keep back gasps of admiration.&quot; The rest of the book continues to read like an adventure novel. It's a shame, really, because it should be remembered that these events really happened, and deserve careful consideration.The classic image of WWI is that of trench warfare, with the machine guns pinning down entire armies. As Tuchman reminds us, however, the first month of the war was a war of maneuver, undertaken at a breathtaking pace that presages the blitzkreig of WWII. Field artillery ruled as the omnipotent weapon of the battlefield, and the war came close to being a one-month struggle between France and Germany.Watching this epic battle unfold, it's hard to remember that we already know how the story ends. I sat in suspense wondering if the British would rejoin the line, and bit my fingernails over whether Paris would fall. My only complaint is that I was expecting more of an analysis of the causes of WWI. There are endless volumes on the causes of the Great War, however, and the adventure novel that Tuchman gives us is a precious gem."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"World War I seems to be a bit of a forgotten war. The details of the conflict have become lost in the more recent and greater impact of the sequel. WWI really begins really more of a 19th century war. Personal feelings plays just as much a factor in policymaking than national self-interest. In this Tuchman's book shines. The complexities of the first decade of the 20th century are clearly described and easy to follow.The first part of the book deals with the \\"set-up.\\" Here she describes how it is that Europe found itself on the brink of war in the summer of 1914 after several near misses in the years before. This is easily the best part of this book. Tuchman uses correspondences of the players to portray their states of mind at the time. These passages are the most enlightening.The second part of the book concerning the warplans. Here the individual strategies of the major players are described, as are the processes through which they were formulated. Again, personality, both personal and national, is a major contributing factor in these formulations.The last part concerns the actual battles that occurred in August of 1914. Here the book is less clear. There is simply too much going on in too many places to keep everything straight. This becomes more complicated when, for example, you encounter a Russian general with a German name, and a German general with a French name, and an English general named French. It is not the fault of the author, but here the book becomes a little bogged down in detail.Overall, the overview of the prewar period is brilliant, but the battles are a little confusing. Still, this book is wonderful as an introduction to WWI. It is a great place to start to learn the environment and the players of the war."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"I always read the worst reviews first. The majority are either frustrated writers who wonder why this person wins the Pulitzer Prize instead of them, people with some political or sociological hidden agenda or then the ones who have trouble reading literature above the 8th grade level.As a retired Army officer, we read a lot about the various campaigns and battles during this most horrific industrialized war of attrition. However, we never went into the detail of the background behind it.This author brings to life a lively historical look at the \\"movers & shakers\\" and the failures that caused this war to happen. She gives you the feeling of being in the various situations as an \\"invisible\\" staff officer observing the course of events of what happened in one month which resulted in a war that would last for 4 long & brutal years. I never realized that the time between the War of 1871 to the start of WWI had been in reality a historical \\"Cold War\\" that involved elaborate invasion plans, defenses and strategies. It is amazing how much power these monarchs had and the intricate treaties woven amongst them. We say that this could never happen again. However, we have today individual heads of states that can start wars without the approval of their congresses or parliaments. A reminder what can happen if false assumptions and poor decisions are made can result in a bloody war. The author definitely made the point in her book.The only negative point - The maps in the mass market addition were of poor quality and I had to go on line WWI atlases to see the details of these areas of operations."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"Some of the reviews have clearly gone overboard, beautiful prose? No, this is not Shakespeare nor Twain, it is a work of non-fiction and won the Pulitzer prize for general non-fiction in 1962. It did not win the history prize and rightly so because it has glaring holes in it. Starting in 1910 and covering the first few months of WW1 it outlines the outbreak of the Great War. Its great strengths are its portrayal of many of the main characters during this period and brings them to life that few others have been able to do. It outlines the German advance to deadlock period in the West and the first Russian defeat in the East well and is referred to as a classic for the period it covers, and what it covers it covers well. However I cannot give this five stars for a number of reasons. First, Barbara Tuchman falls into the annoying trap of writing a book in English and then filling it with lines of French and German, oddly, some she then goes on to translate and others she does not- just write them in English in the first place and be done with it. Second, she does nowhere near a good enough job to explain the causes of \\"The Great war\\", assassination, alliances and time tables is more akin to a poor history teacher blitzing through the subject to get to one they are more interested in. The omission of the Balkans and the decades of power struggle both internally within its borders and externally through Imperial Russia, Austria Hungary, Ottomans and latterly France is disappointing and in my opinion removes the book from being a classic. You cannot put the war into any context by not addressing this, the German Empire will always get to wear the 'Black Hat\\" even before the invasion of neutral Belgium if the Balkans is ignored as Tuchman has done. Third, this applies only to the smaller paperback edition, the maps are unreadable, buy the larger paperback or hardback otherwise unless you live in the region or have a lot of background knowledge for this period you will get lost fast.I still give the book 4 stars as Tuchman writes history in a very readable format far better then many of the dry history writers but if you are looking for prose for the period read many of the fine poets from the time, not non-fiction writers."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"Few of us have any real understanding of the events and personalities which pushed 1914 Europe into a war that should have been over in less than 6 weeks with a resultant German victory, but would instead grind on for years. In this her 3rd novel, Tuchman has done a monumental job of research and interpretation of the facts for the novice reader of military-political histories. She provides us a clear understanding of how the Kaiser and the Imperial German General Staff, contrived to build a case for war, developed a brilliant strategy to execute and win that war on two fronts [against the French and the Russians] and then to ultimately dominate the European continent. She introduces us to reluctant heroes like King Albert of Belgium and to weaker characters like Czar Nicholas of Russia. We are exposed to the brilliant German strategist Count Alfred Von Schlieffen who was the visionary for the incredibly bold and complex blueprint of military actions during the first 35-40 days of the Great War. Then she exposes flawed generals such as the indecisive Joffre of France and then the incompetent warriors like General Sir John French, of the British Expeditionary Forces. All in all... 'The Guns of August' [like Tuchman's 'Stillwell and the American Experience in China'] is a great read and a must have for the library of serious students of military-political history. One serious flaw however, is that this particular edition as produced by Tess Press, is overflowing with errors that even a novice proof-reader would have caught. They are so numerous as to be distracting and I would strongly recommend buying this great book only as published by a different printing house."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"I first read this work upon its publication in 1962. I was very impressed at that time. I recently reread this work...and am still very impressed. I have always been a big Tuchman fan, having enjoyed each and every book written by her, but do feel this is probably one of her best, if not indeed absolutely her best. The Guns of August gives a vivid account of the first month of World War I and event preceding those horrible days. Ms. Tuchman's research is wonderful and she had the writing skill to organize and present to the reader, very complex problems and circumstances in a readable format. One is very tempted to compare those times with current times on some level and this may quite well be true. Then again, the stupidity of humans and the error of humans has pretty well set the stage for most of the wars in history so why should it be any different now? I regress. This is a well written book, easy to understand and certainly will give the reader some food for thought. I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"I was never a huge fan of history in school - it seemed so static and dry. This book was forced upon me, and it opened my eyes to the grandeur of historical events and the necessity of understanding history to understanding the world today.

Although _Guns of August_ can be a tad technical, I would still rank it as one of the best works of this genre.As she wrote in her preface to _Guns of August_, 'I have tried to avoid spontaneous attribution or the \\"he must have\\" style of historical writing: \\"As he watched the coastline of France disappear, Napoleon must have though back over the long ...\\". All conditions of weather, thoughts or feelings, and states of mind ... have documentary support'. Her conscious rejection of 'fluff' in her retelling of the facts, while simultaneously empathising with the personalities involved and generating similar sentiment within her readers, demonstrates clearly her talents as an historical writer.Reading the book, one senses almost the suspense of a thriller movie and the emotion of a romantic one. Describing the out-break of war between the United States and Germany, one sympathised with the German ambassador Bernstorff and his American counterpart; each had friends in their host countries and their departures saddened them. Similarly, the exchange between Count Friedrich von Pourtales and Sergej Sazonow is just as touching:'Pourtales staggered to the window, leaned against it, and burst into tears. \\"So this is the end of my mission,\\" he said when he could speak. Sazonow patted him on the shoulder, they embraced, and Pourtales stumbled to the door, which he could hardly open with a trembling hand, and went out murmuring, \\"Good-bye, good-bye.\\"' (page 103)Reading Tuchman is an experience more exciting than watching a movie. She tells the facts simply, with no superfluous additions or editorial comments. However, she never fails to touch me, to build within me sympathy for the historical characters, just as would occur while reading a novel. Tuchman succeeded in weaving poor, misguided Wilhelm; innocent, unrealistic Wilson; vindictive, blood-thirsty Churchill; and pessimistic Helmuth von Moltke into a tapestry of fantastic story-telling."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"I've been simultaneously listening to an audio version and reading the book, which I have owned for years, but never got around to reading. It's hard to imagine why this was ever considered such a compelling read. Very hard to follow and really rather boring. If you want to read a really great book about World War I, I recommend Paul Fussell's \\"The Great War and Modern Memory\\" - one of the best books I've ever read, or Robert Graves' \\"Goodbye to All That\\" - another really great book. The most interesting thing about Tuchman's book to my mind is that it was ever considered some kind of page-turner, or anything but boring."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"Ninety seven percent of the world's population went to defcon 5!8 million Russian troops died.20 million troops killed world-wide.40 million deaths by disease.100+ million wounded.The best book about World War One ever written.An up-close viewpoint of the first month of Europe's worst knot-mare.The frustration of the high command as they realized that one wrong turn put a million troops on the WRONG side of Paris.

Maybe I can save one or two of you some time as well.If you are looking for a perspective on World War I which enacts its \\"artistic\\" license by comparing the German invasion of Belgium to a swarm of ants, that demonizes the Kaiser and glorifies the stalwart French and British generals - this is the book for you! I have to wonder, though -- if you think those are central elements of a description of what took place in August of 1914, why bother? You already know the history and are just looking for someone to arrange it in elegantly crafted lines. But if you believe that such lively metaphor and monochrome white-hat/black-hat perspectives could hardly explain the historical world any better than they do our own era, stay clear.I'm no expert by any means - but I've developed an interest in the war and the era, and a year of reading WWI-related books, has led me to two conclusions: (1) it was a darn complicated chunk of history - the leading-up-to, the four-years-slaughter, and the reverberating after-effects and (2) attempts to \\"spin\\" the story have been entwined with the factual record to such a degree that they are themselves an intriguing piece of the history. Tuchman's tale neither explores the complications nor acknowledges the spin. She tells a simple tale in wonderfully dramatic language that&#65533;s as good as anything Tom Clancy can produce, but its designed more for the heart than the head.There are many, many books about WWI from the inter-war period and some of them can still stand a look. But there has also been an intriguing resurgence of interest in and publishing on the war during the last decade which, itself, is a phenomenon that hints at something fascinating about who writes history and when (and how)they write it.If you are looking for books with a perspective that goes beyond the &#65533;swarm of ants&#65533; approach I&#65533;d recommend Mosier&#65533;s &#65533;The Myth of the Great War&#65533; and Ferguson&#65533;s &#65533;The Pity of War&#65533;. The former is startlingly pro-German (and pro-American - quite a combination, that) and the latter, although leaking some of the usual pro-Brit tone, constructs a quite-detailed pathway to thinking about the big &#65533;what-if&#65533; &#65533; if Germany had won the war. Keegan&#65533;s section about the Somme in &#65533;The Face of Battle&#65533; goes beyond the usual military history (but avoid his two &#65533;Histories&#65533; of the war itself) and the recent &#65533;14-18, Understanding the Great War&#65533; by Audoin-Rouzeau is flawed but demonstrates how even a Francophile perspective can at least explore different realms."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"I have not read Keegan's recent book on WWI. I am sure his is very good. However, I do know that Tuchman's Guns of August is Great for the Causes of the WWI.Nationalism, Militarism, Imperialism, The Alliance System, and of course the Archduke's Assassination. Tuchman does a excellent job describing why WWI started. This is a well written book, with great information. This is a classic account of the origins of WWI."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"This is one of the best books available on WW1 in terms of readability"},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"Barbara Tuchman, has the reputation with this work \\"The Guns of August,\\" as haven written the definitive and most compelling history of the lead-up and first month of World War I. Having that reputation to live up to may have hurt my estimation of this book. I expected the history to come off the page and envelop me in a world gone mad with war and Nationalism. What I feel I got was a better than average history read that helped me to understand the start of World War I but didn't necessarily immerse myself in dredging up the experience to stick it to the bones of my brain. I wasn't immersed like expected.What I truly liked about this book...the Generals come alive with their follies and foibles, their selfish desires and selflessness, their bravery and cowardice, their dashing elan that results in so many deaths. Tuchman paints an seemingly inevitable turn of tides rolling towards chaos. The Schlieffen plan has been set into motion and it seems nothing can hold it back to roll down the Belgian countryside steaming the Allemande juggernaut of divisions and reserves down on Paris. The decision points are revealed and the things counted on and discounted along the way reveal human beings making mistakes and heroic stands that hold the death of one century and the birth of another.Tuchman makes heroes and goats of the major players and I suspect the reality of their personality and roles may be a bit more multi-dimensional than is made out to be. King Albert of Belgium is the hero standing up to the Germans by committing his country to a disasterous but strategically important defeat. Sir John French of Britain despite his name worked terribly with the French and is portrayed as a fearful stumbling block to any cohesive allied effort, Joffre is a rock (sometimes as dumb as one but a rock nonetheless), and Gallieni the defender of Paris arises as the hero for urging an attack upon an opportune moment presented by Von Moltke's mistake and underestimation of the French Army. So this was a strength of the book.The book surprisingly gets bogged down in the countless retelling of details of which numbered division went where during battles and the retreat. It's suprising at a time when World War I actually involved movement. After all it wasn't much later until it truly got bogged down in trench warfare. Perhaps Tuchman's style is a window of what's to come. It reads more as a technical retelling at points instead of a vibrant history. If you are interested in history, don't let this detractor cause you to pass this one up. \\"The Guns of August,\\" is an important retelling of history however not one of the most engaging ones. It is difficult to live up to its reputation and my expectations admittingly.--MMW"},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"I finished the book with great sadness for the men who died in this war. For the millions on both sides lead to their deaths by incompetent generals, who didn't understand that technology had changed warfare since the prussian-franco war. Hungry and without ammo to fight because their supply lines from the taxpayers who reluctantly footed the bills throughout the whole system where the stupid if not utterly corrupt ruled. (\\"now boys don't steal anything\\") I wholeheartedly agreed with the author who wrote on the last page, \\"when at last it was over, the war had many diverse results and one dominat one transcended all others, disillusionment.\\" Especially knowing that we are in many ways the disillusioned and cynical result of those lost generations who fought and died in Flanders field. The writing is excellent, the topic important and riveting even now 90 years after the event. You find yourself unable to put down the book, or to cease thinking about the issues, which is exactly what a superb author like Ms. Tuchman intended when she struggled to write the book for us, her readers. It is one of those often recommended books that I simply didn't get around to reading, now I wish I had done so years ago, given myself more time to read more about WWI. After all, that is the measure of a good book, one that inspires you to follow the author's footsteps and read some of her research material, immerse yourself in more tellings of the story she introduced you to.

However, I purchased it in order to learn more about the origins of World War I and was profoundly disappointed. The analysis is quite limited and dominated by a heavy anti-German bias. Of course all works of history will show the author's bias to some degree, but parts of this book read like a melodrama, with Germany as the villain and Belgium as the hero.Studying the start of World War I gives us an opportunity to learn better ways of preventing future catastrophic wars. When the analysis of German war aims relies on \\"the hatred of a barbaric culture against anything civilized,\\" that opportunity is lost."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"...The book lays out the facts.The Germans murdered thousands of Belgian and French civilians, 99.99999% for no reason other than to \\"inspire\\" the fear that the doctrine of terrorism the \\"Grosser Generalstab\\" had inculcated into its commanders and troops.The exposes the dithering stupidity of much of the British cabinet--how can that be \\"pro\\" British in the sense of bias? Of course, it can't.It also demonstrates the tragic stupidity--there's no other word for it--of French politics and military planning during the Third Republic (1871-1940) and shows quite clearly that had the \\"offensive a l'outrance\\" had been abandoned for trench systems along the entire French border from Switzerland to the Channel, the Germans would have been stopped cold in Belgium and the French and British would have been fighting from the high ground--rather than the other way around.For anyone to call stating the cold, hard facts about the crimes of the Imperial German Army, is an insult to the thousands they murdered and to the only thing this book is about: the truth!So, neo-Nazis be gone! This book is about the truth, something you're not interested in.Germany was clearly, completely and totally at fault. Nothing in her strategic posture demanded hooking the \\"Reich's\\" fate to the tottering, imminent collapse of the Austrian Empire. Bismarck regarded the idea with horror and did all he could to distance Germany from creaking, bellicose Austria and her sociopathic commander-in-chief Conrad von Hoetzendorff.And yes, Mrs. Tuchman is pro democracy and pro-freedom--ideals few of Germany's pre-1914 elite held dear. And, yes, she is against shooting 6 month old babies in the head as the Germans did in Belgium.As Sir John Keegan points out, in his excellent \\"the First World War\\" (despite the bizarre and irrelevant criticism of this book by obviously weakly informed reviewer, is fantastic and MUST be on every student's shelf), everywhere the Germans went in France and Belgium, villages and towns were burned--sometimes cities, e.g Louvain--women, children, babies and old men were systematically shot--not by special death squads, but by members of some of the premiere regiments of the German Army (e.g. The Prussian Foot Guards, the \\"Big Red One\\" of the German Army).In almost every town in Belgium and the northern 1/4 of France occupied by them you can find grave stones with the inscription...\\"fusillie par les Allemands\\"\\"Shot dead by the Germans.\\"And, next to those whose death are marked 1914 is entirely new and much larger contention of graves with the very same words, only the date, 1940, changes.You see, in both wars, the Germans engaged in systematic war crimes and crimes against humanity.It took the destruction of their cities and the deaths of 9 million German men from 1914-1945 to convince our Teutonic cousins that they would never be allowed to conquer the planet.Mrs. Tuchman presents this with calm, studied prose that diminished none of the horror nor conceals the deeply moral center that drove this woman's life and work.Criticism is either revisionism or foolishness. This book is for the ages."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"I am not a historian, but merely a history buff. As such, I enjoy learning history from a personal perspective. This book is very good at putting you in the shoes of many of the leaders at the time leading up to the &quot;Great War.&quot; It does not paint a very flattering picture of those leaders, but those responsible for leading the world into the largest war to date perhaps do not deserve much flattery. However, I do find it difficult to believe that all of these gentlemen are as bungling and incompetent as portrayed.

She was a self-taught historian but did receive a BA from Radcliffe College. She began a career in journalism by writing for The Nation, owned by her father, in 1935 and traveled to Madrid in 1937 to cover the Spanish Civil War. During this period she also worked as a staff writer for War In Spain and New Statesman. As a liberal she was deeply disappointed by the outcome of the conflict and this may have affected the tenor of her writing. She was awarded her first Pulitzer Prize in 1960 for The Guns of August.The Guns of August only covers the first thirty days of the war, until the eve of the Battle of the Marne, but is still a wide ranging book. It covers in great detail the nationalism, diplomatic maneuvering, and military planning which seemed to lead the European continent to war; as well as the military maneuvers and battles of the first thirty days both on land and sea. The author's focus on a limited time period, rather than the entire war, allows her to delve into detail on the war's causes and the key decisions and actions that occurred early in the war. She places great emphasis on, and explores in detail, the personalities and governments she feels were instrumental during the crisis that led to the war and whose actions, during the first weeks of the war, contributed greatly to its future course.Though The Guns of August does not explore the war plans of the great continental powers in great detail it does provide a good background and overview of the different plans. More than other books it explains the basic beliefs espoused and followed by the military planners of Britain, France, Germany, and Russia. Tuchman demonstrates to a certain degree that the plans were not developed following impartial and objective research, but were driven by the pervasive military doctrine accepted by each countries General Staff. The result was plans that were destined to failure by the amazing ability of the highly educated General Staffs to alter their perception of reality to fit the plans that they wished to execute.The most interesting portions of the book are those sections that deal with the lesser-known facets of the war. Tuchman does a good job describing the remaining European royalty, their personalities and personal relationships, and the effects these had on European politics and alliances. For instance, the significance of King Edward's efforts to find a rapprochement with France and Russia are seldom mentioned in other books on the war. Another section develops the German military's punishment of Belgium's civilians to induce their surrender or subservience. Though other books mention Germany's major depredations they do so in the context of a confused situation that exploded out of control of the soldier's leadership. Tuchman is the first author I've read that deals frankly with the German's philosophy of war, based on Clauswitz, and the fact that the severe punishment meted out in civilian areas was both planned and widespread. In doing so she demonstrates the huge philosophical differences separating the belligerents, which only served to make an early negotiated settlement less likely.This is a very helpful book. More than any other it assists the reader in understanding the underlying causes of the war and the key events and personalities which contributed to the course the war was to follow. I wouldn't suggest reading it; however, until after completing a more comprehensive history of the war such as A Short History of World War I to aid in putting the significance of some of the war's early events in perspective.PJZ"},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"i think that that is what i got out of this book and it was shocking and revealing at once. &quot;guns&quot; took me to the more human and fallible side of war...the mistakes driven by ego and misunderstanding...the passionate stories behind the names of leaders that gave me insight into what really caused them to decide this or the other.this aspect of &quot;guns&quot; is as relevant today as it should have been in 1914...leaders drive their governments and countries into battles mainly out of their wish to develop greater personal power...they should be stopped, but unfortunately, they will probably live forever.this is not a book just for war history buffs although, to be honest, i did find myself interested in troop movements and strategies. this is a gripping hollywod adventure with the added bonus that it is true!"},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"Barbara Tuchman and Shelby Foote must have hung out together at one time.

This first month is filled with drama, excitement and all of the enthusiam of the tens of thousands of young men who still harbored the illusion that the war would be short never expecting the stagnet ordeal and slaughter that awaited them and millions of their fellows.We see England, Germany, France, Russia and tiny Belgum all struggling with the life and death decisions that ironicly we now face today nearly 90 years later.

Ms Tuchman brings history alive and it certainly changed my opinion on the root causes of the war itself."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"I just read this book. It is a fascinating history of the beginnings of WW1 and how it almost came to be decided during the first 6 weeks of battle. The ineptitude of the Russians, the inflexibility of all those at the central commands, the stubborn delusions of the French and Germans and the craziness of it all are stunning. As much as I liked it, the book is not for everyone. Some will find that it's level of detail and attention to so many generals and decisions becomes tedious rather than fascinating. But even those who might get bogged down later on will be interested in the scene setting first chapter and all should read the paragraph at the start of a chapter following the description of German atrocities in Belgium - paragraph from a book by a Belgian philosopher/poet describing his conversion from a pacifist to a hater of Germans and his realization of what he has lost. Find this paragraph and read it if you do nothing else.

True to form, I never read it at the time.Many years later, I began having recurring nightmares of showing up at a final not having read any of the books. Somehow I decided I finally needed to read this book, long left over on my to-do list. After reading 'Guns of August', my nightmares stopped.I hated History in high school, and only took one History class in college. My initial experience equated History with date memorization. I hate memorizing.Which brings me to 'Guns of August'. Reading this book has changed my entire attitude towards History. Tuchman makes you feel like you are living the World War I era right then and there. She describes in fascinating detail how the wheels of the war-making machine, once set in motion, turned inexorably towards mass destruction and terrible loss of life. I am always amazed when an author can bring istory to life in such an engaging way, and Tuchman does just that.Since 'Guns of August', history is now my favorite subject."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"For a person such as myself who wantsto get started on catching up on trying to undestand the break out of WWI, this book along with her Proud Tower are gems.I would even recommend the Guns of August to read before the Proud Tower which I found a more complicated read. perhaps that was because I read it first.Great way to try and get your mind around the ramifications of social, political and even personal situations of the time."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"I'm sure I used to have this book and read it in the 60s, but didn't find it on my shelves, so I reordered it. It was once the classic, the bible, concerning the leadup to and breakout of WW I but, Pulitzer notwithstanding, it's not as great as it was ballyhooed. David Fromkin's book on the same period is far superior.

I must admit I never expected to like this book as much as I did. The story-telling is superb, the principal characters are vividly recreated. There's just enough about military practice and technology (of the times) to allow the reader to understand what's going on, never so much that it is a distraction. (Though wikipedia is always your friend. :) While the book does not focus on the lives of the soldiers or the civilian in the countries involved, the author deftly tours these topics without deflecting from the overall narrative.The book is a detailed, nearly day-by-day chronology of events in Great Britain, France, Germany, Belgium and Russia leading up to World War I and carrying through to early September 1914. It ends with an afterward summarizing the First Battle of the Marne and an outline of how the first six weeks of the war set up the protracted war of the next four years. I was a little disappointed that there was virtually nothing about the background or actions of Austria-Hungary, the nature of the alliance between Austria and Germany, since this was an essential part of the beginning of the war. Nevertheless, as it stands the book is a great introduction to the causes of WWI.Many of the political and military leaders of the various countries are described in very personal, even physical terms, which seemed like extraneous details - I wonder how historians feel about this style of writing. But it became apparent that personalities played an important part in the decisions that were made, and without knowing something about the temperament of the men, they would appear inexplicable.There is an extensive bibliography, though no footnotes - which is probably a good thing for the average reader."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"I've picked up quite a few books on the first and second world war, and this is definitely one of the must reads.

But in any case, start with the guns of August!!"},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"Set between events and developments leading up to it and the dreadful four year trench-stale-mate that devoured the best part of a full generation across the European continent, Guns of August narrates the very beginning of the first world war up to the battle of the Marne, the miracle of the Marne. This \\"miracle\\" signified the end of German hopes and expectations of a quick and easy win over the allied forces, and the final bankruptcy of the Schieffenplan of the German Imperial high command. Perhaps the very period of August 1914 is the true reversal of longer term historical trends up to then. Barbara Tuchmann does not fall in the intuitive trap of blaming either Germans or others for causing the war, as many did, in fact starting from official sides from the very moment of the events she narrates up to and even long after her writing. Research since Guns of August first appeared has obviously revealed many nuances to the question of how to apportion blame for the first world war; Guns of August does not preclude any of these nuances revealed later and much later.As a student I read Guns of August when I 'did' WW I in school, I re-read it with my daughter as she is 'doing' the same period now, it has not become obsolete in the least."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"This book is a highly readable account of the beginning of World War One.

Unlike most modern books on the subject, Ms.Tuchman goes into great detail on the various leaders and politics behind WWI and not the experiences of the common soldier.

I hope they are making students read this in history class as its a great history of WWI and the way of war/politics in general."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"\\"The Guns of August\\" is Barbra Tuchman's chronicle of the events leading up to the First Great War and the first month of military operations. This book was famously gifted to Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev by President Kennedy. It was an appropriate gift. World leaders in the early nineteenth century were taken up by a fierce feeling of nationalism and militarism, combined with a lack of understanding of technologies impact on the way wars are fought, and allowed themselves to be dragged into war with a tangled system of alliances anchored in hotly contested territories in the Balkans. The parallels with the Cold War are self-evident. As a tome to the changing nature of warfare and the social mindsets that add to wartime momentum, this book has permanent significance.The infamous von Schlieffen German War Plan, which called for knocking out France before Russia could mobilize forces to the eastern front, is chronicled in all its ill-fated maneuvers. For example, the plan called for marching through Belgium with a strong right wing, \\"brushing the channel with their sleeves\\" on their way to France, was meant to drag an English expeditionary force into a land battle they couldn't win. If England lost first on the ground, thought von Schlieffen, they would be forced into an early armistice and wouldn't factor in as a Naval threat later in the war. The plan didn't factor in fierce Belgium resistance or the heavy casualties inflicted on the Germans by the English victory at the Battle of Mons. Nor did it factor in the German's last-minute changes to wartime strategy due to the politics of its frontline generals.But this book isn't about how the German's got it wrong. It also chronicles the failed French counter-offensive, the incompetence of the Russian leadership, the exploits of a young Winston Churchill, English chief of the admiralty, and his failure to prevent Ottoman alliance with the Axis Powers. Tuchman takes a look at the outrageous sensibilities of pre-War military thought, the continued idealization of horse-mounted Calvary, the idea that the conflict could be wrapped in within a few months, manifest destiny and other delusions of grandeur.Today's wars are nothing like those of the early nineteenth century, but the changing face of war in the face of socio-political mindsets and evolving technology is a constant factor. Another ubiquitous feature of war is Murphy's Law--any battle plan will run amok whence executed. Reading this book you'll learn to appreciate the inability of world leaders to predict what war will be like, how it will be fought, and when it will end. \\"The Guns of August\\" is a great book. Read it."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"After reading the first chapter of this book, you'll understand why it was awarded a Pulitzer. Tuchman's writing is so rich and authoritative that you come to think she must have known everybody that she writes about. And beyond the detail in her writing, the interpretation and analysis of the events is superb and well told.My only criticism of the book is that her presentation of the actors of this drama is quite harsh and relentless. Everyone seemingly involved, except for Churchill which she doesn't seem to want to criticize, is portrayed as a band of idiots set on their own personal ambitions. I almost get the feeling that as she researched this war that she became more and more disgusted with everything and this disgust shows up in her writing throughout the book. The ineptness of the leaders is is the central theme of the book of course, and does serve as a &quot;wonderful&quot; example of how not to run a war or deal with a crisis. It's no wonder that this book was on the mind of JFK during the Cuban missile crisis."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"Bravo! This is marvelous work that animates the black-and-white world of 1914 Europe with technicolor dynamics and stunning detail. Ms. Tuchman's prose is elegant and erudite; the book is a joy to read. Like David Halberstam, Mr. Tuchman refrains from facile judgment (tempting as it is) and lets the facts (damning as they are) speak for themselves. My only complaint is that Ms. Tuchman, as she did in &quot;A Distant Mirror: The Calamitous 14th Century,&quot; assumes too great a knowledge on the part of the reader. Simple reminders of who's who, what's what and where's where would have made it all the more rewarding. Nevertheless -- 5 stars!"},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"As most of the reviewers here have noted, the book is *wonderfully* written. The Books-on-Tape version has a very good narrator (Jack Hrkach), so it's easy to listen to a full 13 cassettes by him. However, the detailed descriptions of army movements and major battles will leave you confused if you don't have access to the maps in the book or at least to an atlas.If you listen to the tapes without one or the other, long portions will be lost on you.Otherwise, a terrific reading of an exceptional book."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"I can only recommend this book to history buffs (or experts).

It's an excellent book and one that should serve a wake-up call to why wars start. Great book."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"This study of the blunders and tragedies that made up the rush to war and the first few weeks of the conflict is masterful.Tuchman uses primary sources including biographies and letters written by and about the major personalities and events of the time, comparing and contrasting them to beautifully answer the questions: how did this war start, and how close to early victory did the German alliance come?By narrowly defining her window in time to the events leading up to and the first few weeks after the start of hostilities, Tuchman is able to go into depth about the major events and key players in the drama. She does this with insight and empathy turning what for other authors is a history lesson, into a lesson in human nature and how ego and the inbreeding of the aristocracy were as much responsible for this terrible conflict as the politico-economic forces in play at the time.If I have one complaint it is that Tuchman takes her empahtic writing technique too far, attributing emotions and inner thoughts to the historical figures she describes which many times stray beyond what she could possibly interpret from the historical sources. She tries to convey not only what what these great figures did, but also what they were thinking and feeling, and this does not come across as credible so long after the fact, and with the paucity of personal sources at her disposal.This niggle aside, it is easy to see why this study and its author is a prize winner. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"In the opening scene of Barbara Tuchman's \\"The Guns of August,\\" the language and imagery are as opulent and as stirring as the funeral of England's Edward VII. In Tuchman's rendering, that particular setting of a sun not only brought together the leaders of the world, but with them the values and norms, traditions and legacies of the Old World.\\"So gorgeous was the spectacle on the May morning of 1910 when nine kings rode in the funeral of Edward VII of England that the crowd, waiting in hushed and black-clad awe, could not keep bask gasps of admiration,\\" she writes. \\"In scarlet and blue and green and purple, three by three the sovereigns rode through the palace gates, with plumed helmets, gold braid, crimson sashes, and jeweled orders flashing in the sun.\\"Compare these two beautiful and brilliant opening sentences with the book's final paragraph:\\"After the Marne the war grew and spread until it drew in the nations of both hemispheres and entangled them in a pattern of world conflict no peace treaty could dissolve,\\" Tuchman writes. \\"The Battle of the Marne was one of the decisive battles of the world not because it determined that Germany would ultimately lose or the Allies ultimately win the war but because it determined that the war would go on. There was no looking back, Joffre told the soldiers on the eve. Afterward there was no turning back. The nations were caught in a trap, a trap made during the first thirty days out of battles that failed to be decisive, a trap from which there was, and has been, no exit.\\"Gone is the triumphant tone, and what's left is resignation and disillusionment: the First War had destroyed the customs and traditions, norms and values of the Old World, and ever since humanity has been adrift in a brutal and murderous search for a New World. Gone are the parade and the pageantry, and all that remains now is a cold and hard reality.In the best literary tradition Tuchman writes with conviction and mourning, bitterness and nostalgia, satire and tragedy. With sharp stirring wit, she condemns the generals who thought themselves Gods, and who too readily sacrificed the lives of their soldiers to save their individual honor. In a world where ego dominated policy and &eacute;lan determined strategy, cruel and murderous stupidity was the only victor. There were the Germans who fought with efficiency and perversity: they could fanatically maintain their precise timetable and brilliantly organize the chaotic logistics of war, but it was their perverse devotion to their timetable that forced their first blunder, (the invasion of Belgium) a risk they thought they had to take in order to win the war but which ultimately determined that they would lose the war by bringing in Britain and offending the world. There were the French whose military code dictated that they fight stupidly and bravely. The Russians were hopelessly incompetent, and the British hopelessly cynical.This is all established and well-known, and what makes this book a classic is Tuchman's religious devotion to detail and her spiritual obsession with the written word. We can easily imagine how she transported herself back to the past, and slowly came to smell, touch, see, and hear the place, the time, and the people. We can easily see how, while writing the book, she would, in her long silent walks, in her sleep, and even among the chatter of her dinner companions, she would struggle with words, letting them form and gestate in her in a torturous tumultuous tormenting process before becoming refined and solid.\\"The Guns of August\\" is a literary masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"Sure, there are books that cover wider areas of the war. Certainly there are works that deal with niche campaigns. Indeed there are a number of books out there that give great detail of some of the personailities involved. But really, when it comes to covering the lead up to the first world war and the first couple of months of fighting... it's hard to think of anything more to say than what is contained in this deservedly award winning book. Truly magnificent research, excellent avoidance of bias, well crafted chronology and an excellent section of notes and annotations - this thing has the lot.Perhaps being from the US helped Tuchman avoid bias, perhaps she did it through an accountant like ability to winnow wheat from chaff. Or maybe she was able to somehow block all the extraneous detail out of her mind when writing this because rarely have I encountered a book that pounds the reader with interesting snippets and a preponderance of detail yet weave it into the sort of book you don't slog through, no, but the sort of book you fly through despite it being a heavy read, if you take my meaning.If ever a person asks me what book they should read to give them understanding of World War I from now on I will reply 'The Guns of August'. From this book the reader should by all means explore the rest of the conflict based on the niche areas or specific aspects that interest them. But for a primer, look no further."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"I picked up this book because Robert Kennedy, in his excellent \\"13 Days\\", said that his brother John had read it and relied on its information to make sure not to repeat some of the mistakes politicians made that precipitated World War I, notably a tendency to impute too much purposiveness and intentionality to acts that may have been due simply to miscommunication.This book's heady and enthralling prose paints naturalistic portrait of the causes and the fighting in World War I. Focuses on the personalities of the generals and lead politicians, most of whom seem by modern standards somewhat eccentric. Full of interesting details, like what it was like to be near a siege gun, how early efforts to stop the war failed, the French love of their red uniforms independent of their camouflage value, and others.There were several weaknesses, however. There were not enough maps, and what maps there were (I had an old used hardcover copy) were very hard to read due to poor printing. There were interchangeable pictures of similar-looking old generals, but none of armaments and geography, which would have been more informative. Most problematic, there was simply too much detail, it was hard often to see any clear theme being drawn, like a pointillist version of a Pollack painting. Sometimes this mass of detail became numbing and tedious.The book is a little weak on the specific dynamics of how the assassination of Ferdinand actually led to war, this is covered in about half a page.(By the way, I once read a very interesting book on the causes of World War I that argued that it was simple the enormous complexity of the railroad mobilization schedules that made the machinery of war, once started, impossible to revoke. Unfortunately, I forget the name of that book).Despite its weaknesses, there was much that was fascinating here, and I recommend it."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"the Guns of August is a classic text, which manages to explain both the political, social AND the military intricacies of the start of World War 1. It does so in language which make a very accessible historical analysis focussing more on the people than the military strategic explanations written by military people, which can become so tedious.I have been re-reading this at the same time as John Keegan's \\"The First World War\\". Keegan's work is of course as comprehensive as you would expect from this professional military historian, but it's no where as interesting for me, as a psychologist, to know exactly how many (and what numbered) battalions did what when.By comparison, Tuchman gives us the human and social background of the leaders that directed those forces; I find this much more interesting.Devastating is to read how apparantly casually (irresponsibly is a better word) this terrible confict, with its hideous consequences, was entered into by those leaders who never really experienced its practical effects themselves.A classic that will never lose its significance"},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"This classic tale of the start of World War I and the end of the European Age that preceded it stands the test of time very well. I read it when it first came out and owned a paperback copy but just wanted to have a hard cover copy for my library."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"I knew surprisingly little about The Great War, but knew that I wanted to read about it. Tuchman's account is arguably one of the more well known histories of the war so it was natural to start with hers. What I quickly realized is that this book is really only about the first month of the war, August, and some of September. At first you wonder how much could have possibly happened in such a short period of time to justify focusing a whole book on it. Tuchman did wonderfully in showing just how important the month of August was in how it effected the outcome of the war.The Great War is most certainly the last war of its kind. Meaning that it was a traditional power struggle of neighboring kingdoms and empires that pitted one another against each other. By contrast WWII was fought more in regards to one mans ideology, not too mention that technology changed how the war was fought. With The Great War we see Germany and Austria against France and Russia based off of alliances and treaties. Just as Europe was changed in the way it was governed, i.e. so many monarchies being abolished, so too was this the end to how wars were fought.Tuchman illustrates beautifully the alliances and treatises that went in to the build of to war. We understood why Germany attacked France, why Russia attacked Austria and why England joined forces with Russia and France. Belgium was the ultimate reason why Germany lost, at least in terms of the way the war was fought. As Tuchman explains it, if Germany hadn't invaded Belgium's neutrality (or Luxembourg's for that matter) then England wouldn't have been brought in to the war and their image would not have been so stained, which, by the end of the war, was the reason so many turned against Germany.Ultimately Tuchman does a fantastic job jumping from Joffre to Moltke, French to von Kluck. We understand why each general, bureaucrat and so on did what they did and the choices they made. Tuchman minutely researched the numerous memoirs, journals and biographies of the men of that war in order to tell such a round and complete tale of the war that shattered Europe as they then knew it. The only downside is that sometimes throughout the history Tuchman would sound like she was listing off too much, but it ultimately came together. I would recommend. Now I can't wait to read about the rest of the war.4.5 stars."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"There is absolutely a reason for this book to be regarded as a classic. Actually, there are lots of reasons. Tuchman's writing is informative, yet intimate. She tells you what you need to know to understand the topic at hand then goes on to supply more information that you didn't need but adds to your appreciation. All this without the book ever bogging down, unlike the war. Possibly, a big part of this is the topic she chose to cover from WWI, the first month. That was when armies marched, counter-marched and fought instead of slogging through mud for years.Tuchman covers the cuases for war in ways as good as any I've read. It's a hard topic, but she addresses it very well. Every topic in the book is covered well.This book is a must read for anyone interested in the Great War. It's also a must read to get some understanding of how the folly of man makes war more horrofic, if that's possible. It's just a good read if you're looking for something for the beach."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"This book describes one of the most incredible examples where rigidity of thinking and planning led to events spiraling totally out of control. It also demonstrates how it is a very rare occasion that the consequences of a war are anywhere close to the belief of the people that started it. Although the events of 1914 were almost a century ago, this has been demonstrated once again by the American invasion of Iraq.When Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife were assassinated at Sarajevo on June 28, 1914 no one considered it be a major crisis. When the blustering started among the leadership of the European nations, the common belief was that it would all be resolved. However, as Tuchman describes in such excellent detail the rigid nature of the plans and the fear of being preempted led everyone to the same conclusion, \\"all out war as soon as possible.\\" Personal relationships no longer mattered, most of the members of the royal families were closely related, yet that only slowed the process slightly.When the juggernaut of war started to sprout, it was also fed by the frenzy of the masses, nearly all of whom cheered lustily for war. Few stopped to question what was happening and those that did were easily brushed aside. Or in the case of the French Socialist leader Jaures, assassinated. For the moment, militaristic and nationalistic fervor swept the continent and only the blood of millions of men was able to wash it away.This book should be read and reread by any person who aspires to national leadership of a nation. I have heard that American President Kennedy had read this book and that is one of the reasons why he stayed so controlled during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Once you read it, you will understand that what appear to be simple events can be escalated by a series of mistakes, all of which would in isolation be small. The rush for war can be a powerful one and as the American presence in Iraq demonstrates once again, a miscalculation regarding a war can be a very costly thing indeed."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"Every time I read a book by the late historian Barbara Tuchman, I marvel at her ability to combine scholarship with lively, compelling prose. This is a rare combination. In \\"The Guns of August,\\" she recounts the events of the first month of World War I, which culminate in the first Battle of the Marne. I picked up the book after visiting the grave of my great uncle at the Oise-Aisne military cemetery in France; he was killed in the second Battle of the Marne, in 1918. \\"The Guns of August\\" is usually referred to as military history, and it is certainly that, with its vivid descriptions (and excellent maps) of the movement of armies. However, what Tuchman is really good at is conveying the personalities of the men who made the decisions that would shape the entire course of the war. There is the French general, Joffre, he of the punctual 10 p.m. bedtime and leisurely lunches, sitting alone under a tree contemplating the decisions which will surely determine the fate of France. There is Sir John French, the maddeningly reluctant British ally, yielding at long last to Joffre's plea for the British to take the offensive:\\"Joffre's fist crashed down on the table. 'Monsieur le Marechal, the honor of England is at stake!' At these words, Sir John French, who had been listening with 'passionate attention,' suddenly reddened. Silence fell on the company.Slowly tears came into the eyes of the British Commander in Chief and rolled down his cheeks. He struggled to say something in French and gave up. 'Damn it, I can't explain. Tell him we will do all we possibly can.'\\" (434) And so they did, at a cost they could hardly foresee.As a historian of what is now often referred to as \\"the fog of war,\\" of decisions that must be made based on incomplete or mistaken or missing information, Tuchman has no peer. Also interesting is her assessment of the impact of the German violation of Belgian neutrality and the German Army's use of the techniques of terror on civilian populations. Almost a century has passed, but her descriptions of the deliberate targeting of civilians, of hostage-taking, and of the destruction of treasured monuments of civilization, like the library at Louvain, all have exact contemporary parallels. Outside the city of Compiege, an hour north of Paris, you can visit a reproduction of the railway car that sat where the armistice was signed that brought World War I to an end. (It is also a replica of the very car Hitler used to accept the surrender of France twenty-two years later, in 1940. ) The place, and the book, like the neatly kept crosses at Oise-Aisne, a short distance away, are monuments to terrible--but not unthinkable--folly."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"If you have any interest in World War I the Guns of August is a must read. This book has been sitting on my bookshelf for years--I know this because the price on the jacket is under $20.00.

Yes, there are varied descriptions of the various August 1914 battles, but they read like a novel, are essential in understanding the futility of the War and the superficial understanding of the world that England, France, Russia, and even the United States had in 1914.Barbara Tuchman is an excellent writer--it is know accident that she won the Pulitzer Price for this book. Surprisingly, this is a quick read and the 400 pages (hard cover) go very quickly. One develops a keen understanding of the mindset of the French, English, and Germans before and during the war. Tuchman gives fair treatment to the French, English, and Germans. It is not surprising that the war aims of the Germans do not seem to differ much between WWI and WWII. . Tuchman paints a portrait of pre war Europe with its artificial entangling alliances as a powder keg ready to explode. As you read the story of the first month of the War you are struck with the overarching theme, which I think is true of most wars, that while the powers sough an early overwhelmingly decisive battle you feel the foreboding by those in the know that if timetables are not met this will be a long and stalemated conflict. August of 1914 certainly sets the stage for the remainder of 20th century history. This is a great book. I do not know why I waited so long to take it off my shelf"},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"This book is probably the best I have read this year.

La descripcion de las potencias antes del inicio de la guerra es sencilla, clara, pero no por eso menos interesante.Esta primera etapa de descripcion de la situacion fue quiza la que mas me gusto y me llevo a leer otros libros relacionados. Los capitulos relativos a los primeros combates estan bien desarrollados y a uno le permiten visualizar como seguira en el tiempo la contienda.He leido tres libros de la Sra. Tuchman y me parece que este es el mejor de todos, sin desmerecer al Zimmermann Telegram que me parecio tambien estupendo."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"A previous reviewer claims that Tuchman displayed an anti-German bias in this book, saying that &quot;[the Germans] did not murder, torture or otherwise disobey rules of warfare....&quot; Tuchman herself answers this charge in her book of essays, &quot;Practicing History&quot;:&quot;It was supposed because the Germans had not, after all, cut off the hands of Belgian babies, neither had they shot hostages nor burned Louvain.... In writing of German terrorism in Belgium of 1914, I was at pains to use only accounts by Germans themselves or in a few cases by Americans, then neutral. The most telling evidence, however, was ... the rows of gravestones in [Belgian villages, and a marker outside Senlis], each inscribed with a name and a date and the legend &quot;fusille pas les Allemands.&quot;The German accounts she mentions turn out to be, in most cases, the actual reports of the commanding generals (von Hausen, von Below, von Kluck) who ordered the reprisals, claiming always that such were necessary if regrettable reprisals for Belgian franc-tiereur activities.Sorry, doesn't look like she swallowed any propaganda. Propaganda of the sort decried by our reviewer was energetically circulated by the Allies, but Tuchman give no credance whatever to any of it. Regarding the basic charge, that the Germans shot civilians and burned towns as reprisals against civilian insurrection, the only &quot;writers&quot; I have encountered who deny them are the same crowd who deny the Holocaust on the same basis. Good company, that.As for the relative merits of Tuchman and John Keegan, I can only say that this book probably will one day join the ranks of Gibbon, Macaulay, Syme, and the other great &quot;literature of the real&quot;, and will be read with pleasure and edification long after the tepid and torpid efforts of Keegan and the other mediocrities have faded away.Jim Abraham"},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"Halfway through this very interesting account of how WWI started, I checked the publication date. 1962. As a veteran of the Cold War, it dawned on me that Ms. Tuchman's purpose in writing this book was a fear that the Great Powers of 1962, USSR and USA, would stumble upon a catalyst like the Austrian archduke's assassination in 1914, and thus start a major war that could threaten human existence with employment of nuclear weapons.Why else would she confine herself to the early stages of the war? To send this message: &quot;Don't let this happen again.&quot; One wonders if the current wags at the State Department read too much into this book when stumbling all over themselves to &quot;prevent WWIII&quot; by intervening in Bosnia. A little knowledge is a dangerous thing.When one considers the continual sales made by Western armaments companies providing more and better tools to governments the world over, one wonders if the stage is being set, perhaps in India and Pakistan, for a similar bloodletting. For those who have not studied the contemporary history, the 1980-1988 war between Iran and Iraq bore an eerie resemblance to the Western Front of 1915-1918. &quot;It&quot; can happen again, on a larger or smaller scale.Ms Tuchman's antipathy for Germans and avid Francophilia cannot overshadow her gift for telling a very complex story gracefully. I have read some of her other works and find them all engaging and informative.Serious military historians sometimes refer to Tuchman, derisively, as a &quot;pop&quot; historian. If her style induces more of the public to read about important political and military history, we need more pop historians. The history you do not read can teach you nothing. Read this one soon, it's good."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"It gives a detailed accounting of the first month of the war but it is pretty boring reading.

Ms. Tuchman carefully defines the relationships of European governments, their mutual mistrust, and their desires to dominate and eliminate the Germanic threats of conquest. She describes the opening month of the war in great detail and the underestimation that French, British, and Russian military and political leaders made of German military strength and strategy; but she also points out the changing strategy of the French leadership in eventually stopping the German advance which lead to the long 4 year struggle of trench warfare. The French armies actually did much better than most American high school textbooks give them credit. A wonderfully documented book and must read for those who desire to know the 20th Century history of Europe which still influences Europe and world politics today."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"The Guns of August by Barbara Tuchman gives an excellent overview of the first month of World War I. It is very well organized, as the book starts out with the causes of the war, then moves on to the war plans of each individual country, then explains the actions of each government during the outbreak of war and the finally on to the military campaigns. While the book does go over the Russian invasion of East Prussia, the book mostly talks about the German advance through Belgium and into France, up to the First Battle of the Marne, where the book ends.I personally find the first month of the war to be the most interesting, and I feel as though I learned a lot from this book. Tuchman writes in a style which makes it easy to read, and grabs your attention. I didn't have a hard time moving through this book. I recommend it to anyone with interest in the First World War, an often overlooked, but very important conflict."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"Very good description of the senselessness and the bloodiness of World War I. I was a little disappointed that the book didn't provide an account of the entire war -- it only focused on the beginning of the conflict. After watching War Horse, I was motivated to learn a little more about the background of WWI. This title helped in that regard."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"I had the opportunity to read the autobiography of Robert Graves (Goodbye to All That) at the same time as reading this. It helped convey the absurd aloofness of senior English officers from a junior officer's perspective - and over a greater duration of time.There is no doubt that anyone interested in WWI can glean a great deal about the start of the war and the mindset of the European powers from \\"The Guns of August\\". In the Preface, however, it is clear that the commission for the book had purpose and the author painted with facts pursuant to that purpose. A great comedy of errors in a terrible tragedy. The author does seem to spare those who would distinguish themselves later from the bitter sting of initial blunder, fear and incompetence.Generally, the English were confirmed as perfidious, the Russians as reckless and inept slavs (who made a terrible sacrifice in August for their allies) and the Germans as precise and efficient Huns, incapable of measuring their actions from any other point of view than their own myopic beliefs in their superiority in all things. This reader felt as though hunkered down with the French as they reluctantly and almost too late realized the magnitude and direction of the German onslaught. While the efficiency of troop movement and transport on the German side was lauded - the French movements were largely painted as darned lucky to have transpired at all, however, there must have been some remaining \\"elan\\" and competence as sizable movements occurred in short order throughout August, albeit over less ground.I use the word \\"paint\\". The author's palate is colored in facts, yet how the facts are used to steer the events seems apparent. It would be very interesting to see the most accosted players on both sides able to respond to how they were portrayed in this account and what considerations may not have been given in the overall said portrayal.The dedicated sea chase in the Mediterranean was a bit - and indirectly admitted to be - force fit into the story. It did allow the author to become a part of the history she described.As I re-read the above, it sounds as if I don't appreciate the work. That is not the case. I was just left wondering a bit more at the true depth of the calamity that should have easily engulfed the French and English Armies and indeed seen the German combatants home in a few months as they anticipated beforehand.An interesting note - the author does bring up a seeming interesting contradiction in the nature of the much younger, unified German nation of that time. It was confirmed for me by a prior reading of \\"The Berlin Secession...\\" having to do with even an artistic reluctance by Germans to new forms without order. Part of the German reasoning for going to war, according to the author, was the lack of acceptance for German participation in the other cultural centers - particularly Paris. It demonstrates somewhat how the Germans could not see how their structured interpretations of art and culture were possibly merely overlooked amid the avant garde changes other nations were experiencing. While resistance to change was felt initially in these established cultural centers, the Germans were new to the experiences and had great difficulty in overcoming their new nationalistic fervor. Ah... all my opinion, no doubt about that."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"This is the one of the best books on the lead up to and the opening month of the First World War.

If you are a serious reader of world war one histories then this book needs to be on your shelf.

I thoroughly enjoyed it."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"During the cuban missile crisis Kennedy was very afraid that it would start World War 3. He had just finished reading \\"The Guns of August\\". He remarked to his staff that he wished every ship Captain on the blockade could read the book. The lesson he wanted them to take note of was how the author showed that events could move faster than rational thinking and escalate a situation to a full scale war. I have read all of her books and consider her to be one of the best historians of the 20th Century. This is her best book. I would recommend reading \\"The Proud Tower\\", also by the author, before \\"Guns....\\". The \\"A Distant Mirror\\" is another favorite of mine."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"An excellent book, hard to put down and eloquently shows the amazing saga of the beginning of WWI.

Tuchman's ability to weave together the all to human story of the mistakes and blunders committed by egotistical, naive, and often downright stupid leaders, still resonates clearly today. This book should be required reading for all politicians and State Department officials."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"I thought it was a very good book but I was not completely awed by it, as many people seem to have been. It reads pretty well, and especially speeds up towards the end but sometimes I got lost in the details of various plans and maneuvers, even though I read it on the train from Paris to Strasbourg (across various battlefields of WWI), and looked at the map in front of me during the whole time. The book has a pretty strong pro-French bias, but what can one expect of something written in 1962.For its time, the book was a great breakthrough. These days, her turns of phrase about the \\"Saxons\\" and \\"hordes of invaders\\" or what not - sound a little anachronistic. Certainly, more balanced histories of WWI have long been written - one need only pick up David Stevenson's book to see the difference. But on the other hand, Tuchman's is not really a book about WWI - she does not care about long-term causes, who was to blame or who was *more* to blame, etc. She tells a great story, and the book deserves the highest praise. No wonder it's so high on the top-selling list half a century since publication.By the way, the book seems to be much better researched on the French/UK side (there is much more dynamism to the players), than on the German, much less the Russian side. The Russians in particular appear quite unrealistic, and we never hear the kind of personal stories and anecdotes from the frontline, which pervade the UK/French part of the story. All in all, happy with the book."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"This is a 5 star book squeezed into a tiny, tiny paperback. Do NOT buy this edition... the print is impossibly small...I returned it immediately.Buy a trade size edition. I couldn't see one on amazon.com and went to Border's and found it immediately."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"One reason the Schlieffen plan did not succeed in a quick victory by Germany in the Western front was because of the unexpected resistance by the Belgian government and Belgian citizens. In The Guns of August, Barbara Tuchman provides in-depth details of Germany's trek through Belgium as its armed forces sought to engulf the French fortresses that were concentrated along the common border between France and Germany. Tuchman also provides due credit to the Russian army in deflating Germany's expectations of a quick conquest. Again, she provides well-coordinated details of the battles between Germany and Russia in August of 1914. These battles came about because of Russia's quicker than expected mobilization along the Eastern front, and Tuchman makes sure to point this out.Because The Guns of August focuses on the first thirty days of the war, it provides a comprehensive description of the day-to-day events, whether they are troop movements, discourse among the top officers, or actual combat between the belligerents. One thing that stands out throughout the early part of the war is the bickering among governmental officials and army officers within each nation's armies. These quarrels, which sometimes led to the disobeying of orders, had both positive and negative effects for the respective combatants. For example, Chapter 21, \\"Von Kluck's Turn,\\" discusses the fateful decisions of German general Alexander von Kluck. Aggressive maneuvers by Kluck, who was trying to finish off the French forces, not only disrupted the coordination with other troop movements being led by some of Kluck's fellow generals, but also violated instructions from the German Supreme Headquarters. Kluck's actions allowed the French to regroup and avoid annihilation.The early chapters of The Guns of August help to explain why Europe was ripe for war. If Archduke Franz Ferdinand was not assassinated by Serbian nationalists in June of 1914, it seems that the outbreak of war would still have been just a matter of time. Many of the nations of Europe were making war plans well before June of 1914, and Tuchman does not ignore this nationalistic conduct. However, she appears to reveal Germany as the worst of the belligerents. Germany's use of twisted logic to sanctify its path through the neutral country of Belgium and the subsequent scorching of Belgium towns and villages showed Germany at its most fiendish.It probably will be helpful to keep a world atlas available as you read through The Guns of August. Maps are provided in the text, but they do not always complement very well the excellent descriptions provided by Tuchman of the various battlefronts and battle areas. Otherwise, The Guns of August holds the reader's attention very well and is very educational for anyone who would like to improve their knowledge of the First World War."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"In The Guns of August, Barbara Tuchman successfully brings to life the political climate of the early 20th century, how the great European powers of the time had been planning for war with their rivals for very nearly a century, since the end of the Napoleonic Wars. Each country had a different war plan, but all of them were more or less variations on a theme - our glorious soldiers will be mobilized, will take the field against our enemies, will crush our enemies in battle, then will march triumphantly into the enemy's capital city!Perhaps never before had belligerent nations gone to war with such hubris and ignorance of the true horrors of war. Many of the powers assumed that the upcoming war would be waged much as the Crimean War and the Franco-Prussian wars had been fought, where gallant sweeping cavaly charges would be the order of the day. The power of the machine gun and the development of accurate, rapid-firing artillery would render all previous battle tactics obsolete overnight.However, in the first month of this terrible new war, the warring generals couldn't adjust to these new facts. They kept sending thousands upon thousands of men to their deaths in the months before trench warfare became commonplace. The disastrous Battle of the Frontiers (which appears in very few history books in comparison to the Somme and Verdun) is told in heartbreaking detail on how the brightly-clad French soldiers (with their blue coats and bright red pants) marched into the muzzles of German machine guns and died, by the hundreds and thousands, because their commanding generals couldn't comprehend the new, much deadlier, face of war."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"Barbara Tuchman's novel The Guns of August is a vivid account of the events leading to, and the first month of combat in, World War 1.From the first page Tuchman's command of the subject is apparent. The story is a thoroughly researched account of history that reads like a novel, and it sucks the reader into the War just as the nations of Europe ultimately were forced to fight it.The Guns of August gives full detailed accounts of the nations involved at the beginning, France, Germany, England, Belgium, and Russia, in a comprehensive way illustrating each countries foreign policy, and there military planning as the war approached, and how they executed their strategies as the war progressed.There is not much mentioned about the involvement of Austria-Hungary, and the war on the Eastern Front is limited to a couple of chapters, as Tuchman explains in her Author's Note this information is left out because \\"The inexhaustible problem of the Balkans divides itself naturally from the rest of the war, and it seemed to me there was unity without it and the prospect of tiresome length if it were included.\\"One can find no fault with her sentiment, the prose that expresses the minds of the generals that waged war on the Western Front are not whimsical, but are instead the product of an enormous effort to research available material for the time period.The sweeping account of the German advance on French territory ends at the Marne. And Tuchman concludes by telling the reader what they already knew, that the next four years of WWI would be conducted in trench warfare, and a generation of Europeans destroyed and disillusioned.Guns of August"},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"Before purchasing this book, I was honestly worried that it would be boring and slow. I couldn't have been more wrong. It reads in the beginning like a political thriller and throughout the end like a Clancy novel. On top of this, the author's style is beautiful and the information contained within the book's pages is incredible. The background on the characters is insightful and Tuchman does a great job of briefly describing the battles, contrasting the grim opening days of World War I with past European history, while at the same time using the events of August 1914 to foreshadow the realities of the years to come, during and well after World War I. Since this isn't a narrative written from the point of view of the average soldier (like a Stephen Ambrose novel), Tuchman focuses on the big picture, but nevertheless does a great job of describing the battles from the point of view of the generals and soldiers alike. That being said, by the end of the book you will feel like you know the main characters involved in the chain of events. By far one of the most informative, fast moving, and simply one of the best books that I've ever had the pleasure of reading. It's no wonder Kennedy urged his staff to read this book during the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962. A must for any student of history or political science."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"How do wars start? This is an important question and one that historians throughout the centuries have spent exploring. In the case of WWI, this Nobel-Prize winning work by Barbara Tuchman provides a simple, concise and well-documented answer. The military leaders on both sides, Allies and Central Powers, thought they had the perfect plans for defeating the other side, and thought that if they threw enough men and arms at it from the get-go, they could convince the other side to back down within months of the first gunshots. Consequently, the political leaders of both sides believed their generals and hence played up the public chest-pounding in the spring and summer of 1914, hence providing little political room for admissions of defeat. But what happens when neither side decides to back down? The result is a 4-year bloodbath known as WWI. This is the cause of WWI. Each side laid plans that provided a clear cut way to success, but neither side laid plans that provided a clear way to a tolerable, if not honorable, defeat. So each side fought on, hoping for victory, and sacrificing everything to get it.The author, one of America's top female historians, supports her thesis with plenty of references to primary sources from the period. These include diaries of leaders, military plans, battlefield reports, etc, etc... The result is probably one of the best case studies of war published in America during the 20th century. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"This is probably one of the best books I have read in the subject of history. It was almost like reading a work of fiction with a gripping storyline. Tuchman has a gifted ability to write about history in this fashion. I truly love history however I find it hard to come across as good a book as this one. Many history books are often very dry and a real tool to read. The book is supposed to talk about the first 30 days leading up to WWI and the 30 days after WWI began. I think the scope of this book really addresses decades before (the causes leading up to WWI) and how the stage was set for years following and during the war. The book reads as if a movie is playing in the back of your mind. This book is a classic and a good read for anyone interested in history or WWI. Many other works by this author are suggested."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"Mrs. Tuchman's best known work is a wonderful study that reads like a novel. Her skills as a communicator and depth of knowledge and analysis on her subject are always keystones to her work. There are other fine books on the first world war but if you want the best and most thorough overview, you will want this one. Not only does Mrs. Tuchman cover aspects of how it began and progressed but also the general malaise that followed and continued to this very day. Nothing explains the modern world without the context of the first great war that forever changed it at the turn of the 20th century. In the end, you realize that the war solved nothing and the problems on which it was based were only irritated and not eliminated - leading to more war ever since. This is the book that I first came to appreciate Mrs. Tuchman's work and will remain one of my favorites."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"There really is no other word to describe Barbara Tuchman's great work on the beginnings of the First World War. She discusses the attitudes, strategies, politics, and just about anything else that led to this horrific conflict. The detail and understanding present in this book allows any reader to get a grasp of what was going on in the world before and into August of 1914."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"The Guns of August is a must read for those interested in World War I and modern European history. Barbara Tuchman's writing allows one to live the days again; and though the end is known the reader is lead through the intrigues, ineptness, and inabilities of the Axis and Allied leadership in dramatic fashion. I love history, and came across Barbara Tuchman by accident (I found a book of hers in a box of free books), and am now an avid reader of her works. She puts pithy comments throughout the book, (such as when she states that removing a German presence from Belgium was akin to trying to restore virginity, or that nothing was nore trying to the English crown than needing to make a quick decision) and easily transcends the many academic history books that are on the market. She does more than try to correctly decipher history; she wants to reader to live it.As a young boy I lived next to an older gentleman, who had been a German soldier in World War I. He taught me how to count and cuss in German, and had an Iron Cross hanging in his bedroom. In reading the book I could picture his youth spent in stalemated war as his friends died around him. The events of The Guns of August- the first month of the war- forever changed his life, and eventually brought him to the United States. After reading the book I wish I had the opportunity to talk with him now, but he, like those days in August of 1914, has passed on. Thankfully, Tuchman brings those days, and his youth, alive again."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"Tuchman's The Guns of August is an exceptional book that incessantly displays Tuchman's writing talents. This isn't to lessen the value of the quality of the research (which is quite well done), but her ability to leave vivid impressions on the mind are a testament to her skills in description, especially of the major historical figures in her study of the opening scenes of the First World War. This isn't a comprehensive account of the causes and events of the First World War, rather a look at how the major European powers, i.e. France, Germany, England and Russia confronted and planned for the growing crisis, who some of the major figures were, and how they failed to perceive the nature of the war to come and the toll it would exact.There are many vivid sections in the book, including the opening chapter on the gathering of European leaders on the death of Britain's King Edward VII. The growing tensions and feelings on the part of the French and German leaders is very ably discussed. One must realize the feelings that lingered in the aftermath of the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-1871; for the Germans it was a sense of incompleteness after their victory, for the French it was revenge. Maybe that's a bit too simplistic, but it gives a general sense of where nationalist sentiments were flowing. There are many topics and events left out or given scant attention. Russia isn't given a lot of attention either, but enough to give the reader a sense of the weaknesses in the Russian government and the constant fear the Germans had of their eastern borders from an invasion by the Russians. The chapter on the Eastern Front, including the battle of Tannenberg was detailed with the sense of urgency and disaster it represented.Great detail is given to the early strategies devised by the military leaders of France and Germany. The Schlieffen Plan for Germany, which planned for the German army's concentration of strength on their right flank to hug the coast of France while enveloping the French army. For France, it was believed that the best defense was a good offense. Though Germany had a greater population than France, French elan (meaning ardor or spirit) was taught as being able to overcome any statistical disadvantage they suffered. Hindsight is twenty-twenty, but this was a dangerous strategy. The German plan did indeed seem quite sound, and for a while proved successful. But the point to this is that these plans didn't take in contingencies for every factor. Tuchman discusses the influence and results of these plans with a great amount of attention.War proclamations and mobilization efforts, debates for and against war, leaders too sure or unsure of how to act in the face of the growing calamity about to claim the lives of millions of combatants and ordinary citizens are all woven into this narrative. There were acts of heroism and acts of brutality, which occurs in any war. Tuchman's book is utterly absorbing and will hold your attention throughout, as it did mine. As mentioned, her writing talents are manifest, especially when bringing out the traits and personalities of the characters involved. Is her book comprehensive and all inclusive, no, but she succeeds in describing and detailing the people, ideas and events that helped shape the war in its early stages. This book will probably be ranked as a classic on this tragic period in world history."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"The Guns of August is the fourth Barbara Tuchman book I have read and is a masterwork of historical writing. I learned in school that the Archduke Ferdinand was shot in Sarajevo and then all these countries went to war because they had secret treaties. Tuchman tells the real story from the opening chapter of the Funeral of Edward VII (with the array of kings and princes, such as have never been assembled since) through the incredible stupidity of the war planners (on all sides of the conflict) to the final days of the first month of the war. The personal and political and familial and military relationships are so clearly defined that the scenes described take on a vivid life. This is an excllent book, a great undertaking that has awakened me to the fact that war itself made a drastic and horrible turn in 1914 from which the world has not yet recovered. There had always been horror associated with war, despite the language of honor, but the technology changed and the tactics that made the massacre of civilians a shocking event that resonated around the world are now accepted procedures for all combatants, including US troops. The well of melancholy that lies beneath the military history is almost underplayed in Tuchman's treatise. But it is there and painfully real - we have yet to withdraw from the savagery that once humans could not imagine. This book is as relevant today as it was when it was written and as the story was when it happened."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"I first encountered the book when I was in the sixth grade. Most of it was beyond me at the time, but the opening chapter and the its opening paragraphs were a hook that I have never forgotten. The chapter on the Royal Navy's pursuit of the German ships \\"Goeben\\" and \\"Breslau\\" through the Mediterranean is pretty darn good as well. I write history as part of my job working for the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College, and I read and reread this book often in the hope that I can absorb some of Barbara Tuchman's style.There is more to this book, than it simply being an impressively-written book. Tuchman offers her readers a broad and well-developed survey of the opening days of World War I. It is part political, part diplomatic, part military and part naval history. Her argument that pre-existing military plans drove events and prevented diplomacy from defusing the crisis was not as original in 1962 as one might think, but she does what few other historians of this conflict does, she integrates diplomacy with strategic issues and those with operational concerns. There is even a little tactical level stuff that is quite compelling.Another rare characteristic of this book is that balance she gives to all the major players: British, French, German, and Russian. The Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman Turk Empires get less attention, but no one is perfect. To this end, she uses French and German-language source material and used Russian and Turkish sources in translation. Most historians of this war writing in English--be they American, Canadian, Australian, New Zealander or British--tend to focus on the experiences of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) the military detachment sent over to France in the early days of the war. Tuchman is an exception. Tuchman sees that the French Army was a major player and devotes considerable attention to the French perspective and does see the rationale for Plan XVII, which the French Army attempted to use to retake lost provinces. Her study is balanced and thorough. If you buy this book, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"I had a very lucky backdrop for reading this book. I brought it to read on a long hiking trip that took me from the Netherlands, across Belgium and into the north of France. Through a trick of synchronicity, I was entering Liege at the moment that I was beginning the chapter \\"Liege and Alsace\\"-- whose subject is the assault on Liege and the German Army of the Meuse.While such a reading experience greatly enhanced my understanding of the book, I do not think that the potential reader would need to be in Belgium to appreciate it. The complexity of the European political situation at the time and the tangle of alliances make World War I one of the most difficult modern events to really grasp. Tuchman builds a framework which assesses the probable root causes of the war. She also uses diagrams and clear writing to make the movement of the armies visible at an overview level.I found Guns of August to be very fair-handed and believable in its assessment of political origins of the conflict and its assignment of responsibility. Even if you do not accept all of her ideas, I believe that you will still find that the framework works well to contextualize and elucidate the events of the outbreak.The bibliography is annotated, which is very useful for choosing further reading. Additionally, this edition is bound with a foreword by Robert Massie which introduces the reader to Tuchman as a writer."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"Barbara Tuchman's account of the first two months of World War I is written in a narrative style that puts real faces (glorious as well as shady) on the individuals who are so often lost in the trenches of historical writing. One is amazed at how seemingly trivial events combined with underlying factors would, in less than a month, lead to the destruction and rebirth of the world. An entire generation of young men would be lost forever by decisions made by a few. Unlike how the war is usually portrayed, these choices were not easy ones, whether for Poincare or the Kaiser, and all parties involved slept little until the very last minute of peace. The same emotions course through the reader at every turn of the page, and the mind absorbs the history as if encountered for the first time. Barbara Tuchman is also very fair in her views of the leading characters in the unfolding drama. True, many generals were incompetent, throwing entire populations at each other in an attempt to outmaneuver the enemy and win a glorious victory in the style of Napoleon or Bismarck. However, these commanders were human, and one can empathize with the meloncholy felt by Sir French, the sense of inevitability felt by King Albert, and the crushing effect of past parental achievements on the mind of von Moltke. At times, though, one may feel that Shakespeare said it best through the mouth of Puck: \\"What fools these mortals be!\\" The many, missed opportunities for a completely different and benevolent future stings us with the same, if not greater, impact as the loss of loved ones to pure accident. This book gets as closest as possible to a real-time experience of the approach to the Great War, and quite frankly a lengthier work describing the entire war will be too exhausting. I have never read a history book as this one; more \\"strategic\\" than Stephen Ambrose but more \\"tactical\\" than Gilbert Martin. Barbara Tuchman is a truly unique writer."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"'The Guns of August\\" is a perfect example that history is about people . It recounts how the motives,policies,and personal beliefs and animosities of people precipitated the war. It is elegantly written and makes compelling reading."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"As fresh as the day it won the Pulitzer Prize 40 years ago, this is the essential primer on World War I's first, defining and tragic month. At 511 pages it is short work - the pages virtually turn themselves. Tuchman is a master of bringing the past and its characters to rich, vibrant life, and its events to edgy doubt, even though we think we know the outcomes. The main characters are cut in precise, dynamic phrasings -- Churchill, 1st Lord of the Admiralty &quot;[at 37] impossible to ignore...[with an] astonishingly accurate prediction of the future course of the fighting&quot;; Kaiser Wilhelm ranting, &quot;the dead [King] Edward is stronger than the living I!\\" French Generalissimo Joffre, who looked &quot;like Santa Claus and gave an impression of benevolence and naivete - two qualities not noticeably part of his character&quot;; British Field Marshall Sir John French, whose &quot;natural juices of courage had been invisibly drying up&quot;; General Ludendorff with a single adjutant, charging up to &quot;bang on the gates&quot; and singly accept the surrender of Liege and the Belgian troops; courageous Albert, King of the Belgians, pilot, mountaineer, devourer of books, &quot;not bourgeois, so much as bohemian royalty&quot;; Grand Duke Nicholas, 6 foot 6 with &quot;boots as tall as a horse's belly&quot;, whose wild optimism cost Russia annihilation at Tannenberg. The raucous war declaration sessions in England, France, Germany, described as if by a reporter on the scene. The ghastly battles, miscalculated inevitably, it seems, by the major players. At last, after hundreds of thousands dead in a single month, a brutal stalemate on the western front. Perhaps all was summed up in Sir Edward Grey's famous lament: &quot;the lamps are going out all over Europe; we shall not see them lit again in our lifetime.&quot; There is no better analysis or more dramatic reportage of the fateful month that would determine much of the rest of the 20th century. (Also recommended: Keegan's flawed but compelling &quot;The First World War&quot;; Massie's classic &quot;Dreadnought&quot;; and MacMillan's absorbing &quot;Paris 1919&quot;)."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"I first read this book perhaps 25 years ago. I re-read it this past week-end, and I must say that some of the historical material is a bit dated. The late Barbara Tuchman was an outstanding writer. The fast moving and lively prose of Guns of August alone make it well worth the reader's time. My biggest problem with Guns of August is the rather naive perspective of the author. The French and the Belgians come out as the obvious \\"good guys\\"; the Germans, despite Tuchman's weak attempt at being impartial are the obvious villians. But this is perfectly understandable if one looks at the generation that Tuchman represents. She was part of the Greatest Generation, as well as one of the accepted \\"intelligenstia\\". The US played key roles in the defeat of both the 2nd and 3rd Reich. It would be difficult for a non-historian like Tuchman to have taken any any politically incorrect stands. She basically took accepted \\"histories\\", added biographical and narrative detail, and used her superb narrative skills to write one of the classic non-professional histories of the 20th Century.My biggest compliant dealt with the back drop of the Schliefflen Plan. She came to the right conclusions; however, she never really understood the diplomatic-historical background of the failed offensive. Niether did she spend much time giving the reader the full flavor of European politics from 1871-1914 -especially as they pertained to France. Doing that might undermine her her narrative. Tuchman dismisses the German idea (actually, a Prussian one) of fighting a decisive battle. A little bit of research would have revealed that the Prussians since the 7 Years War believed for obvious reasons that winning a war in one single campaign was the only way for them to survive. From Clausewitz one, the Prussians used every bit of diplomacy and military preparation in order to avoid a war of attrition. Even after 1871, Germany was in no way able to fight the combined arms of both Russia and France. By 1914, these 2 nations could mobilize nearly 4 million soldiers to Germany's 2 million. Hence, the Schliefflen Plan. Schliefflen's plan was an act of desperation brought about through horrendous diplomatic errors and mis-management of the Kaiser and his Chancellors.Tuchman also never asked the really difficult question as to why the Great Britain was so willing to take sides in a war that never really involved thier interests? Belgium, a state created by the UK, had outlived its usefullness in acting as a buffer between France and Germany. Niether France nor Germany had either the will or the skill to dominate Europe in the same way that Napolean did 100 years before, or Hitler did 30 years later. However,everyone from the Tories to the liberal party (including Churchill) talked themselves into war by using dated talking points. France, due in large part to German diplomatic ineptitude, was able to game the system by getting both the UK and Russia involved in thier dreams of \\"revanche\\". Yes, the German's broke about every diplomatic protocol known to Europe by invading Belgium. But, Schliefflen and Motlke the Younger thought they had no choice. France played the Russians and British beautifully. France got its war on its own terms - but almost lost it.And finally, Tuchman's chapter covering the Battle of Tannenberg, while well written from a general point of view, leaves much to be desired from a historical one.But don't let these criticisms keep you from reading the book. It's still one of my favorite. Tuchman is at her best when following the big players and the decisions they had to make and live by. Her opening chapter detailing the funeral of King Edward in 1910 is a classic."},{"Title":"The Guns of August","review":"From its famously gorgeous first paragraph to its mournful, tragedy-laden last, Guns of August deserves every ounce of its reputation as a classic not only of beautiful writing but well rendered history. Tuchman has an eye for detail and drama, both of which pervade the book at every turn. Her descriptions of notable people are memorable, ensuring that the reader will always think of them when they think of that person. To wit:Of Leopold II: \\"Tall and imposing with his black spade beard and his aura of wickedness composed of mistresses, money, Congo cruelties, and other scandals . . .\\"Of Joffre: He \\"looked like Santa Claus and gave an impression of benevolence and naivete.\\"Of Kitchener: \\"He looked like a Victorian image of Richard the Lionhearted, except for something inscrutable behind the solemn blazing eyes.\\"Of Crown Prince William: \\"At thirty-two, the imperial scion was a narrow-chested, willowy creature with the face of a fox . . .\\"The list could go on and on.After the first chapter sets the stage with the 1910 funeral of Edward VII, Tuchman divides her narrative into three parts: Plans, Outbreak, and Battle. In Plans and Outbreak, she shifts from capital to capital -- London, Berlin, Paris, St. Petersburg, and Brussels -- and describes how the powers prepared (or didn't) for war, focusing on their plans for mobilization and, in the case of France and Germany, on their famous war plans, the Schlieffen Plan and Plan 17. Indeed, the rest of the book is essentially a study of how those two plans were executed and how, ultimately, both failed and produced the four-year-long stalemate of trenches, attrition, and death that followed August 1914.Compared with the masterful whole, nearly any flaws seem miniscule, and I almost hate to complain, especially since none changes my overall opinion of the book. But . . . I was mildly disappointed by the Outbreak part; true to her focus on the month of August, Tuchman basically ignores the month between the assassination of Franz Ferdinand and the outbreak of war. Those details are not essential to her story, but they would have given the reader a fuller understanding of exactly why it came to pass that a Balkan conflict led to Germany fighting Russia and France. And the work could have benefited from better maps, which are helpful only in gaining a general sense of events.Still, the book is a classic -- perhaps not as a historical source in the academic sense, but definitely as a well-crafted, dramatically told story . . . and also as a lesson in the follies of mankind."},{"Title":"Handing Down the Light: The Biography of Venerable Master Hsing Yun","review":"This book documents the life of one of the most influential Buddhist teachers of the 20th and 21st Centuries. Venerable Master Hsing Yun of the Fo Guang Shan (Buddha's Light Mountain) Buddhist Order, Taiwan, has been a Buddhist scholar and writer for more than 55 years. This biography documents his early struggles to survive in China during the Japanese invasion of the late 1930s, through his equally difficult times after coming to Taiwan in 1949, to the development of one of the largest and most influential Chinese Buddhist Orders in today's world.Venerable Master Hsing Yun is seen as a reformer (if not revolutionary) of Buddhism which in China had for many centuries retreated to the &quot;Mountains and Forests.&quot; Through his remarkable resolve and diligent practice, he has brought a renaissance of the essence of original Buddhism to the every day lives of today's laity. Through a system of over 200 temples world-wide and a lay-Buddhist organization (Buddha's Light International Association), millions of people in many countries have been introduced to the teachings of the Buddha. Through his innovative methods as well as compassion, he has popularized the Buddha's teachings in a realistic and practical way for both personal and social transformation. Master Hsing Yun has inspired so many people though his work to &quot;localize&quot; Buddhism for the benefit of all sentient beings. As a caring and pragmatic educator, he continues into his 75th year to be a catalyst to so many people for both personal development and service to this world. The reader will not only clearly understand the causes and conditions out of which Venerable Master Hsing Yun arose, but also the benefits he continues to offer."},{"Title":"Mathew Swain: The Deadliest Show in Town","review":"I like punchy dialogue and Mike McQuay writes some snappy bits of verbal sparring that constantly make me giggle!

Antinous drowned in the Nile while in Hadrian's entourage and the distraught Emperor subsequently deified him. Antinous (the god) remained popular until his cult was stamped out by Christianity.Royston Lambert's book, subtitled The Story of Hadrian and Antinous, is as much about the story of the story of Hadrian and Antinous than about the couple themselves. The facts left to us by ancient history are so scant that we must deduce from prejudiced &quot;secondary sources&quot; for most of what can be surmised about their lives together. Yet Lambert's exposure of the context and motivations of these secondary sources does as much or more to tell us a story as does the laying out of the bare facts.&quot;The secrets of the imperial bedchamber must for ever be denied to us, and, in view of all the hideous and speculative publicity about their love, Hadrian and Antinous are surely entitled to keep this ultimate and intimate secret.&quot; the author says. Although we can know few if any of the details of the relationship between the boy and the Caesar, Lambert gives us much about how others later saw it. This is, in my opinion, the most interesting aspect of Lambert's book. From the early Christian condemnations to the Victorian bowdlerization and rehabilitation, past historians do much to expose their own prejudices and opinions and very little to expose the imperial bedchamber. And just as all the previous commentaries have done, the present text's cool, objective style will give future generations more insight into how today's historians view pederastic behavior than into the lives of two ancient homosexual lovers. Maybe all historical works do more to comment on the times in which they are written than on the times in which they hope to comment?Beloved and God gives us a story of the last of the gods of classical times and an insight into the cultures of Greece and Rome which remain as the foundations of our own. It was worthwhile for me to learn from Lambert how much times have changed, and yet remain the same."},{"Title":"Beloved and God: The Story of Hadrian and Antinous","review":"This book adequately demonstrates that Hadrian's private sexual life and his obsession with his young lover Antinous did have an impact on policy and his public actions, particularly the establishment of Antinous as a state sponsored god, to be worshiped by the citizens of the Roman empire.Antinous was the beautiful young Greek lover of the Roman Emperor Hadrian. When Antinous, around age 20, was accidentally drowned on the Nile, the 54 year old Hadrian was devasted and his grief changed the Empire. There is some evidence to indicate that Hadrian and Antinous had a 9 year acquatance before Antinous' death. We are unsure if the relationship was sexual in the beginning when Antinous was a child of 11. Other evidence would indicate that he gradually rose to prominence in the Imperial household and became the lover of the Emperor in the final two years of his short life. There are some descriptions of the couple that would indicate Antinous's maturity beyond his years and his calming wise personality brought relief to the restless personality of Hadrian. There is also some evidence that they shared spiritual beliefs and together joined a mystery cult. Hadrian established a cult around Antinous that spread throughout the Mediterranean. There were at least 40 cities with evidence of worship and cults to this state sponsored god. There is some evidence that the cult of Antinous and the cults of Dionysos and Hermes are overlapping since both were named the gods of farm animals, fertility and crops. Sculptors created statues of male adolescent beauty in honor of Antinous, which established the canon of adolescent perfection for many years in the classical world.Hadrian was an amazing fellow. In his later years he lived at Tivoli in a fantasy village containing replicas of the great landmarks of the empire. He was surrounded by multiple images of his deceased lover.There is some belief that Antinous was a human sacrifice of some kind to appease the gods or to benefit Hadrian. Handrian himself denied this to be true in his later years. Others believe he was a slave boy. This is certainly false since Rome was built on slave labor and to raise a slave to god status would have been totally beyond the economic and class structures of Rome. Reports that Antinous was a castrated eunich are also to be questioned since the statues all indicate fully developed muscular male beauty and Hadrian outlawed castration of slaves. Some records indicate Hadrian wrote erotic poetry to Antinous but none survives.Also remember that the cult of Antinous was a competitor with early Christianity. With very few exceptions, writing about the relationship between Antinous and Hadrian are not homophobic with the exception of early Christian writings which were scandalized by the religious cult established by the Emperor in honor of his lover. The festivities around the cult of Antinous supposedly endorsed homosexual orgies. This book is very well researched and documented and certianly is broad reaching and thorough. I would suggest however Marguerite Yourcenar's Memoirs of Hadrian as a companion book. Hadrian become Emperor at 41, mature and wise to the ways of worldly power. He beame emperor after his Spanish cousin, Trajan, a major character in Yourcenar's Memoirs. Trajan, a childless but happily married man, never showed favoritism to Hadrian and never acknowledged him as his successor. This may have save Hadrian's life and character since he was supposed not favored above others in his military career. his political skills increased as the speech writer for his cousin Trajan. Hadrian quickly consolidated power when Trajan died of a stroke in Syria. He wore a short beard, the first of the Emperors to do so but a style followed by all the others. Twice assassination attempts were made on his life. Hadrian ws known for never forgetting the names of men who served with him in the military and was known to bathe and eat alongside common soldiers. There was never a hint of a military takeover during his reign.Much like Elizabeth I, he kept his own council, never really trusting those around him. He married Sabina but all indications would indicate this was a marriage of convenience. He respected the Senators but retained the lion's share of power.Hadrian was known for his many state trips and spent half of his reign outside of Rome. Of the 44 provinces making up the Empire, he visited 38. He died at age 62 atter ruling Rome for 21 years. Lambert has written a good book, speculating sometimes but sticking to the skimpy facts most of the time. The nature of this Imperial homosexual relationship remains a mystery in many ways. The fact that a gay Emperor ruled Rome at the height of power and world dominance, was able to establish a religious cult to his beautiful young deceased lover, and have very little negatively reflected in the surviving texts is testimony that homophobia need not always infect a society."},{"Title":"Beloved and God: The Story of Hadrian and Antinous","review":"I really liked this book since it illustrated a little known (at least to the general reader) story of Hadrian and Antinous and examined the evidence in a convincing manner. While some of the art history may be a little dry, the author wisely saves this material for last.

It is the ethereal beauty of Antinous reaching from the past to dazzle our eyes!Oh how I wish it didn't end like it did. Oh how I wish I hadn't learned of this love! Oh how I wish my eyes hadn't beheld the beauty of Antinous.But we in modern times are richer for the knowledge of love it gives us.

The authors are not always objective. They belittle writings which other people might find valuable.A student of the Japanese language might profit from Ueda's list of 16 ways to avoid saying no. In 1954, McCarthy arrived at statistics regarding how many words are known by the average child at each age.

The book provides a complete theoretical review on the development of second language learning and teaching. The authors discuss why it is easier for some and more difficult for others to learn another language. They organize the book based on five factors that they consider will make up the frame of second-language learning. These factors are language, brain, mind, self, and culture and are innate in those learning a second language. The authors explain how experiences may differ for every one and that the significance of a second language may depend on who is acquiring/learning the second language and what second language is being learned. The author's closing arguments are very optimistic for those who are in the process of learning a second language and those who have failed in the past and wish to give learning a second language another try. In page 206 of their book, Bialystok and Hakuta state, \\"There are no absolute barriers to second-language acquisition\\", thus, they encourage educators to consider using a variety of teaching technique to fulfill the needs and desires of the learners because no single correct approach is sufficient by itself to achieve language proficiency. The book covers a lot of material in a small space, is well written, interesting - and even entertaining. It provides a needed background for beginning language teachers and tutors at all levels.CriticismsIt focuses too narrowly on oral/aural learning. It pays lip service to learning to read/write in a phonemic language but has nothing to say about ideographic languages (pictographic and logographic).There is a major deficiency in its oral/aural section - it only touches on poetry and song - and tonal languages.

There's a relentless federal marshal hounding him and two deranged Virginia man hunters whose favorite prey is human. But Partridge's most desperate enemy might be his sadistic, homicidal father. Things are about to get ugly in Dead Creek...\\"...A bleak and moody novel that amply showcases Curran's love of genre fiction and also his understanding of the dark side of human nature. In Curran's skilled hands, Grim Riders becomes more than a traditional western, seamlessly incorporating the flavor of darker genres, and bringing to mind in a cinematic sense, the best of Spaghetti Westerns and even to a degree, the complex moral challenges of classic Kurosawa samurai tales. Thought-provoking and wildly entertaining throughout, Grim Riders is genre fiction at its best. Not to be missed.\\"--Greg F. Gifune, author of Night Work and The Bleeding Season\\"...Curran recreates the old West as it most probably was, but we're too ashamed to admit. Characters that reach up out of the pages, stinking of sweat, gunsmoke and liquor and punch you in the face as you read. Action which will have you sweating, fingers rigid on the pages, a storyline so compelling your eyeballs will feel like frigid marbles in your skull you've been staring at the pages so long. Such is the power, the lividness of Tim's writing. Grim Riders will create in you a love for the western genre, it's fresh, harsh, tragic, brutal at times, but always entertaining, simply astonishing fiction. All I can say is: Tim, give me more!\\"--James R. Cain, editor Dark Animus Magazine"},{"Title":"Captain Marryat: Seaman, Writer, and Adventurer","review":"This thoroughly enjoyable biography has only one drawback - its brevity. Though Marryat is largely known at present as a children's writer, his reputation in his own time rested on a series of adventure novels for adults based on his own very exciting career - he can fairly be claimed to have single-handedly invented the genre of naval fiction and to have set the pattern for Forrester, Kent, Pope and O'Brien. His own life - though cut off relatively early - was as exciting and varied as anything in his fiction: starting with near suicidal action under the legendary Cochrane, at sea almost constantly in the later years of the Napoleonic Wars in opposition to the French and Americans, returning home to develop a signalling system and commence a literary career and later returning to action in Burma, his service there involving the Royal Navy's first use of steamships in action and initiating the decline of the sailing navy in which Marryat had grown up. Marryat seems to have had a natural affinity for action - as a literary lion touring the United States in the 1830s he took time out to help put down a rebellion in Canada, and was once prosecuted for brawling in the streets of London - and his zest for life comes across well in Mr.Pocock's biography. Until Dickens arrived on the scene he was the foremost popular novelist in Britain, and even thereafter was a prominent figure in London literary circles - as he had been at Court earlier. He carried a raffish air of the Napoleonic and Regency periods into the growing respectability of early Victorian society and the account provided here of his discovery by an irate husband in an American lady's hotel room, and of the ingenious manner in which he appears to have extricated himself, hints at even more scandalous events that can only now be guessed at. Throughout the book Marryat comes across as a larger than life character who must have been a delight (and an exasperation) to know and a good man to have by one's side in a tight corner. One regrets however that this biography does not dwell more on the quality and content of Marryat's literary output and provide a better guide to the reader who would like to explore it further. This, and the brevity, aside, this is a most enjoyable book and can be highly recommended to anybody interested in the age of fighting sail, the advent of steam or the early Victorian literary scene."},{"Title":"Captain Marryat: Seaman, Writer, and Adventurer","review":"Every biography, if not of the encyclopedic type, has some profile, an outline of goals the author wants to reach. Often it is necessary to limit the scope of work, because there are other vast volumes on topic already written, and at the same time the topic allows for specialization. Unfortunately, the book by Tom Pocock does not venture in any kind of specialization, and instead, on less than 200 pages it attempts to present a uniform portrait of Captain Frederick Marryat. As the title suggests, an attempt is made to cover his literary heritage, his enormous seafaring experience, his political and military engagement, and of course worldwide travels. My disappointment is unbounded, really, and let me argue why this is the case.To start with the most serious source of incompleteness of this volume, let me say that it does not offer any insight into the literary heritage of Captain Marryat whatsoever. From time to time, the author mentions that at this or that point in Marryat's life he was writing, published, or tried to publish this or that novel or a diary. Merely a line or two at most is devoted to the subject. For all it is worth, the whole content on literature is limited to one page in total. At the end of the book there is a list of the books written by this ingenious man. Pocock does not add anything worth writing home about about these books. I can't doubt that he read them, but if he did, he didn't show it. And this in the light of the fact that Marryat was the most popular writer in Europe of the 1830s! Marryat influenced many noble authors, starting with Melville and Conrad-Korzeniowski and ending with contemporary nautical fiction writers like Pat O'Brien, not to mention his indirect influence on anyone who has tried his pen in the field of adventure, maritime or not. Marryat and Dickens were great friends who supported and consulted each other in the time their lives overlapped, and the biographer merely focuses on the sociopolitical aspect of this friendship, as if he was not aware of profound literary influences which flowed both ways, and spread like an eagle over the whole Continent of writers, not to mention America. I hoped, in vain, to learn more than I had known beforehand about the connections between writers, Melville, Verne and Conrad-Korzeniowski in particular; I hoped to receive at least minimal treatment and analysis of the particular works of Marryat. I got none. The man basically gave birth to nautical fiction as we know it today, he created several immortal literary archetypes, he had a unique perspective of a naval officer, a writer and a brilliant social observer, and his diaries from travels to America and Canada deserved analysis &quot;deeper&quot; than just a brief quote or two. He wrote about children, about animals, and finally, in his literature of adventure as it was, he incorporated a wide array of themes, ranging from horror, mythology and magic to heavyweight topics of religion, the Holy Inquisition, warfare, exploration and competition. The potential reader of this volume should give up any such hopes. This book offers nothing of the kind.Apart from writing, Marryat was a politically and socially active man, and even here the book fails, despite some coherent efforts on part of the author. In a dry style of a scribble, the biographer merely notes the events, as they came, only occasionally venturing into some analysis of what happened or did not happen and why. The biographer wrote other volumes, including books on Nelson, and I couldn't get rid of the impression that in the case of this book he simply recycled an old formula, and tried to fit an Alpha and Omega of a man like Marryat into a narrowly defined scheme. This couldn't have worked, and it didn't. Complete chunks of Marryat's lifetime were ignored in this way, while others were overblown out of proportion. Indeed, decency is a lost art on the part of the biographer, as the following fact indicates in light of what I have written about so far and what I chose to be silent about out of empathy. In at least two instances, if I remember well, Tom Pocock writes a small essay on the fact that one of his own ancestors knew Marryat, and desperately tries to input some meaning into the oh-so-distant relationship between the two men. Marryat, if asked, wouldn't remember the ancestor in question, but we are show otherwise. This is simply scandalous. To ignore half of Marryat's life in order to make space for this? Excuse me? This biography is outrageous, and although if you know nothing on the subject, it will be of some use, dishonest as it is, at the same time it is a complete waste of money otherwise."},{"Title":"Instrumentation for the Operating Room: A Photographic Manual, 6e (Instrumentation for the Operating Room ( Brooks-T))","review":"This book is wonderful. I am currently going through a Surgical Technologist program and need to know the instruments used in the Operating Room. It splits the instruments out into specialties and gives wonderful pictures. The instruments that look alike, they give close up pictures of the tips to show the difference. The only problem is that the book uses the official name of instruments. However, around here, some of those names are different, however, the close up pictures help to clear up the issue.

The rich, detailed background of vengeful gods and venerable seers gives this brilliant version of the ancient myth a living realism."},{"Title":"The Lion in the Gateway: The Heroic Battles of the Greeks and Persians at Marathon, Salamis, and Thermopylae","review":"SOMEONE, PLEASE REPRINT THIS BOOK!!!!This is a wonderful retelling of a fascinating period in history. The writer was immersed in the study of this time period, as evidenced by her works. The writing is engaging and this is the best account of the Persian Wars for children, grades 4-9 or so. It surpasses Alfred Church's book, The Story of the Persian War."},{"Title":"The Lion in the Gateway: The Heroic Battles of the Greeks and Persians at Marathon, Salamis, and Thermopylae","review":"I read this book when I was in middle school and I just read it again as an adult. It is truly, truly wonderful, taking you right back to this incredible epic struggle of the Greeks against the Persian invaders. There's so much history, so much culture, so much atmosphere in this book. Mary Renault brings these great people to life, in a direct and accessible way. And best of all, she shows us why this story is important, how our own culture, our own ideas of freedom, reason, and democracy came from that flowering of Greece so long ago, and how these ideas were forged and hardened in the battles against the Persians."},{"Title":"The Lion in the Gateway: The Heroic Battles of the Greeks and Persians at Marathon, Salamis, and Thermopylae","review":"Mary Renault has written superb historic novels which I have very much enjoyed. She is clearly a wonderful author. But be aware that \\"The Lion in the Gateway\\" was written for children 10 years and up. In that regard I am sure it is exceptional. However, the small fact that it was written for children was not mentioned on the item page. I purchased this book thinking it must be one of her novels (for adults). As they say, \\"my bad.\\" I would highly recommend this book for a 10-13 year old. It is the perfect way to introduce the vibrant importance of the ancient Greek world to a young mind. Ms Renault is well-known for the historic accuracy in her writings and she is a highly readable author I deeply respect."},{"Title":"The Lion in the Gateway: The Heroic Battles of the Greeks and Persians at Marathon, Salamis, and Thermopylae","review":"This is a great book! I originally found it in a library and checked it out for my son who was a third grade. I'd read it aloud to him and he loved the stories. Later he read it himself, and he has now developed a very strong love of history; especially ancient history. Since then, sadly it has disappeared from most libraries.

I usually can't get through history literature, but this one was SO interesting! The different people were described in such a relatable manner. I've never read a history book so well-written, that was also intended for a student learner, and doesn't talk down to the reader or pontificate to make the writer sound more intelligent. On the last page, before the historical notes, Ms. Renault explains how the Greeks' choices during the Persian Wars relates to our way of thinking. I was really impressed by how well Renault draws the reader into the motivations and values of these people from thousands of years ago. This is also my first military book and I look forward to reading more of Renault's work."},{"Title":"The Lion in the Gateway: The Heroic Battles of the Greeks and Persians at Marathon, Salamis, and Thermopylae","review":"The book is difficult to find, but this vendor had it and delivered it sooner than expected.

Set during the early years of World War II when the Japanese army was pounding the Burma Road, &quot;The Promise&quot; relates the story of a brave division of Chinese who have been sent on a suicide mission to rescue the remnants of an Anglo-American force trapped in Burma. There are a couple of telling portraits of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and his wife that show them in all their venality; their remoteness from the individual masses of Chinese arouses more contempt than admiration. What really affects the reader is the disdain of the Anglo soldiers toward the Chinese who attempt to rescue them and whom, in their desperation to escape from the Japanese, they abandon to their fate, cutting off their retreat and leaving them to save themselves. The open contempt the English express towards the native Burmese (&quot;We own this country, after all; it's part of our Empire&quot;), and their genuine puzzlement when the Chinese confront them about their attitudes, shows up all too clearly their inherent sense of superiority which is based on nothing but a blind ethnocentricism. Buck's sympathies clearly lie with the valiant Chinese who are seething under a viciously brutal Japanese occupation and longing for freedom, but not at the price of European domination. We don't get to know her characters in &quot;The Promise&quot; as intimately as in some of her other books, but we admire them none the less for their courage and their self-sacrifice. &quot;The Promise&quot; is not on a par with &quot;The Good Earth&quot; or &quot;The Three Daughters of Madame Liang&quot;, but it's definitely a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"The promise,","review":"If you read Dragon Seed, the prequel to this book, you will know that you read this book because you couldn't live with the ending that was given! So you read this book and it continues to provide more historical information and answer some of those questions that you had from the last book. However, by the time this book ends, you seem to have more questions than before. I won't spoil it for you, but I was thinking that perhaps the title might explain all unanswered questions simutaneously! Also, the book tends to become a little boring at some parts. Yet every second of boredom is compensated for by later events of extreme excitement. Doubtlessly though, it is a GREAT book and a fine sequel, though more could have been done with the plot. Read it!"},{"Title":"The promise,","review":"I have always enjoyed reading Pearl Buck and hunt for books I haven't read yet.

Sheng and Mayli's love is put on hold yet again as they sacrifice all in order to fulfill their duty to their country. How can they enjoy happiness when all around them are struggling just to survive? When the orders are given by the Chairman that the best of the Chinese soldiers are to be sent to Burma to rescue the British and American troops trapped there, they all know that this is a suicidal mission. The outcome will not be good but the loyal soldiers go anyway, determined to give their all for China. Sheng, the favorite of the Chinese General is to lead his men on the march to Burma, and then into battle against the Japanese; Mayli, whom Sheng loves, is going also, in charge of the nurses who will care for the dying and wounded--but neither knows that they will both be involved in the same battle. The hopeless situation they both find themselves in, the struggle to survive in a jungle environment, and ultimately trying to determine what is best to do when all is lost and only a handful have remained alive is a story of courage and determination that few are willing to sacrifice for. You will have to read the story to discover how loyalty and love gives one strength they did not know they possessed.If you love the writing of Pearl S.

ENJOY"},{"Title":"A Reconstructed Corpse","review":"I tried this based on my enjoyment of a short story by Mr. Brett in an omnibus of mystery stories. The writing style is quite breezy and readable, a good summer book. But the characters, with only a couple of exceptions, are not particularly likeable and the plot is very unlikely. This is not in the league of a Morse mystery - it's more of a British Columbo, only without giving away the mystery in the frist act.A fun read, but not a great read."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I just recently went through a really rough break up and a friend of mine suggested that I read this book to start working on getting over it. It is a beautifully written book and the story is not at all predictable. It twists and turns and the whole time you find yourself on the edge of your seat, not able to put the book down untill you find out what is going to happen between Anne and Mr. Wentworth... will they see eachother? Will they speak? The characters are all very clear, and all very different. There's the annoying \\" it's all about her\\" sister, the well to do Friend, the loner bookworm, the bitter widow, the scheming cousin, each character is unique. Anne is polite and loveable. Everyone loves her and you will too. In the end, this beautiful love story gives a single girl like me hope that there is that perfect someone out there for me, but you don't have to be going through a loss to love this book. Everyone should read it.

Anne is much older than any other Austen heroine (she is 28 by the end of the book), but that difference in age has made her more wise, thoughtful, intelligent, and sensitive. She has known the pain of disappointed love, and has lived through it. She didn't \\"die of a broken heart\\" or anything like that. She suffered, learned from it, and managed to come out the other side with her senses intact.Like all Austen heroines, there is nothing sentimental about her or her romance with Captain Wentworth. In fact, their interactions with each other, after an absence of eight years, illustrate how very realistic the story is. Wentworth is angry and resentful, and uses the young, spirited Louisa Musgrove to make Anne see that she has no power over him, even to make her jealous. Most of us have had similar experiences with ex-boyfriends or ex-girlfriends. The book is completely relevant to the lives of modern readers, which is the very thing that keeps Jane Austen fresh after all these years.Persuasion is also supremely entertaining, with delightful and hilariously vapid characters, such as the vain Sir Walter Elliot, the conniving William Elliot, the the petulant and constantly ill-used Mary Musgrove, and the scheming Mrs. Clay. Any fan of Austen will already have read this book, but any beginner Austen fan, or someone who has not yet ventured to try Austen yet, but is curious, should read this book."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I bought this for my kindle..50 cents! Goodness I am almost ashamed. Sick with a cold, I read it almost straight through. Don't know how I missed this before. It is a joy. So much better than much of what is put out today."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"\\"Persuasion\\" is a novel written by Jane Austen during the Regency Period in England. It was a time where single women were not allowed to be left unchaperoned with a gentleman. A time where people wouldn't dare say impolite things to others, and marriage was a way to improve your wealth, circumstance, and station.This is one of the 6 completed novels written by Jane Austen, while this one isn't as popular and famous as \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" that does not mean it is without merit or any less worthy of praise. If you found yourself liking the movie or book \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" you should give this one a try.Our herione \\"Anne Elliot\\" is the middle daughter out of three. Her mother died when she was young, her father is a silly, vain, and selfish man who spent so much money they are now facing financial troubles. They live in a lovely home called \\"Kellylynch Hall\\" which they must leave to find cheaper lodgings. Now they rent their home out to this couple (Admiral and Mrs. Croft) and take up residence in Bath.Anne is an admirable heroine. One with much sense, honesty, and simplicity. Her two other siblings are not so worthy, her oldest sister takes after their father, selfish, vain, alway self-promoting. Her younger sister is already married with children and very needy. She is also very selfish and a little bit of a hypochondriat.Now when Anne's family leaves for Bath she does not go with them, instead she stays close to their family home while staying with her younger sister. Here Anne is able to live without the shadow of her family, make acquaintances, and be of much usefullness towards everyone. She soon meets up with Captain Wentworth, who proposed to her eight and half years ago and was rejected. Anne did not reject him because she did not love him, she was persuaded by her family. What will they do now seeing each other again after eight and a half years?Overall the story was a very intersting read, you grew very interested in all the characters and their personalities as you always do when you read Jane Austen. It is one of her shorter books around 250 pages. The beginning is the only hard part to read, you might lose interest there but keeping reading it gets better real soon."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I have to admit I am a Jane Austen addict. I just can't help but enjoy her witty dialog set in old English times. Sometimes I wish we talked more like they did. I feel like she just takes me back to a time long past, but very much alive and rich. This is the fourth book I have read of hers, and I loved it just as much as the others. I highly recommend reading it."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Persuasion is a small novel, but it is Jane Austen at her best. Her commentary on the English gentry and the restrictions of \\"society\\" are well presented in this story of Anne who was once persuaded not to marry a man with no prospects and no station in life, at least compared to hers as the daughter of a baronet. Jane Austen proves there can be passion without being graphic. A great lvoe story!"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This book answered a lot of questions that came up after I saw the movie i.e. what's with Mrs. Clay and the young Mr. Elliot? A must read if you really want to understand the movie."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I finally got around to reading this lovely novel by the infamous Jane Austen. It was written in her middle age and published posthumously. Slightly shorter and less intense than Pride and Prejudice, Persuasion is still detailed and enjoyable, full of Austen's trademark wit, deft dialogue, and insight into human nature.The protagonist is Anne Elliot, the twenty-seven-year-old daughter of a baronet. Like other Austen heroines, Anne shares little sympathy or similarity with her family members. Her one romantic attachment is over half a decade old - she was engaged to a naval officer whom her friends disapproved of. At the beginning of the novel, Anne goes to stay with her married younger sister. Her father and older sister have been forced to give up their family home because of their spendthrift habits. Captain Wentworth, Anne's former fiance, reappears in her life, and Anne is forced to learn to interact with him in a polite and detached way. She must watch him pursue others, and decide how to respond to her own suitors.The entire novel is engaging and good, though at times I found Anne almost too calm a heroine. I absolutely loved the climax of the story, near the ending. It is so sweet and surprising. Persuasion is not to be passed over by a Jane Austen fan, or anyone who likes an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Anyone who enjoys reading Jane Austen, will be very please with this book. After reading it, you will find yourself still thinking about it and enjoying it's memories."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This is my second favorite of Austins books. It starts out very slow, but once you get into the story, it is splendid."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Persuasion is the 6th published novel by Jane Austen. Anne Elliott is a sweet 27-year-old woman of good breeding and integrity. She is intelligent, thoughtful, considerate. This may come as a surprise, given that, after losing her mother at 14, she has been encumbered with a father, Sir Walter Elliot, and an older sister, Miss Elizabeth, who are both vain spendthrifts and find her inconsequential; both of whom are blind to the fact that Elizabeth's poorer \\"friend\\", the fawning Mrs Clay, is intent on marrying Sir Walter to become Lady Elliot. Her younger, married sister, Mary is selfish and self-centred. The only person in her life who cares about her at all is a friend of her mother's, Lady Russell, who, when Anne was nineteen, persuaded her not to accept the offer of sailor Frederick Wentworth, as he had no position. Lady Russell tries to persuade Anne, when her estranged cousin, William, heir to the Elliot estate, reappears, that it would be prudent to accept his offer. But Anne is suspicious of his change of attitude. This is the last full novel written by Jane Austen, probably her most mature novel, and it is a great pity she died not long after this novel was completed. This novel has intrigue and humour and, of course, romance. Truly enjoyable."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"My Thoughts:Persuasion is one of my favorite movie adaptations in the world. I could watch the Masterpiece Theater version over and over without getting sick of it. That's how much I love it. Since I had never read a Jane Austen book before, I decided to go with that one for my Summer Romance Challenge. I have to admit it was not easy at first. The very beginning with the details on the family and friends of the family was a struggle to get through. I think the reason why is because I know the story so well from the movie. Once more dialogue came about, it became very enjoyable.Anne Elliot was once engaged to Frederick Wentworth when she was very young. Since her friend Lady Russell didn't approve of the match, she persuaded Anne to break off the engagement. Fast forward eight years later. Anne's father Sir Walter and sister Elizabeth have nearly brought the family to bankruptcy. They have to let the house to someone while they get things back to where it should be financially. The person who takes up residency is Admiral and Mrs. Croft. And guess who happens to be the brother of Mrs. Croft? You guessed it--Frederick, now Captain Wentworth.So now Anne is forced into being around him often, watching him from afar, imagining him as not wanting anything to do with her. Especially when it seems he is preferring the company of another. As time goes on, he gets to see a different side of her, how selfless she is. And when it seems he is attentive to her, Mr. Elliot, her cousin, seems to be very interested in Anne. But where does Anne stand? Does she have a chance with Frederick again?Like I said, this is one of my favorite movie adaptations. Reading the book was like icing on the cake, completely put it all into perspective, getting into the mind of the characters. Jane Austen really is an amazing author. I wish I hadn't taken so long to read one of her novels. Definitely one of the best classics I've read so far.My Rating:Very Good... Stay up late"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This is only the second Jane Austen book I have read, having read Pride and Prejudice some time ago. It took me a little while to get into it. The early chapters feel like they get bogged down in bringing us up to date with the back story. However it's worth persevering as the book gets much easier to read as it develops. Jane Austen's observations on society of that time and the way that she captures the feelings of the protagonists feel so fresh and modern that at times it is hard to believe that the book was written almost 200 years ago.The heroine is Anne Elliott, the middle daughter of Sir Walter Elliott: a vain and snobbish man who has been living beyond his means for some time. For financial reasons he decides to rent out his family home, Kellynch Hall, and moves to Bath with his oldest daughter who shares his obsession with status and appearances. Anne goes to stay for a time with her younger sister, Mary, who is married and lives nearby. Anne is easily the most likeable of the three girls, but is still single at the age of 27. Several years ago she met the love of her life, Captain Wentworth, but she was \\"persuaded\\" by her friends and family that he was not an appropriate match for her. She has never forgotten him.As it happens, Captain Wentworth comes back into her life, as it is his sister who has hired Kellynch Hall. However he appears to no longer have any interest in Anne and spends his time with the daughters of Mary's husband's family. In the meantime a new suitor has come into Anne's life, being her father's probable heir. He is pleasant and polite and certainly a good catch - but she finds it hard to let her feelings for Captain Wentworth go. When she finally realises who she is meant to be with, the book feels as alive and the romance as intense as any chicklit novel you might read today.I read the Brandywine edition of the book. The font size is quite small and densely packed. I probably would have preferred to read another version with an easier layout to read."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This book may be pure fantasy, but it is my favorite Jane Austen novel.

Austen has an uncanny ability to create characters who are so petty and unlikable that one simply wants to put the book down, for lack of someone with sense. This problem, for me, brings Northanger Abbey to its knees, and weighs down Persuasion for the first seventy pages. It's a while before we get to be inside Anne Elliot's head, and in the meantime we must satisfy ourselves with her imbecilic, preening father and his protegee daughter, Elizabeth. But finally, we get to Anne Elliot and Captain Wentworth, to marriage intrigue and the questioning of glances and motives--all of the things for which one absolutely loves Austen. This book provides the goods, so don't give up on it too early.Persuasion is it's own creature, however. I was immediately struck by the difference in style from her earlier book Pride and Prejudice; in Persuasion, Austen strings together dependent clauses as though the story desperately required the reader to be in suspense as to what verb she will next employ. Take, for instance, the reader's first impression of Bath:\\"They were come too late in the year for any amusement or variety which Lyme, as a public place, might offer; the rooms were shut up, the lodgers almost all gone, scarcely any family but of the residents left; and, as there is nothing to admire in the buildings themselves, the remarkable situation of the town, the principal street almost hurrying into the water, the walk to the Cobb, skirting round the pleasant little bay, which, in the season, is animated with bathing machines and company; the Cobb itself, its old wonders and new improvements, with the very beautiful line of cliffs stretching out to the east of the town, are what the stranger's eye will seek; and a very strange stranger it must be, who does not see charms in the immediate environs of Lyme, to make him wish to know it better.\\"Some will take pleasure in reading these lines, but I personally think they do her no credit. At its best, her prose style is lucid, and suffused with that clean, English wit we expect. That being said, I find Austen more charming than aesthetically stunning, and to my tastes, her simplicity of style adds to that charm. Her convolutions detract from it.This issue was exacerbated by the decision of the editor, Gillian Beer, to not standardize punctuation. Austen has a tendency to interrupt an otherwise complete clause with a comma, which is off-putting to modern readers and detracts from her otherwise fluid style. Likewise, there has been no attempt to regulate her use of the semicolon, which 19th century authors used with abandon. Beer might argue that these editorial decisions might affect interpretation, but I never noticed a moment when emphasis might depend upon an otherwise superfluous comma. Furthermore, if there had been any instance where punctuation greatly affected meaning, I think Beer would have mentioned it in her notes--she was so very thorough. Incidentally, this lack of editorial judiciousness brings me to my final contention with the edition.While there are different opinions as to the proper domain of footnotes, I believe they exist for only a few purposes. 1.) They should explain historical and cultural references that may otherwise be outside the reader's ken. 2.) They should explain a historical use of a word that a modern reader may otherwise not know. 3.) They should give manuscript variations, when applicable. They should not (in my opinion) explain turns of phrase, or help the reader interpret the plot, or offer critiques of the novel. My reasoning is that these three tasks belong to the reader; for an editor to do all the heavy lifting actually detracts from the pleasure of reading the book. For instance, when Mr. Elliot implies that he would like to marry Anne, he says,\\"The name of Anne Elliot,\\" said he, \\"has long had an interesting sound to me. Very long has it possessed a charm over my fancy; and, if I dared, I would breathe my wishes that the name might never change.\\"To this excellent, shining line of dialogue, Beer graciously provides a footnote: \\"An oblique proposal: her name and his are the same, Elliot.\\" This is completely unnecessary, and for me mars the beauty of the original sentence. Also, it is inconceivable that the reader might not yet know that both Anne and Mr. Elliot share the same last name, as this exchange occurs late in the book. Unfortunately, this is not the only stupid footnote in the Penguin edition. For the sake of space, I will refrain from listing any others.On the whole, this is a fine novel; not as accomplished as some of Austen's other work, but very engaging and fun to read. She seems to be a bit more moralistic as here well, which is not to my taste, but may be to others. Oh that Mr. Elliot and his \\"Sunday travelling\\"--ought he not to be in church? My only complaint with the novel itself (other than the occasional tortuous/torturous sentence) is the speedy resolution, which I felt could have benefited from a couple more scenes concerning the novel's two main antagonists--a confrontation would have been nice here. Also, I felt Austen took the easy way out by not forcing Anne to make a choice between two eligible suitors. Otherwise, if you like Austen, this is probably exactly what you're looking for."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This was my first foray into Jane Austen. I must admit it took a while for me get accustomed to the literary style, but once I got into the flow of it, I quite enjoyed it. I am looking forward to reading more of her classic works!"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Although I am an English major and have always loved reading, I confess that when I picked up Persuasion, it was the first Jane Austen book I had ever actually read. Watching the films had made me love the stories, but I had never truly experienced the original text. This is the only one I have read so far, and so declaring it my favorite seems a stretch. However I can say with confidence that at this moment, I can't think of another book I've read this year that I liked half so well.The characters in the book have personalities that range from immature to mature, logical to illogical, playful to disdainful, and shallow to deeply heartfelt. Jane Austen has a true talent of capturing real people, in moments of weakness, in strength, and just about everything in between. Anne's sister Mary is one who feels that the world is never quite kind enough to her, while her father feels a lack of need to be terribly kind to the world. Lady Russell, a friend and mentor of the heroine Anne, is logical and sensitive to family connection so much so that occasionally she cannot see the inherent flaws in those whom she is trying to reconnect. The main character, Anne, is a complex creature through whose eyes it is fascinating to watch the world. She is sweet and humble, yet occasionally sarcastic and unfailingly realistic.Another aspect of the book is the implicit value of integrity. Anne does not do anything which she feels to be untrue or unworthy, and she stands up for what she believes in despite the disapproval of her worldly father. One example of this is when she decides to visit an old school mate who has been both widowed and crippled instead of going with her father and sister to visit Lady Dalrymple, a distant cousin of the family who hold a title of nobility. Consistently throughout the book, there is a deep and unwavering determination to do the right thing.Jane Austen is able to capture the complex relationships between people and the intricacies of human nature in beautiful and captivating language, and her skill of tone allow the reader to be completely transported and involved in the world she writes from. I look forward to reading the rest of the books as soon as I can, for through fiction she seems to speak poignantly about my life in a way I couldn't. Sometimes she goes against the adage of \\"Show don't tell,\\" by summarizing conversations and describing peoples attributes without allowing the reader to see them in action. However, this is a matter of style, and no great downfall for the book itself."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Take this opportunity to read Persuasion, it will take your breath away.Anne Elliot was \\"forced into prudence in her youth, she learned romance as she grew older.\\" She was not given the choice by her family and friends to marry the man that she loved and who loved her. She sent Fredrick Wentworth away to the navy with no promise of ever having their love renewed. Fredrick spends his time in the navy honorably, becoming a captain, and tries his best to forget Anne. Anne, left at home, realizes what a mistake it was to ignore her heart and follow the advice of those who she thought she trusted.Persuasion takes place almost ten years after these events when fate pulls these star-crossed lovers together again. They must find a way to forgive each other, one for being sent away, and the other for never returning.Jane Austen wrote Persuasion at the end of her life, and thus had a different perspective while writing it then she did when writing all the rest of her books. This is the only Austen book written after the two protagonists have met and fallen in love. Austen pulls you into Anne's story, demanding that you stick around until you know what happens between Anne and Wentworth. The reader can easily see the emotions that both Anne and Wentworth feel, while both characters are blind to the feelings of the other.Anne taught me that I have to trust my heart. I can listen to the people in my life that I trust, but they will not be able to tell me what to do to be happy. Anne becomes miserable because she followed the advice of those she loved, but she doesn't blame them because she realizes that they told her to do what they thought was best. I enjoyed watching Anne grow and become an amazing woman who knows what she wants and is willing to stand up to the people in her life.One issue that I had with this book is the language that is used in it; it was not written for our day. The language is archaic and difficult to decipher. It is best to know the basic plot before reading this book or else you will get lost in the details of what is happening. However, the joy that is elicited from being part of Anne's life is without a doubt worth the effort."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Amazed at how much easier it is to read these long classics electronically (which I love!) than bulky books.

She wrote about the satire of society and its effects on the chance of marriage.Synopsis:Anne Elliot has listened to friends and family when it comes to the men in her life. Should marry them or not? Anne met the love of her life Captain Wentworth earlier but was discouraged from pursuing him. Will Anne be able to break away from her family and make her own decision about love and happiness? Will society affect her choices?My Thoughts:I feel that classics are important, but I often have to give my full attention to it. I enjoyed Pride and Prejudice but also have a greater understanding of the story. I feel that I will come to appreciate Persuasion in time once I have given it more time.Should we let marriage decide our future? Does our family have our best interests at heart? It is interesting that this marriage and family connections were so important back about one hundred fifty years ago.I look forward to reading my next Jane Austen novel."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I couldn't get into this book.

The book was high quality although the cover make it appear as though you are reading a romance novel. :-)"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"After viewing several versions of Jane Austen's works, it seemed that reading at least one was overdue. Since I had just seen the latest Masterpiece Theater version of Persuasion on PBS, that seemed a likely choice. The possibility of two problems loomed as the book was purchased: First, the book and the taped version would probably have major differences. Second, Having been written 200 years ago, the style would also be different, more narrative than action, for instance. I was to discover that sentence structure was also very different. (Although I have read many books in this style in my lifetime, the popular style today is, of course, more fast-paced and active in comparison.)I was quite right about the pacing and the style. At first, it was a difficult read, taking more concentration than modern popular fiction requires. But as the machinations of the Elliott family and their kin unfolded, I was drawn into the story. How could Sir Walter be so oblivious to Anne's favors? How could Anne have listened to Lady Russell and rejected Wentworth's proposal eight years earlier? How could anyone have wanted to wed Anne's sister Mary whose ailments and spells are so blatantly self-serving? And would a man of Wentworth's personality, station, and eventual rise wait eight years to marry in an era when marrying well was so important to the upper and upper-middle classes?All of the shenanigans listed above and many more are documented in detail in the book. There is no way one can get the same flavor of scheming and hoping in a play or film. At least I've not seen one that accomplished that. It is tough going sometimes for the modern reader. However, it is well worth the effort. Seeing society as Jane Austen did is one of those experiences one can most often get only from books. I'm glad that I picked up this one and now plan to read more of her work: Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility, and Emma among them. It should be an interesting summer."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"The volumes I purchased all prove excellent.

It's just like any other version of Austen that I have read.HOWEVER, I do want to make a very important point for those considering this version and others by this company. The pictures really ruin the flow of the book. You will be reading, then there is a huge blank space after the text. Click next page and you get a picture that is really hard to get a look at, then next page you see the caption and some space before the text continues. It really disrupts the reading to have this randomly throughout the chapters.Aside from that, the kindle version is decent."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I especially love the extra information for further study that is provided within this edition.

She's never gotten over her first love, Frederick Wentworth, whom she was convinced not to marry, as he lacked both status and wealth. Now, at 27, she's fated to be a spinster for life, passed back and forth between her father and equally status-conscious elder sister and her hypocondriac, self-centered younger sister.Frederick Wentworth, on the other hand, did not pine away, but joined the Royal Navy and made a not-inconsiderable fortune. A series of strange events forces them into each other's company again, but Anne is reluctant to show any favoritism for fear of looking like a fortune hunter, and Captain Wentworth has no desire to be burned again.This is one of Jane Austen's quieter novels. We know from the beginning Anne and the Captain will fall in love all over again -- the enjoyment is in getting there. Not quite up there with her other novels, in my opinion, but if you're a fan of Jane Austen or just the genre, it's worth a read."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I'm slowly becoming a Jane Austen fan.

His heir, William Elliott, recently reestablished contact with his relatives -- and he seems very interested in Anne.

I am in my forties now and seem to have gained a deeper appreciation for Anne Eliot's heroic character-- heroic in the moral sense...if we had had Anne Eliots for Wallstreet Bankers we would not be in the trouble we are in now, and truly, honestly, Austen is superb in subtly building her arc of suspense with enough plot twists worthy of any Hollywood blockbuster...which is why, if she had lived today she'd be a Nora Ephron and have a great movie out every other year.The novel also served as the proverbial mirror, or as so many have argued, true art is holding up a mirror to Nature...looking into that mirror myself, I felt many personal shortcomings vis a vis patient and virtuous Anne, and I think the next generation, my children's generation which I think of as the \\"on demand\\" generation would greatly benefit from exploring this novel and mirroring their own commonalities and shortcomings on someone like Anne...Inez Hollander Lake[...]"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"My wife loves owning the classics (including Austen) and went looking for a good hardcover publisher of her favorite books.

Two sisters (a third is already married) and their father, a minor noble, have fallen on hard times. Sir Walter Elliot has been widowed, they have lived beyond their means, and now they must rent out the family estate and live in diminished circumstances in Bath. The putative heir to the estate, cousin William Elliot, is vain and arrogant, refusing any interaction with the family.The main character of Persuasion is Anne, the disregarded middle Elliot daughter. She is kind, gentle, and tolerant, which puts her is rigid conflict with the rest of her family who are pompously jealous of rank and privelege. In fact, the rest of the Elliot family supplies much of the satire for the novel: their scheming to arrange meetings with their betters and the scorn they show to their lessers. This reviewer might even go so far as to say that the humour is not so much satirical as it is ascerbic - nowhere else does Austin seem to dislike her characters so much, and to make them the objects of such ridicule. This is not a criticism, as this ascerbic wit sets up many funny moments and observations; more, I think, than any of her previous works.Unfortunately, I found this to be the most confusing of Austin's works: I had trouble keeping track of all the characters. Confusion is increased because all the men seem to be named Charles! Luckily, a thorough knowledge of all the characters is not required to follow the main storylines (although the reader might miss a few subtle jokes).I'm not an expert on Jane Austin, nor on English literature. However, I have read most of Austin's works, and this layman's opinion is that Persuasion is enjoyable and the funniest of Austin's works."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I have read a couple of other Jane Austen novels, and I think this one stands with the best of them. Although we all know it will have a happy ending, Austen sustains the emotional suspense of *how* Anne and Wentworth will finally reunite, and I was not disappointed. Wentworth's letter brought tears to my eyes; it was so wrenchingly emotional and bare. Aside from the romantic plot line, this novel also draws a clear and humorous picture of the characters and social dynamics of the time, which I found fascinating. I recommend this book highly, especially to those who may be new to Austen, as it is shorter and less complicated that some of her more famous ones. The ending makes it all worthwhile!"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"The novel Persuasion by Jane Austen is very good. Although slow at places, it definatly redeems itself throughout the novel. The protagonist, Anne, is in love with a man, but is persuaded out of love because of his social status. The book is a classic romatice novel, but is not cheesy to say the least. I encourage everyone who enjoys a good novel to read this book, but especially females. This book is centered around the social status and appearance of the people in the early 1800's. The way Anne doesn't care, makes her differant than the rest of the characters, but also helps the reader consider thinking for themselves instead of being persuaded by other people's thoughts. By the end of the novel, the reader has the decision whether persuasion is good or bad. I really enjoyed the novel. The reader just needs to be able to make it through the first couple of chapters, then the book is really enjoyable."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Not all readers are captivated by this quiet, sad, reflective work. But it is also very joyful. It is Jane Austen toward the end of her life reflecting once again on love, companionship and the eternal knot of family, class and society. Anne Elliot is one of the truly abiding heroines of the modern novel: gentle ,wise, politic and balanced. She is a young, beautiful woman thwarted in an early love by societal and family interests. But it is a joy to see her rise again by the recognition of others seeing these same virtues. This is very different novel than Pride and Prejudice but if you don't think it as great a novel meditate again on its resonant power."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"As a fan of Jane Austen and one who ranks \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" among the great literary accomplishments of the millennium, it disappoints me to rate \\"Persuasion\\" as a ho-hum novel. Unfortunately, the book fulfils the expectations of a two-hundred-year-old romance novel from Old England: dull.The book has a strong and compelling intro. Anne Elliot is one of three daughters of widower Sir Walter Elliot, a vain but financially challenged baronet whose daughters have reached marrying age. As a young lady, Anne had a romance with a certain Captain Wentworth, but this relationship breaks up for reasons that are dribbled out over the course of the book, and Wentworth goes off with the Navy for many years. The story line then wanders off in no apparent direction for a couple of hundred pages as we are introduced to other characters and led thru events with unclear purpose or relevance. But Wentworth reappears on the scene and slowly the plot evolves. Austen tries to persuade us to keep reading with mild intrigue over the Elliot estate, conniving cousins, convoluted love triangles, and the ultimate question: will Anne and the Captain reignited their romance?Although Anne Elliot is a strong and likable character, she seems to do little to advance her own cause. Things just seem to happen to her. While Austen's sentence-by-sentence prose is as beautiful and lyrical as ever, she does an insufficient job in the book's middle of persuading contemporary readers, who prefer faster-paced fiction, to brave the huge passages of wordy exposition and press on to the end. Rabid Austen fans, readers of romance novels, and lovers of classic literature will undoubtedly appreciate Persuasion, but I hesitate to recommend it as an introduction to Jane Austen. I'm afraid that if this were her only novel, she'd have been lost to the ages. --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of Wake Up Dead."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Published a few years after the acclaimed PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, this novel paints an intimate portrait of country gentry inearly 19th century England. Describing the social milieus with which she was so familiar, Austen alternates the plot development between modest estates and the seaside resorts of Lyme and Bath. Travel aand communication proved serious obstacles, so letters and notes were the more prized and preserved. Austen weaves a tapestry of strict social customs,explaining the value of keeping up appearances, of keeping one's place--which was clearly deliniated by time-honored class snobbery and ritual. Other themes which are quietly included:be wary of schemers, evaluate the counsel of interfering extended famly, and do not trust superficial impressions.Narrated in the usual third person, ths intense story revolves around Anne Elliot, the middle daughter of vain but impoverished Sir Walter. The author might well have chosen to make this a first person novel, since we always know what the modestprotagonist is doing, feeling and thinking. Austen gently ridicules the struggle between vanity and financial reality, as the family's streightened circumstances obliged them to rent out their beloved Kellynch Hall and take rooms in Bath. But where to find suitable tenants for the ancestral home? Their circle includes the neighboring Musgroves, whose son married the youngest Elliot daughter. Fortunately for the marriageablegirls, their limited horizons are expandaded by the arrival of three young naval captains--one of whom Anne was forced to renounce 7 years before. She represents the first victim ofof the art of familial persuasion. Yet her heart still beats fast at the mention of his name...Austen presents many themes and events which also appear in her signature novel; she deftly reveals a woman's intimate understanding of her heroine's private torment. The social ritual between country gentry is almost ridiculous in their extreme scruples regarding proper behavior--even to their own relatives and in-laws. Austen exposes the time-honored web of duty an public behavior, even on vacation. One wonders if the women of Austen's day were taught--direclty or indirectly--to value their own &quot;nothingness,&quot; as Anne puts it. Is a teachable heart (one that can be persuaded to reason, even in violation of its natural instincts, to be admired in that society? Or in our own time? Were Austen's women true Victorian ladies or more rational creatures thanmale authors of the time generally portrayed them? Anne pounced upon the eternal argument which provoked the denouement: which of the genders is more (or less) &quot;inconstant.&quot; These and many other soul-searching issues are elucidated in this short novel (225 pages) which should be evaluated by the standards of a by-gone era. Thoughtful readers must discern for themselves which truths are valid for all times; if they prove universal, then the work is a true classic. An insightful novel which will appeal to most caring women."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This wasn't my favorite Jane Austen, but I liked the main character better than some of the others I've read, like Emma. The main character, Anne, was sympathetic, and you felt bad for her through much of the book when she was putting up with the other insufferable characters. Jane Austen's books always manage to make me very glad that I didn't live in the Victorian Era. It would have been terrible to not be able to escape the very awful relations always described in her books. The expectations of poor relations seem nearly unbearable. I wouldn't have been able to bear the types of jabs Mary aimed at Anne regularly. It makes me very glad to live in a time when a woman earning her own living is not seen as a disreputable person."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"My review isn't about the story aspect of the book, but rather the physical quality of this edition. It's, well, crap. I don't know what I was expecting, but this wasn't it. As someone else said, it looks cheap. As if this was some new author who had her book printed independently. And the print is miniscule. I never complain about print, but this book is just dreadful. Tiny print and the lines are extremely close together.I'm supposed to be reading this for my book club, but I strongly suspect I'm going to be looking for another edition to use. I suppose I got what I paid for; the quality of this one is just awful."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"have to admit, Jane Austen's Persuasion was just . . . pretty boring. The book mainly consists of the main character, Anne Elliot, hanging about until finally realizing that the man she really wants is a sailor whose love she turned away several years ago. Anne herself is not particularly interesting, nor are there the really fun, memorable characters like the father in Emma. The only dramatic incident in the book is one of Anne's acquaintances taking a tumble and bumping her head, but she's not really hurt and the whole incident is designed to help dispose of one of Anne's potential suitors. In six months I'll have completely forgotten what this book is about, but I will say it offers an interesting historical look at what daily life might be like in the lower-echelons of the the English gentry. It also demonstrates the high regard that Englishmen held for the navy as one of the few avenues for citizens of mundane birth to advance themselves into positions of power, wealth, and prestige.For essays, John Wiltshire's \\"Modern Interpretations\\" discusses how, although the slow-moving and even mournful Persuasion was Austen's final published novel, she was working on a \\"high-spirited satire\\" at the time of her death. Wiltshire also talks about a couple of recent filmed versions of the book. Maggie Lane's \\"Regency Life\\" has an interesting discussion on the role of the navy during the period in which Austen was writing, as well as the use of seaside resorts as places visited for both recreation and their supposed medicinal effects. Caroline Sanderson's \\"Geographical Settings\\" focusses primarily on Bath and Lyme Regis, while Josephine Ross' \\"A Modern Perspective\\" offers an interesting portrait of Jane Austen's own failed romantic pursuits and how that may have influenced her writing."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Overall, Persuasion was not bad, but I would have enjoyed it more with some plot adjustments.I felt like I was never well acquainted with the object of Anne Elliot's affection, Captain Wentworth. Although Austen described why Wentworth was such a good man, I did not participate much in Anne's love for him (although I did empathize with her feelings). There were great moments and good characters, but there could have been so much more in the relationship between Anne and Frederick Wentworth.Also, I was disappointed that the the end was summarized in narration. The climax of the story pertaining to the romance and to the foes of the family, though starting out well, ended too soon in narration rather than dramatic action."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Anne is the middle daughter of a snobbish and foolish lord living in Victorian England. Her mother died when she was a young teenager, and she has very little in common with her older sister or her younger sister. Anne's older sister is a carbon copy of their father, and the two of them managed to spend beyond their means, to the point that they now have to rent out their home and move someplace more affordable. Anne's younger sister has made a decent match in marriage and is now settled into a life that requires near constant attention from others, especially when one of her frequent imaginary illnesses pops up.Anne is mostly ignored by her family, and they don't know that she once had a brief attachment to a young naval officer, Frederick Wentworth. A family friend, Anne's surrogate mother figure, thought Anne would be able to find someone better, and advised her to break off her commitment. Anne took the advice, which resulted in devastation both for herself and for the young man.Now, seven years later, Wentworth's sister and her husband are renting Anne's family home. When the now-Captain Wentworth visits, he and Anne find themselves thrown into the same social circle, and spend many months trying to decide if they still have the same feelings for each other that they did so long ago.I liked this story, with its insight into the amount of effort it took for Victorians to make proper matches and ensure their way of life would continue. I liked the social rankings and the elaborate rules of behavior, which must have been absolutely stifling for someone living through this time.However, I didn't identify at all with Anne as a protagonist. I understand that rules of etiquette were different in those days, and it is difficult for me to read this book without looking through a modern-day filter. However, Anne had no sense of self-value, and only seemed to see herself as important when she was being \\"useful\\" to others. It is true that her family treated her as a tool, but I couldn't see how she could see herself that way and still have been attractive to the men who vie for her attention."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I'm a longtime Persuasion fan, and know the novel well. I bought the Brilliance Audio edition because it's tough to find unabridged versions and I like hearing my favorite old stories aloud.The tapes are certainly sturdy for repeated library lendings, and the narrator is easy to hear and understand, but otherwise Michael Page is the wrong reader for this story! His vocal characterizations are quavery and pinched, and don't usually fit the characters--or degrade them to farce level. The music signalling the end of each cassette is distracting, jarring even.Not a great reading of Persuasion. Not even a good intro to the novel for first timers, and terrible for those of us who know the characters already."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I rate this book three stars. This is the first book from Jane Austen I have read and am not accustomed to her style of writing. I liked this book very much, don't get me wrong, but at times it dragged on, going over tons of social class and position stuff. The end is expected, but suprising at the same time. There is romance in the book, but not enough for my satisfaction. But overall this books is a good one! I would definetly buy it regardless of my personal tastes."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"If (like me) you value Austen primarily for her wit, you may pass on Persuasion.Persuasion is a bit tedious. It's all mincing and moralizing, with none of the wit and good humor that make Pride and Prejudice worthwhile. Persuasion's protagonist, the wilting Anne Elliot, is a doormat for her self-involved relations, whom she not only tolerates but also excuses. Anne's blushing weakness may add to the melodrama (maybe the romance), but it also sucks all the satire out of the narrative. As a result, the reader is deprived of a richly deserved laugh at the pompous antagonists' expense. And without a good laugh, the story is hardly worth the trouble."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Let me start off by saying, maybe my review of this book is not fair- I have, so far, only read about 40% of it and was SO disgustingly BORED that I stopped & went on to another book.My first Jane Austen book that I read was Pride & Prejudice- I LOVED that book! I was very excited to start this book, hoping I would love it just as much as P&P...; but I have the exact oposite feeling about it. I was bored in the begining, but I forced myself to keep reading thinking that it would get better. Finally I just couldn't stand it & moved to another book. After reading so many good reviews on here, I will try to read it again- hopefully the 2nd time will be the charm- ?"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"\\"Persuasion\\" is a great literary work, and, to my mind, Jane Austen's finest book. This was her final completed novel before her death, and was published posthumously. As is often the case with Ms. Austen's fiction, \\"Persuasion\\" deals with the social issues of the times and paints a fascinating portrait of Regency England, especially when dealing with the class system. Rigid social barriers existed - and everyone wanted to marry \\"up\\" to a higher station - and, of course, into wealth. This is also a very poignant and passionate story of love, disappointment, loss and redemption. The point Austen makes here, is that one should not ever be persuaded to abandon core values and beliefs, especially for ignoble goals. There are consequences, always.Gillian Beer writes a fascinating Introduction in this Penguin Classic Edition, in which she discusses Miss Austen's portrayal of the double-edged nature of persuasion. This complete and unabridged edition also contains a biography of the author, an Afterword, a new chronology and full textual notes.Sir Walter Elliot, Lord of Kellynch Hall, is an extravagant, self-aggrandizing snob, and a bit of a dandy to boot. He has been a widower for many years and spends money beyond his means to increase his social stature. His eldest daughter, who he dotes on, is as conceited and spoiled as he is. The youngest daughter, Anne, is an intelligent, sensitive, capable and unassuming woman in her late twenties when the story opens. She had been quite pretty at one time, but life's disappointments have taken their toll and her looks are fading. She and her sister are both spinsters. Anne had once been very much in love with a young, and as yet untried, navel officer. A woman who had been a close friend to Anne's mother, persuaded Anne to \\"break the connection,\\" convincing her that she could make a much better match. After much consideration, Anne did not follow her heart or her better instincts, and she and her young officer, Frederick Wentworth, separated. She has never again found the mutual love or companionship that she had with him. Anne's older sister never married either, because she hadn't found anyone good enough! She still hopes, however, for an earl or a viscount.The Elliot family is forced to financially retrench because of their extravagance. They lease Kellynch Hall to...of all people...Wentworth's sister and her husband. Elliot, his oldest daughter and her companion, move to a smaller lodging in Bath for the season, leaving Anne to pack up their belongings before joining them. She gets the Cinderella treatment throughout the book. Anne decides to first visit with her middle sister, an abominably spoiled, whiny hypochondriac, Mrs. Musgrove. She has made a good, but not brilliant match to a local squire. Her husband, Charles Muskgrove, his parents, and their two younger, eligible daughters, Louisa and Henrietta, are delightful. They all tolerate Mrs. Muskgrove, barely, and adore Anne. It is at the Muskgrove estate that Anne meets Frederick Wentworth again, after his absence of seven years. He is in the neighborhood, because his sister is now in the area, residing at Kellynch, of course. Wentworth is now a Captain in the Royal Navy and quite wealthy. When their eyes meet for the first time, you can absolutely feel Anne's longing and remorse. He is aloof with Anne, although civil. The man was hurtfully rejected once before and it appears that he still feels her snub. Now Wentworth is on the marriage market and Louisa sets her cap for him. Accidents and various adventures ensue, from the resorts of Lyme and Bath to the Muskgrove estate, bringing Anne and Wentworth closer together. The passion between the two is sooo palpable, although Very understated, (this is Regency England after all). I think this is Ms. Austen at her most passionate. Some scholars say that she modeled Anne Elliot after herself.This remarkable novel, and the issues it tackles, is just as germane today as it was when written. And the romance...well, no one does romance better than Jane Austen.JANA"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This book is one of my favorites of all time. Many people dislike it or don't like it as much when compared to Pride and Prejudice or Emma, but there are many reasons why Persuasion should not be compared to Austen's other novels. This novel was the last one that Austen wrote before she died. It is a more mature novel, dealing with many issues not found in Austen's previous novels. One reason why people find faults with the book is that Anne Elliot, the heroine, is not as spunky or witty as an Elizabeth Bennett or an Emma Woodhouse. There is not so much wit flowing in the dialogue between characters, or even dialogue in general. But these differences between the novels make this one so unique.It is a novel of second chances. Anne Elliot, no longer in the bloom of youth, is a grown woman of 27 or 28 years. Eight years ago she had been happily in love with a handsome man named Frederick Wentworth. But, unfortunately, due to his financial status, and Anne under the influence of her family and close friend, was forced to reject his marriage proposal and they parted ways. But now, he is within her closest circle once again. Circumstances led to Anne staying with her married sister, Mrs. Muskgrove, while her own house was being let to Wentworth's sister and husband. Wentworth visits his sister and on calling on the Muskgroves finds Anne among them. Anne finds Wentworth, not only looking as good as he ever did, but is now Captain Wentworth, who has made his fortune. Wentworth, still angry with Anne over being rejected, causes him to treat Anne very cooly. But over many weeks of contact here and there, you catch on that Captain Wentworth isn't all that oblivious to Anne anymore, because of all the little 'glimpses' he throws at Anne. The tension between the two is amazing. You can sense a connection between the two, even though they are on opposite ends of the room. In Bath, the tension builds and builds until it culminates into one of the most moving and romantic reunions ever. The letter that Wentworth writes to Anne declaring his love is bound to bring a tear to your eye and a pang in your heart. Happily, all ends well, but throughout the novel you can easily sympathize with Anne. No longer youthful and no longer as pretty as she used to be, she is full of self-consciousness and confusion. She still loves him after all those years, but she cannot act upon her desires.Austen, yet again, excels in portraying her characters. Anne and Captain Wentworth are full and delightful characters that one must love. Her descriptions of Anne's vain father and snobbish older sister, Elizabeth, hit the mark on satirizing the members of society during that time. She wittingly describes how everyone tolerates Mrs. Muskgrove's hypochondriatic self and how everyone deals with her in their own way. There is not so much dialogue between characters in this book, compared to Austen's other novels. Most of the book is in observation of Anne's character and feelings, which makes it so much easier to relate to everything that Anne feels and you understand her situation all the more. This is a wonderful novel, with many qualities, differing from those of Austen's previous novels, to enjoy and admire."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Over the years, I have read &quot;Persuasion&quot; by Jane Austen at LEAST 10 times. Simply put, it is my favorite book. While not everyone holds this novel with the same high esteem that I do, I urge those who have NOT read &quot;Persuasion&quot; to buy it.This book has meant different things to me at different times in my life. I have often reflected why I find the story so fascinating and believe it is because it so accurately portrays the human spirit and exposes our flaws and strengths with such transparency.Jane Austen reveals those who are so superficial that they see no goodness or worth other than beauty and wealth (Anne's father and sister); those who are so dependent that they do not listen to their own heart - but instead leave their most important decisions for others to make (Anne herself); and those whose pride has been wounded.And perhaps what is so captivating, Austen lets the reader vicariously &quot;undo&quot; an error in judgment. This is an excellent and timeless novel."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This review is for the Norton Critical Edition of Persuasion, and has two parts: a review of Persuasion itself, and a review of Norton Content.No educated person disputes Austen's contribution to the literary world. While her particular craft may not be palatable to all types (whose is?), I maintain that of all Austen's works, Persuasion is the one to hold the most appeal to those unfamiliar with her literature. It could be a \`gateway drug', introducing the reader to Austen, or it could be a delightful \`one-book stand'; whichever way works for the reader.Concealed within Regency trappings is a universal story: there is a \`mythic' quality to it in the sense that C.S. Lewis defines myth. The story reaches through space and time to grab the heart and attention of the reader, compelling her both on and deeper. When the novel opens, Anne Elliot faces the prospect of meeting once again a man with whom she was compelled to break off an engagement nearly eight years prior. While relatively little outward action takes place, Austen builds tension through Anne's inner conflict. Peripheral issues, such as the nature of the change in social systems in this turbulent time in Britain and the place of women in society, serve as complementary fare that highlights the mounting dilemma that Anne faces. In Austen style, the resolution and denouement are highly satisfying and truly ingenious, and the reader is left with meaty material to savor for days to come.The Norton contribution to Persuasion is indispensable. Though I was previously familiar with Persuasion, a favorite professor of mine introduced me to the commentary and contributions within this edition. The preface lays out a road map of sorts for the rest of the book. Included immediately after the conclusion of the novel is the original ending-something that even the non-lit majors in my class found interesting. A fabulous selection of backgrounds and contexts follows, with items such as Henry Austen's \\"Biographical Notice of the Author\\", and a selection from Richard Whateley's \\"Review of Northanger Abbey and Persuasion\\", entitled \\"A New Style of Novel\\".Additionally, modern critical commentary is included from Austen scholars Marilyn Butler, Ann Astell, Claudia Johnson, and others. Appearing at the end are a helpful chronology and selected bibliography. Patricia Meyer Spacks did a fabulous and much appreciated job in editing and pulling the work together. This edition is highly recommended, both within the classroom, and without.--The Medieval Chick"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"One of the major sources of contention and strife in my marriage is the disagreement between my wife and me over what is the best Jane Austen novel (yes, we are both more than a bit geekish in our love of words and literature--our second biggest ongoing quarrel is about the merits of the serial comma).For my money, there are three of Austen's six finished novels that one can make a good argument for being her \\"best\\":\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" (the popular choice, and my wife's)\\"Emma\\" (the educated choice--most lit profs go with this one)\\"Persuasion\\" (the truly refined choice)Harrold Bloom in \\"The Western Canon\\" calls it perhaps a \\"perfect novel,\\" and while I disagree with some of his interpretations of the characters (yes, blasphemy, I know), I wholeheartedly concur with his overal assessment.While all of Austen's novels are generally comic, \\"Persuasion\\" is the most nuanced. It's been described as \\"autumnal\\" and that word suits it. There's a bittersweetness to it that you just don't get in Austen's other work.The novel it comes closest to in terms of character and plot is probably one of her earliest novels \\"Sense and Sensibility.\\" Like Eleanor in that novel, Anne is older and more mature than the typical Austen heroine. In fact, she's dangerously close to being \\"over the hill\\" at the age of 27(!). Love has passed her by, apparently.But unlike Eleanor, who one always feels will muddle through even if she ends up disappointed in affairs of the heart, there's something more dramatically at stake with Anne. She is in great danger of ceasing to exist, not physically, but socially. When we meet her, she's barely there at all. Although a woman of strong feelings, she is ignored and literally overlooked by most of the other characters. In the universe of Austen's novels, the individual doesn't truly exist unless connected with the social world, and while Anne has a stoic strength, we understand that she is in some senses doomed if things don't change for her.This is where we see what the mature Austen can do with a character type that she couldn't when she was younger.This edition also has the original ending of the novel included as an appendix, which gives us a rare and fascinating look in to Austen as a technical artist.I read this novel as an undergraduate, and have reread it several times since. I even took the novel with me to Bath on a trip to England, and spent a wonderful summer evening reading it while sitting in Sidney Gardens, across the street from one of the homes Austen lived in during her time in Bath, listening to Mozart's Piano Concerto #27. It's one of my favorite memories.More than any other of her novels, \\"Persuasion\\" shows how Austen dealt with profound existential questions within the confines of her deceptively limited setting and cast of characters. Those who think Austen is simply a highbrow precursor to contemporary romance novels or social comedies are missing the colossal depth of thought that is beneath the surface of any of her novels, this one most of all.Austen is nearly unique in the history of the novel for the consistency of her excellence. While most novelists have a clear masterpiece that stands out among their work, and usually a fairly sizable number of works that are adequate but not enduring, all of Austen's novels stand up to repeated readings and deserve a wide audience among today's readers.Having said that, \\"Persuasion\\" is simply the best of the best."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"PERSUASION, the last novel that Jane Austen completed before her death in 1818, tells the story of one Anne Elliot, the second daughter of a baronet who has spent his waythrough his fortune and has nothing but his title to lean on.When she was 21 years old, Anne fell in love with and was engaged to Frederick Wentworth, a young captain in the Navy. Her belated mother's best friend, Lady Russell, dissapproves of the match as being below Anne, due to Anne's claim to nobility, and Anne cancels the engagement, much to her and and Captain Wentworth's grief.Nearly eight year's have passed since she broke off her engagement to Captain Wentworth when she, Lady Russell, and a Mr. Shepherd, a friend of her father's, are forced to pose and intervention and tell her father that he must quit his estate and find someone to lease it to, or he will be sent tot he poorhouse. Her father, his only pride being in his social position and personal appearance, relents, but only if they can find suitable tenants - which they do in Admiral Croft and his wife, the sister of Captain Wentworth.Anne thinks that her broken heart has mended, until she sees him again. unfortunately, he is now attached to another . . . and yet Anne sees clues in his behavior that he may be hers once again. Anne and Wentworth must negotiate their past, their different social classes, and proper behavior to find their way back to one another.What sets PERSUASION appart from Austens' other novels is how modern it seems in comparison. Austen takes more liberty with point of view in this novel, the characters have much richer inner lives than the Bennet's or Dashwood's ever did.This novel is highly recommended to anyone who would enjoy Jane Austen. Though the ending is predictable, it does not always seem so, and therefore the novel was a very suspenseful read."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Certainly one of the greatest literary minds of all time is that of Jane Austen, an author who has been much-maligned by her unfair modern association with \\"chick-lit\\" (it's nice that \\"Bridget Jones' Diary\\" was based on \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" but that should not reflect unduly on Austen's work). The trick is that while Austen's novels do tend to center on a romantic plot they are imbued with many other facets that make them so much more than trifling entertainments. Sharp social commentary is particularly prevalent in all of her novels, perhaps none more-so than her final work, \\"Persuasion\\" -- with its deft handling of a woman's place in society and of the difficulties imposed by class barriers. Its focus is on Anne Elliot, middle child of the pretentious Sir Walter, who has no use for her in his life -- choosing to favor his eldest daughter Elizabeth (who, truly, takes after her father in all selfish respects) and to offer regard to his youngest, Mary, at least as a woman who has fulfilled her purpose by marrying satisfactorily. Years earlier Lady Russell, a family friend who became a sort of surrogate parent to Anne after her mother's death, persuaded Anne to break her engagement to her beloved Frederick Wentworth, believing him to be an inferior sort of person who would only make Anne miserable in time. Now, eight years later, Wentworth is a successful captain in the British navy who has proven that he would have been a more than worthy match for Anne in situation as well as affection. But when he comes back into her life, Anne must live with the consequences of her earlier decision as Wentworth appears to have moved on -- actively seeking a wife right under Anne's nose. Anne also finds herself being courted by her cousin William, who would be a perfectly sensible match for her, but since her heart still belongs to Captain Wentworth she cannot bear to consider it. The plot conventions will be familiar to fans of Austen, but that does not detract from the sharpness and enjoyability of the tale in the slightest. The keen observations are on target, and \\"Persuasion\\" has the added benefit of having some of the best characters in the Austen canon this side of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". Anne proves to be a heroine worthy of Elizabeth Bennet's approval, and Captain Wentworth an amiable counterpoint to the steelier Mr. Darcy. Mary's histrionics are reminiscent of the wailings of Mrs. Bennet, providing blissful comic relief without becoming too overbearing. Best of all, naturally, is the omnipresent Austen wit -- an incomparable achievement in all of her novels, on fine display here in \\"Persuasion\\". Anyone who has not yet experienced Jane Austen is missing out on some enjoyable and delightfully thought-provoking reading, and should get started as soon as possible."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I know a lot of teens who, when I tell them I am reading Jane Austen, say, &quot;What are you thinking?&quot; because they have read Sense and Sensibility first, before trying any of her easier works. Persuasion is the easiest book of Austen's to get into, to follow, and to love. She makes the characters real by explaining them in many situations. When I read this book, I instantly became friends with Anne Elliot, the family outcast, because she was an outcast. Then she became even more my friend when she became the beloved and desired friend and love of Captain Wentworth. I loved seeing Anne go through the difficulties of dealing with her past actions, and instead of wanting to go back and change the past, she wanted to go forward and decide the future. Austen masterfully portrays all of her characters, and I would love to go to Lyme and see where Anne met her cousin, and to Bath to see where she and Captain Wentworth decided their future together. Persuasion is my favorite book of Austen's, and if you read it, it will be yours, too."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Like all of her novels, Jane Austen's PERSUASION is essentially a comedy of manners--a work in which the characters must negotiate a complex code of conduct in order to survive, much less achieve their ends. And in a certain sense the novel is indicative of Austen's great talent, razor sharp, laced with irony and wit, and remarkably phrased. And yet PERSUASION is quite unlike Austen's other novels in the story it tells.Eight years earlier, Anne Elliot fell in love with a man named Wentworth. Her family and friends disdained the match, arguing that the man was below her in station and lacked any fortune with which to maintain Anne in her accustomed mode of life. Persuaded to reject him against her own will, Anne broke off the engagement--and thereafter found herself unable to love another even as she endured the follies of her father and two sisters. But Wentworth has returned, having made his name and fortune with the British navy, and it is now his turn to reject her.Published in 1816, PERSUASION is the last novel Austen completed before her death a year later, and it is remarkable for a very autumnal tone. Unlike such Austen masterpieces as PRIDE AND PREJUDICE and EMMA, the herione is not a spirited, quickwitted young women on the verge of matrimony; the hero is not a dashing gentlemen of great estate; there is no verbal duel between the sexes. It is instead the story of a commonsense and pleasantly ordinary woman who considers herself past the likelihood of marriage--and who now wishes only to escape the emotional pain and humiliation visited upon her by a suitor from long ago.While PERSUASION does not really stand along Austen's greatest works, it is nonetheless a very fine novel, a delicately wrought tale of opportunity lost and the passage of time, told in the uniquely piercing style so typical of the author--and while, of course, all eventually comes right for the romantically downtrodden Anne, it has a touch of melancholy quite unlike the tone of her other novels. Austen readers will find it a delight.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Jane Austen's words come to life like notes on a page played by a musician. That most capable \\"musician\\" is Juliet Stevenson, well-known movie and stage actress with the acting chops of the Royal Shakespeare Company behind her. Her training and experience on the stage really shows as she creates individual and convincing voices for each of the characters and highlights the biting and keen observations of the narrator. I had read the book before listening to this audiorecording, and I was amazed at how much I missed. She really brings out the nuances of each character, fully exploiting every detail of each character (Anne's father's vanity, Elizabeth's self-absorption, Anne's self-consciousness and tiny glimpses of her emerging hope) and triumphs with the climactic passage toward the end where she brings Captain Wentworth's letter to life. You can hear the passion and fear in her voice as if it were Captain Wentworth himself. Treat yourself to a Jane Austen reading that brings the text to life."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I was surprised by this one. Persuasion was the only work of Jane Austen's that I had not read in high school. I don't know why it took me until 32 years of age to decide to read it, but I finally did, and loved it so much! It is immediately familiar in the sense that you can sense it as a work of Austen's, but has some slight differences. Anne is less spunky & for some a less immediate heroine. There is certainly less dialogue between characters as compared to Austen's other works. I feel that these things represent maturity & sophistication in her writing that add much depth. I can now say that this is my favorite. I was instantly moved to tears at the crucial point of the story I was so touched and affected by Anne's journey of persuasion....I hope you are too."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"i know she is supposed to be one of the classic greats, but i just can't get into her writing (i force myself because i feel that i should read the classics, if only to make me a well rounded reader). i found the book slow going and to be quite honest, boring."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I had been very Curiousabout is book after seeing it in the Movie \\"The Lake House\\".

I have read most of Jane Austen's book and this one certainly did not disappoint."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"It feels a bit silly to write a review of one of Jane Austen's last published and perhaps lesser known novels. Anyone looking at Persuasion has certainly read Pride and Prejudice or Sense and Sensibility, and has a good idea what to expect. But I'd like to get a few impressions down.Persuasion focuses on Anne Elliot, middle daughter of Sir Walter Elliot and the only person in her family who isn't completely proud and self absorbed. In her youth, Anne was persuaded to break off a relationship with a naval officer that her family felt was beneath her station. Eight years later her former beau, Captain Wentworth, is thrown back into her life, much to her discomfort. She is forced to navigate a passel of family issues and potential suitors in order to find a happy match.There are all the usual elements you can expect in an Austen novel. It is a wry, incisive look at the foibles of human nature; in this case, a contrast between those who value a person purely on their birth or station, versus those who look to personality and character. It has various changes of scenery, from the Elliots' traditional home of Kellynch, to the seaside town of Lyme, to Bath, and draws in a host of well drawn characters. The plot is relationship centered, with one good crisis to drive things forward, and, as I've come to expect, much of it hinges on misunderstanding or deception by characters that aren't all they appear to be on the surface.I liked the book, but I can't say I liked it as much as Austen's more popular novels. Elsewhere she seems to have written even her foolish characters with a sympathetic hand; we laugh at them, perhaps we pity them, but nowhere else to they come off as so one-sidedly unpleasant as in Anne's father and sisters. And, by contrast, Anne is almost the perfect heroine from the start, with little room to grow and few mistakes to learn from. I'm happy I finally read Persuasion--it was the one Austen novel I hadn't read--but it's not the first one I'd recommend."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Persuasion is about second chances.

I had to do it for a class, but there came a point when I couldn't put it down. I carried it around with me on my phone and every time I had a spare minute I would read it."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I'm thrilled that this book remains a perennial favorite, despite the theme. These days, so few people are patient enough to wait, to delay gratification, to survive disappointment, to learn to trust again.By the way, the only movie version worth watching is the one with Ciaran Hinds and Amanda Root. Great casting throughout."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Persuasion , . . . . Jane AustenA number of reviewers complained of serious issues with the printing of this book. Fortunately for me, I experienced no such problems.Jane Austen was an excellent author and Persuasion is a superb example of her work. It is a classic novel of England at that time period (1818). It is a complicated story of romance greatly affected by the class system. There is a bit of good ol' dry English humor as a member of the upper class is forced to take a step down and still manages to keep his nose in the air. Then there's a love tale of the past that just might flame up again. Of course there has to be a villain in such novels and the one here does a fairly good job of being secretly nasty."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"\\"Persuasion\\" is one of my favorite Jane Austen novels. The life lessons to be learned are dispensed in a gentle, non judgmental manner, and the characters could be met at any time in any age. A must read (as far as I am concerned)I purchased the Kindle version so that I have it with me when I travel. Here my issue is that the reproduction was choppy."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"\\"Persuasion\\" is a great literary work, and, to my mind, Jane Austen's finest book. This was her final completed novel before her death, and was published posthumously. As is often the case with Ms. Austen's fiction, \\"Persuasion\\" deals with the social issues of the times and paints a fascinating portrait of Regency England, especially when dealing with the class system. Rigid social barriers existed - and everyone wanted to marry \\"up\\" to a higher station - and, of course, into wealth. This is also a very poignant and passionate story of love, disappointment, loss and redemption. The point Austen makes here, is that one should not ever be persuaded to abandon core values and beliefs, especially for ignoble goals. There are consequences, always.Sir Walter Elliot, Lord of Kellynch Hall, is an extravagant, self-aggrandizing snob, and a bit of a dandy to boot. He has been a widower for many years and spends money beyond his means to increase his social stature. His eldest daughter, who he dotes on, is as conceited and spoiled as he is. The youngest daughter, Anne, is an intelligent, sensitive, capable and unassuming woman in her late twenties when the story opens. She had been quite pretty at one time, but life's disappointments have taken their toll and her looks are fading. She and her sister are both spinsters. Anne had once been very much in love with a young, and as yet untried, navel officer. A woman who had been a close friend to Anne's mother, persuaded Anne to \\"break the connection,\\" convincing her that she could make a much better match. After much consideration, Anne did not follow her heart or her better instincts, and she and her young officer, Frederick Wentworth, separated. She has never again found the mutual love or companionship that she had with him. Anne's older sister never married either, because she hadn't found anyone good enough! She still hopes, however, for an earl or a viscount.The Elliot family is forced to financially retrench because of their extravagance. They lease Kellynch Hall to...of all people...Wentworth's sister and her husband. Elliot, his oldest daughter and her companion, move to a smaller lodging in Bath for the season, leaving Anne to pack up their belongings before joining them. She gets the Cinderella treatment throughout the book. Anne decides to first visit with her middle sister, an abominably spoiled, whiny hypochondriac, Mrs. Musgrove. She has made a good, but not brilliant match to a local squire. Her husband, Charles Muskgrove, his parents, and their two younger, eligible daughters, Louisa and Henrietta, are delightful. They all tolerate Mrs. Muskgrove, barely, and adore Anne. It is at the Muskgrove estate that Anne meets Frederick Wentworth again, after his absence of seven years. He is in the neighborhood, because his sister is now in the area, residing at Kellynch, of course. Wentworth is now a Captain in the Royal Navy and quite wealthy. When their eyes meet for the first time, you can absolutely feel Anne's longing and remorse. He is aloof with Anne, although civil. The man was hurtfully rejected once before and it appears that he still feels her snub. Now Wentworth is on the marriage market and Louisa sets her cap for him. Accidents and various adventures ensue, from the resorts of Lyme and Bath to the Muskgrove estate, bringing Anne and Wentworth closer together. The passion between the two is sooo palpable, although Very understated, (this is Regency England after all). I think this is Ms. Austen at her most passionate. Some scholars say that she modeled Anne Elliot after herself.This remarkable novel, and the issues it tackles, is just as germane today as it was when written. And the romance...well, no one does romance better than Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"The experience of reading _Persuasion_ is closer to that of reading _Jane_Eyre_ than it is to reading _Emma_ or _Pride_and_Prejudice_. Anne, our heroine, is a cut above those around her. She suffers through her social life and keeps her observations to herself. As in Austen's other books, there's plenty of wit to enjoy from the outside. But there's also a deep identification with Anne that brings out the poignancy and suspense of the romance until by the last twenty pages I could hardly stand it. And ahhhh, the payoff. Wonderful."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"A wonderfully clever novel. This was my first Jane Austen novel,and I wasn't disappointed - although a bit surprised that it wasn't boring as I feared. This is the story of Anne who loses her chance at first love. When she has a second chance at love with the same man, we fear she will fail again, but Austen keeps the reader on the edge of the chair in suspense and (sometimes frustration). What a master at turning the phrase, of creating so vividly the class conflict, and the tension inherent in Victorian manners. A definitive exploration in the art of persuasion. Now I'll have to read some others, but I chose Persuasion as my first, because it got the best Amazon.com reviews. Sounds like a poor reason I know, but I was afraid that I might find Austen's work too far away from our own times to find compelling. I need not worry."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"If you are a Jane Austen fan, as I am, you will surely enjoy Persuasion. The basic premise is about a young woman who was persuaded to let the love of her life get away, but now he has come back and she's wondering if she still has a chance. Books from this era accurately reflect how actions of individuals were always to be moderate and proper. Nowadays there would be no reason for this book because more likely than not the individuals involved would simply confront each other with questions to find out how the other felt. But back then being so forward was unheard of. So what we have here is a book filled with sexual/romantic tensions that makes for a very exciting read. Jane Austen's biggest flaw, in my opinion, is not milking the climax of her stories for all they're worth. When you reach the scenes in her books that everything has been leading up to, they are always brushed over with scant details and little actual dialogue so that you can't really feel what took place. A bonus about the Austen novels is that they are not so long that it is intimidating just to open them. Overall I would rate this as the best Austen book."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This was the first Jane Austen book that I have read, and I loved it dearly. So much so that I devoured it in two sittings, two days! Seeing the 1995 BBC movie version made me go out and purchase the book. The book and movie are excellent if you are an incurable romantic such as myself. The writing is brilliant, the characters well-crafted. Anne is a heroine of today, thoroughly modern in every way! Amanda Root and Cirian Hinds do a remarkable job in the movie. Please do yourself a favor and read the book though first."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Persuasion was the last book Jane Austen wrote and in many ways it is the most complete example of the style that endears her as much to modern readers as it did to readers from the nineteenth century. Austen was always demure but she had claws and her books are much more about sex than most of her contemporaries' work. (The act itself, of course, is never mentioned).Persuasion's plot is based around the possibility of the rekindling of a romance, which burned brightly when the two protagonists were younger, and which was thwarted because the forces of familiar persuasion made Anne Elliott reject her love for Captain Wentworth. All of Austen's plots are romantic staples revolving around the constant impediments placed between the heroine and her ideal man but, unlike the plots of many novels contemporaneous to Austen's, these impediments are not Gothic in nature - they are merely the frustrating minutiae of everyday life. To be sure, the denouements are invariably happy but when we think about what would happen, if these people were real, afterwards, we can foresee myriad problems and further barriers to happiness. (For example, in Pride and Prejudice: how is Lizzie going to cope with Darcy's family and, in Persuasion: how is Anne, happily ensconced with her paramour, going to cope with her own dysfunctional family? No matter, Jane has done her job and brought the two lovers together.)One of the most entertaining aspects of Austen's technique are her ironic narrative asides. We, as readers, are given access to the feelings of the main protagonists before they reveal them to the world (in Pride and Prejudice we know that Darcy is besotted with Lizzie well before he declares his amour, and in Persuasion we know that Captain Wentworth still carries a torch for Anne Elliott while she is still assuming that all hope of a rekindled romance has been dashed because of her earlier propensity to be persuaded against her emotions).One of the most curious aspects of Austen's wonderful assortment of characters is the strangely brutal way she portrays families. There is always at least one member of the principle family who is deeply flawed - both Lizzie's parents in Pride and Prejudice, Marianne and Elinor's weak brother and vile sister-in-law in Sense and Sensibility, and Emma's neurasthenic father (a mild critique compared to the sharpness of the other characterizations). Nowhere is this \\"critique of the family\\" more keenly delineated than in Persuasion. Anne Elliot's father is a complete fool obsessed with physical appearances above all else, and it is clear that Anne has little respect for him or her own sisters. Austen invested all her idealization of character in her main protagonists - in this case Anne and Captain Wentworth. While not always physically attractive, Austen's heroines are always morally complete (except for the ever-so-slightly capricious Emma) - and Anne Elliot, the heroine of Persuasion, is surely more a portrait of Jane Austen than any of her other heroines: she is no longer young, has lost the full bloom of youthful beauty, and has been disappointed in love because she heeded the wishes of others, and not of her heart and her mind.We know, by reading any of Jane Austen's books, of her fierce intelligence, biting wit and brilliant observational powers of familiar human behavior. And she could be deliciously bitchy, as this example from Persuasion shows:\\"(Anne and Cpt Wentworth) were actually on the same sofa, for Mrs Musgrove had most readily made room for him - they were divided only by Mrs Musgrove. It was no insignificant barrier indeed. Mrs Musgrove was of a comfortable substantial size, infinitely more fitted by nature to express good cheer and good humour than tenderness and sentiment; and while the agitations of Anne's slender form, and pensive face, may be considered as very completely screened, Captain Wentworth should be allowed some credit for the self-command with which he attended to her large fat sighings over the destiny of a son, whom alive nobody had cared for.\\"That might seem sardonic enough, but here's the clincher!\\"Personal size and mental sorrow have certainly no necessary proportions. A large bulky figure has as good a right to be in deep affliction as the most graceful set of limbs in the world. But, fair or not fair, there are unbecoming conjunctions, which... taste cannot tolerate - which ridicule will seize.\\"Anne Elliott is certainly less ironic than the voice of the narration (Austen herself), but she seems to be a manifestation of what Jane Austen thought of herself, or at least, how she would like to be: intelligent, kind, sensitive to other's feelings, and most importantly, someone who is valued for these qualities rather than for beauty and money. Persuasion is a good read: it's not as cheeky as Emma or as involved as Pride and Prejudice, but there are plenty of the great Austen ironic (and even sarcastic) flourishes. And the intelligence of her writing is a delight."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Not always the most popular of Austen novels but definitely reflective of her older amd more mature style. It is interesting as this is the first time that the Napoleonic Wars are actively referred to, and yet the only novel she completed in peace time.Written at the end of the Napoleonic Wars it is about Anne, daughter of a somewhat snobbish small country gentleman whose idea of himself is far exceeded by his actual worth. She has been persuaded to refuse the only offer for her hand in marriage to a low ranked officer. Now years later through a bad coincidence he has returned to the neighbourhood. He has done well in the wars and is now highly ranked and wealthy from his prize money.Anne must contend with her own feelings even as she sees him happy with the daughters of her neighbour - perhaps ready to chose one of them as his wife.This is very much the conflict of class over substance, of appearance over reality and of the ability to trust one's self over the persuasions of others around.Letters play an enormously important part in Austen's novels, and the use of a letter in this book is wildly romantic and almost dangerous in the context of the situation.I love this novel, it involves an older, more mature heroine, and one who really deserves to be loved. It has much gentler sequences in it than say the rambunciousness of Pride and Prejudice.I may be biased about Austen, but I believe they make some of the best reading about - funny, wildly romantic and deeply satisfying to read."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"If you're interested in reading some Austen and haven't before, I would recommend you read Persuasion first as it is the quickest read and, in some ways, the most fulfilling (I know that's subjective!). But I found this book SO \\"lovely\\" and much more fast-paced and intriguing than some of Austen's others. Pride and Prejudice is my favorite by far, but this is a great second. The characters are fabulously complex with the frustrating exterior of serenity. Also, if you are interested: there are some great commentaries on women's position in society during the 19th century in Britain which I found so interesting. Specifically a conversation toward the end in the final party!If you love this book, or other Austens, READ READ READ Reading Lolita in Tehran. It's fabulous and makes Austen so much more interesting and intellectual!"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"There is no doubt how I doat upon Jane Austen's novels. Add &quot;Persuasion&quot; to the list. Her last finished novel, published after Austen's death, &quot;Persuasion&quot; is a mature novel in more senses than one. Our heroine, Anne Elliot, is in her late twenties, by far older than say, an Elizabeth Bennet (&quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;) or an Emma Woodhouse (&quot;Emma&quot;). In addition, Anne seems to have more freedom to move socially and personally than most of Austen's earlier heroines. Within the restrictive pecking order that governs Austen's ficitional world, this is saying something, since Anne is often presented as limited by family and 'connexions'. &quot;Persuasion&quot; is a subtle work, as Anne's actions generally take place outside of, and even in spite of, the fashionable circles her family frequents. All of this combines to form a novel of understated depth and skill.&quot;Persuasion&quot; begins in 1814 - turmoil unsettles the Elliot family of Kellynch-hall - Sir Walter Elliot and his eldest daughter, Elizabeth, live beyond their means upholding family and social pride, and are feeling pressure from creditors and friends to reconstitute their lifestyle. Reluctantly renting their estate to an Admiral and Mrs. Croft, Sir Walter and his darling Elizabeth retreat to a smaller situation at the ultra-fashionable resort town of Bath. Sir Walter's middle daughter, Anne, stays behind with an honored family acquaintance, Lady Russell, intending to join the rest of the family shortly.In retirement thus at Uppercross, Anne is shortly confronted by a change of society - including the return of two men of consequence in her past, a cousin and former heir to her father's estate, William Elliot, and Captain Frederick Wentworth, with whom she broke a long engagement eight years before. Throughout the novel, Anne finds herself forced to negotiate her way through the flippant vanity of her father and sisters, the reserved judiciousness of her adviser Lady Russell, and her unfortunate friend, Mrs. Smith, while contemplating the possibilities of reestablishing her family's estate with Mr. Elliot or rekindling her affections for Captain Wentworth.Having recently read &quot;The Romance of the New World&quot; by Joan Pong Linton, I found myself drawn in &quot;Persuasion&quot; to the overarching theme of middle class industry and social advancement versus the supposed inherent virtues of landed nobility. With the exception of William Elliot, who only anticipates an inheritance, none of the novel's various suitors, Wentworth, Captain Benwick, Charles Hayter, etc., are directly linked to landed money. Especially in the cases of Wentworth and Benwick, service in the Royal Navy is most often and most convincingly presented as an avenue for monetary, and increasingly, social advancement. A brief scene in which the Dowager Viscountess Dalrymple notices Captain Wentworth in a crowd is enough to show us the virtues and attractiveness of a self-made man in Austen's largely aristocratic (if minor aristocracy) fictional universe.There is in &quot;Persuasion,&quot; as in most of Austen, a good deal of time afforded to character development, especially in the context of what I like to call background-checks. In &quot;Persuasion&quot; however, moreso than usual, Anne Elliot is largely left to herself to decide how to proceed in her own most sensitive matters. That she operates outside of her family's regard, and that of her own trusted friend Lady Russell, makes her unique, strong, and more assertive and self-sufficient than many Austen heroines. &quot;Persuasion&quot; is an excellent, intimate novel, with many exquisitely crafted moments of pain, pleasure, and humor. It is one I cannot wait to read again."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"For those familiar with Austen's work, Persuasion will be both familiar and somewhat different. All of Austen's works are simple romances, but this one is another unique part of her writing. In most of her novels, Austen had a young heroine, who is blocked from the hero by rivals. In Persuasion, the heroine is Anne Elliot, who is 27 and cannot marry the hero, Captain Wentworth, because of a previous aborted romance. Their history blocks them, but they still manage to overcome it.Austen again manages to create believable characters with sharp wit. However, while good, this book in my opinion isn't in the same great class as Pride and Prejudice, Mansfield Park or Emma. For me its partially because of its Autumnal air and its rather tiresomely familiar at times. Anne's father, Sir Walter Elliot's character is vanity from beginning to end. Why Austen chose to always have a negative father caricature is a mystery to me. The theme of the navy versus the nobility is also very prevalent. Other lesser characters, such as the Admiral and his wife, Lady Russell, William Elliot and Mrs. Smith are truly alive. So despite my misgivings, Austen sharpened her art enough for a book that makes a great read. It is a read that people will continue to experience for years to come."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Just what I ordered! Thank you! Great seller!I recommend product to anyone!I love the book!

I would recommend this book to any whose a Jane Austen fan."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Persuasion is an interrupted love story, not as piquant as Austen's other novels, but stimulating and provocative in more subtle ways. In a way, it is a study of how we are influenced or persuaded to make choices in our lives, both from within and without, and it is also a study of character. Anne is by far the most likable character, and it is her innately good character that is contrasted with all the others, but for me, Anne is far too restrained to be wholly likable. In one scene, Anne translates an Italian libretto, which she does with great skill, but she refuses to go beyond mere translation and discuss the music due to its romantic nature, which would be inappropriate. The overriding concern for all the characters is always to be socially correct. Persuasion lacks any really spritied characters. But then, why should all stories have spirited characters? There's nothing wrong with a story about more ordinary people. And the way Austen has these \\"ordinary\\" people talking, it is pure literary pleasure to read and savor the English language expressed so eloquently."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"My sister had been raving about Persuasion, but after reading a few of Austen's books, I was very relunctant to read it. When I had to read something for English class, I chose Persuasion--hoping I wouldn't be bored out of my mind. Shortly, I was drawn into the world of the heroine: Anne Elliot, and could hardly put the book down! Although Persuasion is predictable, it is, in my opinion, one of the best books ever!"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"PERSUASION, the last novel that Jane Austen completed before her death in 1818, tells the story of one Anne Elliot, the second daughter of a baronet who has spent his waythrough his fortune and has nothing but his title to lean on.When she was 21 years old, Anne fell in love with and was engaged to Frederick Wentworth, a young captain in the Navy. Her belated mother's best friend, Lady Russell, dissapproves of the match as being below Anne, due to Anne's claim to nobility, and Anne cancels the engagement, much to her and and Captain Wentworth's grief.Nearly eight year's have passed since she broke off her engagement to Captain Wentworth when she, Lady Russell, and a Mr. Shepherd, a friend of her father's, are forced to pose and intervention and tell her father that he must quit his estate and find someone to lease it to, or he will be sent tot he poorhouse. Her father, his only pride being in his social position and personal appearance, relents, but only if they can find suitable tenants - which they do in Admiral Croft and his wife, the sister of Captain Wentworth.Anne thinks that her broken heart has mended, until she sees him again. unfortunately, he is now attached to another . . . and yet Anne sees clues in his behavior that he may be hers once again. Anne and Wentworth must negotiate their past, their different social classes, and proper behavior to find their way back to one another.What sets PERSUASION appart from Austens' other novels is how modern it seems in comparison. Austen takes more liberty with point of view in this novel, the characters have much richer inner lives than the Bennet's or Dashwood's ever did.This novel is highly recommended to anyone who would enjoy Jane Austen. Though the ending is predictable, it does not always seem so, and therefore the novel was a very suspenseful read."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"In my opinion, Persuasion is probably Heyer's most underrated book. Most people read Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibilty and Emma, but Persuasion doesn't get nearly as much attention, which is very sad as I think it's probably Austen's best-written novel. Perhaps people don't read it because it's about an \\"older\\" hero and heroine, and the heroine is not beautiful, nor is she very spunky or spirited. The story also develops in a much more subtle way than some of Austen's others. Whatever the reason for its lack of popularity, however, it definitely deserves a wider following.Not only is it the most romantic of Austen's books(in my opinion), but it also has the greatest characters! They're funny, silly, stupid, and manipulative- and therefore, completely memorable. And the hero and heroine are just the sort one wants to cheer for, and see settled happily. I admit that P&P;, S&S; and Emma are fun reads, and they'll always have a huge following. Persuasion won't ever reach that level of fandom, but it's definitely on my favorites list and deserves a reading."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Persuasion is one of my favourite novels by Jane Austen.

After a few years she still loves the man she broke up with. As she meets him again a couple of years later, he has made a lot of money as Captain . At first they try to keep out of their way, but that seems to be impossible. They meet eachother really often, because the relatives of Anne want him to mary one of their daughters. The love is still there , in both of them, but manners and doubts make it impossible to tell.Like in all Jane Austen's novels there are implications and disaccords that let you always hope for a Happy End .And for my opinion Jane Austen wrote the most romantic loveletter in that book."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This book is one of my favorites of all time. Many people dislike it or don't like it as much when compared to Pride and Prejudice or Emma, but there are many reasons why Persuasion should not be compared to Austen's other novels. This novel was the last one that Austen wrote before she died. It is a more mature novel, dealing with many issues not found in Austen's previous novels. One reason why people find faults with the book is that Anne Elliot, the heroine, is not as spunky or witty as an Elizabeth Bennett or an Emma Woodhouse. There is not so much wit flowing in the dialogue between characters, or even dialogue in general. But these differences between the novels make this one so unique.It is a novel of second chances. Anne Elliot, no longer in the bloom of youth, is a grown woman of 27 or 28 years. Eight years ago she had been happily in love with a handsome man named Frederick Wentworth. But, unfortunately, due to his financial status, and Anne under the influence of her family and close friend, was forced to reject his marriage proposal and they parted ways. But now, he is within her closest circle once again. Circumstances led to Anne staying with her married sister, Mrs. Musgrove, while her own house was being let to Wentworth's sister and husband. Wentworth visits his sister and on calling on the Musgroves finds Anne among them. Anne finds Wentworth, not only looking as good as he ever did, but is now Captain Wentworth, who has made his fortune. Wentworth, still angry with Anne over being rejected, causes him to treat Anne very coolly. But over many weeks of contact here and there, you catch on that Captain Wentworth isn't all that oblivious to Anne anymore, because of all the little 'glimpses' he throws at Anne. The tension between the two is amazing. You can sense a connection between the two, even though they are on opposite ends of the room. In Bath, the tension builds and builds until it culminates into one of the most moving and romantic reunions ever. The letter that Wentworth writes to Anne declaring his love is bound to bring a tear to your eye and a pang in your heart. Happily, all ends well, but throughout the novel you can easily sympathize with Anne. No longer youthful and no longer as pretty as she used to be, she is full of self-consciousness and confusion. She still loves him after all those years, but she is unsure whether or not he still loves her.Austen, yet again, excels in portraying her characters. Anne and Captain Wentworth are full and delightful characters that one must love. Her descriptions of Anne's vain father and snobbish older sister, Elizabeth, hit the mark on satirizing the members of society during that time. She wittingly describes how everyone tolerates Mrs. Musgrove's hypochondriatic self and how everyone deals with her in their own way. There is not so much dialogue between characters in this book, compared to Austen's other novels. Most of the book is in observation of Anne's character and feelings, which makes it so much easier to relate to everything that Anne feels and you understand her situation all the more. This is a wonderful novel, with many qualities, differing from those of Austen's previous novels, to enjoy and admire. Reading of getting a second chance in love is enough to lift anybody's heart and spirit and leave them happily satisfied with the book."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"My husband got me the Kindle for Christmas. I'm an avid reader, and my husband and kids get tired of all the books around the house! I've found it enjoyable for reading many things (can't use it for textbooks where I need the pictures), and it is lightweight which I need for my joint problems.Anyway, I have always loved Jane Austen, but this was one book I hadn't read yet. I had read that this was one of her last books, and that some of the tone of her books changed as she got older. Austen died most probably with breast cancer, so she most probably was dealing with some symptoms at this point in her life. I don't know if she was aware of her situation, that she may die soon, but this book has a certain poignancy in it. It doesn't seem as hopeful or as humorous as her other books that look at life for women in the early 1800's.By this time, she knew she would not have an opportunity to marriage. It's sad that women in England back then, especially those of the trade class/genteel middle class, were so dependent upon men choosing who to marry. They couldn't hold jobs, they had no rights as concerns inheritance, everything in their future depended upon their getting married. But during their lifetime they knew nothing different. Austen dealt with all of these problems, and the very real possibility of injury and disease and death curtailing the lives of women in this novel.She also dealt with snobbishness among the upper classes. That part of the book is hilarious as usual. She really knew how to draw these people, and their attitudes.By the time I got halfway through this book, I had a hard time putting it down. I really wish someone would write of our day and age, in this tone and with this ability to draw people. I haven't ever seen a writer to compare with her...I don't think I ever will."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"At 19-years-old, Anne Elliot was a beauty who fell in love with naval officer Captain Wentworth. The two shared a whirlwind romance; but the fact that Captain Wentworth was lacking in the financial department, caused the two to part ways. It wasn't that Anne wanted to say goodbye to Captain Wentworth; she was more bullied into it by Lady Russell, a friend of her deceased mother. Ten years have passed. Anne is now twenty-nine-years-old. Over the years, she has met no other suitor who tickled her fancy in the way that Captain Wentworth was able to. Thus, she has never gotten married. The fact that her father, Sir Walter Elliot is heavy handed when it comes to spending only makes Anne more convinced that she will never have a significant other; after all, she would not have much in terms of money to bring to a relationship. But then Captain Wentworth comes back.While the ten years which have passed have done little to mar Anne Elliot's beauty, they have done much to decrease the amount of money still left within her family. As a baronet, Sir Walter Elliot is obsessed with keeping up with the times, this means draping himself in all sorts of fashionable garb, and displaying his social rank for the world to see. When not glancing at himself in mirrors, Sir Walter Elliot spends his time with the scheming, husband-hungry, Mrs. Clay. Mrs. Clay, who has befriended Anne's older sister, Elizabeth, would do anything to catch herself a husband. Elizabeth is the same way. Unlike Anne, Elizabeth is just as obsessed with social status as her father; and both Elizabeth and Sir Walter Elliot look down upon Anne. Anne's other sister, Mary, who is married and has children, looks down upon Anne just as her sister and father. Mary expects Anne to wait on her hand and foot at all times - even when she is a guest in her own home. Anne is usually happy to oblige; but when she finds that her home, Kellynch Hall, will be rented out, and that she and her family must take up residence in Bath, she is quite disappointed. That is, until she runs into Captain Wentworth. Captain Wentworth is more dashing than ever before, and Anne can't help but feel the same attraction to him that overwhelmed her ten years ago. But with so much time gone, Anne can't tell if Captain Wentworth still feels the same way about her; and with other women vying for his attentions, she can't help but wonder if the two of them will ever be together again.I will admit that it took me a few chapters to truly become interested in PERSUASION; but once I was introduced to Anne Elliot, there was absolutely no turning back. From the moment Anne Elliot enters the story, you can't help but fall in love with her. She is demure, kind, intelligent, spirited, and debonair, in her own right. She is so willing to please those surrounding her, that, at times, the reader can't help but wish that she would lash out, and speak up for herself. Yet, perhaps, if she did just that, she wouldn't be as much of an appealing, lovable character. Captain Wentworth's quiet, shy, timid persona can be infuriating at times, but he is still a dashing, handsome male lead that you can't help but swoon over. The confusion between Captain Wentworth and Anne Elliot, regarding their relationship, can, at times be trying, as the reader wants to see the two of them together; but the mishaps produce a piece of dry humor that is entertaining and adds to the storyline. PERSUASION presents a whirlwind romance that you can't help but get swept up into!Erika SoroccoFreelance Reviewer"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This is my favorite Jane Austen novel, and also her last before her death. It's a quick read, and you can't go wrong when it's free on Kindle!"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"no difference between free and paid one, so why not choose a free one? :) This is good enough for reading."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"The characters and emotions in this book are some of Jane Austen's finest works, and I adore this book. I also adore Anne. All the better that I can now picture Rupert as Captain Wentworth whilst I read (I picture my own Anne, however). Oh, when she first sees him look at her like he used to! And, oh, his letter! Just remembering makes me hanker for another re-read! Just so lovely and emotional.If you love romance, this is one of the very best (although I now know to skip the visit to Mrs Smith, at the end, as I don't think it adds anything to the plot)."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"The plot was a bit frustrating due to misunderstandings and lack of communication by the main characters. Austen does meander through relationships well in order to sustain the reader's interest."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I confess: I was expecting a lot more from Persuasion. The premise of the book is interesting: it is the story of twenty-seven year old Anne Elliot. Eight years earlier, she rejected Frederick Wentworth, choosing her duty to her family over her love for him. Now, he's back again as a successful navy officer, and Anne thinks this might be their second chance. But he's courting the Musgrove sisters, and seems determined to ignore her.It all sounds very interesting, and Persuasion is definitely one of Jane Austen's more serious works, but the writing lacked something. It wasn't that witty or that interesting in the end. Maybe if I reread it a little later, I'll like it better, but it just didn't draw me in like Pride and Prejudice, and eventually, Emma. I couldn't really relate to Anne like I did to Elizabeth Bennet or Catherine Morland from Northanger Abbey. There wasn't enough of Wentworth. The background history was kind of vague. I'm sorry to be critical of anything of Jane Austen's, but this one just didn't work for me.Becky loved it, so I have to come a to a reluctant conclusion: We really don't have similar opinions on books. Books that I love she doesn't review, books that she loves I don't enjoy as much (generally.) Books that she reviews unfavorably I like. It's kind of sad.Back to Persuasion. As I said, it's a much more serious work; it's not necessarily about young love and flirtation. Anne is still fairly pretty, but she has to face the fact that if she doesn't marry soon, she'll be an old maid. There was a lot less snappy dialogue, and overall, I think it's just an inferior book. I do look forward to reading For Darkness Shows the Stars, a science fiction retelling of it (review coming soon.)All of my reviews can be read at my blog [...]"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Love the story and the writer. A must read for Austen fans and all lovers of good love stories and classics."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I know why this is considered a classic. The language used. Contemporary novels will never be written like this. It is like reading from an artists eyes. The way sentences are written is very different to the way they are written now. A lot of thought went into each [sentence] or rather Jane Austin is so gifted it comes second nature.Now for the book summary and highlights. It was tough to get into. About the sixth chapter is starts getting interesting. Often you put down a book if the first chapter fails to capture the imagination, but with a 'classic' you need a little patience and endurance. It is worth the wait.This review is after reading the classics of War and Peace, Crime and Punishment, the Art of War, Moby Dick, Andre Norton's Saragasso Series, Charles Dickens' Our Mutual Friend, Secret Adversary by Agatha Christie, Confucius' Sayings, Common Sense by Thmas Paine, and Treasure Island (to give this context). You see I did not enjoy reading when I was young, but now older and with a 1.25 hour commute on the train (to Brisbane from Gold Coast) and back, I have time !Compared to Charles Dickens, it is an easier read. Charles' book was a tougher read and more complex but it did go into Persuasion but moreso into the realm of manipulation. If you enjopy Persuasion, you should read Dickens' book. Mind you Dickens' book is an even tougher read - I re-read the first seven chapters 3 times ! but it is definitely worth it. Like digging for gold - you struggle a lot, but when you find the gold it is like WOW !Anne Elliott is somewhat ignored by her family (Father Sir Walter and Sister Elizabeth). Her mother passes and their finances are in disarray. Miss Russell a confidant of Sir Walter contrives a scheme to boost their cashflow while moving them elsewhere with little impact to their social-life. Anne who is steadfast and reasonable and even tempered throughout the story demonstrates that not everyone can be manipulated and if you are even-tempered and reasonable, nothing will escape your obsveration.She comes across Mr Worthington (admiral) and initially she hopes to marry him, then the persuausive schemes start and you know throughout the whole book, I'm looking for acts of Persuasion to give this book meaning and the answer is found in the last chapter and Jane Austin neatly ties the story into a happy ending. Through acts behind the seen a third party is after Anne's affections and this person works in concert with other key characters until Anne bumps into an old friend Mrs Smith and the whole scheme is turned on its head !In truth, the major drama surrounds louisa who falls while being silly and nearly kills herself, but the way it is written that part seems trivial and it is used to free certain people and allow certain things to swing in motion. If only Mr Elliot was there sooner and saved Louisa.... There's a thought, then this story may have gone a differnet direction. Read this and see if this review makes any sense at all !?!"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"\\"Persuasion\\" is the book a lot of people can relate to, including myself. A story of letting \\"The One\\" get away and the miracle of second chances. The title may not have been her choice (brother Henry named the book after her death), but this is all Austen. It shows how both society and greed for money can be very persuasive.The father, Sir Walter Elliot, is a selfish man who falls prey to extravagants. The widow with three daughters becomes indebted. He is influenced to rent out their home and stay at Bath. He is influenced by his eldest daughter, Elizabeth and Mrs. Clay (a greedy widow of slight lower class to the Elliots). Lady Russell is a friend of the Elliots and godmother to Ann. The Lady is the cause to the way Anne Eliot (at age 18) loses her true love, Frederick Wentworth. Lady Russell finds this was erroneous for persuading Anne's decision.At the age of 27, Anne Elliot is classified as spinster. Her two very selfish and arrogant sisters have both been indifferent towards their middle sister Anne. Anne has let everyone control her in every way. In my opinion, I can understand Frederick's hesitation towards rekindling his love to Anne.The novel is a favorite of mine. It is shorter than all of Jane's novels and the storyline more simple, but it's still a great love story. I agree that it is like a Cinderella story.

This is quite frankly well written happy tales - much like today's best sellers in pink dust jackets. Persuasion is very similar to Pride and Prejudice - the mood is the same, the excessive one-dimensional characters are the same and the message is quite similar. Still, the strength of the novel, apart from some splendid literary gymnastics, is how it does not take itself very seriously at all. It seems as if Austen simply wanted to write another \\"pretty little piece\\". Call it formulaic, if you like, but Austen knew her strength, as well as her audience.The heroine, Anne, is quite delightful - similar to Elizabeth Bennet in her thoughts and actions. The vain father figure, Sir Walter Eliot, is as comedic as her hypochondriac sister, Mary. The villain, however, is not as good as her other ones - he is bland and dreary, and not all that deliciously bad.My favorite parts of the story are the various observasions of female beauty. Of what does it consist - and how does it change through time? A woman's \\"years of dread\\" are still her thirties - if she is unmarried, that is. The lamentations over hideous crows feet, freckles, faded or coarse skin and the general loss of blom are in many ways just as prevalent in current female literature...Recommended as a sweet little treat - nothing more, but nothing less."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I can't stop reading this book andthe fact that it has kind of an old english doesn't seem to bother me at all."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Not only did I receive my purchase in a timely manner, but I also found the book to be in excellent condition and exactly what I asked for.

That's the problem for Anne Elliott, the heroine of Jane Austen's final novel \\"Persuasion\\" -- a delicate romance that takes place AFTER the romance, rejection and heartrending sorrow. There's some slight roughness around the edges, but the story and the characters are simply brilliant.Eight years ago, Anne Elliott was engaged to the handsome, intelligent and impoverished sailor Frederick Wentworth, but was persuaded to dump him by the family friend Lady Russell.Now she's twenty-seven (ancient by the time's standards), and her vain father Sir Walter is facing financial ruin. So he decides to relocate to Bath and rent out the vast family estate -- and it turns out that the new tenant is Frederick's brother-in-law. Of course, Anne still loves Frederick, but he doesn't seem to feel the same, especially since he's rumored to be interested in some younger, flirtier girls.And Anne's worries increase when she joins her family in Bath, where her father is attempting to live the lifestyle he feels he deserves (since he's a baronet). His heir, William Elliott, recently reestablished contact with his relatives -- and he seems very interested in Anne. But Anne suspects that he has ulterior motives... even if she doesn't realize how Frederick truly feels about her.It's pretty obvious that Jane Austen wrote \\"Persuasion\\" late in her life -- not only is Anne Elliott older than her other heroines, but she seems to have been more sympathetic to women who bowed to society's \\"persuasions.\\" This was the last book that Austen wrote before her untimely death, and it was only published posthumously.As a result, the book can be a little rough and the story is rather simple. But Austen's writing is still intense and powerfully vivid. Her prose is elegant and smooth, and her dialogue is full of hidden facets. The half-hidden love story of Anne and Frederick is among Austen's most skillful writing (\\"I am half agony, half hope. Tell me not that I am too late, that such precious feelings are gone for ever\\"), and it's virtually impossible not to be moved by it.And Austen went out of her way to praise the self-made man, who got ahead through merit instead of birth (something that bugs Sir Walter). She also pokes holes in social climbers, vain aristocrats (\\"Few women could think more of their personal appearance than he did\\"), nasty family and false friends.Anne herself is a very rare heroine, both then and now -- she's past her designated \\"marriage\\" years and would have been considered a lost cause. But she remains remains kind, thoughtful, quiet, intelligent, and as time goes on she starts to appreciate her own judgement instead of being \\"persuaded.\\" And Captain Wentworth is a vibrant portrayal of a strong man who worked his way to the top, but had to do so without the woman he loved.Jane Austen's last finished novel is a little rough in places, but the exquisite beauty of Frederick and Anne's love story is simply staggering. Truly a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Jane Austen's Persuasion stands shoulder to shoulder with the best of the author's work. Emma and Pride & Prejudice are equally extraordinary novels and I don't think one has to engage in a tug of war over which is best: each has its charms and delights. The story of Anne Elliot, who enters into an engagement at age 20, only to succumb to family pressure and break it off, is 28 and alone when we meet her. Time has proven what she instinctively knows: Frederick Wentworth was the right man for her and she was foolish to let him go.His reappearance sets the stage for what is, at once a masterpiece of comedy, romance and satire. Anne's vainglorious father and sisters are deftly skewered, but in that mocking but never mean Austen style. The appearance of an estranged cousin and Captain Wentworth's apparent attachment to a neighborhood belle complicates matters wonderfully until we reach the inevitable happy conclusion.What sets this novel apparent, I think are two characteristics. Picking up the story eight years after Anne's mistake is a wonderful device. We don't meet a perfectly sensible woman (Elizabeth Bennett) or a delightful ingenue (Emma Woodhouse). Anne Elliot is a mature woman, indeed by social standards close to an old maid, and one left to regret her own poor judgment. Her situation is one any empathetic reader can identify with (who hasn't judged wrongly in Romance?) and creates a humility that is quite appealing. Unlike Elizabeth and Emma who need to learn the error of their ways, Anne already knows--she simply needs to be excused them.Secondly, unlike some Austen works, characters are far more dimensional. Anne is weak, but well-intended. Wentworth acknowledges he is bitter and resentful and acknowledges he fails to initiate a reconciliation out of pride, losing further years they might have been together. Elliot pere and Elliot the heir are quite cartoonish as is sister Elizabeth. However Anne's friend and confident and her sister Mary are more nuanced and therfore more appealing than most of Austen's minor characters.Is Persuasion worth reading? Without a doubt! Where does it fit in the Austen cannon? I think in the first rank. But everyone should decide for themselves."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Austen's last is one of the famed four -- Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility, Emma, and this novel, the most melancholy but also perhaps most romatic of the quartet. I also highly recommend the filmPersuasion"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I started reading this novel years ago, when I was reading all of Jane Austen, and I didn't finish it. It was too tense and agonizing. The suspense was almost painful: here is this young woman in her late twenties, still in love with a man she rejected because of family pressure eight years ago, and he comes back into her life. At first he seems cold and distant, but then she begins to think that maybe he still loves her too. But in this society, the woman can't speak first. She can't simply say to him, \\"I still love you, and I'm sorry I didn't accept your proposal eight years ago. I was given bad advice by my family.\\" No, she has to wait for him to put aside his pride and ask if maybe she's changed her mind about him. She's on pins and needles the whole time, and there are terrible humiliations, and she's treated very badly by her family, but in the end it all works out.Still, it's so painful to think that women once lived like this: utterly dependent on marriage for survival; dreading being an old maid; prevented from doing any kind of real work at all; prisoners of a rigid class system; and silenced by rigid gender role conventions."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Persuasion is Jane Austen's last completed work before her death. It differs from her other more well known works such as Pride & Prejudice, and Emma. It focuses on a relationship who have a second chance to re-ignite true love but whether or not they will depends on so many things that make a good story and are still applicable today.A crazy family, social expectations, unforgiveness, competing love interests, and a little bit of that classic Austen wit that bites in just the right places.It's shorter than Austen's other works as well, and the plot less complicated and detailed than Pride & Prejudice and Mansfield Park.If for no other reason than the famous \\"you pierce my soul\\" letter, this should be a must on everyone's read list."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Frankly I am puzzled by the criticisms leveled at this edition.

Austen had only 11 months to live when she completed it in 1816. Austen is the best writer in the language at taking a few upper-middle class rural families, a few love stories and arch social commentary into the heady mix that is her literary genius! Her observations of the social mores and balls, clothing style, music, literature, architecture and daily life of Regency England(1811-1820-the Prince Regent George IV assumed responsibility while his father George III became insane). is superb in its comic prose.The tale's main theme is how humans are persuaded to perform and also avoid moral actions which will determine how they live their lives. Eight years prior to the novel's opening we learn that Anne Eliot had earlier rejected the proposal of British naval officer Frederick Wentworth. She was persuaded to pursue this action due to the advice of her of a well meaning wealthy woman.Now Anne's impecunious and fatuously highfaultin baronet of a father has to lease his home due to pay his many debts. Her older sister Elizabeth is a hypocritcal prig who has to be one of the most odious creatures in Austen's work. Captain Wentworth returns to the village of Kellynch since his sister and her husband have rented the Eliot home. (they have departed for the watering hole of Bath). Eventually Anne and her Wentworth met, reconcile and are wed. Along the way we meet such characters as Anne's idiotic sister Mary and her husband who spends most of his time hunting. There are also a few subsidary love stories featuring Anne's siblings and the Musgrave girls. The fall of Lousia Mulgrave off the cob at Lyme is famous at is shows Anne that Wentworth still has feelings of love for her.The novel is lighter and less complex than such tomes as \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", \\"Mansfield Park\\" and \\"Emma.\\" It was published in four volumes along with Jane's early work \\"Northanger Abbey\\" following her early death.One is left to wonder how many more small but elegant literary gems would have been produced by Miss Austen. Her books take us back over 150 years to a relatively stable and staid society. If one would be allowed b by the literary gods to invite three authors to dinner this reviewer would choose: Samuel Johnson, Oscar Wilde and Jane Austen. \\"Persuasion\\"will be broadcast on the BBC production to be shown on Masterpiece Theatre this autumn. Hopefully viewers of the series will turn to the real McCoy and enjoy the many pages of the preacher's kid named Jane!"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"While not Jane Austen's most popular novel, this story of longing, regret and love, full with the satire and keen observations of the social graces of the period, is one of my personal favorites. The heroine Anne Elliot is an interesting lady caught in a times where women had very little independence and means to pursue their own happiness, and where family connections dictated most social interactions. Her journey to reclaim her love and more important her sense of self is very heartwarming. And her dashing Captain Wentworth, while still a pround gentleman finally lets his own emotions towards Anne steer him, and her to a happy conclusion. I am great fan of romantic literature, and Jane Austen does not dissapoint."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"The same remarks apply that I gave regarding Thos.

Austen presents a very strong heroine in Anne Elliot, whose only false step in life seems to have been her allowing a trusted friend to persuade her not to marry sweetheart Captain Wentworth. When they next meet, years later, he has made his fortune in the wars, and she has become the official spinster of the family, deeply regretting her decision not to marry him. What happens next is enthralling not so much for the plot, but the detail with which Austen describes the turbulent emotions of the outwardly calm, collected and staid Anne Elliot."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I am a huge Jane Austin fan.

But that was years ago before Anne's well-meaning friend and her less-than-good-intentioned family discouraged the acquaintance and Anne was convinced to give Frederick up.With years to think of her decision and years to consider all that Wentworth has accomplished without her, Anne has little hope of seeing him again or changing things between them.That is until a change in her father's circumstance forces the family to rent their estate. Given the identity of the new tenants, it seems inevitable that Anne and Captain Wentworth will see each other. It even seems inevitable that Wentworth will be angry and Anne hurt. Only time will tell if they can once again be something more to each other in Persuasion (1818) by Jane Austen.Persuasion is Austen's last novel. It is also a favorite among several of my friends.*With a book that is already such a large part of the public consciousness and the literary canon, there isn't a lot to say in a review that hasn't been said before.Jane Austen is one of my favorite classic authors so it is not, perhaps, especially surprising that I enjoyed Persuasion. In addition to a story that kept me on my toes,** Persuasion features a lot of strong, or at least interesting, characters. Wentworth is appropriately dashing even at his worst. Then we have Anne who is a delightfully forward heroine for a novel from 1818. It was invigorating to watch Anne come into her own as the novel progressed and she developed her own agency and the wherewithal to pursue her own wants and needs.Like many classics Persuasion is a book many people will read on the merits of its reputation (or for school) or it's the kind of book they won't touch. One review might not change whatever opinion you might have but Persuasion is an obvious must read for romantics and anyone who likes their heroines level-headed and ready to stand on their own two feet.*Though one does add the caveat that Pride and Prejudice first has to be taken out of the equation as Pride and Prejudice is arguably everyone's favorite Austen novel.**My only experience with Persuasion before this reading was Diana Peterfreund's post-apocalyptic retelling For Darkness Shows the Stars. I had never even seen a movie version so I really had no idea what to expect from the story. At. All. It made for a pleasant surprise while reading.Possible Pairings: Graffiti Moon by Cath Crowley, Middlemarch by George Eliot, The Disreputable History of Frankie Landau-Banksby E.

And it didn't. I only purchased this book because it was free and because I was OK with Jane Austen's NORTHANGER ABBEY, introduced by my sister. I promptly forgot about it. The only reason I ever got around to reading it was because I was bored out of my skull, and looking for something to read. I saw this book, remembered NORTHANGER ABBEY, and decided to read the reviews. It looked decent, so I gave it a try.I couldn't put this book down! I stayed up till 11:00 p.m. reading it! Normally I go to bed at 8:30 to 9:00. And just to give you a better idea of how much I liked it, I read it in two days. This is not a \\"short read.\\"Jane Austen has a skill in making characters come to life. I have been able to connect with each and every one of her heroines, though Elizabeth in PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is too contemptous of others. Her books give an idea of the value placed in rank back then. It makes one glad for the semi-equality in the modern world. I loved the dialogues, and Mary, Anne's sister is so ridiculous you want to laugh.Anne falls in love with a poor sailor, Captain Wentworth, but is persuaded that she can make a much better match. She spends the next eight years regretting this decision, and wishing she had followed her better instincts. Captain Wentworth makes his fortune, but his pride is too much damaged to return to Anne. Fate throws them together again in the end as Anne's father rents their house to the Crofts, close relations to Captain Wentworth, and they begin to see each other much more often than they are comfortable with. I will let you discover what happens next, as one review spoiled it all for me.I have now broadened my knowledge of Jane Austen's novels. All of them are very good.

It is also poignant, thought-provoking, heart-wrenching, satirical... I re-read it at least once a year, and am always amazed at how much Anne's story has come to mean to me.This book makes me laugh and it makes me cry. It combines all the elements that make an Austen novel an Austen novel. Sir Walter is a most hilarious buffoon, Mr. Elliot is as evil a villain as there can be, Mary is the quintessential spoiled, selfish baby sister, and Captain Wentworth (sigh) is her most dashing, romantic hero. Yes, I will always have a soft spot in my heart for Darcy, but his love and devotion were not tested for &quot;eight years and a half.&quot; IMNSHO, someone who is NOT moved by Captain Wentworth's letter has a heart of stone."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"\\"Persuasion\\" is a novel written by Jane Austen during the Regency Period in England. It was a time where single women were not allowed to be left unchaperoned with a gentleman. A time where people wouldn't dare say impolite things to others, and marriage was a way to improve your wealth, circumstance, and station.This is one of the 6 completed novels written by Jane Austen, while this one isn't as popular and famous as \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" that does not mean it is without merit or any less worthy of praise. If you found yourself liking the movie or book \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" you should give this one a try.Our herione \\"Anne Elliot\\" is the middle daughter out of three. Her mother died when she was young, her father is a silly, vain, and selfish man who spent so much money they are now facing financial troubles. They live in a lovely home called \\"Kellylynch Hall\\" which they must leave to find cheaper lodgings. Now they rent their home out to this couple (Admiral and Mrs. Croft) and take up residence in Bath.Anne is an admirable heroine. One with much sense, honesty, and simplicity. Her two other siblings are not so worthy, her oldest sister takes after their father, selfish, vain, alway self-promoting. Her younger sister is already married with children and very needy. She is also very selfish and a little bit of a hypochondriat.Now when Anne's family leaves for Bath she does not go with them, instead she stays close to their family home while staying with her younger sister. Here Anne is able to live without the shadow of her family, make acquaintances, and be of much usefullness towards everyone. She soon meets up with Captain Wentworth, who proposed to her eight and half years ago and was rejected. Anne did not reject him because she did not love him, she was persuaded by her family. What will they do now seeing each other again after eight and a half years?Overall the story was a very intersting read, you grew very interested in all the characters and their personalities as you always do when you read Jane Austen. It is one of her shorter books around 250 pages. The beginning is the only hard part to read, you might lose interest there but keeping reading it gets better real soon.This edition includes a chapter that was omitted in the completed version, it was kind of a first draft option and Jane Austen chose another scene instead. I don't know if other versions of this book have that chapter. It was interesting to see the alternative ideas Jane Austen had."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Persuasion, Jane Austen's last novel, is the story of Anne Elliott and Frederick Wentworth, two young lovers who are persuaded to be separated rather than marrying when they first fall in love around age nineteen because of lack of prospects. The story picks up eight years later when circumstances have changed and the now Captain Wentworth has returned to the area with a successful career and Anne's family is now reduced in financial status. Anne wonders if perhaps Frederick might still harbor feelings for her, but this being Austen, things never go smoothly and there is quite a lot of wondering and subterfuge, and colorful characters to keep things amusing.This is not my favorite Austen; things started off quite slowly and there is not a great deal of dialogue. I did enjoy the fact that Frederick and Anne rediscovered each other relatively later in their lives, and as always, the build-up to the happy ending kept me smiling. While Persuasion doesn't have quite the emotional zing that Austen's earlier works do, it is still enjoyable. I doubt there's such a thing as an Austen novel that won't capture you in some way, and Persuasion accomplishes just that in its subtle, quiet style."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Those who read PERSUASION by Jane Austen tend to view it as a book primarily concerned with marriage in the typical Austen romantic comedy sense of young ladies seeking to marry upward and young men also seeking partners--but not necessarily to each other. While much of Austen's novel deals with precisely that, to view this solitary strand of thought as Austen's most telling point is surely to miss that point totally. In PERSUASION, Austen took her earlier PRIDE AND PREJUDICE and sought to show that her view on how single women relate to their families, their friends, their proposed husbands and to society at large underwent a significant change from the latter to the former.In PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, Austen places Elizabeth Bennett squarely in the traditional role of the 18th century woman who sought somehow to gain economic equality with men in such a way so as not to upset or circumvent the established social order that dictated that women must obey their parents and marry the men whom they selected as suitable candidates. Miss Bennett uses reason and general smarts to cause changes in Darcy that would in turn cause changes in the larger social order that acted as a behind the scenes puppeteer. The comedy then was a function of a small change in Miss Bennett causing a larger one in Darcy. In PERSUASION, Austen takes the similar plot of a young woman breaking up with a man that perhaps needed breaking up with and updated it to include Anne Elliot doing much the same thing with Captain Wentworth. In Elizabeth Bennett's case, Darcy determined not be chased away. In Anne Eliot's case, Wentworth made no such determination and left the scene for eight years. The difference between the two acts of breaking up and their respective reconciliations did not lay in a profound change in the social order. What changed was Jane Austen, who became more finely attuned to the winds of Romanticism that were then wafting from one country to another. The relentless focus on rationalism that dominated the Augustan Age had slowly morphed over just a few decades to one in which human feeling and emotion trumped human reason.Austen, in her choice of \\"Persuasion\\" as the title, subtly implied that what was at stake was not simply potential marriage partners waltzing a predictable if unstable dance towards the altar. Rather, she wished to point the reader in the direction of seeing not only how and why persuasive rhetoric might impact on lovers' lives, but also to ascertain the consequences of treating emotional people as if they were devoid of those emotions. In Miss Bennett's case, \\"persuasion\\" was used in the context of rational discourse used to alter the world view of Darcy. In Anne Elliot's case, it was used to fortify the existing social order at the expense of using \\"right reason\\" to convince Anne to break up with Wentworth on the grounds that he was simply too low on the economic and social pecking order to marry a woman who is supposed to be a few rungs higher than he. Actually, Austen satirizes Anne by implying that, if anything, her loftier position in society, exists mostly in her and her father's eyes, not at society's at large. Anne differs from Elizabeth Bennett in that in PERSUASION, Anne sees that she has erred in being falsely persuaded but is allowed to show and vent emotion in re-establishing accepted marital order even if the somewhat stodgier and old-fashioned social order balks. As Anne Elliot uses both head and heart to win back the love of a man who felt rightfully scorned for no good reason, Jane Austen focused attention on basic human romantic entanglements that for many frustrated lovers remain tangled even today."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"\\"Persuasion\\" is one of Austen's shorter, simpler pieces, sweet and charming without as much intrigue as her other novels. It tells the story of sweet, quiet, even-tempered Anne Elliot, a plain spinster disregarded by her family because she is not attractive enough for them. Anne's only share of romance had been years before, with a naval man deemed beneath her --- a man named Wentworth, who she was persuaded to reject because of his lower connections.Anne's father is a lazy spender who cares more for his vanity and title than his family, and spends them all to the point of bankruptcy and they are forced to move to Bath, giving up their long-time home of Kellynch Hall. While the rest of the family moves, Anne is left to take care of the more menial tasks and visit her sister --- a woman who delights in \\"fancying herself ill.\\" While visiting Mary and her family, Anne is once again thrown into the company of Wentworth --- now CAPTAIN Wentworth.As is typical of Jane Austen, this novel is filled with charm, wit, and humor. The story is perfectly thought-out, with just enough twists to keep it interesting, and enough romance to make you sigh. The characters are flawlessly designed.I laughed and I cried in this novel. After \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" this is my favorite of hers."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Any person considering reading PERSUASION by Jane Austen must have several thoughts in mind before beginning. This book is a classic, written by a master. It requires an investment of your time, your patience, your understanding and your attention. It is a book to be savored, not galloped through as if it were a modern fiction bodice ripper. If you are willing to approach this book with an open mind, expecting only to receive pleasure from the written word, you will most likely enjoy it tremendously.I read a lot of modern romance fiction. One of the things I have noticed on researching a book through the Amazon review system before I buy it is that so often reviewers state that they were able to finish the book in two hours, three hours, four hours. Do they honestly think that is a compliment to the author? One thing I can guarantee here, you will never be able to say that about PERSUASION. Slow down, read for pleasure, read for the pure joy of observing Jane Austen's manner of combining words. Her punctuation style is totally different from modern fiction. It requires that you hold thoughts in your mind long enough for her to have completed her lengthy and complicated sentence structure.Fans of Jane Austen often say that one specific book is their favorite. My favorite is the one I happen to be reading at the time. I've read them all multiple times and am always able to find nuggets of pleasure either not noticed before or now understood from a fresh perspective. PERSUASION is a book which shows very clearly Miss Austen's feelings on the English class system and how appearances are very often deceiving. Anne Elliot's own family is (in their minds at least) in the top strata of society. In actual fact, they are very small fish in a wide pond and do not amount to much except when within their own corner of England. Anne spends much time with the Musgrove family and all those surrounding that happy, boisterous group. Although lower in the social standings, they are loving, kind and generous, traits which are totally lacking in her own father and older sister. Anne is considered of no consequence to her family yet is loved and admired by those outside her social set who can see her value and worth. This is a story of young love lost with the opportunity to reclaim that love when maturity has given new insights into reasons, details and personalities. This book does not specifically leave you with a \\"happily ever after\\" feeling. Anne will never be mistress of Kellynch-hall, probably never even live there again. Captain Wentworth is a career naval officer with all that implies in his future service during wars. And yet, you cannot help but feel that Anne and Frederick will be quietly, calmly, gloriously happy for their remaining days. Partially because of the eight long years of separation which allowed them both to mature and grow and partially because they are just so very right for each other.Do not begin reading this book expecting a \\"romance\\" novel as written today. If you do, you are doomed to be disappointed."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I recently finished reading Jane Austen's Persuasion. It wasn't originally within my reading plans for the year, but I was inspired to read it by both The Lake House and the recent Pride and Prejudice film.Jane Austen's work is notable for reflecting on the class structure of its times. Written in the early 1800s, at the time of the end of the Napoleonic Wars, England's upper classes are well structured, with rules in place to dictate exactly who has greater stature, and constricting how discourse occurs, and how romance should proceed. In Persuasion, the main character Anne Elliot finds herself ruing the decision she made some 8 years previously, that saw her send away the man she loved, because her family saw that the man had little stature. Well, he went off to fight in the Wars, and has come back, as many have come back, with greatly changed riches and improved stature. Anne finds herself still in love with the man in question, and over time the poor man finds that he has not changed his thoughts either, and they persuade themselves to re-unite, and marry, finally.Some of what's observed, herein, is how the rules of society are changing to accommodate the newly-rich...and how Austen distinguishes between \\"gentlemen\\" (those who act as good people) and those with stature, but then doesn't allow her characters to be guided towards the gentlemen so easily. In today's terms, we would think Anne Elliot foolish for turning her back on love because her parent says the man is not a good match, because of stature, but these things happen even today. So, I think in this respect that the novel remains a good reflection on how poorly people navigate through the minefields of love, and how poorly people can themselves fare when they don't act according to their own true wishes.This was Austen's last completed novel, as I understand it. It was a little more adult in terms of how it handled its themes, and it surprised me with some of its skill. A major character nearly dies part-way through the story; it happens abruptly, and it is handled as a natural abrupt event in a way that was momentarily shocking...a true sign of skill. Definitely, this is worth a read for fans of novels of this time period."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"It being my 27th year of spinsterhood (the same age of our heroine Anne Elliot), and being Austen-inclined, I picked up (and consequently couldn't put down) my beloved, aged Complete Works of Jane Austen in order to reread Persuasion, a close third favorite (only just after her masterpiece P&P and the profound S&S). Oh, Jane, how I love you, my most favorite author. So funny; I was cackling with laughter at your comedic timing, your witty and ironic eye, and your amazing attention to detail in human psychology, character, and behavior. Not just moved to laughter, but even to tears (Captain Wentworth's final love letter still gives me collywobbles). Falling into Jane's books is like falling into a vat of literary chocolate. Oh, yes, there is the beautiful love story (one of her absolute best, by far her most mature, perhaps her most moving and emotional) between the broken-hearted and angry Captain Wentworth and the spinster, past-her-prime Anne Elliot, torn asunder years before because she was persuaded that he was unworthy of her, now reunited, yet distant. (How Jane so perfectly and honestly describes the pining, unrequited heart!) But--as with all of Jane's works--the love story is really only a vehicle for her greater messages and observations about society, reality, human psychology--messages that are still profoundly pertinent. It's not only that her characters and situations could be walking around onto on our concrete streets. It's that Jane knew humanity down to its core two hundred years ago. When her incredibly real and troubled characters find romance, it is a meeting of internal discovery. Persuasion, needless to say, is about the necessity of finding the balance between yielding to outside forces (i.e. advice) and staying true to your own desires and conscience. What human being hadn't had to contend with that? This book is perfection itself. Still powerful, meaningful, humorous, moving, and utterly delightful. Grade: A+"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"The magic and sheer excellence of 'Persuasion' lies in the personalities of the variouscharacters: Anne Elliot, the heroine of the book, is quiet, caring and proper but beneaththat surface of hers, she's a woman who has loved and lost. Her father, Sir Walter Elliot,and her sister, Elizabeth are like mirror images of each other, both are shallow, self-proclaimedsnobs and conceited. Captain Frederick Wentworth, Anne's love from her past, is just excellent!He's the male image of Regency cool: tall, handsome, a man of hard work and lady-killer.As a novel, 'Persuasion' is a thoughtful insight into the women left behind because ofbad choices, yet it is never self-pitying. I couldn't understand why while I was reading the bookand at the end, I saw what Austen was trying to show.That is the wicked factor of 'Persuasion', Austen allows you to eitherbe persuaded or dissuaded.As a social commentary, it is subtle in how it mocks certainaspects of society such as the 'dandies' of Regency England, the men who indulged in vanity,personified by Sir Walter Elliot. Yet, the books acts as a platform for the debate of marriagebegs the question, is marrying outside your station suicidal?One critic said that 'Persuasion' was like a Regency version of the Cinderella tale: Anne Elliotis Cinderella, Cpt. Frederick Wentworth her Prince Charming and Lady Russell as theWicked Stepmother. This is a blatant over-simplification! Persuasion is at first sight abeautifully crafted and touching romance but is also a book of many layers.Last Thought: Enough to convert an Austen cynic into an Austenian."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Jane Austen's \\"Persuasion\\" accomplishes the feat of rewarding both extremely casual and deeper, more analytical readings. It certainly contains enough genuine insight into humanity, and social relationships in particular, to be considered a \\"serious\\" novel. But \\"Persuasion\\" defies the stereotype that accompanies this genre. Rather than being ponderous and solemn, it is instead a work of sheer joy to read. Readers are treated to a complex novel that reads like a summer beach book.Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of \\"Persuasion\\" is how it balances the depth and richness with pure entertainment. Anne, her sisters, her father, and of course Captain Wentworth, are all very complex and fully fleshed-out characters. At the same time, however, they are all delightful people to read about. Anne in particular is charming and compassionate. Austen's prose is wonderful; witty, intelligent, and clear. And the story itself, a tale of people in love, is universal in its appeal and yet never once becomes formulaic. The novel, then, is a fantastic success in every possible way. It provides the richness of great literature with the charm of the greatest writers.

They eventually meet again, and the story continues to unfold. I actually used Persuasion for the subject of one of my long papers in college, and it was so fascinating to dig into the story as well as the story behind the story. There are actually a lot of similarities between this story and Jane's own story. Jane Austen is an incredible author, and Persuasion is one of her greatest works.Comment"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This book is one of Austen's best i read this book for my senior english class it is the only book that i have ever taken to.

While not as silly as EMMA, it did not have the character development or interesting story line(s) of SENSE AND SENSIBILITY and PRIDE AND PREJUDICE. Still, a good read, if you're an Austen or romance novel fan."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This book might have been a small chapter of a tremendous book. Perhaps it was curtailed by intent. A shallow, somewhat childish plot serves as background for significant character development of Anne Elliot, initially portrayed as a shy retiring late 20s wallflower, but every character, including her Wentworth, view Anne as an intelligent obviously gorgeous woman. What we do have in Persuasion is the admirable psychological manipulation by Anne of her own environment, and though we may be less than entranced by a tale of the English idle rich, we do have a woman of strong mind weaving through a soap opera society of parties, walks by the sea and cards. If able to ignore the vacuous background of the novel, we have good, somewhat humorless auto-pilot type writing showing perhaps more potential than actual accomplishment. I read Pride and Prejudice 30 years ago and remember absolutely nothing about it except that I liked the book. Persuasion very likely will leave a similar impression."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Jane Austen wrote Persuasion as her last novel. She influenced her characters to be moderate people who lived within the same town as she grew up in. This town is to be called Bath.Anne, the main character of the novel, is the sister of Elizabeth and Mary. The family is well respected in town. They live with their father, Sir Walter Elliot, who without great thinking puts the family into dept. They then move to Bath and leave their house to Admiral and Mrs. Croft. Mrs. Croft is Captain Wentworth's sister, the man Anne had once fallen so deeply in love with. Anne goes and visits the Musgrove family where again she meets Captain Wentworth after not seeing him for so long. The Musgrove family, have two children and Captain Wentworth focuses his attention on one in particular.They travel to see another family in which Mr. Elliot falls in love with Anne. After only knowing her for a short period of time they later find out that they are cousins. Anne forgets about Captain Wentworth for awhile and focuses her attention on Mr. Elliot. They become engaged and Anne finds out Mr. Elliot's motives. Forgiving Mr. Elliot Anne stays with him. As time goes by she hears that Captain Wentworth proclaims that his love for her has never gone away.Jane Austen portrays the story as a love story but with a little twist and turn to it. Where family members fall in love and sides are taken. Based in the pas it has a present kind of love to it. Love triangles, family ties, and friendships that go on and off.Persuasion needs a lot of attention. You have to focus on the little details and be interested in old literature and the time period in which the book was based and written in. There were certain things that become uncertain and unclear to understand.The way Jane writes isn't really as typical as most books teenage children would read. She sets her stories on other books she has written and being sick while writing this book, it could have been a little better. Not to say it was a horrible book, but you really have to have the time and heart to read it.If you are a serious reader and can really get into a book, this is a good choice. It portrays a love story that could happen in today's society but has other aspects that allows you to know that it was set back in a time period when love wasn't the one thing everyone was looking for and willing to talk about."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Persuasion is Jane Austen's most sophisticated story and writing. She lovingly and incisively demonstrates the problems of being a well-bred sensitive person in a society that's more intrigued by social standing, money, and polite conversation than by good character.Persuasion is Anne Elliot's story. The title's initial allusion is to Anne's brush with matrimony when a promising, but not rich, naval officer, Captain Wentworth, proposed and she fell in love with him at 19. But Anne's deceased mother's friend, Lady Russell, persuaded Anne not to make the match. Up until the time of the story, Anne hasn't had another suitor and she's now well past the usual age of marriage at 29 and \\"her bloom had vanish early.\\" Her father's spendthrift ways mean that Anne could bring little money to a marriage so she's expecting not to marry.While in her social class that lack of a husband is a drawback, in reality her family is a greater problem. Her father, Sir Walter Elliot, is a baronet who spends too much money, is obsessed by social rank, loves to be around the \\"beautiful people\\" and admire himself in a mirror, and keeps company with an unsuitable, scheming widow, Mrs. Clay, who is looking for a husband and has latched onto Elizabeth as friend. Anne's older sister, Elizabeth, is also unmarried and is as equally obsessed with social status as their father. Both Sir Walter and Elizabeth fail to value Anne and looked to her to suit their conveniences. The other daughter, Mary, is married but the connection doesn't thrill either Sir Walter or Elizabeth. Mary sees Anne as a virtual servant who should wait on her every beck and call when Anne is her guest.Due to Sir Walter's over spending of his income, it is decided he will rent the family estate, Kellynch Hall, while he, Elizabeth, and Anne take up less expensive quarters and a reduced social life in Bath. This change sets lots of new events into motion, not the least of which is Anne being re-introduced to Captain Wentworth who now has a fortune and seems to be looking for a lively, young wife. Only their common commitment to being polite makes time in one another's company tolerable. What strong emotions burn under the surface? She's very embarrassed, but Captain Wentworth is hard to read.In the course of the book, you'll find out a lot about social climbing in Regency England, the finances of the social elites and those who were up-and-coming, how marriage agreements were struck, and how the naval officers differed from the gentry. You'll also be impressed, I'm sure, by the patina of politeness that served as a social lubricant among people who often didn't care a trifle for one another.In such a society, people mostly wore masks of being thoughtful, considerate people while in reality they were seldom thinking about very much and didn't care much for others. Anne Elliot is the exception in that her heart and mind are actually devoted to the service of others.One of the most interesting parts of the story is how it was possible (mostly by accident) to sort out the phonies from among those with glittering manners.Anne Elliot is one of the most memorable and admirable characters in English literature. Do read this book and find out about the other kinds of persuasion that took place during this year of her fictional life. You'll be delighted that you did."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"When Jane Austen finished \\"Persuasion\\" in 1816, she was already suffering from the effects of the disease that would kill her the following year. \\"Persuasion\\" is rather shorter than its precessors such as \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" and \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". It is however the polished work of a mature author, and easily holds its own with her other finished novels.As the story opens, Sir Walter Elliot, a vain and foppish baronet facing bankruptcy, is persuaded to rent his home and move his family to Bath in order to economize on expenses. The middle daughter, Anne, unmarried and ignored by her family, is shocked to learn that the prospective renters are an Admiral Croft and his wife, whose brother is one Frederick Wentworth. Eight years earlier, Wentworth, then a young naval officer lacking wealth and status, had wooed Anne, who was persuaded by her mentor, Lady Russell, to reject his suit on the grounds of his lack of prospects. The kind-hearted but much put-upon Anne is left behind by her family to close up the house and to take care of her hypochondriac married younger sister Mary, who lives nearby.While visiting with Mary and her husband Charles Musgrave, Anne encounters the now Captain Wentworth, wealthy with prize money and looking for a potential wife among Charles' two sisters. Wentworth is distant and correct with Anne. When Wentworth proposes a visit to the seaside village of Lyme Regis, Anne is included in the group. While there, Wentworth appears to settle on Louisa Musgrave, only to have Louisa be seriously injured in an accident. The practical Anne takes charge in the crisis, causing Wentworth to take renewed notice of her.Anne ends up in Bath, where her family pursues a meaningless round of social calls. A handsome and long-missing cousin materializes to reconcile with the Elliots and to pay court to Anne. The long-suffering Anne must balance his suspicious attentions with the unclear intentions of Wentworth, who follows Anne to Bath.Anne still loves Wentworth, but hardly dares to hope that he will pass up younger and more attractive women to renew his relationship with her. The inarticulate Wentworth finally finds his voice in a note to Anne, giving her another chance to make the right choice.In this final novel, Anne wrestles with a dilemma common to Austen heroines, whether to marry for love or money and security. The younger Anne was persuaded not to marry for love because Wentworth lacked the money and prospects to give her the security of her station in life. In revisiting that choice, Anne concludes that the advice was correct under the circumstances but proven wrong by subsequent events. Anne believes in marrying for love; the further implication of her internal argument is that she and Wentworth should have waited for each other while he acquired the financial security necessary for their successful life together.\\"Persuasion\\" is a well-written and moving story, filled with the usual well-developed characters and often biting social commentary of a Jane Austen novel. It is very highly recommended to her fans and to those readers looking for an excellent period romance."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I would recommend reading the book before or after seeing any adaptation of Persuasion. It helps to get to know the main characters a little better. Buying this book is well worth the money, because you will get a lot of enjoyment out of it. Austen's wit and character analysis is brilliant."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Persuasion, Austen's final completed novel, is set in 1814, an interlude in the long Napoleonic wars. The men are home from the campaigns, with fortunes made and loves lost. It is a time for healing and renewal, while time allows. Austen herself was in deteriorating health and did not have long to live. For her characters too, there is a sense of time running out.In fact, although it is completed, there are signs that Austen would have reworked or further developed some of it, had she lived. A major character (the one who did the initial persuading) is never fully realized, other characters are similarly neglected toward the end, and the novel is relatively short.Persuasion does not have the depth of characterization of Pride and Prejudice, or quite the passion. It also lacks the cynical edge that is found in much of her work. The prose never reaches the sublime heights that she achieves elsewhere, but it is always very fine nonetheless. This makes for a slighter, more comfortable read, and a promise that, only love faithfully, and autumn must somehow pass into summer.There are references in the novel which will be obscure to most of today's readers (for example, \\"the inimitable Miss Larolles\\") and an edition with notes would be a good idea, if you can find one. The Signet Classic edition has no notes, but has quite a good introduction by Margaret Drabble, although it summarizes the plot, so read it after the novel, not before."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This came in a timely faschion. It was sent for next day though we had a big storm it was not anyones fault! Came quickly and was in excellent condition!!! Would order from here again and again!"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Jane Austen's last completed novel, which was published posthumously was Persuasion and the story starts with Anne Elliot, an upper-class girl at the age of 19, falling in love with Captain Frederick Wentworth. They get engaged but her mother's great friend and her own trusted friend, the widow Lady Russell, persuased Anne to break the engagement with him. The reason for this is, that the young officer possesses no connections to the upper-class and is therefor not worth to be with Anne according to Lady Russel.But after eight years, Anne, who truly loved Frederick Wentworth, is still unmarried and destined for spinsterhood. Until her mother has lived there was no problem with the income at the Elliot family, but according to the fact that her father wasn't careful with the money, they are now facing the situation that the family estate is gone to Admiral Croft, Wentworth's brother-in-law and the Elliots (Anne's father Sir Walter Elliot, her elder sister Elizabeth) need to move from Kellynch hall to Bath.Before Anne moves to Bath she spends some time with her younger sister Mary and her husband Charles Musgrove, as well as his sisters Louisa and Henrietta at Uppercross. Captain Wenthworth so far had success in the wars, which brought him a considerable fortune and now he is looking for a wife to get settled ashore. He and Anne meet again at Mary's and Charles house, but though Anne still has feelings for him she tries not to show them clearly. And furthermore Louisa\`s and Henrietta\`s trials to flirt with Frederick Wentworth and get him attracted, makes it more difficult for Anne to be in the focus.But on a day-walk at Lyme Regis it came to an accident when Louisa falls from a cliff thinking that Captain Wentworth catches her, which he didn't. The only person being calm and starting to organize the necessary steps to be taken after this accident was Anne. This inititates that Captain Wentworth's feelings for Anne came back. But when they slowly start their relationship again, there is another admirer of Anne, her cousin William Elliot, who seperates them again by spreading rumours that he and Anne are going to marry soon...This is a wonderful heart-moving novel and the letter at the end written by Frederick Wentworth to Anne is absolutely romantic. But this novel is also full of irony, for example when Mary wants to follow her husband for a dinner while here son is ill and she makes recommends about men and women, or when it is spoken about Bath (a place Jane Austen hated herself much): But still, there certainly were a dreadful multitude of ugly women in Bath; and as for the men! They were infinitely worse. Such scarecrows as the streets were full of!\\""},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This is my favorite Jane Austen's book (and Pride and Predjudice). Is so beautiful, and charming, and I love the characters,the way of writing and everything. If someone say to you that its boring, forgive him/her: it's because he/she's not a good reader."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Don't pay attention to all those stretched-minded who say that it is Chinese torture, or something else, read it. If you're intelligent enough, you will find it very interesting and realistic. However, if you don't like it, remember that Jane Austen only wrote to herself, not to all the little minded who found it boring."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Right before this book was &quot;assigned&quot; to our book club, I had read another &quot;classic&quot; so was a little disappointed because I was hoping to read a more modern book.I was in for a surprise. This book was incredibly modern and Jane Austen tackles so many issues that are present today. It's amazing how the heroine of this novel is disappointed with her friends, relatives and acquaintences for things that were completely acceptable (and normal) when the book was written but wouldn't be so today.Despite its date of publication, this is truly a contemporary novel!"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I know a lot of teens who, when I tell them I am reading Jane Austen, say, &quot;What are you thinking?&quot; because they have read Sense and Sensibility first, before trying any of her easier works. Persuasion is the easiest book of Austen's to get into, to follow, and to love. She makes the characters real by explaining them in many situations. When I read this book, I instantly became friends with Anne Elliot, the family outcast, because she was an outcast. Then she became even more my friend when she became the beloved and desired friend and love of Captain Wentworth. I loved seeing Anne go through the difficulties of dealing with her past actions, and instead of wanting to go back and change the past, she wanted to go forward and decide the future. Austen masterfully portrays all of her characters, and I would love to go to Lyme and see where Anne met her cousin, and to Bath to see where she and Captain Wentworth decided their future together. Persuasion is my favorite book of Austen's, and if you read it, it will be yours, too."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. Just what I was looking for!

I loved Persuasion very much, but it lacked the wit and humor of other Austin reads. The storyline was a bit boring...and lacked the romantic sparkle of that Emma posessed. :) It was definetely a more mature work of this author. I would definetely read it though.....just don't be prepared to be overly impressed."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I, too, found Persuasion unimpressive when I first read it. However, it grows on you. And most true Austen aficionados prefer this to her other, better-known works. Persuasion demands a bit more from the reader. This is not the book to use as an introduction to dearest Jane; for that you must seek out Emma or Northanger Abbey. But do not allow yourself to be misguided by the reviews of people who, by their own admission, are neither experts nor passionate about the works of this brilliant writer, who was, without a doubt, the finest female writer the English language has ever produced."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This was the slowest I've ever read a good book in my life!

However, since she was sick and dying when she wrote it, I will be happy that she wrote it at all and shared her wonderful prose with us one last time."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This is one of my favorite books, but what makes it a great \\"listen\\" is Stevenson's reading, which is just outstanding. I wish she would complete the entire Austen novel set."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Amanda Root played the heroine, Anne Elliot, in a great film version, and she is the reader of this audiobook. Her diction is very fine, she is a joy to listen to, and the sensitivity and perceptiveness of a Jane Austen heroine comes across in the narration.This version is abridged. About 40% of the words are retained and 60% discarded. The plot comes across intact, but much of what makes the novel great (the asides, reflections, commentary) is discarded. If you don't mind sitting for a 9-hour version instead of this 4-hour version, check out the unabridged \\"Persuasion\\" audiobook read by Juliet Stevenson. Ms. Stevenson comes across as more of a neutral observer, but she changes her voice more for the various characters.That's not to take away from Amanda Root's uniquely fine reading. If you're big on \\"Persuasion\\", get both. That's what I did."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Loved it, never read it before and was well worth the read, another classic, no wonder but it can stand the test of time"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This has always been one of my favorite jane austen books. I love anne and captain wentworth. They both remain faithful to the each other for eight years. That's an amazing love story."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Other than to die hard Austen fans, this &#34;other&#34; perfect writing may be somewhat unknown. It should not be. If a person believes himself or herself to be a well-rounded reader, but does not insist upon reading every major work of Austen's, they deceive themselves.I thought I had an adequate idea of Austen's works by watching the films &#34;Sense and Sensibility&#34; and &#34;Pride and Prejudice&#34;. I decided to read these two books, simply out of curiosity as to how they would stand against the films. I found the movies to be lacking the absolute finest portions of each story, so I decided to read Austen's other works that I had not been familiar with.Persuasion, as well as everything I have read from the pen of Jane Austen, does not disappoint. Well, except that it does, eventually, end. It's worthy of as many accolades as her more famous works, and as the others do, causes a sense of general happiness in its reader."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"There are many reactions that an Austen fan gets when they confess themselves as such. Perhaps a shared fangirl squee. Maybe an \\"of course you are.\\" Plenty of times it's the admission of not getting Austen. Of not enjoying \\"romance novels.\\" Of being confused or bored by her prose.I carefully say that I am a fan, as I haven't yet made my way through all her works. More than anything, I love Pride and Prejudice with a deep, nostalgic, I've-read-it-a-million-times love.A friend of mine recently picked this up for a re-read, and her reading updates inspired me to give Persuasion a try. It took about three or four chapters before I liked Anne Elliot immensely and reading through the rest of the book was surprisingly easy. What Austen writes is more nuanced than just a romance novel. Her books, Persuasion included, are full of humor and smart commentary and little treats throughout the narration.I think it's all the better that my first time reading Persuasion has happened in my mid-twenties. Where while reading Pride and Prejudice I am all giggles and swoons, Persuasion had me relating and nodding sagely. Anne Elliot is the Austen character I've found so far the easiest to relate to. We've all had our opinions persuaded, we've all felt overlooked, we've all questioned the decisions of our family, we've all questioned our own past decisions. There we find Anne as she finds herself once again moving in the same social circle as Captain Wentworth, \\"the one that got away,\\" to put it tritely.Anne is to be appreciated as a more mature Austen character. She has many admirable traits and many quirks that made me like her. I loved that at 27, and sort of lost in the shuffle of her life, losing consequence and being overlooked, her happiest moments are when she feels useful. Yes, girlfriend. I also loved that often times, she had to retreat, and sit in silence and consider her own thoughts.Though I didn't feel the relationship between Wentworth and Anne quite as much as Darcy and Elizabeth, I loved the themes the plot set up let Austen explore. I loved the relationship between Admiral and Mrs. Croft. It is not often that Austen gives us peeks of long lasting, happy marriages, and in the Crofts she comments on what she thought it ought to be. Sharing the reigns while driving sort of thing. A second favorite moment came when Anne was discussing the differences in feeling between women and men. More than agreeing with anything that was said, I loved it in context. And, of course, that conversation led the way for THE romantic moment in the book, Wentworth's letter to Anne.At the end, I can't really compare this to Pride and Prejudice. I loved that one longer and better. That said, I also can't give Persuasion anything less than five stars. For any faults you might find in Austen, she was not a one hit wonder. Here she provides another book to fall in love with, and I have no doubt that I will visit Anne again. And again, and again."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"My favorite Austen book with Pride and Prejudice a very close second. This is a faster read packed with emotional impact and enjoyable characters."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Tantor Media ordinarily produces superb quality audio books -- for example, the Pride and Prejudice recording. However, Tantor's choice of recording artist for Persuasion coupled with overly-long chapters, falls way short of the kind of recording that Jane Austen deserves. This review is not about the novel, which I think is lovely, if not superlative, like Pride and Prejudice or Emma. The recording artist speaks Anne Elliott's parts in an almost-whisper with a slow cadence -- almost like a young schoolgirl's voice. This is not only contrary to the character, who is strong and smart, but is really ridiculous! Anne is an adult and should speak in an adult voice. Also, the artist over-enunciates long and complicated words -- as though she is seeing them for the first time. Therefore, the recording as a whole lacks the smoothness and polish that Austen's writing provides. As for the chapters, Tantor cheapens the MP3 recording by having one track per Austen chapter, which means that some of the climactic chapters are well over 30 minutes long. If one wants to back up and listen to a missed line -- say when driving -- one has to listen to the whole of the chapter (at least that is how my car's MP3 player functions). If Tantor wanted to produce a more user-friendly production, the tracking would be every 5-10 minutes at most. So overall, a disappointing production of a lovely novel. Even so, I have listened to this audio books at least three times so far, and probably will again."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"There isn't much I can say about this book that hasn't already been expressed in the earlier 200+ reviews. This romance is delightful and the focus on second chances was especially appreciated. I think if Austen had lived longer, she would have gone over the book more throughly. The end did feel a little rushed. However, it still had wonderfully drawn characters and a completely satisfying romantic ending.Specific to Kindle: Several errors around quotation marks -- blocks of description or narrative were put into quotation marks, making them seem like part of a conversation. While it was easy to tell what was going on after a line or two, it was still annoying."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I found myself completely immersed in Jane Austen's Persuasion. It was a book that I could not put down for I did not want to leave the fascinating world that Ms. Austen has created. Anne and Captain Wentworth were lovely characters and I enjoyed following them throughout their journey. I highly recommend this book for anyone who loves a beautiful romance novel or a great story in general."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"What is my favorite Jane Austen book? Not that I don't love them all but that honor would have to go to Persuasion. It's more mature in tone than her other works, featuring an older heroine. Anne Elliot is 27 and has lost her bloom after being persuaded to break off her engagement to Frederick Wentworth 8 years previously. I love Anne Elliot and it's a tough call to choose between her and Elinor Dashwood for a favorite heroine.Unlike some of Austen's other books, my opinion on this one hasn't really changed at all over the years. I've loved it from the first time I read it and my love has only grown with each rereading. I had the impression before reading it that it would be more on the depressing side, like Mansfield Park, but it's really not. It has the usual cast of satirical, amusing side characters, like the vane Sir Walter and snobby Elizabeth, the hypochondriac Mary, etc. I feel like it's the most romantic of Austen's works as well. You can feel the tension of the unspoken feelings between Anne and Wentworth throughout the whole book until it all comes out in Wentworth's beautiful letter. It makes me swoon every time!The only complaint I really have for this book is that it's so short and a bit truncated. I believe Austen's failing health made her rush things a little bit and cut out some originally planned material. IIRC, she had intended to include some more about Mr. Elliot and Mrs. Clay, but I'm okay with how it ended up."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I purchased this book to read as an assignment for school in my British Literature class and am extremely pleased. I was not sure if I would like Jane Austen but this is an well written love story that kept me wanting to read more with every page I turned.

Although it is important to understand why most actions are done in the book.[...]"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This is perhaps my favorite Austen novel. As with all of her others, I have read it many times, and am delighted all over again with each re-reading. Jane Austen's wit and deep understanding of human nature have charmed readers for 200 years."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Many readers who start with Austen's longer, more complex works, quickly get overwhelmed and throw up their hands in frustration. Persuasion is probably the most accessible of all of Austen's novels and has one of the most memorable love stories. I'm actually glad that Austen, like Shakespeare, has had a renaissance of sorts due to some pretty good movie versions (this movie was not the finest, but at least it gives one a flavor). Emma is my personal favorite Austen movie (as well as one of my favorite novels.) Even less skillful readers will be drawn in my the fairly straightforwards plot of Persuasion. As a side benefit, all readers will get a good taste of Austen's wit, humor and at times biting social commentary."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Jane Austen is often noted for her earlier works, namely Pride and Prejudice. Her later books are sometimes passed up, yet they can prove to be quite an enjoyable read.Anne Elliot, a wealthy, yet amazingly kind girl, finds herself in love with a penniless gambler who is making his profession as a sea captain. He proposes. She allows her friends to &quot;persuade&quot; her that this poor captain is not the man for her. He leaves, heartbroken, and over time becomes a wealthy man. He returns eight years later and Anne realizes that she never quite got over the man who stole her heart so many years ago. However, Captain Wentworth seems fairly content without her. Her shyness keeps the debonair captain from ever knowing her true feelings, but like any good Austen novel, the good girl always wins. Anne isn't as impetuous as Elizabeth Bennett, but her sweet nature will keep you rooting for her. Read and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I first read Jane Austen as a freshman in college, reading PRIDE AND PREJUDICE in one fabulous day, a singular feat for me. I can only add my voice to those praising her works, which are deceptively unpretentious and straighforward. This one, late in her career, is a bit complicated at first with a myriad of relatives and relationships. But at its core it is a mature portrait of social pressures on women, focused on an intelligent and wise and loving woman who finds a man equal to her. It is not merely a good story, not merely proto-feminist, not merely a satire... it is all of those, and a lovely read."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Persuasion, like other Jane Austen novels, contains characters who are class conscious to the point of being absolutely ridiculous. Anne is the most sensible one of the bunch. She decided that these class distinctions are less important than helping an old friend. Sir Walter Elliot and his oldest daughter, Elizabeth, are completely willing to associate with those of a higher class than themselves but will avoid people of a lower class. They avoid anything that would ruin their image. Mary, the other Elliot daughter, is just as selfish but in a slightly different way. Jane Austen's dialogue is difficult to follow at times, but worth the extra work it takes to understand the story."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Every time I finish another Austen novel, it becomes my &quot;favorite,&quot; and Persuasion is no different. Perceptive, emotional, profound and even painful at times, it still sparkles with Austen's humor and flair for turning a clever phrase. Anne Elliot is a heroine's heroine, and one with whom the reader feels an instant sympathy and affection. If only Jane Austen had been given more time on this earth to share her splendid and amazing gift--but in the little time she did have, she has given all of us who love her work a never ending source of pleasure and enjoyment. Persuasion in indeed a rare and priceless gem."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This book came into my life at a time I really needed it. Perhaps that makes me partial to it, but I found it compelling, compassionate, and greatly moving. Not a general reader of Austen, but compelled to pick it up after viewing the movie, I was impressed with it's insight and its emotional and social commentary. But more than social commentary it is, though to some it may sound trite, a book of the heart and soul. For me it was spiritually cleansing and emotionally purifying. A book of beauty and love, a work which has become a personal favorite."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I stayed up until two o'clock in the morning to finish Persuasion, a revelation in itself because the first time I picked up the book during my vacation in Jamaica, I barely comprehended it and couldn't get into it and ended up putting it down in exchange for one of Charlaine Harris' Southern Vampire Mystery. I decide to start it from the very beginning, and after about five hours decided I would risk not being able to get up on time in the morning just to see how it all turns out.Jane Austen's books, I've decided, is a little like watching a Shakesperean play (or any of the other British-made films like Snatch or Trainspotting, it takes a while to fall in with the rhythm of the language. Your brain eventually trains itself to accept some of the archaic English as not being gobblelygook, and you find yourself falling into the plot and caring and even admiring the beautiful if somewhat stilted, language.Now I have to admit that I have come into my admiration for Jane Austen late in life (about two weeks ago and I'm 41), and not for not having had exposure to her, either. I do have a degree in English Literature, and Jane Austen is pretty much part of the standard reading requirement for any college or university. I also seem to own all of the books, and I seem to recall doing a paper on Northanger Abbey, even though I couldn't tell you right now what that was all about. This is, however, my first time reading Persuasion, if you don't count the time I tried to pick it up in Jamaica two weeks ago.As an English major, I know that I was supose to revere Jane Austen, but I never understood why. Earlier readings had left no indelible mark on my soul, but for some reason, this time around, I truly was enchanted. With Persuasion, I believe a lot of it had to do with how Austen carefully shapes her characters. These are true people to me, I fancy myself to be Ann, and her two sisters seem to me be just like my two sisters, without the power of the baronet and servants and estates and all that other good stuff that can only come with being a part of that genteel class. Austen lets me live in a world so different from my own, so fascinating in its examination and yet filled with so much of the problems and realities that we would encounter in our everyday lives.Persuasion is a study in human nature. Some might argue that the characters lack depth, for they are either kind and good, like Ann, or selfish and shallow, like her sister Elizabeth. I think though, the genius is in the presentation of such flawed characters - Austen is biting and unforgiving in her portrayals. She is best when she is exposing some unjustness of social mores or grossness of character. But to be fair, even the good can make mistakes and be misled, and the good themselves are trying to determine what their proper place is in this unjust world. It is their goodness which earns them their well-deserved happiness while the selfish and shallow (no one seems truly evil in this book), like in any good fairytale, get what they deserve."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"And, who doesn't? She's my favorite author and has been for a long time. I first read this book about 7 years ago and of course fell in love with it. I re-read it for a book club next week. I very rarely read books a second time. I think this is only my 3rd time.It is a beautifully-written book, like all her others. In Persuasion, Anne Elliot is persuaded by a family friend to not pursue a relationship with Captain Wentworth because of his inferior place in society. Many years later, she is reacquainted with him and her love for him has not diminished. She is unsure of how he feels about her. He is now a prestigious and admired captain; his station in life completely changed from before.They find each other in the same social circles, but his pride and her uncertainty of his feelings prevents them from reuniting. At some point, it is believed that each of them is attached to another.The novel has its funny assortment of characters just like all of Austen's works. And, Austen saves the wonderful union of Anne and Captain Wentworth for the last pages, as in her other books. But, that makes it sweet as you finally read the happy ending. I actually cried as I read the touching letter he writes to Anne at the end."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This was my favorite of all of Jane Austen's novels! I loved it from start to finish! Captain Wentworth is her greatest hero; surpassing even Mr. Darcy. It's wonderful, witty and romantic."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This is the third book by Austen I forced my way through, but I must admit, I find her writing dry, humorless, dull, and always the same themes. It's the constant talk about class, and who is good enough for whom, and the woman and man who just can't seem to get together until the very end when they admit their mutual love. It's all very tedious. I don't find a clever word or thought in her books. I only got through 1/2 this book, and then, in boredom, threw it aside for SINISTER STREET by Compton Mackenzie. Besides, there were many characters introduced throughout the novel, and I couldn't keep them in mind. They were not at all developed as characters. They were relatives and friends, and I didn't care about any of them for they were not portrayed in enough detail to distinguish them apart.I guess, I will give up on Austen. My favorites are Trollope and Hardy. Sinister Street, so far, is superb. One really understands Michael Fane and his little sister!"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I enjoy this book and read it about once a year.

However, in the future if I want to read something of this caliber I would write NBC and ask for the script of their least watched daytime &quot;soap&quot;.

Most great literature is so wonderful because of its timelessness, touching on universal feelings and ideas. While it may have been groundbreaking in its time, it is so dull now. We women have already established our desires of equality in culture and have already acknowledged at least an inkling of what feminine independence is but this novel is a back step. Also, it is so predictable. Of course all of the characters will end up married, and most likely to their man of choice. This book is dull and predictable and is restricted by its time period. If you want to delve into the past then maybe pick it up, but otherwise, it's unexciting, and it still feeds on social classes and marriage as a woman's reliance on a man for social and fiscal support."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Somehow I never read this one and found it to be a good read with Good Writing by a very good author"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Everything was as expected.

Unlike other Austen's, it wasn't full of young and overwhelming love. However, the more I pondered it and reread it, the more I enjoyed its honesty.

Definitely one of the most hopeful and satisfying endings and well worth reading."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"My first impression of Persuasion was that Jane Austen writes some interesting and detailed characters. Right from page one, Sir Walter was my favorite character. He's a jerk, yeah, but he's hilarious. I don't know that the characters in this book are as modern as they are in say Pride and Prejudice, but the author's brutal honesty, especially about the less appealing characters, is always entertaining. The whole story made me really think about how much other people influence our lives and whether or not that is always a good thing.And can Jane Austen write a romance. The flirting, the dashing hero that you want but can't have, and that beautiful love letter! I do have to say that there was one major climactic scene that just felt cheesy to me. Oh the horror! Other than that, it was refreshing and fun to read a Jane Austen novel that I didn't even know existed until a few years ago."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Yet another great story by Ms. Austin.

I wasn't sure that I could enjoy this book on the Kindle but found it just as engrossing as a hard cover book."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Although a genius in providing commentary on her time, I have often struggled with the way Austen reveals the inevitable love interest in early in her novels. This is the most suspenseful of her books that I have read thus far, and I thoroughly enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Persuasion was the last book Jane Austen wrote and in many ways it is the most complete example of the style that endears her as much to modern readers as it did to readers from the nineteenth century.Persuasion's plot is based around the possibility of the rekindling of a romance which burned brightly when the protagonists were younger and which was thwarted because the forces of familiar persuasion made Anne Elliott reject her love for Captain Wentworth. All of Austen's plots are romantic staples revolving around the constant impediments placed between the heroine and her ideal man but unlike the plots of many novels contemporaneous to Austen's these impediments are not Gothic in nature - they are merely the frustrating minutiae of everyday life. To be sure, the denouements are invariably happy but when we think about what would happen (if these people were real) afterwards, we can foresee myriad problems and further barriers to happiness. (For example, in Pride and Prejudice, how is Lizzie going to cope with Darcy's family and in Persuasion, how is Anne, happily ensconced with her paramour, going to cope with her own disfunctional family?) No matter, Jane has done her job and brought the two lovers together.One of the most entertaining aspects of Austen's technique is her ironic narrative asides. We, as readers, are given access to the feelings of the main protagonists before they reveal them to the world (in Pride and Prejudice we know that Darcy is besotted with Lizzie well before he declares his amour, and in Persuasion we know that Captain Wentworth still carries a torch for Anne Elliott while she is still assuming that all hope of a rekindled romance has been dashed because of her earlier propensity to be persuaded against her emotions).One of the most curious aspects of Austen's wonderful assortment of characters is the strangely brutal way she portrays families. There is always at least one member of the principle family who is deeply flawed - both Lizzie's parents in Pride and Prejudice, Marianne and Elinor's weak brother and vile sister-in-law in Sense and Sensibility, and Emma's neurasthenic father (a mild critique compared to the sharpness of the other characterizations). Nowhere is this &quot;critique of the family&quot; more keenly delineated than in Persuasion. Anne Elliot's father is a complete fool obsessed with physical appearances above all else, and it is clear that Anne has little respect for him or her own sisters. Austen invested all her idealization of character in her main protagonists - in this case Anne and Captain Wentworth. While not always physically attractive, Austen's heroines are always morally complete (except for the ever-so-slightly capricious Emma) - and Anne Elliot, the heroine of Persuasion, is surely more a portrait of Jane Austen than any of her other heroines. She is no longer young, has lost the full bloom of youthful beauty, and has been disappointed in love because she heeded the wishes of others, and not of her heart and her mind.We know by reading any of Jane Austen's books of her fierce intelligence, biting wit and brilliant observational powers of familiar human behavior. And she could be deliciously bitchy, as this example from Persuasion shows: &quot;(Anne and Captain Wentworth) were actually on the same sofa, for Mrs Musgrove had most readily made room for him - they were divided only by Mrs Musgrove. It was no insignificant barrier indeed. Mrs Musgrove was of a comfortable substantial size, infinitely more fitted by nature to express good cheer and good humour than tenderness and sentiment; and while the agitations of Anne's slender form, and pensive face, may be considered as very completely screened, Captain Wentworth should be allowed some credit for the self-command with which he attended to her large fat sighings over the destiny of a son, whom alive nobody had cared for.&quot;Anne Elliott is certainly less ironic than the voice of the narration (Austen herself), but she seems to be a manifestation of what Jane Austen thought of herself, or at least, how she would like to be - intelligent, kind, sensitive to other's feelings, and most importantly, someone who is valued for these qualities rather than for beauty and money. Persuasion is a good read - it's not as cheeky as Emma or as involved as Pride and Prejudice, but there are plenty of the great Austen ironic (and even sarcastic) flourishes. And the intelligence of her writing is a delight."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I like Jane Austen, but this is a very special book, even for her.When I was widowed a few years ago, I read Persuasion. Lots or people here love this book, but it holds a special place in my life because it gave me the will to go on. We live in a youth-oriented culture which tries to tell people that only the young, the rich and the beautiful have a right to love and happiness; this book says that all people can have a second chance at happiness. Persuasion taught me that the pain over losing the one you love does not have to end your life. You can start again, and perhaps be even happier than you were the first time around, when you were young and didn't know what life was about. I know some people prefer the dashing heroes in Austen's other books, but Anne and Captain Wentworth are much closer to who most of us are. We are not flashy or rich; we don't always have supportive families; our beauty might only be seen by the people who love us the most because they've looked in our hearts. Love will not bring us land or access to the powerful, and it won't make our families act more kindly to us. But what love does is act as a shelter from the storms of life- death, sickness, insensitive people.While women now have more freedom to love than they did in the early 19th century, they are still hampered by unrealistic ideas regarding how the mind and body ages, the value of maturity, how having 'baggage' can be a sign that one has been places and seen things, and how common sense and human decency may be more important in the long run than beauty or good fashion sense. Most women are still afraid to be alone with themselves or to carve out a satisfying life without a man. Because most women and men don't value these concepts, Persuasion is not ranked as highly as Austen's more exciting earlier novels. Still, if I could only take one book with me to a desert island, this would probably be the one."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"When I saw that this was the preferred edition for kindle I presumed that the text would be organised in a way to fit the kindle comfortably. Instead I found that the text does not uniformly fill the page. It is written as a full line follwed by a half line. I had to increase the font size in order to make it slightly less annoying. One thing it taught me is to ALWAYS download the sample chapter first before purchasing and don't presume that 'kindle preferred' means you'll be getting the best one for the kindle. Of course the book itself is brilliant."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Persuasion was Austen's last completed novel before her death and was written whilst the novelist was dying, which may explain its shorter length when compared to her other novels. Although briefer in the telling, it lacks none of the hallmarks of Austen's style including the omniscient ironic (and sometimes in this work cynical) narrative voice and her witty yet extraordinarily subtle comments on her societies approach to women and the social hierarchy. The action of this novel centers on the character of Anne Elliot who under the influence of a close family friend, Lady Russell is persuaded to reject the advances of Wentworth. The main body of the plot takes place eight years after this rejection; Wentworth is now known as Captain Wentworth and has made his fortune through the collection of enemy booty in the Napoleonic Wars. Now with England in peace he has returned ashore seemingly having forgotten Anne and his rejection and ready to take a wife.As the romance unfolds the novel covers a number of themes, for instance the idea of being \`persuadable' per se. Initially the notion that Anne allowed herself to be won over by Lady Russell's influence is seen as a fault, however as the story progresses the sub plot involving the character of Louisa Musgrove shows that rather than being a fault, Anne listening to Lady Russell's advice shows that she is susceptible to reason and practicality. Seemingly the error occurred rather in Lady Russell's judgment of Wentworth than in Anne's decision to follow her advice.Lady Russell's preference for Mr Elliot Jnr as a more suitable marriage partner for Anne over Wentworth seems to be based solely on the class distinction that divides these two men. This class based prejudice by Lady Russell may be regarded as a critical reflection upon Austen's society which closely associated (and often without valid cause) moral virtue and class status, the assumption being that the higher your class, the better your moral decency. The reader discovers the error of Lady Russell in relying on such a system of character judgement as it produces such corrupt results.Possibly the greatest achievement of this work is the very quiet proto-feminist message that Austen manages to slip into one of the closing chapters. Every the ironist, Austen has the meek Anne Elliot, who seemingly conforms to all of societies rules about what a women \`ought to be' speak out against the confining nature of a woman's expected place in society. When discussing the fate of love affairs between men and women, Anne argues that it is easier for men to forget as women \\"live at home, quiet, confined...You are forced on exertion. You have always a profession, pursuits, business of some sort or other, to take you back into the world immediately, and continual occupation and change.\\" Anne then goes on to turn on its head Captain Harville's ideas that the supposedly stronger and more robust figure and mind of man is better capable for love than that of the mind of women.Austen's novels are never innocent of the issues which affected their period and this is yet another example as Austen deftly and subtly critiques gender roles, social class and the notion of \`appearances.' In its whole, this is a great book, perhaps the fact that it was written by an older and dying Austen may explain the nostalgic tone of decline or sadness that seems to pervade it. It is well worth the money you would spend to buy it and the time you would take to read it."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I've hated the fact that Persuasion isn't one of Jane Austen's most famous works ever since I read it. It is truly a beautiful love story, and it is written perfectly (as only Jane Austen could do).The story is about Anne Eliot, one of Austen's most likeable characters. Seven years before the novel begins, Anne had been persuaded out of a marriage to Frederick Wentworth. Neither Anne nor Captain Wentworth, had been persuaded out of love, though. Both have basically wasted the last seven years. Fortunately for the couple, circumstances arise which through them back together, and the two have to attempt to build a new relationship and deal with there own actions from years before.Persuasion is possibly Austen's greatest love story. It is much less satirical than here other novels. Anne is also a much more sympathetic character than say Emma. The novel is, of course, in Austen's incomparable style. Any romantic or lover of great literature would adore this beautiful novel."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This book is one of my favorites of all time. Many people dislike it or don't like it as much when compared to Pride and Prejudice or Emma, but there are many reasons why Persuasion should not be compared to Austen's other novels. This novel was the last one that Austen wrote before she died. It is a more mature novel, dealing with many issues not found in Austen's previous novels. One reason why people find faults with the book is that Anne Elliot, the heroine, is not as spunky or witty as an Elizabeth Bennett or an Emma Woodhouse. There is not so much wit flowing in the dialogue between characters, or even dialogue in general. But these differences between the novels make this one so unique.It is a novel of second chances. Anne Elliot, no longer in the bloom of youth, is a grown woman of 27 or 28 years. Eight years ago she had been happily in love with a handsome man named Frederick Wentworth. But, unfortunately, due to his financial status, and Anne under the influence of her family and close friend, was forced to reject his marriage proposal and they parted ways. But now, he is within her closest circle once again. Circumstances led to Anne staying with her married sister, Mrs. Muskgrove, while her own house was being let to Wentworth's sister and husband. Wentworth visits his sister and on calling on the Muskgroves finds Anne among them. Anne finds Wentworth, not only looking as good as he ever did, but is now Captain Wentworth, who has made his fortune. Wentworth, still angry with Anne over being rejected, causes him to treat Anne very coolly. But over many weeks of contact here and there, you catch on that Captain Wentworth isn't all that oblivious to Anne anymore, because of all the little 'glimpses' he throws at Anne. The tension between the two is amazing. You can sense a connection between the two, even though they are on opposite ends of the room. In Bath, the tension builds and builds until it culminates into one of the most moving and romantic reunions ever. The letter that Wentworth writes to Anne declaring his love is bound to bring a tear to your eye and a pang in your heart. Happily, all ends well, but throughout the novel you can easily sympathize with Anne. No longer youthful and no longer as pretty as she used to be, she is full of self-consciousness and confusion. She still loves him after all those years, but she is unsure whether or not he still loves her.Austen, yet again, excels in portraying her characters. Anne and Captain Wentworth are full and delightful characters that one must love. Her descriptions of Anne's vain father and snobbish older sister, Elizabeth, hit the mark on satirizing the members of society during that time. She wittingly describes how everyone tolerates Mrs. Muskgrove's hypochondriatic self and how everyone deals with her in their own way. There is not so much dialogue between characters in this book, compared to Austen's other novels. Most of the book is in observation of Anne's character and feelings, which makes it so much easier to relate to everything that Anne feels and you understand her situation all the more. This is a wonderful novel, with many qualities, differing from those of Austen's previous novels, to enjoy and admire. Reading of getting a second chance in love is enough to lift anybody's heart and spirit and leave them happily satisfied with the book."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This story is heart-wrenchingly agonising. This is a good thing! Never have I been so moved by a love story. When Anne and Captain Wentworth finally overcome their own guardedness and the pressures of society and re-declare their love for each other...... It is the most wonderful scene ever written. I have never read a more wonderful love story. I think this to be the most romantic of Jane Austen's novels. The mercenary marriage market Jane Austen ridicules in &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; is portrayed in a darker and more destructive light in &quot;Persuasion&quot;. Two lovers torn apart by a society fixated on class, wealth and position, only able to find happiness together once this obstacle has been overcome, but in the mean time..... OH THE HEART ACHE!!!!! I recommend this one for a rainy day when one can lie in bed, or sit in the favourite arm-chair, and wallow in the brilliance of this timeless and heart stirring romance. Don't forget your tissues!"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this novel because of Jane Austen's lyrical prose, her timeless subjects of family relationships, love (and/or the search for it), her heartwarmingly drawn characters that I think any reader anywhere and at any time can relate to easily, and her usual witty and critical social commentary. I find it amazing to think that she wrote this novel nearly 200 years ago! I can think of several people in my own family and among friends, colleagues, and acquaintances who match her descriptions of Anne Elliot, her father and sisters Walter and Elizabeth Elliot and Mary Musgrove, Lady Russell, Captain Wentworth, etc. Times and mores may have changed in 200 years, but human nature has not changed! Reading her descriptions of these characters and well imagining Anne's reaction to them, whether it is with resignation, amusement, or exasperation mirror my own thoughts on them.Austen has created a wonderful character in Anne Elliot. I found that I liked her more and more as I read the novel, and, had she been real, would liked to have had her as a sister, friend, or relative. She is such a wonderful character because readers have a chance to see how she has grown up, has changed, and is willing to go for what she wants now that she is older and wiser (much like anyone else).The story is not like Austen's other novels (Pride and Prejudice, Emma) because it deals with the issue of a true rarity in life--a second chance at love. Anne Elliot met and fell in love with Captain Frederick Wentworth, a naval officer, when she was 19 years old. Against her better judgment, she is \\"persuaded\\" by family in the form of family disapproval of her choice. Her mother is dead, her father and her elder sister Elizabeth (who have a very strange, almost-marriage-like relationship themselves) are social snobs and do not consider a mere captain in the British navy good enough to marry into their family because they are ranked above him socially. Anne's feelings, Frederick's feelings, and the possibility that he could earn a great deal of money by capturing privateers and enemy ships, or be rewarded with a title for distinguishing himself in battle does not occur to them. Anne is also strongly influenced by Lady Russell, a close family friend and a particularly close friend to Anne. Lady Russell, since the death of Anne's mother, has become a mother-figure/friend to Anne (since Anne is ignored by her father and sister Elizabeth). Lady Russell also disapproved of Anne marrying Captain Wentworth, and Anne, because she was young and easily influenced by those around her at age 19, breaks off her engagement to Captain Wentworth. She has regretted it ever since, and has not met anyone (her father and sister went out in Society, but did not take Anne with them; her younger sister Mary is married, but spends her time complaining about non-existent ailments and about all the wrongs and hurts she has suffered at the hands of family and friends to take any interest in introducing Anne to eligible young men) she would consider as a husband. Eight years pass, and, by chance, Captain Wentworth (now considerably wealthier though not titled) re-enters her life due to the temporary lull in the Napoleonic Wars. He too was very hurt by Anne's breaking off of their engagement, but, like Anne, he has not met any other women who compare to her. Both are wary of eachother--and Austen handles both their introspection and their gradual establishment of a stronger, more mature love for eachother with sensitivity and passion. I loved this story because it clearly shows an older (though still young) heroine who is offered the rarest of all things--a second chance at love with the love of her life. She is wise enough to reject the opinions of her family and Lady Russell this time, accepts the love offered, and offers her own love in return! Captain Wentworth's letter to Anne at the end of the novel is the kind of love letter every woman would cherish. Wow! What a beautiful letter! It warms your heart, touches your soul, and nourishes your spirit. The story is all the more poignant because Anne and Captain Wentworth appreciate eachother and their relationship because they know what they have and what they could have missed had they followed social conventions.For the die-hard Austen fans, there is plenty of social commentary, and I thought that Austen illustrated the snobbishness of the upper classes very well in her characterizations of Anne's father and sisters. The criteria they use to accept or reject a person are based on such things as whether the man owns property and how much, how many servants he has, title, family background, connections, and, in her father's case, physical appearance is very important. None of these things have any intrinsic value compared to whether Anne is loved and respected by Captain Wentworth, how he treats people, his ethics, morality, etc. Austen's subtle humor and way of poking fun at these values contribute to the tone of this novel.Give this novel a try. I do not think that you will be disappointed. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This is one of Jane Austen's five novels as a mature author. As with four of the other five, it follows the same formula of a financially disadvantaged young woman who meets and marries a wealthier man. The exception is her novel \\"Emma\\" where the protagonist has her owns means. There are no axe murders in an Austen novel or any nasty elements. Her stories take place in small English towns and they all have a variety of characters including a few willful women and usually one male rogue.As background information, I have read all of Austen's novels, and I have read various analyses of Austen's work.\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is Jane Austen's finest novel. That book is the perfect balance of story, prose, structure, and interesting characters. It evokes many emotional responses in the reader. That novel is among the greatest novels of all time on par with for example Flaubert's \\"Madame Bovary\\" or Tolstoy's \\"Anna Karenina.\\" From a strictly literary point of view, \\"Mansfield Park\\" is the most complicated and sophisticated literary work penned by Austen.So, where does that leave \\"Persuasion\\" among her novels? The present novel is good and it is generally thought of as one of her five best. It is one of her mature novels - as opposed to Northanger Abbey, an early work. It has a good story and good characters. I liked her treatment of Captain Wentworth. The description and the story about the primary character, Anne Elliot, is vintage Austen writing and story telling. But overall it does not quite reach the heights of those other two great Austen novels. Still, I rate it somewhere between 4 and 5 stars. It is more a question of whether you like the story or not, since it follows the Austen formula. All of her five mature novels share a certain fixed writing style and a common structure, or the Austen formula as mentioned above. She uses the early pages to introduce the families, and other characters, and give start the story. She moves characters around from place to place in part for time shifting. She does a wrap up in the last few chapters.Those opening chapters are an obstacle for most readers. She uses her own vocabulary and has an unusual way of structuring her prose. That structure is a trademark of Austen's writing. Also, she manages to work in a lot of drama and social issues with some humor and irony.Austen wrote the novel based on contemporay life in England from approximately 1814 to 1815, in the post Napolean period, and it was published in 1816 after her other works. Overall I would rate it as excellent but not her best. It is similar to \\"Sense and Sensibility\\"and much better than her early novel \\"Northanger Abbey\\" in terms of literary sophistication and the characters, and it ranks behind the two novels mentioned above and \\"Emma.\\" Those three (Emma, Pride and Prejudice, and Mansfield Park) are her finest works.Most Austen fans will love the book, and I would recommend the novel."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Persuasion is one of my favorite books -- and probably my favorite Austen, though I go back and forth between this and Pride and Prejudice. P&P is more sparkling and witty; Persuasion feels more mature. Definitely a book to read over and over. And the letter from Captain Wentworth to Anne(you'll know what I'm talking about when you get there!) is the best-written letter in fiction. Read it! You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"\\"Persuasion\\" is a novel written by Jane Austen during the Regency Period in England. It was a time where single women were not allowed to be left unchaperoned with a gentleman. A time where people wouldn't dare say impolite things to others, and marriage was a way to improve your wealth, circumstance, and station.This is one of the 6 completed novels written by Jane Austen, while this one isn't as popular and famous as \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" that does not mean it is without merit or any less worthy of praise. If you found yourself liking the movie or book \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" you should give this one a try.Our herione \\"Anne Elliot\\" is the middle daughter out of three. Her mother died when she was young, her father is a silly, vain, and selfish man who spent so much money they are now facing financial troubles. They live in a lovely home called \\"Kellylynch Hall\\" which they must leave to find cheaper lodgings. Now they rent their home out to this couple (Admiral and Mrs. Croft) and take up residence in Bath.Anne is an admirable heroine. One with much sense, honesty, and simplicity. Her two other siblings are not so worthy, her oldest sister takes after their father, selfish, vain, alway self-promoting. Her younger sister is already married with children and very needy. She is also very selfish and a little bit of a hypochondriat.Now when Anne's family leaves for Bath she does not go with them, instead she stays close to their family home while staying with her younger sister. Here Anne is able to live without the shadow of her family, make acquaintances, and be of much usefullness towards everyone. She soon meets up with Captain Wentworth, who proposed to her eight and half years ago and was rejected. Anne did not reject him because she did not love him, she was persuaded by her family. What will they do now seeing each other again after eight and a half years?Overall the story was a very intersting read, you grew very interested in all the characters and their personalities as you always do when you read Jane Austen. It is one of her shorter books around 250 pages. The beginning is the only hard part to read, you might lose interest there but keeping reading it gets better real soon."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Jane Austen's last novel, posthumously published in 1818, is about the possibility of having a second chance for love after one's made the mistake of following advice contrary to natural inclinations. The story centers on Anne Elliot, descendant of an illustrious family from the nobility of Somerset. Her mother has died and she lives with her father, an insufferably vain and irresponsible character, who has spent most of his fortune in a stupid way. Anne also lives with her elder sister Elizabeth, another unlikable person. They treat Anne with contempt and humiliation. The youngest sister, Mary has been married to a good man with a good social position. Turns out that the Elliot's have run out of money and they must move to a more humble house in order to lease the manor. The new tenant is an Admiral Croft, married to the sister of Captain Frederick Wentworth, a former boyfriend of Anne. Eight years ago, this man had proposed marriage to Anne, but he had been rejected after Anne's family, and in particular a fomer best friend of her mother's, had convinced her that she could find a much better prospect (Wentworth was by that time a beginner in the Navy and didn't have money). Anne has suffered ever since, because she really loved him and the much better prospect seems never to appear. Wentworth himself was deeply hurt by the rejection, but now he has come back from the war rich and with a promising future. The Elliots, the Crofts, and the Musgroves (Mary's husband's family) develop a good social relationship and Captain Wentworth is frequently invited to parties and reunions.The rest of the novel is centered on Anne's feelings and her ambivalent emotions: on the one hand, she tries to be as little as possible in the company of Wentworth, but on the other she is very anxious about finding out if he still feels something for her. But Wentworth is cold and silent with her, showing respect but also letting her know how offended he feels. Mary's sister in law, Louisa Musgrove, falls for the handsome captain, and it seems like they will get married. That is, until she has an accident in the resort of Lyme, which changes the course of action.With a conventional and almost predictable plot, Austen manages nonetheless to write an acute psychological portrait, and a wonderful story. Her prose is terse and fluid, with a subdued sense of humor. Anne is a credible and likable character, always a good friend even if her relatives despise and ill-treat her and her beauty has started to fade. She is fully conscious of what a terrible mistake she made when she rejected a good, hardworking man who loved and respected her, and who is now an attractive option for many young women. Sexual tension is ever present in this world of repression and hipocrisy, and the self-affirming and independent Anne stands above the rest of the characters, as a prefiguration of the modern, self-reliant woman. One of the best by Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Even though Persuasion is one of Jane Austen's lesser known novels it is very well written and also a very good story. The story is centered around the romance of Anne Elliot and Captain Wentworth. They had fallen in love eight years before the novel takes place, but Anne broken off their engagment after Lady Russell persuaded her that he was not a suitable match. They end up seeing each other again after Anne's family runs into money problems and Anne and Wentworth realize that their feeling for each other are renewed. Problems from their past and also their families hurt their chance of a fresh start.I thought this novel was very interesting and another one of Jane Austen's great novels."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"At the end of the day, Persuasion is worth reading because it offers a simple hope for how we can live together. Unlike, say Pride and Prejudice, where in the end the characters more collide than marry, the orbits of protagonists Anne and Captain Wentworth eventually come to revolve around each other.When I read Austen, I often wonder whether the author likes her characters. In Persuasion, it seems like the author strives to make her characters contest to find their proper standing, and neither breeding nor education (nor gender) determines the mettle of a man or woman. However, determining how we can live together, faults and all, is probably more important than the sort of personality and tribulation time trials that some of Persuasion's characters attempt to determine among themselves. More important is the comparison of the various family units, the Elliots, the Crofts, and the Musgroves, and what a wise reader would learn from each.Make no mistake, this is no drawing room bodice ripper, of the \\"she slinked into the room scantily clad\\" variety. And its indolent upper class ever-vacationing denizens may appear quite impossible in today's society. However like occasional dessert, I found it better digested slowly, at the end of a day of intellectual toiling, rather than as a main course, or as a substitute for breakfast, lunch or dinner.I'm not sure if I would have enjoyed this as a younger person. This is apparently the author's final work, and she did not live to see it published. So it is probably the artist at the height of her craft. If she left us with anything to think of how we might all get along, this is, in my estimation, it."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"You know it's very difficult to choose which of Jane Austen's books it the greatest but I can say that this is one I re-read every couple of years. This, the last of Miss Austen's fabulous set of novels, is of the woman who was forced to give up her love and then never loved another. The heroine is more mature than those of her others books, not quite so insentive to others, nor as judgemental. Maybe the most exasperating aspect of this book is that you can see that once reunited, the two still love each other, but obey those deeply instilled lessons in behavior to the point that I find myself almost saying 'for goodness sake, just tell him you love him still'! But that wouldn't be a Jane Austen novel, for you'ld miss the ongoing narrative of families who behave even as families do today, and all of the love knots would not be tied only as neatly as this queen of the early novel could do. Oh, if only she had lived longer, but at least we still, almost 200 years later still have her masterpieces to read over and over!"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I am a big fan of Jane Austen. She has so much wit and characteristics within her characters. For one, In PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, it is apparent that a thinly disguised Jane Austen is the heroine. The romantic comedy is played fondly between Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy, but in this case, it is Anne Eliot and her former beau, Frederick Wentworth. Under &quot;persuasion&quot;, she is forced to lose her regard for him because of his low connections. Seven years past and he again re-enters her life when his sister and her husband rents Kellynch Hall, since Anne's father needed the money. She avoids meeting him, but when they had no choice in their accidental visits, he meets her with cold civility. He courts the rash and young Louisa Musgrove, but an unfortunate accident changes the direction of his eyes to fall upon Anne once more. As the begin a steady friendship, the ones they are involved with fall for others, and they reflect upon what they once had and have a pleasant life together. Anne might not appear as strong as most of Jane Austen's characters, but she still has the firm beliefs of the world and would not allow things such as vanity or fortune to stand in the way of her happiness."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Every person has the power to influence those around us. Although very few people hold such high positions, like the president, to sway the masses, everyone has the ability to influence their friends and family members. Moreover, anyone who is a role model, mentor, or parent has a moral obligation to take their power of influence very seriously. Under what circumstances should you try to persuade another? What happens if your arguments persuaded someone towards the wrong decision, whether intentionally or not? And on the flip side, how much should we allow others to influence us?Persuasion tackles all of these questions and explores so much more. It is a rich, thoughtful novel full of romance, social critique, and, of course, many variations on the theme of persuasion.The novel opens in 1814 with the introduction of the baronet Sir Walter Elliot of Kellynch Hall and his three daughters: Elizabeth, Anne, and Mary. Elizabeth, the eldest daughter, is Sir Walter's favorite. Anne is the often overlooked middle child, and the youngest, Mary is an attention seeking hypochondriac, who also happens to be Sir Walter's only married daughter.Sir Walter is a spendthrift, and consequently, his household finances are a mess. In order to get his finances under control, he rents out Kellynch Hall and moves to Bath with Elizabeth. Anne remains behind for a few months, and lives with her sister Mary and Mary's husband, Charles Musgrove, at Uppercross. By coincidence, the tenants of Kellynch Hall are Admiral and Mrs. Croft, and Mrs. Croft's brother just happens to be a Captain Wentworth, a former love of Anne Elliot. Hence, under these circumstances, Anne and Captain Wentworth are brought together after eight years apart. In their past history, the two were very much in love, but Anne was persuaded to break off her engagement to Captain Wentworth, for he was deemed an unfit husband for her. When the two meet again, there is so much delicious, suspenseful tension between them that lasts throughout the entire novel.As with all of Jane Austen's novels, the language may be difficult for some readers. Just be patient, and you'll likely get used to it.I must admit that Pride and Prejudice remains my favorite Jane Austen novel, but Persuasion is nonetheless an excellent and thought-provoking novel with a simple and beautiful romance. I highly recommend it, and hope that you are persuaded to try it."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Let me just start this review with that fact that I am a HUGE Jane Austen fan. I love the language and I think it's a shame that we don't speak like that anymore. However, this is not my favorite Austen book. There is not a lot going on in this book besides the pining of Anne Elliot and while I was reading this book I kept waiting for something to happen. Although I do have to say that I LOVED the ending, which I won't go into cause I do not want to spoil anything for future readers. I do not want to discourage anyone from reading this book because Austen is great either way but for me personally this book was just a little underdeveloped in comparison to her other novels. Still a must read though for any Austen fan!!!"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"In Jane Austen's time, young women were taught that it was practically their duty to \\"marry well\\" -- someone of at least equal social/financial standing.But if a woman turned down a suitor for being poor, she ran the risk of losing the man she loved. That's the problem for Anne Elliott, the heroine of Jane Austen's final novel \\"Persuasion\\" -- a delicate romance that takes place AFTER the romance, rejection and heartrending sorrow. There's some slight roughness around the edges, but the story and the characters are simply brilliant.Eight years ago, Anne Elliott was engaged to the handsome, intelligent and impoverished sailor Frederick Wentworth, but was persuaded to dump him by the family friend Lady Russell.Now she's twenty-seven (ancient by the time's standards), and her vain father Sir Walter is facing financial ruin. So he decides to relocate to Bath and rent out the vast family estate -- and it turns out that the new tenant is Frederick's brother-in-law. Of course, Anne still loves Frederick, but he doesn't seem to feel the same, especially since he's rumored to be interested in some younger, flirtier girls.And Anne's worries increase when she joins her family in Bath, where her father is attempting to live the lifestyle he feels he deserves (since he's a baronet). His heir, William Elliott, recently reestablished contact with his relatives -- and he seems very interested in Anne. But Anne suspects that he has ulterior motives... even if she doesn't realize how Frederick truly feels about her.It's pretty obvious that Jane Austen wrote \\"Persuasion\\" late in her life -- not only is Anne Elliott older than her other heroines, but she seems to have been more sympathetic to women who bowed to society's \\"persuasions.\\" This was the last book that Austen wrote before her untimely death, and it was only published posthumously.As a result, the book can be a little rough and the story is rather simple. But Austen's writing is still intense and powerfully vivid. Her prose is elegant and smooth, and her dialogue is full of hidden facets. The half-hidden love story of Anne and Frederick is among Austen's most skillful writing (\\"I am half agony, half hope. Tell me not that I am too late, that such precious feelings are gone for ever\\"), and it's virtually impossible not to be moved by it.And Austen went out of her way to praise the self-made man, who got ahead through merit instead of birth (something that bugs Sir Walter). She also pokes holes in social climbers, vain aristocrats (\\"Few women could think more of their personal appearance than he did\\"), nasty family and false friends.Anne herself is a very rare heroine, both then and now -- she's past her designated \\"marriage\\" years and would have been considered a lost cause. But she remains remains kind, thoughtful, quiet, intelligent, and as time goes on she starts to appreciate her own judgement instead of being \\"persuaded.\\" And Captain Wentworth is a vibrant portrayal of a strong man who worked his way to the top, but had to do so without the woman he loved.Jane Austen's last finished novel is a little rough in places, but the exquisite beauty of Frederick and Anne's love story is simply staggering. Truly a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"PERSUASION, Jane Austen's last completed novel was written between 1815 and 1816, with final chapter revisions in August of that year. Published posthumously in late 1817 with her earlier work NORTHANGER ABBEY, each of the novels represents the alpha and omega of her writing career. Even though they are divergent in tone and topic, they each share a commonality in being partially set in Bath and display Austen's trademark play on social strata, money and courtship. Austen finished the manuscript of PERSUASION in declining health which may account for its slim size in comparison to her heftier previous efforts MANSFIELD PARK (1814) and EMMA (1816). Or, quite possibly it is exactly the length that she preferred for her story, allowing for a simpler plot and focus on fewer characters. Its size in no way diminishes it value. Some scholars consider it her finest achievement and readers have long cherished it for its jab at social mobility and moving love story.In 1817 Austen wrote to her niece Fanny Austen Knight in her usual ironic manner, \\"You may perhaps like the heroine, as she is almost too good for me.\\" At age 27, Anne is not your typical Austen heroine. The middle daughter of Sir Walter Elliot she is from a distinguished family of a landed Baronet. Her vain father takes their aristocratic ancestry and social position very seriously and expects his three daughters to make prominent matches. Quiet, reserved and not as pretty as her father values, Anne is often overlooked and her opinions dismissed by her family; \\"but Anne ... was nobody with either father or sister; her word had no weight; her convenience was always to give way -- she was only Anne.\\" Eight years prior Anne met and fell in love with a young naval officer Frederick Wentworth. Because he did not match her social and financial status, Anne was persuaded by a well meaning family friend to reject his marriage proposal. Wentworth returned to sea and forgets her. Anne never forgets him and remains unmarried. When he returns eight years later a wealthy and successful naval hero he reenters her social sphere with heightened status. On the other hand, Sir Walter's extravagant lifestyle has out paced his income to the point of serious debt and the family must retrench, let Kellynch Hall and remove to Bath. As Anne watches the younger ladies of the neighborhood swoon and play for Captain Wentworth's affections she is painfully aware of her lost bloom of youth, deeply regrets her decision and pensively longs for his favor until a tragic accident at Lyme Regis and events in Bath renew her hopes.In yet another brilliant reading of a Jane Austen classic novel, British actress Juliet Stevenson interprets Austen's poignant story of fidelity and second chances with wry humor and sensitive pathos. Her depth of characterization is remarkable and I am never in doubt that she is relaying Austen's intension faithfully. Those who have previously read the novel will find new enjoyment in this beautifully produced audiobook and those new to Austen's masterpiece will be treated to an unabridged eight hours and forty three minutes of pure perfection. Such equal blending of masterful story and artistic integrity is rarely encountered and I highly recommend it.Laurel Ann, Austenprose"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Jane Austen has been one of the most influential writers of all time. Her beautiful love stories will always be remembered. Her work was ahead of its time, which is why a lot of today's writers emulate her style. My favorite Austen novel is Persuasion.After the heroine, Anne Elliot, was talked into leaving the man she loved, an attractive and financially challenge man named Frederick Wentworth, she felt she couldn't possibly marry a poor man. Eight years later, however, Wentworth returned to his homeland with a fortune and a place in society. It is obvious that those were the times in which social status was the most important thing, not love. Jane Austen had created a beautiful story that people can still relate to. The characters are beautiful and the story is memorable. I have read Pride and Prejudice and Emma, but in my opinion, Persuasion is her best work.This is a beautiful piece of literature, and if you haven't read it, I suggest that you do."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"The language is so Old World, I found it difficult 2 understand.

It's nice to have her collection available to read when the time becomes available and it's difficult to beat the price."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I didn't grow up reading this kind of stuff, so I guess you could say, I am trying to make up for lost time. I haven't read many, and I can't seem to read them in succession, but I am reading them. This is the second Jane Austen novel I've read, and I really couldn't tell you which one I liked better. I think it would probably have to be this one. Maybe it was because I had already had a little practice with Pride? I don't know. But this one, to me, seemed to be a love story from the start, and also seemed to be much sweeter, somehow. But I'm not sure what it was that struck me closer to the heart, because Pride was just as much so...wasn't it? Anyway, if you want to read the classics, and can get past the old english, which to me is kind of elegant, then give this a try. It is a good read, after all..."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"It's no Pride and Prejudice, mainly because the style is strained and nearly unbearable for the first ten or twelve chapters. I could sense the writer struggling against writer's block or imagination failure or something, and it took forever to plod through the staggering, wordy, pieced-together writing of the first third of the book. I doubt it would ever have made it past the slop pile nowadays. A second or third draught might have been a good idea.Anne was very wise and introspective, and while it works great later in the story, in the beginning, I came about half an inch from reaching into the book and cuffing her a good one. Seriously, quit with the pity party Miss Elliot and quit sabotaging yourself.Seems that there were quite a lot of serendipitous plot engines, too. I had a wee bit of trouble suspending my disbelief in some of the more convenient circumstances that occurred later on, and while a little bit of coincidence is never a bad thing, when multiple instances of situations reading like they were manufactured with the express purpose of working out something mentioned no more than two pages (or paragraphs) back, I start to feel like I'm being forced at gun point over a rickety bridge of plot points rather than being gently guided along a carefully crafted path of meticulously arranged thoughts to the inevitable, but still rewarding conclusion.If you have to read this for some strange reason, I'm sorry for you. You'll have to commit to the beginning. If you're reading for leisure, suffer chapters one and perhaps two, then skim the next eight or ten. You won't miss too much, and the writing becomes much more tolerable thereafter. And, if I'm wrong and you find yourself lost, skip to the last three chapters, because they're all anyone ever read this book for to begin with, and you'll get a fairly good summation of it therein."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Beautiful story, have read it many times and will continue to do so, love Jane Austin the title tells the story."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Persuasion has been on my must-read list for a long time, ever since I read Sense and Sensibility and became an Austen fan.

Just pick this book up and READ it!! You won't be sorry!!"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I have now read all of Austen's completed works and wrote reviews for all them as well ^-^. (I'm feeling very proud of myself by now) It's not my favorite, but it's definitely not the worst. And for Jane Austen, even the worst is an enjoyable, entertaining read; I only mean the worst compared to her other novels not on a general scale.To get down to the book, it was quite different from the others. Anne is twenty-eight at the start of the book, she is plain and unattractive having lost her \`bloom' seven years earlier due to the loss of her love, and isn't as witty and sparkling as Elizabeth Bennet or Emma. Yet you don't come to despise her; she's not weak. And when you come to think of it, her agreeing to break off her engagement with the hero was a wise thing to do at her age. If he hadn't acquired a great fortune or perhaps died in service, then where would she be? Plus the fact that she was young and smothered with disapproval all around and the woman she thought of as her mother was dead against the match.So anyway, she also has the most despicable family out of any of Austen's other novels-even Mansfield Park-they are conceited, selfish and self-important. The sad thing is that you realize that people like Sir Walter really exist, people who care solely for appearances and rank. Even Anne's sister Mary, perhaps the nicest sister, is selfish without really meaning it, and treats Anne the way a spoiled child treats it's parents; nicely when it wants something, but all the while thinking: what else do they have in their lives to do but to cater to all my whims?There are a few trivial things I didn't like: first that Sir Walter Elliot is such a snob; Walter is my absolute favorite name! Austen gave it a pretty bad impression. Secondly, I wish that James could have married Anne; I really liked him, much better than the hero, and he suited her so well! I didn't really like the hero of this book; I'm a sucker for the rich, dashing gentlemen of her other novels. You don't really know the hero of this book so well.Anyway, like all her books, the prose is outstanding, her usage of the language remarkable and the reader's attention is never lost; Austen's greatest gift. I have always loved Austen's style of writing, it's great! Great book, highly recommended! Add it to your classics shelf. Don't have one? Get one!!!=^-^="},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"As a big fan of Austen's, I read this book and wasn't disappointed. All of Austen's trademarks are there: her witty commmentary of the British elite, silly men and women who both exasperate and amuse you, and a good love story. Persuasion is about Anne Elliot, who after breaking off an earlier engagement with Captain Wentworth, is suddenly in his company 8 years later, and longing to rekindle the romance. This book wasn't as fun as Pride and Prejudice, mainly because the struggle between Anne and Wentworth doesn't resonate the same way as that between Elizabeth and Darcy. Neither characters are particularly arrogant (though Wentworth is hostile at being rejected before), but it's still interesting to see how the two will find one another among the silliness of the people and situations around them. Jane Austen just has a way of keeping her reader in suspense, no matter if you feel sure you know the ending. The question is always How will they get together rather than if, and the How here will please any romantic reader satisfactorily."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I downloaded the sample chapter onto my Kindle and yes, the line breaks are strange. It does not read flush left to flush right, but rather like poetry in couplets. Which is ironic, given how poorly poetry line breaks are done on many e-readers."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Austen created a literary treasure with this book. The story has all the the usual Austen charms, yet also deals with lost love, age and family pressures. Anne and Wemtworth are qonderful charecters."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"All of Jane Austen's heroines are unique in different ways; Emma Woodhouse was rich and had no pressing need to marry; Fanny Price was shy and introverted; Lizzie Bennett was witty and self-mocking; and Elinor Dashwood had to share the spot-light with her younger sister Marianne. Anne Elliot's defining attribute is that she is considerably older than her literary fellows; for at the grand old age of twenty-seven is nearly past her prime (in the eyes of her contemporaries) and entering perpetual spinsterhood. In a time when a woman was defined by her society almost solely on her success in marriage, things are not looking so good for Anne.This is especially bitter for Anne considering she was once in love with the handsome but poor Frederick Wentworth, but persuaded to break relations between them on the advice of her deceased mother's dearest friend Lady Russell, who disapproved the match. Regretting such an action in the years that followed, Anne has almost reconciled herself to a life of maidenhood, surrounded by self-absorbed relatives.However, fate is about to give her a second chance. Set (and written) as the Napoleonic Wars were ending, Anne learns that Captain Wentworth - now a wealthy and respectful officer - is about to re-enter her acquaintance. After her father is forced to rent out their estate in order to pay off debts, Anne travels to Uppercross Cottage to stay with her sister Mary Musgrove, unsettled with the thought that one of the tenants left behind is the sister of Captain Wentworth. Settling in with the Musgroves and the beautiful Henrietta and Louisa (Mary's sister-in-laws), it is only a matter of time before Mr Musgrove returns with Captain Wentworth in tow.Anne is understandably nervous given their unhappy parting, but forces herself to remain calm and polite in his presence - and to her sorrow he behaves the same toward her, focusing his attention on the Musgrove girls. To stir things up a bit, Anne also meets her estranged cousin Mr Elliot, who is immensely attentive and charming toward her and almost certainly intends to make her his wife.Anne herself is neither pretty nor witty; rather she's patient, kind-hearted, sensible and part of a family that doesn't deserve her. It's not that her father and sisters are unkind, but one can feel Anne's discontent and loneliness in being part of a family that places importance only on riches and rank without any conception that their minds are weak and uninformed. As the only sensible person in a world of self-absorption, Anne trudges through her duties unnoticed and uncomplaining. But she's not perfect, for every reader knows that she's made a mistake in giving up the love of her life (though she comes to a surprising conclusion concerning it in the last chapter, placing her duty to society and family above the demands of her own heart), and as Frederick and Anne dance around each other, hopelessly trapped by the silence that conformity demands, the modern reader will share their frustration in their inability to speak their minds, especially in a world where there are no such restrictions.But of course, this is an Austen book and you don't have to be physic to know that a happy resolution is on its way - but the way in which it is settled is perhaps Austen's most touching union between two characters, made even more poignant by the fact that that it's taken them two tries to find one another. One feels especially happy for Anne, who truly deserves some joy in her life - her reaction to the warmth of the Musgroves' familial life is heartrending when you realise her surprise and appreciation for it is caused by the lack of such warmth in her own family.\\"Persuasion\\" is the shortest of all Austen's novels, as well as the last one she wrote before her death, which should appeal to those who are a bit stretched for time. It's not her best, most beloved or most famous novel, as many of the character simply aren't as vivid or involving as some of her other novels, but it contains the same themes of social commentary, verbal wit and wry insights into the human condition that Austen is famous for. A sweet, slim novel about loyal, love and second chances."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This was the first time I read this book. I know it's a classic and all that, but I really enjoyed it.

Her latest novel Persuasion continues the theme of society, love, and marriage and how money and jealousy interferes. Published posthumously, Persuasion is a dramatic story about persuading others of love, adhering to wishes of family and society, and the subtle hints that foretell every climatic chapter.Widower Sir Walter Elliot lives on his Kellynch-hall estate with his two daughters Elizabeth and Anne. Both girls had unsuccessful chances at marriage: Elizabeth was turned down by Mr. Elliot, a family cousin and heir to Sir Walter's estate who married a plain woman of fortune instead; Anne had a great affair with a Mr. (now Captain) Wentworth, a naval officer who had nothing--and was therefore ineligible--to marry Anne. As Sir Walter falls deeper into debt, the Elliot family leases the estate to an Admiral Croft in order to save money. And Admiral Croft, naturally, is a great friend of Captain Wentworth, who reappears eight years after he and Anne parted. Can Anne persuade Captain Wentworth to lover her once again? The answer lies in the story.Like in her other novels, Jane Austen incorporates the manners and social customs of the early 1800s in her novels. The novel speaks of the \\"great war\\" with Napoleon that the British Navy fought, and the characters are forever thinking about money and royal connections. Anne very much wanted to marry Captain Wentworth when the first fell in love. But English custom demands that a couple gets approval of their marriage from the bride's family. And as Captain Wentworth was poor at the time, the Elliots strictly forbade Anne from marrying him, and she didn't. Throughout the novel the characters also maintain an air of sophistication and elegance--an air required of everyone in the British court. And as Sir Walter Elliot was known in court, the whole family had to behave with \\"utmost decorum.\\"\\"It was impossible for her to have forgotten to feel that this arrival of their common friends must be soon bringing them together again.\\" (Austen 197).Foreshadow is prominent in the novel. In Chapter 2 both Captain Wentworth and Mr. Elliot are mentioned, assuring the reader that they will be prominent main characters. It was not until the end that the characters discover the reason behind Mr. Elliot's first marriage, but one character hinds that \\"money, money was all that he wanted\\" (Austen 178). After page 17 it becomes obvious to the reader what would happen between Anne and Captain Wentworth, for \\"repeating his name so often...was a new sort of trial on Anne's nerves\\" (Austen 44). Little hints along the way suck the reader deeper and deeper into the story.Although \\"Proper English\\" is intimidating when reading Jane Austen's stories, her plots are classics in love and marriage. Anyone who has gone through a painful break up or a dramatic relationship knows just how much money, family and jealously can ruin a relationship. Austen dramatically tells the stories of her heroines while maintaining a 19th century setting, and drops subtle hints along the way to keep readers hooked. Persuasion is a classic that is understood and loved by all who read it."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I am not quite sure why Persuasion is not quite as good asSense and Sensibility or Pride and Prejudice. It is a well constructedstory, and if anything, the secondary characters are more amusingthan those in her other novels. However, the main charactersare just too restrained (maybe repressed is a better wordhere). Their exchanges, and frequently lack thereof, makes it a bitfrustrating. However, this is still an excellent read - entertainingfrom start to finish."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Everyone else has said all there is to say about Austen, her writing, and this plot. I want to thank Penguin Classics for the endnotes in this edition. They were comprehensive, clear, attractively presented (instead of being wedged into the text), and helpful to 21st-century readers of this early 19th-century novel. The scholarly introduction (with a spoiler warning, how thoughtful!) and the biographical timeline help place the book in both literary and chronological context, and were substantive additions to this work."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This novel, written by the mature Jane Austen and published after her death, reveals the strengths of Austen's art. First, she is a careful and exact observer of human character, as compared to those that base a novel of emotion or behavior. Second, she is totally aware of class distinctions and the determinism that is created by a rigid class structure. She explores how character is independent of class but often mistakenly associated with upper class persons. Third, Austen is also a comedic writer, full of wit and funny portrayals of hypocrites, though many may find fault with my interpretation below since this aspect of Austen's art is rarely discussed. Fourth, Austen carefully portrays the world of 17th century upper class women which could be viewed as oppressive, paternalistic, and deterministic. However she continually portrays women as resilient actors rather than victims.She was a superb observer and interpreter of human character. This is different from those contemporary authors who are more likely to explore emotion and behavior. Character in the work of Austen is destiny and good character eventually leads to better outcomes and poor character leads to worse outcomes. Whereas at times her characters exhibit emotion, they are more likely to withhold emotion and when this withholding is done carefully and discretely, Austen would see this as signs of good character. Whereas she has high regard for honesty, she seems to see honesty as having both a proper method of presentation and to have proper timing in order to have impact. The letter Captain Wentworth writes to Anne Elliott at the end of the novel is a perfect example of suppressed emotion transformed into carefully strategically timed truth-telling.Class differences play and huge role in the works of Austen and Persuasion explores this with the romance of a rich girl of noble family in love with a handsome but middle class young man who both have reversal of fortune and 8 years later re-encounter each other. Anne Elliott is surrounded by a father, two sisters, and her deceased mother's best friend; all of whom use social class as a cognitive short hand for who is worthy and who is not. Anne is the character that can penetrate the smoke of social class to see the true strengths of character underneath. Interestingly, when Persuasion was written, the Napoleonic wars were over and many young men who made their fortunes in the British navy returned with fortunes into English society. Here the new rich encounter the old landed rich, a formula for social upheaval. Austen perfectly articulates this as the Elliott family vacates their ancestral home, Kellynch, and rent the mansion to an Admiral and his wife.Austen was witty and could be considered a comedic writer. Her descriptions of human folly, prejudice, snobbery, and hypocrisy are all skillfully handled. She never preaches. She allows the snob, the fool, the hypocrite to reveal themselves through their speech and interactions. The outburst of Anne's father, Sir Elliott, upon hearing this his daughter is visiting a sickly poor school friend instead of visiting barely know distant rich relatives is priceless.In summary, Austen's Persuasion is a good example of Austen's considerable skill at character analysis and revelation and development of character in social interactions and social contexts. She is delightful to read."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I have no right to review Jane Austen. I give this book 5 billion stars."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Persuasion is Jane Austen's most sophisticated story and writing. She lovingly and incisively demonstrates the problems of being a well-bred sensitive person in a society that's more intrigued by social standing, money, and polite conversation than by good character.Persuasion is Anne Elliot's story. The title's initial allusion is to Anne's brush with matrimony when a promising, but not rich, naval officer, Captain Wentworth, proposed and she fell in love with him at 19. But Anne's deceased mother's friend, Lady Russell, persuaded Anne not to make the match. Up until the time of the story, Anne hasn't had another suitor and she's now well past the usual age of marriage at 29 and \\"her bloom had vanish early.\\" Her father's spendthrift ways mean that Anne could bring little money to a marriage so she's expecting not to marry.While in her social class that lack of a husband is a drawback, in reality her family is a greater problem. Her father, Sir Walter Elliot, is a baronet who spends too much money, is obsessed by social rank, loves to be around the \\"beautiful people\\" and admire himself in a mirror, and keeps company with an unsuitable, scheming widow, Mrs. Clay, who is looking for a husband and has latched onto Elizabeth as friend. Anne's older sister, Elizabeth, is also unmarried and is as equally obsessed with social status as their father. Both Sir Walter and Elizabeth fail to value Anne and looked to her to suit their conveniences. The other daughter, Mary, is married but the connection doesn't thrill either Sir Walter or Elizabeth. Mary sees Anne as a virtual servant who should wait on her every beck and call when Anne is her guest.Due to Sir Walter's over spending of his income, it is decided he will rent the family estate, Kellynch Hall, while he, Elizabeth, and Anne take up less expensive quarters and a reduced social life in Bath. This change sets lots of new events into motion, not the least of which is Anne being re-introduced to Captain Wentworth who now has a fortune and seems to be looking for a lively, young wife. Only their common commitment to being polite makes time in one another's company tolerable. What strong emotions burn under the surface? She's very embarrassed, but Captain Wentworth is hard to read.In the course of the book, you'll find out a lot about social climbing in Regency England, the finances of the social elites and those who were up-and-coming, how marriage agreements were struck, and how the naval officers differed from the gentry. You'll also be impressed, I'm sure, by the patina of politeness that served as a social lubricant among people who often didn't care a trifle for one another.In such a society, people mostly wore masks of being thoughtful, considerate people while in reality they were seldom thinking about very much and didn't care much for others. Anne Elliot is the exception in that her heart and mind are actually devoted to the service of others.One of the most interesting parts of the story is how it was possible (mostly by accident) to sort out the phonies from among those with glittering manners.Anne Elliot is one of the most memorable and admirable characters in English literature. Do read this book and find out about the other kinds of persuasion that took place during this year of her fictional life. You'll be delighted that you did."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Persuasion is an utter delight to read. This book was written almost 200 years ago but the story could just as well have been written today. It is still fresh and gives a tremendous light on the life and mannerisms of people that lived long ago - nothing much has changed i take it! Jane Austen is witty and has the tremendous ability to describe situations and relationships. She is also the master of suspense. Persuasion is a moving story that describes the human ability to patiently and agonisingly wait for happiness or love as it were. I thoroughly enjoyed the book and will never forget the character of Miss Anne Elliot. A delightful read indeed."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I hold very firmly to the belief that this book cannot be fully appreciated in a first reading. It is necessary to read it at least twice, and preferably more.It's not as immediately pleasing as some of Ms. Austen's other works, Pride & Prejudice, Sense & Sensibility etc., but those who take the time to appreciate this book will find it well worth the effort."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"PERSUASION, the last novel that Jane Austen completed before her death in 1818, tells the story of one Anne Elliot, the second daughter of a baronet who has spent his waythrough his fortune and has nothing but his title to lean on.When she was 21 years old, Anne fell in love with and was engaged to Frederick Wentworth, a young captain in the Navy. Her belated mother's best friend, Lady Russell, dissapproves of the match as being below Anne, due to Anne's claim to nobility, and Anne cancels the engagement, much to her and and Captain Wentworth's grief.Nearly eight year's have passed since she broke off her engagement to Captain Wentworth when she, Lady Russell, and a Mr. Shepherd, a friend of her father's, are forced to pose and intervention and tell her father that he must quit his estate and find someone to lease it to, or he will be sent tot he poorhouse. Her father, his only pride being in his social position and personal appearance, relents, but only if they can find suitable tenants - which they do in Admiral Croft and his wife, the sister of Captain Wentworth.Anne thinks that her broken heart has mended, until she sees him again. unfortunately, he is now attached to another . . . and yet Anne sees clues in his behavior that he may be hers once again. Anne and Wentworth must negotiate their past, their different social classes, and proper behavior to find their way back to one another.What sets PERSUASION appart from Austens' other novels is how modern it seems in comparison. Austen takes more liberty with point of view in this novel, the characters have much richer inner lives than the Bennet's or Dashwood's ever did.This novel is highly recommended to anyone who would enjoy Jane Austen. Though the ending is predictable, it does not always seem so, and therefore the novel was a very suspenseful read."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I'm persuaded to find this a most charmingly written story.

In this reader's eyes, neither of these extremes occurred with \\"Persuasion.\\" It most definitely had its romantic moments. Captain Wentworth's culminating profession of love to heroine Anne make that case better than I ever could: \\"You pierce my soul. I am half agony and half hope. Tell me not that I am too late, that such precious feelings are gone for ever. ...

It is often criticized for being too short and not up to par with Austen's other novels. Persuasion was in fact written during the onset of the disease that eventually killed the author. Her final novel may indeed be considered different from her previous novels. It is the only Austen novel where the female protagonist is close to becoming a spinster. Persuasion is a very different type of novel with a love story told in retrospect, an unexpected villain, and an unintentional, but very bad piece of advice that negatively impacts many lives.The main protagonist in this book is Anne Elliot. Anne is the middle daughter of Sir Walter Elliot. Sir Elliot was once a man of property and weath, but his ostentatious manner of living has considerably dimished his fortune. The great Elliot family retain only a much respected name and a fine estate named Kellynch Hall. Sir Walter is forced to confront his inability to retain the standard of living once enjoyed at the estate. He is asked to consider many options, including trimming down the number of servants, but all options seem appalling to the proud Sir Elliot.Under the advice of a family friend, Sir Elliot agrees to let Kellynch Hall and retire to Bath with his eldest and middle daughter. Sir Elliot is not the only one in the family who takes the advice of the much respected Lady Russell, a widow and friend of the deceased Lady Elliot.Anne Elliot was once engaged and very much in love with a poor, but honorable naval officer named Frederick Wentworth. Anne, however, broke off the engagement after Lady Russell convinced her that it would be a grave mistake for a young lady of her station to marry someone so far beneath her.Eight lonely years go by for Anne, and the years have not been kind to her. The author writes that her beauty has considerably dimished. One who may have known Anne years ago would hardly find her recognizable. Over the years, Anne has forced herself not to think \\"of that person\\" as Anne often refers to Frederick Wentworth. The reader is immediately aware of Anne's lingering feelings for the man she heartlessly and foolishly rejected.She is forced to confront her feelings when the family that leases Kellynch Hall turn out to be relations of now wealthy Captain Wentworth. There is much awkwardness and dread as Anne prepares to face the man she once loved and let go. Captain Wenworth, however, appears indifferent and one would hardly suspect from his cold behavior towards Anne that the two were ever even acquainted!Throughout the novel Anne desperately looks for and finds small little details in Captain Wentworth behavior that the love he had for her has not diminished entirely. But can he forgive her for snubbing him?I absolutely adored this novel about the one who got away, but there is so much more to the story than just Anne and Captain Wentworth. The book is full of lively characters, such as Anne's pompous father, her self-indulgent sister, Elizabeth, and many others. Most people are aquainted with Austen's Pride and Prejudice and Emma, but Persuasion should be recognized for the fine novel that it is."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This was the first JA book I've ever read, I really enjoyed it, and not in small part because of the footnotes, and discussion included in this penguin edition. It really helped me to understand the story and the times they were living in much better.

That is what Anne Elliot does. Frederick Wentworth is a dashing naval officer, but well beneath Anne's station. She is, after all, the daughter of Sir Walter Elliot, baronet and master of Kellynch Hall. Not only is Wentworth a penniless officer, he is also ambitious and confident. According to Anne's particular friend Lady Russell, those qualities are unbecoming in a man. And so, out of safety, Anne severs her engagement to Wentworth. Fast-forward eight years. Anne is now twenty-seven, still single, still disinclined to marry. Her father has little money and is now forced to let Kellynch Hall to a well-respected admiral. Among the admiral's society is Anne's former fianc&eacute;, now Captain Wentworth, well respected and very rich. Anne's love for Wentworth reemerges, but is it too late? Is his indifference so big that he won't even speak to her? Could she somehow persuade him to give their love another try?This is Jane Austen's final finished work. It was published in 1818, one year after her death. Persuasion is a masterpiece and my second favorite Austen (after Pride and Prejudice). This novel contains Austen's signature comedy of manners, but it's not her funniest effort. It is, however, her most romantic. Whose heart doesn't break when Anne watches Wentworth court both the Musgrove sisters, and listens to her sister and brother-in-law argue over who Wentworth should choose to be his bride? Who hasn't choked up with The Letter? (Persuasion fans know what I'm talking about.) This is the third -- or is it the fourth? -- time I read this book, and I still tear up when I read that bit! Persuasion is a wonderful novel, but it isn't perfect. Various secondary characters are either one-dimensional or underdeveloped, and I would have liked the scenes in Lyme to be expanded, for those are my favorite scenes. Alas, if you're an Austen fan, there is plenty of her signature stuff here: the pretentious gentry, the unscrupulous opportunists, the parties and get-togethers and courtships and descriptions of the countryside. I like that this novel is partly set in Bath, giving it the genuine Regency setting that makes Jane Austen unique. If you've never read Persuasion, I cannot persuade you to read this enough! And if you've read this and are a fan, may I perhaps persuade you to read it again?"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Although also a romance like Austen's better known novels, Emma and Pride and Prejudice, Persuasion is a subtle one, with a theme not of whirlwind passion but of constancy and devotion. The main character, Anne Elliott, was very much in love with Captain Wentworth as a young girl, but was persuaded by friends and family to reject him as a husband. Broken-hearted, Wentworth went to sea, and the novel actually begins when he re-enters Anne's life eight years later, having made his career and his money.Anne is a character to whom the reader can easily relate: introspective, analyzing everything and flawed, able to make make mistakes and recover from them. She narrowly averts an unhappy life by not letting her friends and family persuade her again to marry her cousin, who has money and manners but turns out to be quite despicable. And while Captain Wentworth does not have the dash or charm of a Mr. Darcy, he is Anne's one true love, as prone to the follies of a broken heart as she is subject to the strong influence of those around her.The underlying theme is about choices and following one's heart. If Anne had only listened to her own feelings instead of allowing others to sway her, she would have found happiness sooner. Despite what seems like an afterthought of a speech at the end of the novel, when Anne justifies her earlier behavior, this seems to be a strongly feminist novel, advocating the rights of women to choose their own way in life and their own partners for life, rather than be guided solely by considerations of fortune and class.This is also one of Austen's funnier novels, particularly the scenes featuring Anne's sisters and father, who are incredibly self-absorbed. Their dialogue--constantly misreading the situation in their own favor or stating something when the opposite is true--brings a welcome lightheartedness to the story."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"excellent book, love the characters and its an easy and quick read. i love reading the books more the watching the movies."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"My favorite Jane Austen book.

It's a book that I've enjoyed reading again and again."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Sometimes there's nothing better than settling in with an old favorite. Austen's Persuasion is a story of rediscovering what is lost. More than lost, what was let go. With her apt view of society of the day, the story still bears out all these years later."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Just what you'd expect from a Jane Austen novel. Romance, suspense, jealousy, unrequited love, all of it. By far one of the best books I've read since Pride and Prejudice. Jane Austen's books really draw the reader into the story and cause the reader to empethize with the heroine. She knows just how to tug at a person's heart strings through the plight of the main characters. A wonderful book, and one that I will read again and again."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I love all Jane Austen's books, but this is my personal favorite. The way the characters interact is very humerous, but the story is touching. I feel more of a connection to Anne than to any of Austen's other characters, and I love the way she and Wentworth fall in love... again."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Persuasion is a very good book. It's slower than the contemporary novel, which is to be expected (it is nearly 200 years old, after all). Like all of Austen's other novels, it is of course a social commentary. It's a story of delayed love and patience. It's been called her 'most romantic.' The idea of the old love, Captain Wentworth, coming back after years apart and both parties still being in love IS very romantic, but I disagree with it being her most romantic. It's a very sweet story, and also pretty straightforward. It was a lot of fun to read, and a good story."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"As an avid fan of Jane Austen, I began reading \\"Persuasion\\" with great expectations. Although I cannot say I am dissapointed, I must admit I did not like Persuasion as much as Pride and Prejudice or Sense and Sensibility.First of all, although I sympathized with Anne when he was slighted by her own family and she was taken no notice of in the company of foolish women just because she is not as pretty and \\"fragile\\" as them, maybe because she is not as strong and passionate a character as Elizabeth Bennet in Pride and Prejudice, I could not particularly attach myself to her. Still, I read the novel from beginning to the end in a very short time because it has more than enough to keep our interest. Especially the character of Mrs. Croft, the sister of Captain Wentworth is worth notice; because among the \\"ailing\\" and \\"fatigued\\" women of the higher classes of that time, this woman who walks long distances with her husband, who accompanies him on long sea journeys and takes the reins of their carriage to manoeuvre out of the way of a post is very interesting. In this novel, Jane Austen says quiet a lot of things which can be thought quiet feministic. Well she says similar things in P&P;, for example she makes Darcy say that Elizabeth's complexion is greatly improved after a long walk, when Bingley's sisters criticize her for such an unlady-like behaviour.Another thing about the novel is that we don't really know the feelings of Captain Wentworth. It is true that the letter he writes to Anne at the end is full of love but I didn't feel his passion as I did Darcy's when he proposed to Elizabeth the first time.All in all, I recommend the book to readers who have read Austen's other novels. But as a first read it may not be so enjoyable as Pride and Prejudice or Sense and Sensibility."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Though not as well known as the novels that established the author's name (Pride and Prejudice, Emma), Persuasion is certainly worth your time. It's extremely well-written with superb characterization. The plot isn't too original by today's standards, but is interesting nonetheless. Anne Elliot, the smartest and most pleasant by far of three upper class sisters, is 28 and still single. At 19 she fell in love with and almost married a dashing naval officer named Frederick Wentworth. However, great pressure from her family and relations &quot;persuaded&quot; her to reject Frederick due to his lower station in society. Frederick was greatly hurt and promptly went off to engage his energies in naval action.Eight and a half years later, Anne still hasn't met another guy she likes as much as Frederick and remains single. But now Frederick returns from war, retired, extremely wealthy from privateering with mercenaries, and more mature. He's ready to settle down and a chance family connection puts him back in the same neighborhood as Anne! He's still upset with Anne. And this time, other women are catching his eye too...While not up to the standards of Anne Bronte's outstanding The Tenant of Wildfell Hall, Persuasion is a good classical romance novel. I think it beats out Thomas Hardy's Far From the Madding Crowd on plot and characterization, though Hardy's prose is generally more powerful. Nevertheless, Austen can be quite poignant when she wants to be: Wentworth's shocking letter to Anne at the end of the book moved even me, a generally left-brained emotionless creature!A highlight of the novel is the illuminating social commentary that Austen subtly inserts into the prose. Clearly, she felt that the class system entrenched in British society at the time had its shortcomings. The endnotes in the Penguin edition do a good job of explaining the finer points of Austen's many jabs at class-conscious folks including Anne's self-absorbed father Walter and hopeless sister Elizabeth. Anne's other sister Mary is rendered superbly by Austen as a basically good-natured woman unfortunately marred by a touch of vanity. I personally know a Mary or two.Recommended to all adult readers!"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I'm surprised that the other reviewers on this page are so lukewarm to Persuasion. True, it is not a perfect book, but I found it immensly enjoyable and well written. It is different to Austen's other novels, and having just finished Emma the difference was obvious to me, but it is also a completely different kind of book. It is written by an older and more serious woman than the one who penned Pride and Prejudice and Emma, and tells the story of an older, though still relatively young woman, who is haunted by a terrible choice she made several years ago to please her family and friends.The book is far more Romantic than anything else Austen wrote, and I also found it more streamlined and focussed. There are no chapters on how to set the table, like there were in Emma.I was a little disappointed in the end, as Austen doesn't record the conversation between Anne Eliot and Captain Wentworth, but instead tells us in a detached way what topics they spoke of. Still, that's a fairly minor quibble against what was really a very good book."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"i've read this book twice, and it has highly recommended itself both the times. its a more mature work of jane austen perhaps it being her last book.anne elliot, the heroine is reserved, elegant and reflective ..she had fallen in love with a very desirable young man, wentworth, but his connections and moreso his position in society made it not all desirable for anne's beloved friend, lady l to allow her to continue her relationship.now 7 years later they meet again to renew their love and affection; he being a captain now and possessing a large enough fortune. though at first he receives the attentions of louisa musgrove and anne the attentions of her cousin, mr. elliot, the heir to her father, they soon come to realise that what felt from the heart is the truest meaning of love. with the help of her many friends anne soon returns the affections she once held for captain wentworth."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Although the social formulas are not compatible with the present times, I was moved by the power of the emotions and the psychology of all the characters.

Austen's tale of true-love's fulfillment impeded by the perceptions of others' views about the appropriateness of the parties involved leaves the reader questioning his or her own pursuits of love.Austen writes of the how the road to one's soul-mate sometimes takes a long and twisted journey, through time, one's self-doubts, and the perception of others. It may take Anne and Capt. Bentwick over eight years, but true love prevails as Austen's fans all know.Also, Austen takes her sharp-witted pen once again to people's views of love, social climbing, societal views on women, and status-bound troglodytes. Austen still inspires today readers to question his or her own motives in love, as well as the motives of others.Finally, Austen wraps this beautiful tale of true love in the exquisiteness of her style--both vividly concrete and syntactically challenging--and her character study of the status-quo breaking heroine."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I chose this reading because I am a Jane Austen fan and have not read Persuasion since in high school. Her style is definitely refreshing for that period of time."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Personally, I think this is Jane Austen's best work. It's certainly her most mature. Anne Elliott is born into a prideful aristocratic family. At a young age, she nearly marries the love of her life, only to break it off after being persuaded by a mother-like figure (on grounds of his not being able to support her properly). He tries to drown his sorrow in his career in the Navy while she stays quietly at home and suffers the Cinderella-like treatment she receives at home.Circumstances throw them back together again 7-1/2 (I believe) years later; Captain Wentworth did well in the war and is now the object of all the young ladies. Watching them re-unite and deal with the hurt of the past is well worth the read. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"A charming story. One child that stands out from the rest. To the good all works out in the end."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I was recommended this read by my college professor. Hey enjoyable and so deep on a wide multitude of areas."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"It is my all time fav Austen read. The Kindle version has a few flaws such as odd spacing or spelling errors but nothing that you are not able to figure out. The price is right at FREE."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"What a surprise to find a character like Anne Elliot hiding between the pages of Persuasion. If you met Anne Elliot today, chances are you probably wouldn't remember her - but she would remember you -- so unused are we to being observed quietly and subtly. She is not a typical heroine, by modern standards, who speaks her mind freely and is a person of action. Elizabeth Bennet in Pride &amp; Prejudice comes to mind when I think of modern heroines -- outspoken and clever.What makes Anne Elliot a peculiar heroine is her ability to listen and observe -- two qualities most of us would consider rather passive. I find it interesting that at the opening of the book, Anne Elliot is described as a woman who is past the first bloom of youth and you get the sense that life is passing her by. But these qualities give Jane Austen the opportunity to capture the subtle inner workings of Anne Elliot's heart. Anne does not have beauty as a means of getting her way; the idea of having her own way to get would be unthinkable to her. So we are left to focus on her thoughts and feelings.So much in the book is left unsaid which in turn speaks volumes. It is quite delightful to find a character who is defined not only by the things they say but by the things they don't say; by what they do and the things they don't do."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I enjoy all of Jane Austen's novels but find this one to be my favorite. It is the most thoughtful and emotional and relies less on external events than the other novels. Anne Elliot is older than all of Jane Austen's other heroines. Her maturity shows in the way she handles her family's financial problems, her reunion with Wentworth, the events at Lyme, and the final happy moment when they reconcile. The ending was fulfilling and satisfying, and all that I could have hoped for, after, literally, reading Anne's thoughts."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"In Mrs. Croft's statement &quot;we women don't want to be in calm waters all our lives&quot; Jane Austen and her heroine, Anne Elliott, move beyond the domestic, from the bracing sea air of Lyme, to glimpses into the seafaring adventures of the Navy brethren. This to me is the predominate appeal of Persuasion - Anne, in her approaching maturity, is reunited with her former suitor in what we may expect is a deeper, more heartfelt love, having endured separation for so many years and she has the prospect of joining him at sea. My heart leaps to see her escaping domesticity and the dull social duties as exemplified by Sir Walter and her sister Elizabeth. Of course, Austen's use of language is perfect. My favourite Austen novel. The film adaptation with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds exquisitely captures the mood and characters of this book."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I've just finished reading 'Persuasion' and I loved it. At first glance Anne Elliot is somewhat of a doormat; then we learn that she is the only unselfish and rational member of her family, who has been putting their needs before hers for the last eight years and is finally sick of it. I was delighted at Jane's - whoops, I mean Anne's - rebellion against her position and her coming into her own as a woman deserving of love."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I have to agree with the other reviewers of Jane Austen's Persuasion: this has to be one of her best works. The poignancy of the emotions throughout the novel were so present, so real. The writing drew me into the story, and I could hardly put the book down. Was the language too flowery? Not at all. It was beautiful. And I was quite sorry to see the words &quot;The End.&quot;There is something to be said about a book that captures the imagination and piques the curiosity. This book is one of them."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Persuasion is Jane Austen at her best. The novel is most brilliantly thought out and beautifully presented. With romance at the forefront Austen nevertheless apprehends the task of presenting valuable life lessons. She achieves the intensity of the most gripping works, the light-heartedness of the most comical, and the wonder of the fantastic. This novel challenges whatever good lies dormant and inspires what's honorable in you. It also warms the heart."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I found Persuasion to be the most mature of all Austen's works. The story of Anne Elliot's simple yet poignantly lost love (and final redemption)is heartfelt. The language, I think, is sophisticated and not pretentious. However, I think that most interesting aspect of this is that fact that when I read this book 20 years later, I will be able to feel its profoundity on yet another level."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Persuasion is Austen's version of Hans Christian Andersen's &quot;The Ugly Duckling.&quot; How does Anne Elliot deal with her &quot;faded bloom?&quot; Throughout the novel, Austen depicts a most sympathetic character, Anne Elliot, that a woman of the 1990's can readily identify with. Anne Elliot is pulled in each and every direction as she tries to fit in and find her own self. This is not just another one of Austen's cliched marriage plots. It is a book about learning to cope and evaluating one's culture."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Persuasion is a fantastic novel by Jane Austen. I've read all of her works, and this is one of my absolute favorites. Even though it was written so long ago, the plot could be something that happened to someone today. Persuasion is about a young couple who loves each other but is persuaded to end the relationship because the girl isn't \\"acceptable\\" for the boy since she doesn't come from a wealthy family. They eventually meet again, and the story continues to unfold. I actually used Persuasion for the subject of one of my long papers in college, and it was so fascinating to dig into the story as well as the story behind the story. There are actually a lot of similarities between this story and Jane's own story. Jane Austen is an incredible author, and Persuasion is one of her greatest works."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"After reading Northanger Abbey, I decided to round out my Austen reading with Persuasion. About halfway through this book, I wasn't really thinking that it would be on the same level as the other Austen books (in my mind at least). I didn't feel anything much toward the characters or their situations. But the second half of the book changed my feelings and I grew more agitated reading it - will Anne and Captain Wentworth ever realize that they still love each other? There it was! I felt for the characters and their situations. And the letter Wentworth writes to Anne absolutely melted me. What girl wouldn't want to receive a letter like that!"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Anne Elliot and Captain Frederick Wentworth were happily in love and ready to be married - until Anne's friend Lady Russel persuades her that Captain Wentworth, a poor man in the army, is not the man for her. Eight years later, however, society brings them together again. Anne still loves him, and she must divulge if he still loves her, a hard task considering all the lovely young women who would do anything to marry the handsome and now wealthy Captain. Persuasion is a story filled with jealousy and uncertainty, as well as passion, simple joy, and a powerful, unconditional love.Persuasion is my third Austen novel (the first being Pride and Prejudice, then Sense and Sensibility); I loved it. It kept me up late at night - midnight and later. I finished it in four days, which is a record for me as I do not read classics very quickly.In one word, I would say this is a simple book, in the best sense. It is written well and the way the events of the story are played out build the characters' personalities, their way of living. The story progresses in just a way that mirrors Anne's feelings for Wentworth... In the beginning, there is no word of a Captain Wentworth, and Anne's life is happy. At least, on the outside. As everything falls into place, however, Anne becomes more and more unnerved and unable to conceal her love, the love she's had all along. The tension between the Captain and Anne Elliot was substantial and realistic. I was very impressed and am every excited to read and re-read all of Austen's wonderful novels. They're sitting on my shelf...waiting!"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Ms. Austen writes a fantastic story for the most part. The gossip was a little much at times. And the stereotypical situations and feelings were accurate even if a little annoying. The story flowed fairly well. I was impressed with keeping all the different characters and traits separate. Just a lot going on and different story lines. I was impressed with how much was in the book and everything was wrapped up neatly. Some things hadn't happened yet but you knew what was going to happen.I truly felt for Anne. She was trying to follow the influence of a friend since her mother was dead. I understand but she finally had to figure out for herself what was right and stick to it. Things seemed to go better now that she was older. Family and friends didn't fight things for her so much. Of her family members I loved her older sister Mary the best. She had her moments where she would get \\"sick\\" or get frustrated with her husband for making plans when plans were already made. But she had to learn to speak up as well. The women just kind of sat back and did nothing sometimes.All in all, I enjoyed the book. The drama was a little bit overwhelming but I had to find out how it ended. I wanted to know if Anne and Fredrick would end up together. I could see how things would all play out or at least how I hoped it would end up. Ms. Austen is an amazing author and I cannot wait to read more of her work."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This is the story of second chances. After eight years, Captain Wentworth and Anne Elliot find each other after a forced separation. The illustrations are beautiful, but not all of them were included in this particular edition, which is why this is four-star and not five."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"As with the other books from Jane Austen I find them to be charming and witty. Again, I found nothing wrong with the format of this book."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"In Jane Austen's time, young women were taught that it was practically their duty to \\"marry well\\" -- someone of at least equal social/financial standing.But if a woman turned down a suitor for being poor, she ran the risk of losing the man she loved.

The title for this review comes from the letter that was written out by the hero. I LOVED THE LETTER, the most sensual love letter that I have ever read.Not even one kiss in this book, but while reading it, it is like you would take a deep breath and hold it until the end. Beautiful choice of words keeps your mind of state mesmerized. I loved the way that author wrote about every feeling or thought the heroine had in a presence of a man that she loved for so many years. Also, how she was in apprehension of an every meeting with him and weighting every word that he has said. The climax in the book was when he handed her the letter to pour his feelings buried inside for her. What a beautiful letter! The writer also has a great way to describe human nature. The writer grabs you with rich words.But the book is full of making acquaintances which was a bit too much for me in this book.

The story took place in the 19th century in Kellynch hall. Anne and Captain Wentworth was in love. Anne's father didn't wanted Anne to married to Captain Wentworth because of the social class. Eight years later, Captain Wentworth returned having made his name and fortune with the British Navy, and its now his turn to reject her. Anne still love Captain Wentworth but her father persuaded her not to married the man of not having good money. The three main characters of Persuasion is Anne Elliot, Captain Wentworth, and Sir Walter Elliot. The theme was Social mobility. Sir Walter objects to letting the house to an admiral because the navy offends his two most valued traits.Persuasion is for teenagers to adults type of audience. The romance go toward older people. This is a type of book for people who are mature. People who are older would love this book more than a younger person because the book is a classical book. Persuasion was a very appealing book. The was very awkward. They should change the ending because it sound crazy. They should made it sound like they got married instead of them engaged. It was a good book because it show how someone was persuaded to not married someone. Anne was in the world because the person she love , she couldn't get married to him. The story shows how much trails they had to go through to get together. Persuasion is considered to be a classic because it show how people got married in the 19th Century. The 19th Century romance was beautiful. It is also considered a classic because they married their cousins a lot in this story, they didn't mind if they married their cousin. Now these days, that crazy to married your cousin. I really recommend this book to people who like to read literature. So I believed that adults should read this more because they would be interested in it. I also recommend for people who love to read books. I rate this book \\"Persuasion\\" a three star becuause the ending was not good, they should change the ending. Everything else was about the book was good."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Jane Austen's last novel, published posthumously, receives this year's Clunky Boring Classic Award.

Read 'Pride and Prejudice' instead."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"this applies to all of austen's books. by the time you get to 'persuasion' you get pretty tired of it. same story lines, same themes, same devices. i read this book at the same time as dickens' 'dombey and son'. and after 200 pages of 'dombey', i never picked up 'persuasion' again. i got about half way through before i dumped dainty jane. there's just no comparison when you put them side by side. austen is really not so much a true novelist so much as she is some kind of prose playwright. her novels are really plays embellished by narrative descriptions of what people think and feel. they lack the full recreation of a physical world outside the minds of her characters. one is never even told something as basic as what her characters look like, much less how they dress, act or move. and one gets only the sketchiest descriptions of places and things, much as you'd find in a play. compare this to the rich and vivid imagery of dickens or flaubert or proust and it becomes obvious how far short of novels austen's books really fall. read any play and the resemblances to austen's books become all too apparent.still, austen is a good writer. she just isn't in the same class as the aforementioned great writers."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"after reading P&amp;P and Northanger, i just couldn't slog my way through another of her books. but this one looked more interesting than any of her other works, so i thought, &quot;why not, i'll give it a try.&quot; big mistake. by far her worst (that i've read, but i still have emma and s&amp;s to go, and no plans on ever reading mansfield park). but i think it is safe to say i am not a fan of austen's. she's dull, and she turned an interesting idea into a dull book. i only gave her two stars instead of one because the premise behind the book was such a good one."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This was a typical Jane Austen love story and a well-written piece. I actually found it quite quick. My only gripe is that this story (compared to \\"Mansfield Park\\" or \\"Pride and Prejudice\\") is quite incomplete in descriptions about the mannerisms between some characters *at the time of their occurance* that, though explained fully in the last couple of chapters, a reader would not find them as easily recognizable as one would hope. I was slightly shocked to see the motives behind two of the characters. It was a good read but it did feel a little incomplete."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Austen's novels are characterized by their limited plot and their freedom from deep philosophical musings, complicated image patterns and symbolism. As a result the reader is presented with a skilfully crafted novel in which setting, character delineation, acute observation of social interaction, accuracy and realism are all very important. The early novels were characterized by the use of irony, humour and satire. These are much less evident in Persuasion, as Austen seemed more concerned with the sympathetic and sensitive expoloration of her heroine's character and situation. Persuasion is a simply structured novel, for its plot is concerned only with bringing Anne Elliot and Captain Wentworth together. A major theme of the novel is Austen's examination of pride and vanity - pride in one's social position and vanity of one's personal appearance. The idea of persuadability is tied up with another major concern of the novel - the right quality of mind. As the novel develops, Austen strives to achieve a right balance between contrasting opposites. I started to read the book reluctantly (as it was for school); but when I was familiar with the characters and the language, it was very enjoyable. If you have ever been in love, or thought yourself to be, or even had a crush on someone; you will identify with Anne Elliot's behaviour when she is around Captain Wentworth. It was amazing how real the characters came to be, and the events which occured can be compared of those today. I recommend the book to anyone with an interest in love stories. It was the first Austen book I have read, and it will not be the last."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"To be absolutely truthful, Anne Elliot may be too \\"nice\\" for you to find her as enjoyable as Emma Woodhouse or Elizabeth Bennett. Don't let that put you off however, this production was a joy! Persuasion is thoughtful and mature, and beautifully brought to life by Juliette Stevenson's reading. Her delightfully modulated voice, switches with ease between characters: she really shines as Anne's annoying sister Mary, you find yourself wishing for more of her! Male characters are believable as men - really, each character is rendered with admirable distinctness and individuality. Naxos' technical recording is of excellent quality as usual, seamless between takes. Jane Austen's keen insight into people's motives and character is piercing as always and her wit at society's expense is as apt today as 200 years ago. I have thoroughly enjoyed this recording and highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Jane Austen's *Persuasion* was her last book before she suddenly, unfairly died, and it is profoundly different than her earlier works.In this book, Anne Elliot, the protagonist, is past the bloom of her youth, all of 27 years old. She gave up the love of her live, Captain Wentworth, when she was twenty because she was persuaded that he was not socially a proper match for her. Considering the vast importance of a proper match, or a good match, in Jane's earlier works (such as *Pride & Prejudice* in which Lizzy Bennet, who is essentially penniless and perhaps soon to lose her home, makes the ultimate \\"good match\\" in which she marries Pemberly, er, Mr. Darcy) it is interesting in this book how Jane examines the results of declining a socially and economically imprudent match. Anne Elliot's life is blighted when she gives up love merely because Wentworth is not enough for her. She becomes an old maid. This book is an admonition to the flighty young girls who sought \\"good matches\\" at the expense of love. It's a grown-up's book.*Persuasion* also funny as all heck. That first sentence, \\"SIR WALTER ELLIOT, of Kellynch Hall, in Somersetshire, was a man who, for his own amusement, never took up any book but the Baronetage; there he found occupation for an idle hour, and consolation in a distressed one; there his faculties were roused into admiration and respect, by contemplating the limited remnant of the earliest patents; there any unwelcome sensations, arising from domestic affairs, changed naturally into pity and contempt,\\" is a damning statement about people who don't read good literature, but only read books of mere facts, like the Peerage. Anne's older sister is just as daft and great for an eye-rolling laugh.TK KenyonAuthor ofRabid: A NovelandCallous: A Novel"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I have read all of Austen's novels except Northanger Abbey, and I found this one to be in the top three, along with EMMA and PRIDE AND PREJUDICE (my personal favorite). This book is very unique compared to her other masterpieces.Let's begin with a summary. Anne Elliot fears life as an \\"old maid\\" as she reaches the age where most women during the pre-Victorian era are supposed to be married. She regrets not marrying the one man she truly loved, Captain Wentworth. At the time, he was not considered suitable. Now almost seven years later, Wentworth returns, having made his fortune and is now considered a fair prospect. Now every girl is fawning over the strong, sea worn Captain Wentworth. Emotions Anne thought she could never feel again overpower her. Despite her attempts to control her emotions, she realizes that there is no man she could even consider marrying over him. The question now is does he feel the same way? This is a page turning novel that you just keep reading wondering if Anne and Wentworth will ever get it together.I found this novel so different in a good way for many reasons. First, there really isn't any fair leading lady or dashing young man. Anne Elliot, I believe, is Austen's most realistic character. Don't get me wrong EMMA and PRIDE AND PREJUDICE fans, I love Emma and Elizabeth and admire them for all their characteristics. However, I find myself wishing I was them rather than relating to them. I loved how Anne was quiet, but beautiful and witty at the same time. She also is very proper and doesn't really know how to compose herself in front of the man she loves. She is too influenced by what other people think, like many of us. I personally loved reading about a character who I myself can relate to in many ways. Yes, Anne is flawed but she's real.Second is the eternal question that haunts us all when crossed in love....does he feel the same way? Austen was an early psychologist of her time and really understands human behavior. I loved how Anne (and Wentworth as we find out in the end) really is fearful of getting hurt and really doesn't know what to do with herself. It's just so real and life like and I guess she gets lucky because of the ticking clock with Wentworth, but I believe it provided hope for those during Austen's time and now who are faced with the same problem. I loved how Austen wrote about this which I think really kept me reading the book.Well, I could spend all day talking about this book, but basically I'm saying read it, it's not quite as long and detailed as Austen's other works but strong at the same time. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Many would have Austen's &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; determine her status as one of the greatest of all novelists; however, this critic will always stand by the quiet and profound maturity that defines this lovely masterpiece &quot;Persuasion.&quot; Here the characters are all terribly human and flawed and the narrative so touching without ever resorting to maudlin prose. There is an underlying sadness in this book which tells the reader that at some point in her life, Jane Austen loved deeply. This book is a celebration of that love; indeed, she would not have felt comfortable mourning it before her family or her readers. Therefore, instead of indulging in self-pity, Austen gratifies the soul by telling the story of one woman who refuses to sacrife her integrity and &quot;secures&quot; the man she loves in her way and in her time. This is more than a great read; it is truly a magnificent work."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"8 years has passed since the break up of Anne Elliot and Frederick Wentworth. Because of Frederick's lack of fortune and connections at the time, Anne was persuaded to reject his proposal. Now, he's back into town, with a fortune amassed at sea and still single. The feelings that were never quenched on Anne's side, are burning stronger than ever. And it has been turned upside down with (now) Captain Wentworth's renewed presence. Sure, she still wants him. But she's not sure if he does! Especially with the Musgrove sisters now in the picture. Not that she's lacking for suitors, but they just pale in comparison with Capt. W!What a classic. Jane Austen, 200 years ago had the romance and chemistry right. Even for an ordinary girl like Anne who had let love pass by her once! Oh the suspense. You didn't know which Musgrove sisters Captain W was going to choose... let alone be sure if he even harbored any feelings for Anne! Or was Anne going to fall for the smooth and suave Mr. Elliot, her cousin? But all the waiting was worth it. Oh, the letter that he writes to Anne at the end is so worth it! I think the romance between Anne and Capt. Wentworth rivals any of the contemporary romance stories."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Jane Austenites such as myself dive in most willingly and blissfully into her stories. We bask in the sway of waves bearing her lively pitch, her precise and playful interaction with the language - and we bemusedly acknowledge that such magic has never even yet come close to being rejuvenated by anyone, despite so many attempts made within the some 200 years since her novels were written.PERSUASION quaintly commences on a quiet country estate in Regency England, and on a fanciful whim journeys on through to the seaside resort of Lyme, thence onward through the social promenade of Bath. The story follows Anne Elliot, daughter of snobby baronet, Sir Walter Elliot. Anne is the middle daughter, in between older sister Elizabeth, the apple of her father's eye, and married younger sister, Mary Musgrove. Jane Austen makes very good use of her exquisite wit in the depictions of shallow, haughty Elizabeth and selfish, frivolous Mary.Anne, however, is cut from a different cloth. Having fallen in love at age 19 or 20 with a handsome young man of no fortune, Anne denies her passion for what she sees as her duty and breaks her engagement with Frederick Wentworth - after, of course, some persuasion from Lady Russell, a friend of her late mother. Then, some eight years later, after Anne has apparently lost her youthful bloom, Captain Wentworth returns - still very handsome, and now quite rich after having made his fortune in the Navy during the Napoleonic Wars.As Captain Wentworth brandishes warm, flirtatious attention upon the young, lively Musgrove sisters, Louisa and Henrietta, sisters of Mary's husband Charles, Anne silently harbours the certainty that her deep affection and love for Wentworth had never faded despite all those years apart from him, and that his aloofness bears witness that his feelings for her have forever disappeared. She all the while keeps those pangs of loss and regret subdued, and stays steadfast in her knowledge of what is right and what is good in the complex modes of interaction with others. After her father's frivolity with money has necessitated moving his family to Bath and leasing out his estate, Kellynch hall, Anne must search for her place in the world.Although PERSUASION may not be the wittiest, nor the liveliest, nor the brightest or most luminous of the six novels written by Jane Austen, one cannot deny that it is perhaps the most moving. Our heroine's allure takes the reader gently into that era of innocent romance, that beautiful country where sometimes what once had been lost might inexplicitly, almost magically, be found...if sought."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"&quot;Persuasion&quot; was Jane Austen's last novel, and the more sober and pensive quality of the book, as compared to some of her earlier works, most notably &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, reflects her maturity both in age and as a writer; no one in their early 20's could have written this book. The heroine of &quot;Persuasion&quot; is Anne Elliot, seven years after she rejected, at her family's insistence, the young man she had fallen in love with at 19, when he was just starting a naval career and was too poor, in the eyes of her pretentious relatives, to be considered acceptable marriage material. Now he has returned, financially secure and promoted to captain, and she finds herself still in love with him. Without giving away the rest of the plot, the book gives a powerful argument for following one's heart instead of the prejudices and snobbisms of society. Anne does not have the same appeal to many modern readers as Elizabeth Bennet; she is more shy, retiring and reflective. But as the book progresses and she finds the strength to act on her feelings, she grows in personality and character. This final work by one of the greatest writers (and my personal favorite) in the English language is a lasting testimony to her incredible talents as a novelist."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This is the last novel that Jane Austen finished before she died. Had she lived longer, it might have been a longer book. But It is a piece of jewel that I enjoyed very much.Our heroine Anne,when she was nineteen years old was persuaded to give up the only man she ever loved because he had no money and could only offer her an uncertain future as a sailor's wife. Captain Wentworth comes back eight yers later, successful and rich looking for a wife. Jane Austen weaves her magin threads and the story unfolds with unforgettable characters and final union of two people who had loved each other all these years inspite of social prejudice and class difference.Of all leading men in her books, Captain Wentworth is the most dashing man with his good looks, intelligence and fearlessness of a strong man who knows his own value inspite of social injustice.This is the kind of book to read over and over again. and every time you read, Jane Austen will take you to the charming regency time in Bath."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"\\"Persuasion\\" is a novel written by Jane Austen during the Regency Period in England. It was a time where single women were not allowed to be left unchaperoned with a gentleman. A time where people wouldn't dare say impolite things to others, and marriage was a way to improve your wealth, circumstance, and station.This is one of the 6 completed novels written by Jane Austen, while this one isn't as popular and famous as \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" that does not mean it is without merit or any less worthy of praise. If you found yourself liking the movie or book \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" you should give this one a try.Our herione \\"Anne Elliot\\" is the middle daughter out of three. Her mother died when she was young, her father is a silly, vain, and selfish man who spent so much money they are now facing financial troubles. They live in a lovely home called \\"Kellylynch Hall\\" which they must leave to find cheaper lodgings. Now they rent their home out to this couple (Admiral and Mrs. Croft) and take up residence in Bath.Anne is an admirable heroine. One with much sense, honesty, and simplicity. Her two other siblings are not so worthy, her oldest sister takes after their father, selfish, vain, alway self-promoting. Her younger sister is already married with children and very needy. She is also very selfish and a little bit of a hypochondriat.Now when Anne's family leaves for Bath she does not go with them, instead she stays close to their family home while staying with her younger sister. Here Anne is able to live without the shadow of her family, make acquaintances, and be of much usefullness towards everyone. She soon meets up with Captain Wentworth, who proposed to her eight and half years ago and was rejected. Anne did not reject him because she did not love him, she was persuaded by her family. What will they do now seeing each other again after eight and a half years?Overall the story was a very intersting read, you grew very interested in all the characters and their personalities as you always do when you read Jane Austen. It is one of her shorter books around 250 pages. The beginning is the only hard part to read, you might lose interest there but keeping reading it gets better real soon."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Persuasion is Jane Austen's most sophisticated story and writing. She lovingly and incisively demonstrates the problems of being a well-bred sensitive person in a society that's more intrigued by social standing, money, and polite conversation than by good character.Persuasion is Anne Elliot's story. The title's initial allusion is to Anne's brush with matrimony when a promising, but not rich, naval officer, Captain Wentworth, proposed and she fell in love with him at 19. But Anne's deceased mother's friend, Lady Russell, persuaded Anne not to make the match. Up until the time of the story, Anne hasn't had another suitor and she's now well past the usual age of marriage at 29 and \\"her bloom had vanish early.\\" Her father's spendthrift ways mean that Anne could bring little money to a marriage so she's expecting not to marry.While in her social class that lack of a husband is a drawback, in reality her family is a greater problem. Her father, Sir Walter Elliot, is a baronet who spends too much money, is obsessed by social rank, loves to be around the \\"beautiful people\\" and admire himself in a mirror, and keeps company with an unsuitable, scheming widow, Mrs. Clay, who is looking for a husband and has latched onto Elizabeth as friend. Anne's older sister, Elizabeth, is also unmarried and is as equally obsessed with social status as their father. Both Sir Walter and Elizabeth fail to value Anne and looked to her to suit their conveniences. The other daughter, Mary, is married but the connection doesn't thrill either Sir Walter or Elizabeth. Mary sees Anne as a virtual servant who should wait on her every beck and call when Anne is her guest.Due to Sir Walter's over spending of his income, it is decided he will rent the family estate, Kellynch Hall, while he, Elizabeth, and Anne take up less expensive quarters and a reduced social life in Bath. This change sets lots of new events into motion, not the least of which is Anne being re-introduced to Captain Wentworth who now has a fortune and seems to be looking for a lively, young wife. Only their common commitment to being polite makes time in one another's company tolerable. What strong emotions burn under the surface? She's very embarrassed, but Captain Wentworth is hard to read.In the course of the book, you'll find out a lot about social climbing in Regency England, the finances of the social elites and those who were up-and-coming, how marriage agreements were struck, and how the naval officers differed from the gentry. You'll also be impressed, I'm sure, by the patina of politeness that served as a social lubricant among people who often didn't care a trifle for one another.In such a society, people mostly wore masks of being thoughtful, considerate people while in reality they were seldom thinking about very much and didn't care much for others. Anne Elliot is the exception in that her heart and mind are actually devoted to the service of others.One of the most interesting parts of the story is how it was possible (mostly by accident) to sort out the phonies from among those with glittering manners.Anne Elliot is one of the most memorable and admirable characters in English literature. Do read this book and find out about the other kinds of persuasion that took place during this year of her fictional life. You'll be delighted that you did."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"While more expensive versions may have slightly better readers this version was overall a great value."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"In my opinion, this is Jane Austen's greatest book. Anne Elliot is a beautifully written character, and Austen subtly conveys her strength of mind and depth of emotion with the best of her skills. Many critics have declared that Austen's greatest talent was creating characters that stay in character without getting stagnant, and I think this novel is the best showcase for that talent. Though often not as comical as some of her other works, this novel is a beautiful portrait of hopeless lovers, and the dialogue (always done well by Austen) is superb. What makes this novel stand-out in my mind, is that though it includes somewhat less of the social satire than her other books (though it is of course still present), it creates a very honest portrait of family relations and how filial duty can not always inspire love, even in the best-mannered of individuals.For those wondering what exactly makes Austen a truly classic author, and not just a fun feminine writer, I suggest a close reading of Persuasion."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Although Persuasion is generally overshadowed by Jane Austen's more well-known novel, Pride and Prejudice, this is a beautifully written, poignant love story about the strength and endurance of love. Anne receives a proposal she very much wants to accept but is discouraged by a friend of the family who is advising her in the place of Anne's deceased mother. Anne listens, breaks off the relationship, and then regrets her decision. She turns down at least one other proposal that we know of (Charles, who later marries her sister) because she still hasn't gotten over her love for Wentworth. Through a series of coincidences, Anne meets her beau again eight years later and the spark is still there although they both try to keep their feelings hidden. They finally acknowledge their love for each other and ignore the protests of friends and family who would keep them apart. There's a very interesting discussion between the characters in the book about who keeps love alive the longest in the absence of the one they love -- men or women. If you haven't tried this one yet, I think you'll find it very satisfying."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Persusion is the story of Anne Elliot, a girl trapped in a classic example of listening to bad advice.Anne falls for the charming Captain Wentworth, and after many sunny days spent toghether, the couple decides to marry.When Anne tells this to her dear and only friend, Lady Russell, she is informed that he is too poor and far below her status as a daughter of a baronet. After succumbing to Lady Russell's persuasion, a broken-hearted Anne ends the engagement. The miserable pair then goes their separate ways.Eight years later, the Elliots are struggling for money and decide to lease their house and move to Bath,leaving Anne with her sister Mary. Who should be their new tenant, but Cpt. Wentworth's brother. Anne and Wenworth are soon thrown together again. This begins a journey of reconciliation, leaving the reader with the constant question,\\"Will they forgive their past and rekindle their love?\\"I thought this was an excellent literary classic that truly captures the point and makes a great romance without being sappy or the characters being shallow. I would recommend this book for middle school on up, and primarily for girls. I can't picture many males sitting still for this one. The characters are perfectly molded, and some, like Sir Walter are humorous and very entertaining.I would give Persusion 5 stars and 2 thumbs for an excellent novel!"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"The subject of unlikely love is one we will never grow tired of, and as long as that is true, Jane Austen is an author we will always treasure. She always gives us such enthralling glimpses into live in nineteenth century England that we can little help but wish ourselves back to a time when love was courtly and appearances were everything. Somehow, she knew that love went beyond her society's rules. She knew that rank and name were not enough to silence love. In PERSUASION, she gives us all that she gave us in Pride and Prejudice. We shake our heads at the embarrassing families, yearn for the hero and heroine to admit their feelings to each other, and long for the man who causes trouble between the heroes to just go away. But, this time, not only do we have the suitor who keeps the man of our heroine's dreams at a distance, we have a malicious sister. We see Anne struggle with internal and external pressures while she deals with the seemingly outright malice of her sister, Elizabeth. Elizabeth is mean! She is not indifferent or aloof, but downright nasty and greedy. Her sister's happiness is something she would rather not see until her own is firmly in place, and she seems like the type to use sabatoge to succeed. I, for one, will never tire of reading of the ups and downs of a forbidden or unlikely love, and always feel a sense of exultation when the dashing man and striking young woman finally feel free enough to admit their feelings to one another, despite the dirty looks their pairing may draw."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Having read all of Jane Austen's books, I've been very impressed with her style. Reading Persuasion, I immediately noticed the difference between shy Anne Elliot and Jane Austen's other characters: Emma, Elinor and Marianne, Elizabeth Bennet, Fannie Price, and Catherine Morland. Anne is not the most beautiful, the cleverest, or the most-spirited. She is shy, quiet, thoughtful, somewhat plain, and honest. She reacts to emergency situations calmly and clearly, proving that she does have a backbone. I think the fact that she is older and more mature than Austen's other characters shows a maturity in Austen's writing. I highly recommend this book to those who love Jane Austen and can understand being shy and strong."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"is Austen's novel which begins with Anne Elliot thinking about a lost love instead of a future love.Beautifully written, it is a novel that makes readers wonder if there is going to be the \\"characters meet and finally get married\\" ending that is so typical in Austen novels. Anne Elliot is 27, unmarried, and living at home with her father and older unmarried sister who are concerned about appearing more wealthy than they actually are. When the family is convinced by Lady Russell to rent out their home and move to a more economical space, Anne ends up going to care for her younger sister Mary Musgrove.Anne's visit with her sister's family becomes uncomfortable once Captain Wentworth becomes a frequent visitor there. Wentworth is the love that Anne regretfully let slip away, having been influenced by her good friend Lady Russell that his social status was inferior to Anne's. Wentworth and Anne are both convinced that their relationship is over and their communication with one another is formal, yet limited.Anne is not sure what to make of Captain Wentworth's interest with Louisa and Henrietta (Charles Musgrove's sisters), and more than one gentleman takes a romantic interest in Anne. Both Anne and Wentworth distance themselves from each other in an attempt to forget that they ever loved each other.It is when Anne is away from Wentworth, and at home with her father and sister that she begins to realize how much she loves Wentworth. She wonders if she is too late, if the chance for love has really passed. Even though she loves Wentworth, Anne is still concerned about what her father and Lady Russell will think of him.Readers can only speculate as to the ending of the novel, which appears to be more uncertain than the endings in Austen's other novels. The art of persuasion, as well as social status, and the contrasting views of the elders and the youth, makes this novel one of Jane Austen's best."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"It's another great book of Jane Austan.
