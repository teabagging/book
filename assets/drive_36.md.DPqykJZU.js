It shows how to conduct an evaluation, from beginning to end, in a way that will be useful -- and actually used. Patton believes that evaluation epitomizes the challenges of producing and using information in the information age. His latest book includes new stories, new examples, new research findings, and more of Patton's evaluation humour. He adds to the original book's insights and analyses of the changes in evaluation during the past decade, including: the emergence of evaluation as a field of professional practice; articulation of standards for evaluation; a methodological synthesis of the qualitative versus quantitative debate; the tremendous growth of 'in-house' evaluations; and the cross-cultural development of evaluation as a profession. This edition also incorporates the considerable research done on utilization during the last ten years. Patton integrates diverse findings into a coherent framework which includes: articulation of utilization-focused evaluation premises; examination of the stakeholder assumption; and clarification of the meaning of utilization. --Publisher description.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=87QOAQAAMAAJ&dq=Utilization-Focused+Evaluation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stripped to the Bone (Black Lace)","description":"Motivated by a voracious appetite for passion, Annie is on a mission to keep changing her life.

Asking McClure who his friends were, Kennan was astounded when he listed the names that included Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Allen Ginsberg, Bruce Conner, Neal Cassady, and Ken Kesey. He had studied the works of these groundbreaking poets, writers, and artists, and recognized the significance of this opportunity. Twenty-one years old, Keenan spent over a year documenting the last days of the Beat Generation with a borrowed 35mm camera, photographing the Beats in their homes and with their families and friends. His portraits constitute a unique chronology and reportage of this era, and many of these photos have since become iconic images that represent a literary generation. Here, in this book of 20 postcards, is a timeless rendering of the spirit of the Beats. \\"This slim volume produced by City Lights Publishers offers the reader a taste of Keenan's astounding work in post-card-sized bites: Especially riveting are the shots of Bob Dylan, Michael McClure and Allen Ginsberg taken in the alley behind City Lights Bookstore in 1965, before Dylan's San Francisco show with Robbie Robertson and The Hawks. Also of note is the shot of Neal Cassady in front of the mirror shaving, and the wonderful photo of the late Allen Ginsberg sharing a private moment with Dennis Hopper. Keenan's work, always pristine and often over-looked, provides a personal glimpse into the magical cool and troubled heart of the 1960s.\\" --Jacob Aiello, Electric Review Larry Keenan was a recipient of the prized Phelan Award for his fine art photography. He was also an award-winning advertising and corporate photographer who specialized in combining the traditional medium of photography with contemporary digital techniques. His photographs are in museums and private collections throughout the world, and were exhibited in the Whitney Museum's Beat Culture and the New America and the Smithsonian Institute's REBELS: Artists and Poets of the '50s.

It is this story that Reginald Hale set out to trace, by visiting the places that tradition associates with Mungo's life.

He lived during a mostly innovative time for German art and saw the development of the German Expressionist movements as well as the arrival of the following avant-garde movements which were forming in the rest of Europe. Like a true artist of his time, Macke knew how to integrate into his painting the elements of the avant-garde which most interested him. His style was formed within the mode of French Impressionism and Post-impressionism and later went through a Fauve period. Macke's meeting with Robert Delaunay in Paris in 1912 was to be a sort of revelation for him with Delaunay's chromatic Cubism, which Apollinaire had called Orphism. August Macke's oeuvre can be considered as Expressionism and also as part of Fauvism.

In traveling the circuit of the eighty-eight Buddhist temples that make up the route, pilgrims make their journey together with Kobo Daishi (774-835), the holy miracle-working figure who is at the heart of the pilgrimage. Once seen as a marginal practice, recent media portrayal of the pilgrimage as a symbol of Japanese cultural heritage has greatly increased the number of participants, both Japanese and foreign. In this absorbing look at the nature of the pilgrimage, Ian Reader examines contemporary practices and beliefs in the context of historical development, taking into account theoretical considerations of pilgrimage as a mode of activity and revealing how pilgrimages such as Shikoku may change in nature over the centuries. This rich ethnographic work covers a wide range of pilgrimage activity and behavior, drawing on accounts of pilgrims traveling by traditional means on foot as well as those taking advantage of the new package bus tours, and exploring the pilgrimage's role in the everyday lives of participants and the people of Shikoku alike. that have shaped it in the past and in the present, including history and legend; the island's landscape and residents; the narratives and actions of the pilgrims and the priests who run the temples; regional authorities; and commercial tour operators and bus companies.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IQusC0jcVPwC&dq=Making+Pilgrimages:+Meaning+and+Practice+in+Shikoku&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Winning Bodybuilding","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bDMDDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Grimm's fairy stories","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FWvBzgEACAAJ&dq=Grimm%27s+fairy+stories&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Spanish on the Job","description":"This handy, pocket-sized book uses phonetics to show you how to pronounce each word or phrase.

Bob Hoffman, the founder of York Barbell, propagated an ideology of success for Americans seeking physical improvement. Often called the \\"Father of World Weightlifting,\\" Hoffman was a pioneer in marketing barbells and health foods. He popularized weight training and inaugurated a golden age of American weightlifting. Muscletown USA--part biography, part business history, and part sports history--chronicles how Hoffman made York the mecca of manly culture for millions of followers worldwide. Hoffman created his so-called muscle empire out of an oil-burner business that he started in the early 1920s. Within a decade, his passion for sport exceeded his need to produce oil burners and by the outset of the Depression he began manufacturing barbells at the factory. He soon discovered a willing public of aspiring weightlifters like himself who would buy not only barbells but also health and fitness products. Hoffman soon recruited a remarkable group of athletes, whom he tagged his \\"York Gang.\\" He gave these men jobs in the factory, where they trained for national and international meets. Gradually, Hoffman emerged as one of the most prominent muscle peddlers in America, using his fame and fortune to promote competitive weightlifting, bodybuilding, and powerlifting. Muscletown USA reveals other innovations in which Hoffman played a major role, including weight training for athletes, health foods, bottled spring water, isometrics, and women's weightlifting. Even anabolic steroids, first used by weightlifters in the early 1960s, were a direct outgrowth of the fitness culture spawned by Hoffman. Meticulously researched and engagingly written, Fair's book will appeal to a wide range of readers, including anyone fascinated by American sports history and the iron game.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZabpnQEACAAJ&dq=Muscletown+USA:+Bob+Hoffman+and+the+Manly+Culture+of+York+Barbell&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Winners, Losers & Microsoft: Competition and Antitrust in High Technology (Independent Studies in Political Economy)","description":"From acclaimed political scientist Diana Mutz, a revealing look at why people's attitudes on trade differ from their own self-interest Winners and Losers challenges conventional wisdom about how American citizens form opinions on international trade. While dominant explanations in economics emphasize personal self-interest and whether individuals gain or lose financially as a result of trade this book takes a psychological approach, demonstrating how people view the complex world of international trade through the lens of interpersonal relations. Drawing on psychological theories of preference formation as well as original surveys and experiments, Diana Mutz finds that in contrast to the economic view of trade as cooperation for mutual benefit, many Americans view trade as a competition between the United States and other countries a contest of us versus them. These people favor trade as long as they see Americans as the \\"winners\\" in these interactions, viewing trade as a way to establish dominance over foreign competitors. For others, trade is a means of maintaining more peaceful relations between countries. Just as individuals may exchange gifts to cement relationships, international trade is a tie that binds nations together in trust and cooperation. Winners and Losers reveals how people's orientations toward in-groups and out-groups play a central role in influencing how they think about trade with foreign countries, and shows how a better understanding of the psychological underpinnings of public opinion can lead to lasting economic and societal benefits.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0XogEAAAQBAJ&dq=Winners,+Losers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Drummer Boy: Marching to the Civil War","description":"A thirteen-year old boy lies about his age to join the Union forces during America's bloodiest war.

In 1862, recently widowed and with two small children to support, British schoolteacher Anna Leonowens agrees to serve as governess to the children of King Mongkut of Siam (present-day Thailand), unaware that her years in the royal palace will change not only her own life, but also the future of a nation. Her relationship with King Mongkut, famously portrayed by Yul Brynner in the classic film The King and I, is complicated from the start, pitting two headstrong personalities against each other: While the king favors tradition, Anna embraces change. As governess, Anna often finds herself at cross-purposes, marveling at the foreign customs, fascinating people, and striking landscape of the kingdom and its harems, while simultaneously trying to influence her pupils especially young Prince Chulalongkorn with her Western ideals and values. Years later, as king, this very influence leads Chulalongkorn to abolish slavery in Siam and introduce democratic reform based on the ideas of freedom and human dignity he first learned from his beloved tutor. This captivating novel brilliantly combines in-depth research author Margaret Landon drew from Siamese court records and Anna s own writings with richly imagined details to create a lush portrait of 1860s Siam. As a Rodgers & Hammerstein Broadway musical and an Academy Awardwinning film, the story of Anna and the King of Siam has enchanted millions over the years. It is a gripping tale of cultural differences and shared humanity that invites readers into a vivid and sensory world populated by unforgettable characters.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VgVeDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Meant to Be (Diary of a Teenage Girl: Kim, Book 2)","description":"This Is Now It s Kim s senior year and, while everyone s looking forward to graduation, she s got so much going on she can barely make it through the day.

The result is a lavish literary spectacle. Ultimately, Rux's work belongs to his own genre, a postmodern Marquis de Sade, a writer arguing with mortality. As described by one critic, Rux is most impressive...a gifted poet who offers up vibrant imagery like a street corner preacher in the midst of a nervous breakdown. -- The New York Times, 1999.

An extensive discussion of performance history traces the play's progress on stage from abridgement and adaptation to full historical epic. A survey of criticism discusses the wide range of responses provoked by the play's handling of its historical theme, and concludes by focusing on the element of burlesque in the attempted social revolution portrayed. A facsimile of the First Quarto printed by Thomas Creed in 1594 appears as an appendix. Also included are notes about textual variants in the early quartos, a selection of lines that are thought to refer to other plays, a doubling chart, a list of the play's sources, and a genealogy chart. The Arden Shakespeare has developed a reputation as the pre-eminent critical edition of Shakespeare for its exceptional scholarship, reflected in the thoroughness of each volume. An introduction comprehensively contextualizes the play, chronicling the history and culture that surrounded and influenced Shakespeare at the time of its writing and performance, and closely surveying critical approaches to the work. Detailed appendices address problems like dating and casting, and analyze the differing Quarto and Folio sources. A full commentary by one or more of the play s foremost contemporary scholars illuminates the text, glossing unfamiliar terms and drawing from an abundance of research and expertise to explain allusions and significant background information.

In late December 1944, as the Battle of the Bulge neared its climax, a German loudspeaker challenge was blared across GI lines in the Ardennes: \\"How would you like to die for Christmas?\\" In the inhospitable forest straddling Belgium, France, and Luxembourg, only the dense, snow-laden evergreens recalled the season. Most troops hardly knew the calendar day they were trying to live through, or that it was Hitler's last, desperate effort to alter the war's outcome. Yet the final Christmas season of World War II matched desperation with inspiration. When he was offered an ultimatum to surrender the besieged Belgian town of Bastogne, Brigadier General Anthony McAuliffe defied the Germans with the memorable one-word response, \\"Nuts!\\" And as General Patton prayed for clear skies to allow vital airborne reinforcements to reach his trapped men, he stood in a medieval chapel in Luxembourg and spoke to God as if to a commanding general: \\"Sir, whose side are you on?\\" His prayer was answered. The skies cleared, the tide of battle turned, and Allied victory in World War II was assured. Christmas 1944 proved to be one of the most fateful days in world history. Many men did extraordinary things, and extraordinary things happened to ordinary men. \\"A clear cold Christmas,\\" Patton told his diary, \\"lovely weather for killing Germans, which seems a bit queer, seeing whose birthday it is.\\" Peace on earth and good will toward men would have to wait. 11 Days in December is unforgettable.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PWzwzSfNepcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Thousand-Headed Man","description":"With a mysterious black Chinaman, Doc Savage and his amazing crew journey to the jungles of Indo-China in a desperate gamble to destroy the infamous Thousand-headed Man.

An exploration of memory, Going Down for Air artfully combines two very different yet connected texts. A Memoir is richly evocative not only of times past, but also of a very English, imperial, queerly masculine subjectivity, caught on the cusp of the extinction of the world in and of which it made sense. Derek Sayer's allusive writing succeeds as few have done before in capturing the leaps and bounds of memory itself. Rich in its detail, unstinting in its honesty, this beautifully written memoir is a considerable literary achievement. The memoir is complemented by Sayer's provocative theoretical essay on memory and social identity. Drawing on linguistic and psychoanalytic theory, photographic images, and literary texts, In Search of a Subject argues that it is memory above all that maintains the imagined identities upon which society rests. Going Down for Air is a bold and strikingly successful literary and sociological experiment, which makes a major contribution to understanding how our memories work - and gives them social meaning far beyond","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ByXvCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Black College Football, 1892-1992: One Hundred Years of History, Education, & Pride","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=v3RYAAAAYAAJ&dq=Black+College+Football,+1892-1992:+One+Hundred+Years+of+History,+Education,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Case Study Research: Principles and Practices","description":"Case Study Research: Principles and Practices aims to provide a general understanding of the case study method as well as specific tools for its successful implementation.

It allows for a distinct appraisal of the systemic and societal constructs that create and perpetuate the African American predicament in urban America.

He rushes excitedly toward it, believing it contains a puppy or kitten. Instead, he finds an abandoned baby. Suddenly, a dark car explodes from behind the trees and careens onto the road. A second later itas gone, leaving behind a trail of dust as the only evidence it had been there at all. And so begins the chain of events that lead to murdera]and the downfall of the McAllister family.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AFrlfr9esycC&dq=The+Boy+on+the+Side+of+the+Road&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Food!

In 1995, Jean-Dominique Bauby was the editor-in-chief of French Elle, the father of two young childen, a 44-year-old man known and loved for his wit, his style, and his impassioned approach to life. By the end of the year he was also the victim of a rare kind of stroke to the brainstem. After 20 days in a coma, Bauby awoke into a body which had all but stopped working: only his left eye functioned, allowing him to see and, by blinking it, to make clear that his mind was unimpaired. Almost miraculously, he was soon able to express himself in the richest detail: dictating a word at a time, blinking to select each letter as the alphabet was recited to him slowly, over and over again. In the same way, he was able eventually to compose this extraordinary book. By turns wistful, mischievous, angry, and witty, Bauby bears witness to his determination to live as fully in his mind as he had been able to do in his body. He explains the joy, and deep sadness, of seeing his children and of hearing his aged father's voice on the phone. In magical sequences, he imagines traveling to other places and times and of lying next to the woman he loves. Fed only intravenously, he imagines preparing and tasting the full flavor of delectable dishes. Again and again he returns to an \\"inexhaustible reservoir of sensations,\\" keeping in touch with himself and the life around him. Jean-Dominique Bauby died two days after the French publication of The Diving Bell and the Butterfly. This book is a lasting testament to his life.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iCzQ4z02cFYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Responses to 101 Questions on Hinduism","description":"A short, user-friendly introduction to major historical, cultural, spiritual and theological points of interest in the complex of faith traditions known collectively as Hinduism.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=alc0d3Ys-dIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Reflections from the North Country","description":"Originally published: 1st ed.

Law in a Lawless Land offers a rare and penetrating insight into the nature of Colombia's present peril. In a nuanced account of the human consequences of a disintegrating state, anthropologist Michael Taussig chronicles two weeks in a small town in Colombia's Cauca Valley taken over by paramilitaries that brazenly assassinate adolescent gang members. Armed with automatic weapons and computer-generated lists of names and photographs, the paramilitaries have the tacit support of the police and even many of the desperate townspeople, who are seeking any solution to the crushing uncertainty of violence in their lives. Concentrating on everyday experience, Taussig forces readers to confront a kind of terror to which they have become numb and complacent. \\"If you want to know what it is like to live in a country where the state has disintegrated, this moving book by an anthropologist well known for his writings on murderous Colombia will tell you.\\" Eric Hobsbawm","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8uC8iBkqBFYC&dq=Law+in+a+Lawless+Land:+Diary+of+a+Limpieza&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Lucky Number","description":"People say not to believe the things you read in magazines, but you know what?

It addresses such questions as: How do consumers develop 'meaning' regarding green products? How are such processes subconsciously structured by certain activities of the mind? How intelligent and successful are consumers in assessing the environmentally friendly attributes of products in daily life? Adopting an interdisciplinary approach, drawing on insights from psychology and anthropology as well as the author's own intensive field research, the book s interdisciplinary framework allows the author to develop an understanding of the entire cognitive process.

Edmund, a young apprentice, is awaiting punishment as a counterfeiter when a knight intervenes on his behalf--and compels Edmund to join Richard Lionheart's forces in the Holy Land. There, amidst the savagery of the twelfth-century Crusades, Edmund learns both courage and compassion, and discovers that cruelty is sometimes considered the will of Heaven.

Forty-three comprehensive and diverse chapters delve into significant themes and methods of folklore and folklife study; established expressions and activities; spheres and locations of folkloric action; and shared cultures and common identities. Beyond the longstanding arenas of academic focus developed throughout the 350-year legacy of folklore and folklife study, contributors at the forefront of the field also explore exciting new areas of attention that have emerged in the twenty-first century such as the Internet, bodylore, folklore of organizations and networks, sexual orientation, neurodiverse identities, and disability groups. Encompassing a wide range of cultural traditions in the United States, from bits of slang in private conversations to massive public demonstrations, ancient beliefs to contemporary viral memes, and a simple handshake greeting to group festivals, these chapters consider the meanings in oral, social, and material genres of dance, ritual, drama, play, speech, song, and story while drawing attention to tradition-centered communities such as the Amish and Hasidim, occupational groups and their workaday worlds, and children and other age groups. Weaving together such varied and manifest traditions, this handbook pays significant attention to the cultural diversity and changing national boundaries that have always been distinctive in the American experience, reflecting on the relative youth of the nation; global connections of customs brought by immigrants; mobility of residents and their relation to an indigenous, urbanized, and racialized population; and a varied landscape and settlement pattern. Edited by leading folklore scholar Simon J. Bronner, this handbook celebrates the extraordinary richness of the American social and cultural fabric, offering a valuable resource not only for scholars and students of American studies, but also for the global study of tradition, folk arts, and cultural practice.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JbSmDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Exploding the Gene Myth: How Genetic Information Is Produced and Manipulated by Scientists, Physicians, Employers, Insurance Companies, Educators , and Law Enforders","description":"How Genetic Information Is Produced and Manipulated by Scientists, Physicians, Employers, Insurance Companies, Educators, and Law Enforcers","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Y4wUZdOmMo0C&dq=Exploding+the+Gene+Myth:+How+Genetic+Information+Is+Produced+and+Manipulated+by+Scientists,+Physicians,+Employers,+Insurance+Companies,+Educators+,+and+Law+Enforders&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Real Face of Atheism, The","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AStuJQAACAAJ&dq=Real+Face+of+Atheism,+The&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Shilling for Candles","description":"Was there anyone who didn t want lovely screen actress Christine Clay dead?

For each of these volumes, Habermas wrote an introduction that crystallized, in a remarkably clear and succinct way, his thinking on the key philosophical issues that have preoccupied him throughout his long career. This new book by Polity brings together these five introductions and publishes them in translation for the first time. The resulting volume provides a unique and comprehensive overview of Habermas s philosophy in his own words. In the five chapters that make up this volume, Habermas discusses the concept of communicative action and the grounding of the social sciences in the theory of language; the relationship between rationality and the theory of language; discourse ethics; political theory and problems of democracy and legitimacy; and the critique of reason and the challenge posed by religion in a secular age. The volume includes a substantial introduction by Jean-Marc Durand-Gasselin, which offers a synoptic view of the development of Habermas s thought as a whole followed by concise accounts of his contributions in each of the areas mentioned. Together they provide the reader with the necessary background to understand Habermas s distinctive and original contribution to philosophy. Philosophical Introductions will be an indispensable text for students and scholars in philosophy and in the humanities and social sciences generally, as well as anyone interested in the most important developments in philosophy and critical theory today.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OnxoDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"New to North America: Writing by U.S. Immigrants, Their Children, and Grandchildren","description":"\\"Abby Bogomolny's collection of moving narratives -- firsthand testimonials by people who have been excluded from voicing their own experiences -- document in fiction, poetry, memoir and essay the crossing of cultural and linguistic borders and the precarious nature of negotiating life in the US ....

The modern world can be a complicated, frenzied, and noisy place, filled with too many options, products, ideas and opinions. That explains why what many of us long for is simplicity: a life that can be more pared down, peaceful, and focused on the essentials. But finding simplicity is not always easy; it isn't just a case of emptying out our closets or trimming back commitments in our diaries. True simplicity requires that we understand the roots of our distractions - and develop a canny respect for the stubborn reasons why things can grow complex and overwhelming. This book is a guide to the simpler lives we crave and deserve. It considers how we might achieve simplicity across a range of areas. Along the way, we learn about Zen Buddhism, modernist architecture, monasteries, psychoanalysis, and why we probably don't need more than three good friends or a few treasured belongings. It isn't enough that our lives should look simple; they need to be simple from the inside. This book takes a psychological approach, guiding us towards less contorted hearts and minds. We have for too long been drowning in excess and clutter from a confusion about our aspirations; A Simpler Life helps us tune out the static and focus on what properly matters to us.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZJCDzgEACAAJ&dq=A+Simple+Life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Linda Goodman's Sun Signs","description":"The New York Timesbestselling author s classic guide to astrology:  What makes Sun Signs different is that much of the writing is done with humor  (The Boston Globe).

Yet the portraits he painted more than a century ago captivate us today, and he is now widely acclaimed as the finest portrait painter our nation has ever produced. This book recounts the artist's life in fascinating detail, drawing on a treasure trove of Eakins family correspondence and papers that have only recently been discovered. Never before has Thomas Eakins's story been told with such drama, clarity, and accuracy. Sidney Kirkpatrick sets the painter's life and art in the wider context of the changing world he devoted himself to portraying, and he also addresses the artist's private life-the contradictory impulses, obsessions, and possible psychological illness that fired his work. Kirkpatrick underscores Eakins's unflinching integrity as an artist and discloses how his profound appreciation of the beauty of the human form was both the source of his greatness and ultimately of his undoing. Nevertheless, the author observes, Eakins has had his \\"revenge,\\" inspiring a new generation of realist painters and gaining the recognition that eluded him in life.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0ZM7O5neeZgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beyond The Razor Wire: (A collection of poem from inmates)","description":"The long strands of razor wire conceal from society what it is like on the inside.

Now, the very foundations of fundamental existence have been discovered and a new system, unifying the complete range of physics, has been developed. However, humanity may not be able to advance much beyond where we are today, our progress having been cut short by the savagery, ignorance and irrationality maintained within populations. The Pathology of Cultural Delusion announces the new discovery of the foundations of existence, the architecture of the primary particles. This work of discovery, by an American engineer, shows the Cosmos to be a continuum of development and degeneration, with no \\"Creation\\", finally providing a rational and unified view of the universe. Origin discusses the human condition and our burgeoning problems in the light of this new knowledge, in the absence of cultural preconceptions of myth and magic. This work addresses the fundamental conceptual pathogens that account for virtually all social dysfunction. This new view displays our present social systems in their true light, as authoritarian, manipulating, deluding and generating adversity, maintaining populations at diminished levels of mentality, unable to effectively protest or press for fundamental changes.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZyebCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Uri Geller: Magician or Mystic?","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=o8L0GgAACAAJ&dq=Uri+Geller:+Magician+or+Mystic%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The year without a summer: A story of 1816","description":"Like Winchester's Krakatoa, The Year Without Summer reveals a year of dramatic global change long forgotten by history In the tradition of Krakatoa, The World Without Us, and Guns, Germs and Steel comes a sweeping history of the year that became known as 18-hundred-and-froze-to-death. 1816 was a remarkable year mostly for the fact that there was no summer. As a result of a volcanic eruption in Indonesia, weather patterns were disrupted worldwide for months, allowing for excessive rain, frost, and snowfall through much of the Northeastern U.S. and Europe in the summer of 1816. In the U.S., the extraordinary weather produced food shortages, religious revivals, and extensive migration from New England to the Midwest. In Europe, the cold and wet summer led to famine, food riots, the transformation of stable communities into wandering beggars, and one of the worst typhus epidemics in history. 1816 was the year Frankenstein was written. It was also the year Turner painted his fiery sunsets. All of these things are linked to global climate change something we are quite aware of now, but that was utterly mysterious to people in the nineteenth century, who concocted all sorts of reasons for such an ungenial season. Making use of a wealth of source material and employing a compelling narrative approach featuring peasants and royalty, politicians, writers, and scientists, The Year Without Summer by William K. Klingaman and Nicholas P. Klingaman examines not only the climate change engendered by this event, but also its effects on politics, the economy, the arts, and social structures.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=O8WoqlSDXH0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Measure of a Man (Arabesque)","description":"Peyton is delighted to hear that her gay brother has found a man, fellow firefighter Lincoln, who is actually straight, a situation that is further complicated when Lincoln finds himself falling for Peyton.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=J4IyhnGtGoMC&dq=Measure+of+a+Man+(Arabesque)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Examined Life: Thoughts and Advice for the Independently Minded","description":"Intellectual and hip version of \\"life's\\" little instruction book.

Of course, there is an inevitable tension in trying to work like this. For example, in Chapter 16 we talk about referential integrity. There are - sentially six different flavors of referential integrity but Access only s- ports four of them (they are the most important ones however, so you aren t missing out on too much). The problem is this. Should we tell you about the other two? If we do, as an Access user you have every right to be annoyed that we are telling you about a feature you can t use. On the other hand, the six different types that we describe are part of the re- tional world and this book is about that world  we are not trying to teach you how to use Access, we are simply using Access to illustrate the relational model. Ultimately we decided to risk your ire and to describe all of the features of the relational model as we see it, even if Access doesn t support all of them. One advantage of this approach is that if you need to use a different database engine you will almost certainly find the extra information useful. Incidentally, this is not meant to imply that Access is somehow lacking as a relational database engine. The reason we chose it for the first book is that it is such a good example of a relational database tool.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XVrqkyceJQUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wrath of the Gods-xibalba","description":"Gucumatz, divine Heart of Heaven, Father and Mother of all There Is, conceived the pristine forest as den for animals large and small, but He never pledged it as dwelling for men because, for humans, the jungle is hell itself. Nevertheless, instigated by greediness, men invade its enclosure and unfailingly stumble into a collective madness that binds them to its roots, preventing their escape before their time is due. Inhabiting the jungle men turn into beasts that despise kindness and relinquish all virtues as they submit to wickedness. How can integrity be preserved living in hell? For the jungle is Xibalb , the dwelling of demons. What do men look for in Xibalb  that, to live there, they are willing to lose not only their lives, but also their souls? Absolution, perhaps, because regardless of their origin, removing the mask of greediness they wear over their feelings, they reveal to be fugitives of their own consciences that arrive in Xibalb  to atone remorse, or expiate guilt, and for that they come from different and distant localities.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lDGQgtkb5EwC&dq=Wrath+of+the+Gods-xibalba&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Warranted Christian Belief","description":"This is the third volume in Alvin Plantinga's trilogy on the notion of warrant, which he defines as that which distinguishes knowledge from true belief. In this volume, Plantinga examines warrant's role in theistic belief, tackling the questions of whether it is rational, reasonable, justifiable, and warranted to accept Christian belief and whether there is something epistemically unacceptable in doing so. He contends that Christian beliefs are warranted to the extent that they are formed by properly functioning cognitive faculties, thus, insofar as they are warranted, Christian beliefs are knowledge if they are true.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=N-FLnwEACAAJ&dq=Warranted+Christian+Belief&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Forever for All: Moral Philosophy, Cryonics, and the Scientific Prospects for Immortality","description":"This book considers the problems of death and the hereafter and how these ages-old problems ought to be addressed in light of our continuing progress. A materialistic viewpoint of reality is assumed, denying the likelihood of supernatural or other superhuman assistance. Death, however, is not seen as inevitable or even irreversible; it is maintained that the problem can and should be addressed scientifically in all of its aspects. The book thus follows recent, immortalist thinking that places hopes in future advances in our understanding and technology. A functionalist, reductionist argument is developed for the possibility of resurrecting the dead through the eventual creation of replicas and related constructs. Meanwhile, it is urged, medical advances leading to the conquest of biological death should be pursued, along with cryonics: freezing the newly deceased for possible, eventual reanimation. A common ground thus is sought between two hitherto largely independent strands of scientific immortalism, the one based on hopes in a remote but hyperadvanced future, the other on the nearer-term prospects of presently advancing technology. The resulting philosophy, encompassing both past and future, is directed toward the long-term interests of each sentient being, and it thereby acquires a moral dimension. The immortalization of humans and other life-forms is seen as a great moral project and labor of love that will unite us in a common cause and provide a meaningful destiny. A rational and thorough exploration of human potential. Few have considered, much less visualized, the profound changes set to occur over the next few decades through exponential advances in science and philosophy. Mike Perry has, and he shares his vision with eloquence. --Jim Halperin, author of The Truth Machine and The First Immortal.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jCebCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Phantom Brave: The Official Strategy Guide","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=x1uNswEACAAJ&dq=Phantom+Brave:+The+Official+Strategy+Guide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Squid Eye","description":"The predecessor to this book was A Guide to the Laboratory Use of the Squid Loligo pealei published by the Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole, Massachusetts in 1974. The revision of this long out of date guide, with the approval of the Marine Biological Laboratory, is an attempt to introduce students and researchers to the cephalopods and particularly the squid as an object of biological research. Therefore, we have decided to expand on its original theme, which was to present important practical aspects for using the squid as experimental animals. There are twenty two chapters instead of the original eight. The material in the original eight chapters has been completely revised. Since more than one method can be used for accomplishing a given task, some duplication of methods was considered desirable in the various chapters. Thus, the methodology can be chosen which is best suited for each reader's requirements. Each subject also contains a mini-review which can serve as an introduction to the various topics. Thus, the volume is not just a laboratory manual, but can also be used as an introduction to squid biology. The book is intended for laboratory technicians, advanced undergraduate students, graduate students, researchers, and all others who want to learn the purpose, methods, and techniques of using squid as experimental animals. This is the reason why the name has been changed to its present title.

Dangerous Friend offers an in-depth exploration of this mysterious and complex bond, a relationship of paramount importance in Tibetan Buddhist practice. According to Tibetan Buddhist tradition, the student must have complete trust in the teacher (the \\"dangerous friend\\") if he or she is to achieve any understanding. It is the teacher's responsibility to uphold the integrity of the tradition, the basis of which is compassion for all beings, by transmitting it properly to an appropriate student. Likewise, it is the student's responsibility to meet the challenge of carrying on the lineage of teachings. By entering such a relationship, both teacher and student accept the burden of protecting those teachings by understanding them completely and correctly, by practicing them fully and faultlessly, and by transmitting them without omission. Dangerous Friend includes discussions of the following topics: ? Meeting and recognizing an appropriate teacher. ? Understanding the gravity of entering the teacher-student relationship. ? Shifting one's approach from spiritual materialism to genuine Buddhist practice. ? Accepting the challenge of being truly kind, honest, and courageous.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VZoQAQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nature and Man's Fate","description":"This is a new release of the original 1959 edition.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GjXcnQEACAAJ&dq=Nature+and+Man%27s+Fate&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Discovering Algebra: An Investigative Approach (Discovering Mathematics)","description":"Discovering Algebra provides a balance between skill development and mathematical exploration, between individual work and group work, between teacher directed activity and student led activity, and between the study of mathematics per se and the study of mathematics as it relates to the world and other disciplines.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1dgfPwAACAAJ&dq=Discovering+Algebra:+An+Investigative+Approach+(Discovering+Mathematics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Try Anything Once","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8HUVAQAAIAAJ&dq=Try+Anything+Once&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bridge to Terabithia","description":"Tilly, Tom and Tiny from Tots TV have adventures in these pocket-sized books","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WZkxmgEACAAJ&dq=Bridge+to+Terabithia&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"You Make Me Do These Things to You","description":"A dark romance box set from International Bestselling Author, Nikita Slater.

As he delves into the emotions of the German commander and the Norwegian traitor, and depicts the spirited patriotism of the Norwegian underground, Steinbeck uncovers profound, often unsettling truths about war and about human nature. Nobel Prize winner John Steinbeck s self-described  celebration of the durability of democracy  had an extraordinary impact as Allied propaganda in Nazi-occupied Europe. Despite Axis efforts to suppress it (in Fascist Italy, mere possession of the book was punishable by death), The Moon is Down was secretly translated into French, Norwegian, Danish, Dutch, Swedish, German, Italian and Russian; hundreds of thousands of copies circulated throughout Europe, making it by far the most popular piece of propaganda under the occupation. Few literary works of our time have demonstrated so triumphantly the power of ideas in the face of cold steel and brute force. This edition features an introduction by Donald V. Coers. For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines.

Drawing on his memories of the real inhabitants of Monterey, California, including longtime friend Ed Ricketts, Steinbeck interweaves the stories of Doc, Dora, Mack and his boys, Lee Chong, and the other characters in this world where only the fittest survive, to create a novel that is at once one of his most humorous and poignant works. In her introduction, Susan Shillinglaw shows how the novel expresses, both in style and theme, much that is essentially Steinbeck:  scientific detachment, empathy toward the lonely and depressed and, at the darkest level the terror of isolation and nothingness.

This book, designed for those who are taking introductory courses on operating systems, presents both theoretical and practical aspects of modern operating systems. Although the emphasis is on theory, while exposing you (the reader) the subject matter, this book maintains a balance between theory and practice. The theories and technologies that have fueled the evolution of operating systems are primarily geared towards two goals: user convenience in maneuvering computers and efficient utilization of hardware resources. This book also discusses many fundamental concepts that have been formulated over the past several decades and that continue to be used in many modern operating systems. In addition, this book also discusses those technologies that prevail in many modern operating systems such as UNIX, Solaris, Linux, and Windows. While the former two have been used to present many in-text examples, the latter two are dealt with as separate technological case studies. They highlight the various issues in the design and development of operating systems and help you correlate theories to technologies.

The selections of Handel?s music included here are those best understood and most apt to be mastered by young musicians. One evening, back in 1691, conservative Doctor Handel was shocked and dismayed to find his small son carrying the torch at the head of a band of singers wandering through the little town of Halle. The good doctor never quite understood the all-consuming love of music which drove his son from childhood on and on to the great heights he eventually attained as the beloved Father of the Oratorio, the composer of the magnificent MESSIAH. Opal Wheeler has given us here the most finished, most completely satisfying book on her list of fine music biographies. Handel at the Court of Kings should be a favorite of all children who love music, whether they are young musicians themselves or not.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pN47AQAACAAJ&dq=Handel+At+The+Court+Of+Kings&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"CliffsTestPrep Police Sergeant Examination Preparation Guide","description":"The CliffsTestPrep series offers full-length practice exams that simulate the real tests; proven test-taking strategies to increase your chances at doing well; and thorough review exercises to help fill in any knowledge gaps.

The result of 5 years of investigation from researchers around the world New data from a range of new techniques, including synchrotron radiation X-ray topography provide safer and surer methods of identifying deformation mechanisms Informing the future direction of research in intermediate and high temperature processes by providing original treatment of dislocation climb DESCRIPTION: Thermally Activated Mechanisms in Crystal Plasticity is a unified, quantitative and fundamental resource for material scientists investigating the strength of metallic materials of various structures at extreme temperatures. Crystal plasticity is usually controlled by a limited number of elementary dislocation mechanisms, even in complex structures. Those which determine dislocation mobility and how it changes under the influence of stress and temperature are of key importance for understanding and predicting the strength of materials. The authors describe in a consistent way a variety of thermally activated microscopic mechanisms of dislocation mobility in a range of crystals. The principles of the mechanisms and equations of dislocation motion are revisited and new ones are proposed. These describe mostly friction forces on dislocations such as the lattice resistance to glide or those due to sessile cores, as well as dislocation cross-slip and climb. They are critically assessed by comparison with the best available experimental results of microstructural characterization, in situ straining experiments under an electron or a synchrotron beam, as well as accurate transient mechanical tests such as stress relaxation experiments. Some recent attempts at atomistic modeling of dislocation cores under stress and temperature are also considered since they offer a complementary description of core transformations and associated energy barriers. In addition to offering guidance and assistance for further experimentation, the book indicates new ways to extend the body of data in particular areas such as lattice resistance to glide.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VPbIvN7SkkcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Though All The World Betrays Thee","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jddceJGUaYYC&dq=Though+All+The+World+Betrays+Thee&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Representative Men (Seven Lectures)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ayY5AQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cards on the Table","description":"A flamboyant party host is murdered in full view of a roomful of bridge players...

In seeking common ground among various Christian traditions, he looks first at what Scripture has to say and then assesses the strengths and weaknesses of differing views in that light. While insisting that baptism is not substitute for saving faith, he nevertheless makes a strong case for the practice of infant baptism, confronting head-on common objections to the practice as well as addressing the related problems of confirmation and rebaptism.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HMdJDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Brown Paper School book: Book of Think : Or How to Solve a Problem Twice Yo","description":"#1 New York Times Bestseller  THIS. This is the right book for right now. Yes, learning requires focus. But, unlearning and relearning requires much more it requires choosing courage over comfort. In Think Again, Adam Grant weaves together research and storytelling to help us build the intellectual and emotional muscle we need to stay curious enough about the world to actually change it. I ve never felt so hopeful about what I don t know.   Bren  Brown, Ph.D., #1 New York Times bestselling author of Dare to Lead The bestselling author of Give and Take and Originals examines the critical art of rethinking: learning to question your opinions and open other people's minds, which can position you for excellence at work and wisdom in life Intelligence is usually seen as the ability to think and learn, but in a rapidly changing world, there's another set of cognitive skills that might matter more: the ability to rethink and unlearn. In our daily lives, too many of us favor the comfort of conviction over the discomfort of doubt. We listen to opinions that make us feel good, instead of ideas that make us think hard. We see disagreement as a threat to our egos, rather than an opportunity to learn. We surround ourselves with people who agree with our conclusions, when we should be gravitating toward those who challenge our thought process. The result is that our beliefs get brittle long before our bones. We think too much like preachers defending our sacred beliefs, prosecutors proving the other side wrong, and politicians campaigning for approval--and too little like scientists searching for truth. Intelligence is no cure, and it can even be a curse: being good at thinking can make us worse at rethinking. The brighter we are, the blinder to our own limitations we can become. Organizational psychologist Adam Grant is an expert on opening other people's minds--and our own. As Wharton's top-rated professor and the bestselling author of Originals and Give and Take, he makes it one of his guiding principles to argue like he's right but listen like he's wrong. With bold ideas and rigorous evidence, he investigates how we can embrace the joy of being wrong, bring nuance to charged conversations, and build schools, workplaces, and communities of lifelong learners. You'll learn how an international debate champion wins arguments, a Black musician persuades white supremacists to abandon hate, a vaccine whisperer convinces concerned parents to immunize their children, and Adam has coaxed Yankees fans to root for the Red Sox. Think Again reveals that we don't have to believe everything we think or internalize everything we feel. It's an invitation to let go of views that are no longer serving us well and prize mental flexibility over foolish consistency. If knowledge is power, knowing what we don't know is wisdom.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UhkSEAAAQBAJ&dq=Brown+Paper+School+book:+Book+of+Think+:+Or+How+to+Solve+a+Problem+Twice+Yo&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Salvation and Suicide: Jim Jones, the Peoples Temple, and Jonestown (Religion in North America)","description":"An  ambitious and courageous  examination of the Jonestown cult viewed through the lens of theology (Journal of the American Academy of Religion). Re-issued in recognition of the 25th anniversary of the mass suicides at Jonestown, this revised edition of David Chidester s groundbreaking book features a new prologue that considers the meaning of the tragedy for a post-Waco, post-9/11 world. For Chidester, the murder-suicide of some 900 members of the Peoples Temple in Guyana recalls the American religious commitment to redemptive sacrifice, which for Jim Jones meant saving his followers from the evils of capitalist society.  Jonestown is ancient history,  writes Chidester, but it does provide us with an opportunity  to reflect upon the strangeness of familiar . . . promises of redemption through sacrifice.  His original conclusion that the Peoples Temple was a meaningful religious movement seems all the more prescient and astute today, when fundamentalism has raised the troubling spectre of violence and suicide all over the world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6eMJAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Relationships: An Open and Honest Guide to Making Bad Relationships Better and Good Relationships Great","description":"Today more than ever, people long for connection.

When one thinks of a Soul Mate or Twin Flame, they might equate it to a passionate romantic relationship where you're making love on a white sandy palm tree lined beach in paradise for the rest of your lives. This beautiful mythological notion has caused great turmoil in others who long for this person that fits the description of a lothario character in a romance novel. It is also an unrealistic and misguided interpretation of the Soul Mate or Twin Flame dynamic. Twin Flame Soul Connections discusses and lists some of the various myths and truths surrounding the Twin Flames, and how to identify if you've come into contact with your Twin Flame, or if you know someone who has. The ultimate goal is not to find ones Twin Flame, but to awaken ones heart to love, and to work on becoming complete and whole as an individual soul through spiritual self-mastery, life lessons, growth, and raising your consciousness. Your soul's life was born out of love and will die right back into that love.

To understand the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, it is necessary to go back to the source of its art, and to know the life of our fathers; these are two inseparable things, which entwine one another, and become complete one by the other. - Preface.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pvMAAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Making Country Furniture: 15 Step-by-Step Projects","description":"George Buchanan shows you how to create 15 pieces of country furniture that include a trinket box, a sleigh bed, a corner cupboard, a child's chair and a trestle table.

This long-awaited second edition, expanded and completely updated, will be equally revered. Like its predecessor, this edition of Indexing Books offers comprehensive, reliable treatment of indexing principles and practices relevant to authors and indexers alike. In addition to practical advice, the book presents a big-picture perspective on the nature and purpose of indexes and their role in published works. New to this edition are discussions of \\"information overload\\" and the role of the index, open-system versus closed-system indexing, electronic submission and display of indexes, and trends in software development, among other topics. Mulvany is equally comfortable focusing on the nuts and bolts of indexing how to determine what is indexable, how to decide the depth of an index, and how to work with publisher instructions and broadly surveying important sources of indexing guidelines such as The Chicago Manual of Style, Sun Microsystems, Oxford University Press, NISO TR03, and ISO 999. Authors will appreciate Mulvany's in-depth consideration of the costs and benefits of preparing one's own index versus hiring a professional, while professional indexers will value Mulvany's insights into computer-aided indexing. Helpful appendixes include resources for indexers, a worksheet for general index specifications, and a bibliography of sources to consult for further information on a range of topics. Indexing Books is both a practical guide and a manifesto about the vital role of the human-crafted index in the Information Age. As the standard indexing reference, it belongs on the shelves of everyone involved in writing and publishing nonfiction books.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=G0Eqm8FbiTMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pooh's pot o'honey","description":"[1] Pooh hears a buzzing noise and meets some bees.--[2] Pooh goes visiting and gets into a tight place.--[3] Pooh and Piglet go hunting and nearly catch a Woozle.--[4] Eeyore loses a tail and Pooh finds one.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4nlUAAAACAAJ&dq=Pooh%27s+pot+o%27honey&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Son of the Phantom","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hst9GwAACAAJ&dq=The+Son+of+the+Phantom&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gleanings in Exodus (Gleanings Ser.)","description":"Exhaustive studies that bring out deep theological and spiritual truths from the Scriptures.

She was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1927, 1928 and 1930.Wharton combined her insider's view of America's privileged classes with a brilliant, natural wit to write humorous, incisive novels and short stories of social and psychological insight. She was well acquainted with many of her era's other literary and public figures, including Theodore Roosevelt.Edith Wharton was born Edith Newbold Jones to George Frederic Jones and Lucretia Stevens Rhinelander at their brownstone at 14 West Twenty-third Street in New York City. She had two much older brothers, Frederic Rhinelander, who was sixteen, and Henry Edward, who was eleven. She was baptized April 20, 1862, Easter Sunday, at Grace Church. To her friends and family she was known as \\"Pussy Jones\\".The saying \\"keeping up with the Joneses\\" is said to refer to her father's family. She was also related to the Rensselaer family, the most prestigious of the old patroon families. She had a lifelong lovely friendship with her Rhinelander niece, landscape architect Beatrix Farrand of Reef Point in Bar Harbor, Maine. Edith was born during the Civil War; she was three years old when the South surrendered. After the war, the family traveled extensively in Europe.From 1866 to 1872, the Jones family visited France, Italy, Germany, and Spain.During her travels, the young Edith became fluent in French, German, and Italian. At the age of ten, she suffered from typhoid fever while the family was at a spa in the Black Forest. After the family returned to the United States in 1872, they spent their winters in New York and their summers in Newport, Rhode Island. While in Europe, she was educated by tutors and governesses. She rejected the standards of fashion and etiquette that were expected of young girls at the time, intended to enable women to marry well and to be displayed at balls and parties. She thought these requirements were superficial and oppressive. Edith wanted more education than she received, so she read from her father's library and from the libraries of her father's friends.Her mother forbade her to read novels until she was married, and Edith complied with this command Edith began writing poetry and fiction as a young girl. She attempted to write a novel at age eleven. Her first publication was a translation of the German poem, \\"Was die Steine Erz?hlen\\" (\\"What the Stones Tell\\") by Heinrich Karl Brugsch, which earned her $50. She was 15 at the time. Her family did not wish her name to appear in print because the names of upper class women of the time only appeared in print to announce birth, marriage, and death. Consequently, the poem was published under the name of a friend's father, E. A. Washburn. He was a cousin of Ralph Waldo Emerson and supported women's education. He played a pivotal role in Edith's efforts to educate herself, and he encouraged her ambition to write professionally.In 1877, at the age of 15, she secretly wrote a 30,000 word novella \\"Fast and Loose\\". In 1878 her father arranged for a collection of two dozen original poems and five translations, Verses, to be privately published. In 1880 she had five poems published anonymously in the Atlantic Monthly, then a revered literary magazine. Despite these early successes, she was not encouraged by her family nor her social circle, and though she continued to write, she did not publish anything again until her poem, \\"The Last Giustiniani\\", was published in Scribner's Magazine in October 1889. Edith was engaged to Henry Stevens in 1882 after a two-year courtship. The month the two were to marry, the engagement abruptly ended....","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2QLbqohgDh8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chicken Soup for the Soul Cartoons for Dads","description":"After the resounding success of Chicken Soup for the Soul Cartoons for Moms, the authors decided to take a humorous look at fatherhood, again from the perspective of internationally syndicated and award-winning cartoonist, John McPherson.

But what begins for Blackpool as an investigation sandwiched between golf games in nearby Palm Springs quickly becomes an obsession. For the savage beauty of the wastelands holds many secrets. Secrets that stir up Blackpool s long-suppressed nightmares of his own son s death. Secrets that threaten to destroy an entire police department. Secrets that, by rights, should remain forever buried by the wind in the ageless desert sands.

For college graduate Sidney Temple, the Roaring Twenties bring opportunities he never imagined. His impulsive marriage to independent artist Loretta is a happiness he never thought he d find. And when he s tapped by J. Edgar Hoover to be one of the FBI s first African-American agents, he sees a once-in-a-lifetime chance to secure real justice. Instead of providing evidence against Marcus Garvey, prominent head of the  dangerously radical  back-to-Africa movement, Sidney uses his unexpected knack for deception and undercover work to thwart the Bureau s biased investigation. And by giving renowned leader W. E. B. Du Bois insider information, Sidney gambles on change that could mean a fair destiny for all Americans... But the higher Sidney and Loretta climb in Harlem s most influential and glamorous circles, the more dangerous the stakes. An unexpected friendship and a wrenching personal tragedy threaten to shatter Loretta s innocent trust in her husband and turn his double life into a fast-closing trap.

He has been nominated twice for Governor General's Awards, and his first novel, Medicine River, has been transformed into a CBC movie. His books have been reviewed in publications such as The New York Times Book Review, The Globe and Mail, and People magazine. King is also the author of the serialized radio series The Dead Dog Caf  and is an accomplished photographer. Border Crossings is the first full-length study to explore King's art. Davidson, Walton, and Andrews employ a framework of postcolonial and border studies theory to examine the concepts of nation, race, and sexuality in King's work. They examine how King's art routinely explores cross-cultural dynamics, including Native rights and race relations, American and Canadian cultural interaction, and the artistic traditions of Europe and North America. The authors argue that, by situating these concepts within a comic framework, King avoids the polemics that often surface in cultural critiques. His writing engages, entertains, and educates. This provocative analysis of King's art reads across cultures and between borders, and makes an important contribution to the study of Native writing, Canadian and American literature, border studies, and humour studies.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YH4t4JLbAtsC&dq=Dead+Dog+Cafe+(Dead+Dog+Cafe+Comedy+Hour)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pursuit of Love (Arabesque)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Blush of Winter Moon","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XQ8gAQAAIAAJ&dq=Blush+of+Winter+Moon&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Violets Are Blue (Read by Daniel Whitner & Kevin O'Rourke)","description":"D.C.

G. Wells explores not the idea of religion, but the idea of a deity. He presets his own belief in a finite God - an attack on doctrinal Christianity that supports the idea of an infinite force. \\"God, the Invisible King\\" sets forth clearly and exactly H. G. Wells' personal religious beliefs, making it a must-read for fans of his work and highly recommended for those with an interest in Christianity.

Today, he is perhaps best remembered for his contributions to the science fiction genre thanks to such novels as \\"The Time Machine\\" (1895), \\"The Invisible Man\\" (1897), and \\"The War of the Worlds\\" (1898). Although never a winner, Wells was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature a total of four times. Many vintage books such as this are becoming increasingly scarce and expensive.

Here is a remedy for that all-too-familiar chapter in every girl's life: getting dumped. It's not really Ben & Jerry's that soothes the sting -- or getting even -- though that certainly helps. Rather, it's learning to lose him and respect yourself that puts you on the path to sanity-and gives you some Zen with men. In this quirky romantic comedy of errors, Suzy Yalof tells her John Doe story from the pitch \\"open -- minded, smart, funny\\" to sex, the L-word, and the big dump (a subzero day on a chairlift) to finally getting over John Doe (Hint: Do the things he always hated). Like all of us, Suzy Yalof has survived the exaltation, embarrassment, and disappointment of romance. But with the realization that for every frog there is a prince, she's rebounded with style. Hers is an exemplary story of a woman scorned -- and then inspired. Every woman who has ever loved and lost and then gone on to exhaust her mom, her pals, and the neighborhood bartender with her John Doe story will find a well of unconditional empathy in Getting Over John Doe. It is a love lesson for our time -- and far more titillating than dating John ever was.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GauR5Gl7visC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bertolt Brecht: Journals 1934 - 1955","description":"\\"Those who dismiss Brecht as a yea-sayer to Stalinism are advised to read these journals and moderate their opinion.\\" (Paul Bailey, Weekend Telegraph) Brecht's \\"Work Journals\\" cover the period from 1938 to 1955, the years of exile in Denmark, Sweden, Finland and America, and his return via Switzerland to East Berlin.

New Strategies of Educational Excellence","description":"Despite more than 15 years of effort, it is widely acknowledged that internal reform of the public schools has produced little, if any, success. This has led to renewed interest in alternative forms of educational delivery to devolve decision-making through charter schools, public and private voucher plans, contracting out educational services, and home schooling. However, such reforms have largely been resisted by public school interest groups, including teacher unions, state departments of education, colleges of education, and school board and administrator organizations that have fought any but the most benign changes. Less attention has been given to another option that has been quietly growing in importance: private, for-profit schools. Firms in the private sector are typically more productive and responsive to consumer demands than their public sector counterparts. Can Teachers Own Their Own Schools? examines the economics, history, and politics of education and argues that public schools should be privatized. Privatized public schools would benefit from competition, market discipline, and the incentives essential to produce cost-effective educational quality, and attract the additional funding and expertise needed to revolutionize school systems. Drawing inspiration from Margaret Thatcher's privatization of government council housing in England, privatization reforms in Latin America, and the E.S.O.P. (Employee Stock Ownership Plan) movement in the United States, Vedder presents a bold plan in which teachers, administrators, and others involved in the educational process would become the owners of schools, acquiring an attractive financial stake in the process. Such privatization reforms could pave the way for new, cost-effective means of improving educational outcomes. As a result, schools in which teachers, administrators, and parents have a significant financial stake would foster vibrant school communities with increased parental involvement and the innovation and efficiency essential to produce educational excellence.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3NMlAQAAIAAJ&dq=Can+Teachers+Own+Their+Own+Schools%3F+New+Strategies+of+Educational+Excellence&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Yardbirds: The Band That Launched Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, and Jimmy Page","description":"Lasting just five years, the original Yardbirds had a tremendous impact on 1960s music and culture in America and England.

While the emphasis has shifted somewhat in the course of the writing, it is still a book about political organization, an attempt to work out a theory about the relation between organization and conflict, the relation between political organization and democracy, and the organizational alternatives open to the American people. The assumption made throughout is that the nature of political organization depends on the conflicts exploited in the political system, which ultimately is what politics is about. The thesis is that we shall never understand politics unless we know what the struggle is about. The great problem in American politics is: What makes things happen? We might understand the dynamics of American politics if we knew what is going on when things are happening. What is the process of change? What does change look like? These questions are worth asking because obviously tremendous things are going on in American public affairs, even in quiet times... To understand why Americans generally have been unconscious of the process of change it is necessary to take a new look at the dynamics of American politics. Throughout this book the emphasis has been on the dynamic character of the American political system. The concepts formulated here constitute an attack on all political theories, all research techniques and concepts tending to show that American politics is a meaningless stalemate about which no one can do anything. Because so much is going on, one object of the book is to show the need for a new public policy about politics.--from the Preface.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JPzyJyg3_tUC&dq=The+semisovereign+people%3B:+A+realist%27s+view+of+democracy+in+America&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Old Mother Hubbard (Routledge's new sixpenny toy books)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CVWctAEACAAJ&dq=Old+Mother+Hubbard+(Routledge%27s+new+sixpenny+toy+books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Araby (Signal Editions)","description":"\\"Araby\\" is a new collection of poems on the adventures, dreams, hopes, and imaginings of two singular characters: Jaham, the \\"Father of Clouds\\", a semi-nomadic poet and auto mechanic, and his inseparable sidekick Bald Adham, also a virtuoso mechanic as well as pillar of Muslim piety.

The outcome is in doubt and a terrible blow has fallen on American morale. Lieutenant David Armistead, a Marine Corps hero and cousin of the President of the United States, is missing and some say he's gone over to the enemy. Coast Guard Captain Josh Thurlow and his ragtag crew are given the assignment to find Armistead, though not necessarily to bring him back alive. Recruited in the hunt is a tormented and frail PT-boat skipper nicknamed \\"Shafty\\" who is also known by another name: John F. Kennedy. When Josh is stranded in the jungles of New Georgia with a mysterious, sensual woman who has a tendency to chop off men's heads, it's up to Kennedy to come to the rescue and complete the mission. But to procure a gunboat, he first has to play high-stakes poker with a young naval supply officer called Nick who happens to be the best gambler in the South Pacific. Nick has another name, too: Richard M. Nixon.

The next time a conclave unfolds in Rome, some 6,000 journalists are expected to descend on the Eternal City to cover the death of John Paul II and report on the election of his successor. The man in white who emerges from the Sistine Chapel at its conclusion will automatically become one of the most important figures on earth, a leader who commands a unique combination of political and spiritual power. Depending on how he chooses to exercise that power, governments and political systems may rise or fall, religious wars may heat up or abate, and the Church may undergo a radical transformationfrom changes in its stances on such issues as sexuality, the place of women in the Church, to the role of the papacy itself. Conclave is a fascinating look at the election process and at what this headline-making occasion will mean to the world. John L. Allen, Jr., takes readers behind the scenes to reveal the issues, parties, and people most likely to determine the outcome. Setting the election within a broader context, he explains why it matters who becomes pope, discusses their role in the modern world, and examines the issues that will form the agenda of the next papacy. Although the book is not intended as a  handicapper s guide,  Allen does offer his own informed list of the  top twenty  contenders for the position. He creates, as well, a classification system that clarifies the differences among the informal political parties that exist within the College of Cardinals, the body of 130-plus men who will elect John Paul II s successor. In conclusion, he presents a critical, independent-minded profile of each of those cardinalsfor one of them will certainly be the new pope.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tHsltdTp6OgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Acts of God (Book Three of The Christ Clone Trilogy)","description":"BeauSeigneur concludes his powerful epic of man's ultimate destiny and its inextricable ties to Christopher Goodman--the clone of Jesus Christ. \\"[A] fine mix of scientific, political, and religious knowledge.\\"--Charles Sheffield.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HNZpAAAACAAJ&dq=Acts+of+God+(Book+Three+of+The+Christ+Clone+Trilogy)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Living and Working in America: A Survival Handbook (Living & Working in America)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Human Resources Kit for Dummies","description":"Align HR practices with your objectives and keep your company competitive A company's ability to grow and stay on top of customer demand has always depended heavily on the quality of its people.

An award-winning novel about belonging by  one of the greatest writers of science fiction and fantasy who ever lived  (Stephen King). Individually, they are a seemingly simpleminded young man living in the woods who can read the thoughts of others, a runaway girl with telekinetic powers, twin girls who can barely speak but can teleport across great distances, and an infant with a mind like a supercomputer. Together, they are the Gestalt a single extraordinary being comprised of remarkable parts although an essential piece may be missing . . . But are they the next stage in human development or harbingers of the end of civilization? The answer may come when they are joined by Gerry. Powerfully telepathic, he lacks a moral compass and his hatred of the world that has rejected him could prove catastrophic.

From September 11, 2001 to May 2, 2011, Osama Bin Laden evaded intelligence services and special forces units, drones and hunter killer squads. The Exile tells the extraordinary inside story of that decade through the eyes of those who witnessed it: bin Laden's four wives and many children, his deputies and military strategists, his spiritual advisor, the CIA, Pakistan's ISI, and many others who have never before told their stories. Investigative journalists Cathy Scott-Clark and Adrian Levy gained unique access to Osama bin Laden's inner circle, and they recount the flight of Al Qaeda's forces and bin Laden's innocent family members, the gradual formation of ISIS by bin Laden's lieutenants, and bin Laden's rising paranoia and eroding control over his organization. They also reveal that the Bush White House knew the whereabouts of bin Laden's family and Al Qaeda's military and religious leaders, but rejected opportunities to capture them, pursuing war in the Persian Gulf instead, and offer insights into how Al Qaeda will attempt to regenerate itself in the coming years. While we think we know what happened in Abbottabad on May 2, 2011, we know little about the wilderness years that led to that shocking event.

Takagi takes a very complex and sensitive subject--racial politics--and shows, through a careful analysis . . . that changes in the discourse about Asian American admissions have facilitated a 'retreat from race' in the area of affirmative action. . . . This book will appeal to an audience significantly wider than a typical academic one.\\"-- David Karen, Bryn Mawr College Charges by Asian Americans that the top universities in the United States used quotas to limit the enrollment of Asian-American students developed into one of the most controversial public controversies in higher education since the Bakke case. In Retreat from Race, Dana Takagi follows the debates over Asian-American admissions at Berkeley, UCLA, Brown, Stanford, Harvard, and Princeton. She explains important developments in the politics of race: changes in ethnic coalitions, reconstruction of the debate over affirmative action, and the conservative challenge to the civil rights agenda of the 1960s. Takagi examines the history and significance of the Asian American admissions controversy on American race relations both inside and outside higher education. Takagi's central argument is that the Asian-American admissions controversy facilitated a subtle but important shift in affirmative action policy away from racial preferences toward class preferences. She calls this development a retreat from race. Takagi suggests that the retreat signals not only an actual policy shift but also the increasing reluctance on the part of intellectuals, politicans, and policy analysts to identify and address social problems as explicitly racial problems. Moving beyond the university setting, Takagi explores the political significance of the retreat from race by linking Asian-American admissions to other controversies in higher education and in American politics, including the debates over political correctness and multiculturalism. In her assessment, the retreat from race is likely to fail at its promise of easing racial tension and promoting racial equality.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=b25VQklHaY4C&dq=The+Retreat+from+Race:+Asian-American+Admissions+and+Racial+Politics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Buckskin & Blanket Days","description":"For the westerner trouble came with the territory.

Patricia Moran points out that strategies of resistance and challenge are also strategies of repudiation and revulsion directed at female embodiment. Word of Mouth reevaluates Mansfield and Woolf, focusing on the figures of the anorexic and the hysteric and on the extensive imagery of eating, feeding, starvation, suffocation, flesh, and longing that permeates both fictional and nonfictional texts; it locates this writing within the overlapping frames of psychoanalytic theory, studies of women and eating disorders, and feminist work on women's anxiety of authorship.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SeaAzGwockwC&dq=Word+of+Mouth:+Body+Language+in+Katherine+Mansfield+and+Virginia+Woolf+(Feminist+Issues:+Practice,+Politics,+Theory)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Incredible Journey","description":"A classic Canadian story of the bravery and ingenuity of three animals who find their way home.

Four chaplains were assigned to the Dorchester with more than 900 men on board. Alexander Goode, a Jewish rabbi; John Washington, a Catholic priest; George Fox, a Methodist minister; and Clark Poling, a Baptist minister, all offered comfort, reassurances, and prayers with a warning from the captain that a German submarine was hunting their convoy. The Nazi U-boat captain, Karl-Jurg Wachter, had been stalking the Americans for days. When bad weather separated the Dorchester from the other convoy ships, Wachter was finally in a position to strike. Just past midnight, on February 3, just hours from their destination, the Dorchester was torpedoed and sank, throwing its passengers into the frigid waters and creating the worst single loss of an American personnel convoy during WWII. Many of the survivors credit the four chaplains with saving their lives. Those chaplains would become known as \\"The Immortals\\" for their heroism in making the ultimate sacrifice. With no thought of themselves, they calmly helped men to safety through the chaos of their badly damaged ship, searched for spare life jackets for those without--eventually giving away their own life jackets and encouraging men in the freezing waters. The celebrated story of the Immortals is now joined for the first time in print by the largely untold story of another hero of the sinking of the Dorchester: Charles Walter Davis Jr. was a young Black petty officer aboard a Coast Guard cutter traveling with the convoy who bravely dived into the glacial water over and over again, even with hypothermia setting in, to try to rescue the men the chaplains had first helped and inspired to never give up. Thoroughly researched and told in an engrossing non-fiction narrative, the book alternates between accounts told from the perspective of the Nazi U-boat captain and his crew, and the hunted--the men of the American convoy. Using his expertise as an attorney specializing in religious freedom and constitutional law, the author, Steven T. Collis, also paints a thought-provoking portrait of religious life in America during wartime and how American views of faith affected the chaplains and the men they served. Page-turning and inspiring, The Immortals explores the power of faith and religious conviction and powerfully narrates the lives of five heroic men who believed in something greater than themselves, living lives of service and sacrifice for their country and their fellow man.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gCuuzQEACAAJ&dq=THE+IMMORTALS&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Dolphin Day in Hawaii","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=s3GWAAAACAAJ&dq=A+Dolphin+Day+in+Hawaii&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Presbyterian Church Welcomes You: A Handbook for Church Members and Inquirers","description":"There is a voice that speaks quietly to guide in the right direction.

He argues that 'good reading', like moral action or religious experience, involves surrender to the work in hand and a process of entering fully into the opinions of others: 'in reading great literature I become a thousand men and yet remain myself'. Crucial to his notion of judging literature is a commitment to laying aside expectations and values extraneous to the work, in order to approach it with an open mind. Amid the complex welter of current critical theories, C. S. Lewis's wisdom is valuably down-to-earth, refreshing and stimulating in the questions it raises about the experience of reading.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5k6BYs5erqEC&dq=AN+EXPERIMENT+IN+CRITICISM&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Twilight Is Dawning: An Anthology of the Later Years : The Twilight Chronicles","description":"Stories told in an effort to cast the senior citizen in the light of compassion and understanding.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KScPAAAACAAJ&dq=Twilight+Is+Dawning:+An+Anthology+of+the+Later+Years+:+The+Twilight+Chronicles&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"R.

Did you have a party? If so, do you remember who was there? Now step back: how clear are those memories? Should we trust them to be accurate, or is there a chance that you re remembering incorrectly? And where have the many details you can no longer recall gone? Are they hidden somewhere in your brain, or are they gone forever? Such questions have fascinated scientists for hundreds of years, and, as Alison Winter shows in Memory: Fragments of a Modern History, the answers have changed dramatically in just the past century. Tracing the cultural and scientific history of our understanding of memory, Winter explores early metaphors that likened memory to a filing cabinet; later, she shows, that cabinet was replaced by the image of a reel of film, ever available for playback. That model, too, was eventually superseded, replaced by the current understanding of memory as the result of an extremely complicated, brain-wide web of cells and systems that together assemble our pasts. Winter introduces us to innovative scientists and sensationalistic seekers, and, drawing on evidence ranging from scientific papers to diaries to movies, explores the way that new understandings from the laboratory have seeped out into psychiatrists' offices, courtrooms, and the culture at large. Along the way, she investigates the sensational battles over the validity of repressed memories that raged through the 1980s and shows us how changes in technology such as the emergence of recording devices and computers have again and again altered the way we conceptualize, and even try to study, the ways we remember.

Published in 1932, the novel is a compelling portrait of Southern society. It traces the history of a group of characters shaped by and responding to the religious, cultural, and racial traditions of the American South. Faulkner contrasts the story of Joe Christmas, whose unclear parentage makes him a target for the town's hatred, with the placid tale of Lena Grove's search for her lover. While Joe's story is created by prejudice, hatred, and mistrust, Lena's story is one of simple country people whose honor, courage, and affections are uncorrupted by either the past or the modern world. Alwyn Berland illuminates the relationship between these contrasting stories, demonstrating how Southern Calvinism, both as a theme and as an unconscious influence on Faulkner, is the key to a small cluster of themes that connects seemingly unrelated threads of narrative. Berland's study offers a detailed and accessible examination of Faulkner's style, and discusses how his modernist and experimental techniques are related to his vision of human experience. Berland places Faulkner's achievement in the context of the ideas that interested him, Southern literary tradition, and his influences on his contemporaries and later writers. The only booklength study of this novel available, Berland's work will be of great value to Faulkner scholars, students of Southern literature, and those interested in the development of the novel in the twentieth century.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oZhaAAAAMAAJ&dq=Masterwork+Studies+Series:+Light+in+August+(Twayne%27s+Masterwork+Studies)+(No+95)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Silence of the Lambs","description":"A serial murderer known only by a grotesquely apt nickname--Buffalo Bill--is stalking women.

On finishing school more girls are entering universities and undertaking professional training for careers than ever before. Males and females enter many high status professions in roughly equal numbers. However, engineering stands out as a profession that remains obstinately male dominated. Despite efforts to change, little progress has been made in attracting and retaining women in engineering. This book analyses the outcomes of a decade-long investigation into this phenomenon, framed by two questions: Why are there so few women in engineering? And why is this so difficult to change? The study includes data from two major surveys, accounts from female engineers in a range of locations and engineering fields, and case studies of three large engineering corporations. The authors explore the history and politics of several organisations related to women in engineering, and conclude with an analysis of a range of campaigns that have been waged to address the issue of women s minority status in engineering. Challenging Knowledge, Sex and Power will be of great interest to students of feminist economics, and is also relevant to researchers in women s studies and engineering education.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cWMdAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Neil Diamond","description":"Neil Diamond's superstardom has come at a personal cost.

From the lobbies of the Houses of Parliament to Rupert Murdoch's newsrooms to the conference rooms of some of the world's biggest banks, Jones systematically explores the revolving doors that link the worlds of politics, media, and finance and shows how this corrupt and incestuous world came to be. Funny, sharp, and rich with brilliant descriptions of the men and women at the heart of the elite, The Establishment is a joy to read, but its diagnosis is deadly serious: the establishment is the biggest threat to democracy today. And it's time, writes Jones, for it to be challenged.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6nSWBgAAQBAJ&dq=The+Establishment&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Complete Guide to Mmx Technology","description":"Intel's new MMX TM technology--now built into every Pentium and other Intel Desktop processor--can dramatically increase the performance of multimedia applications.

Published anonymously to widespread controversy and commercial success, de Musset's lesbian erotic novel was inspired by his own heated affair with George Sand, a French novelist who pursued relationships with men and women throughout her life. Attending a dance at the opulent home of the Countess Gamiani, Alcide hears a rumor about his hostess' sexual appetites. Intrigued, he remains behind after the guests have left, hoping to join her for a romantic tryst: \\"I made up my mind to watch her that night, to conceal myself somewhere in her bedroom. The glass door of her dressing room faced the bed. I knew that. I realised at once the advantage of that spot; and hiding between dresses hung up, so that I could see unseen, I resolved to patiently await the orgy.\\" Finding her in bed with a young woman named Fanny, Alcide soon makes his presence known. Between scenes of intense passion, the women share stories of sexual escapades between men, women, priests, nuns, and animals. Gamiani, or Two Passionate Nights is a masterpiece of erotic fiction that remains an object of interest to scholars of queer representation in the history of art. With a beautifully designed cover and professionally typeset manuscript, this edition of Alfred de Musset's Gamiani, or Two Passionate Nights is a classic work of erotic literature reimagined for modern readers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EZ9zzgEACAAJ&dq=Gamiani,+or,+Two+nights+of+excess+(Masterpieces+of+French+erotic)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Art of Poetry: Poems, Parodies, Interviews, Essays, and Other Work (Poets on Poetry)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1APQ88mKdfAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mission: Addition","description":"Audisee? eBooks with Audio combine professional narration and text highlighting for an engaging read aloud experience!

This book follows the tried-and-tested 21 Days tutorial model to guide the reader through Windows Forms.

From Rome to Ravello and Sienna to Sicily, Bed and Blessings Italy reveals extraordinary accommodations for budget and savvy travelers alike. Life behind the mysterious monastic walls is a journey into another time, another place -- very much in the real world, yet one step removed. Many of the houses are former palaces and villas, filled with exquisite antiques and religious artwork. All are open to people of any faith, or none at all, whether alone, as a couple or with a family. In the Jubilee year 2000 Italy expects 30 million visitors, more than 8 times the annual amount! Many will stay in convents and monasteries, which hitherto, people have known about mainly through word-of-mouth. Now, Bed and Blessings Italy will offer travelers a real insider's guide to some of Italy's hidden treasures. Bed and Blessings Italy is an imaginative and well-researched guide featuring 131 convents and monasteries in some of Italy's finest areas. Mother-daughter team June and Anne Walsh spent two years researching the places in their book, traversing 13 regions of Italy and visiting more than 300 sites. For each entry, the book gives a description of both the physical place and the atmosphere, as well as address, fax and phone numbers, price, number of rooms, availability of meals, languages spoken, directions, and so on.

It s the clash between our sense of stubborn self-sufficiency and God s call to recognize that we re really nothing without Him. It s pride versus humility. And it s a fight we can t win without looking repeatedly to Christ and the cross. C. J. Mahaney raises a battle cry to daily, diligently, and deliberately weaken our greatest enemy (pride) and cultivate our greatest friend (humility). His thorough examination clarifies misconceptions, revealing the truth about why God detests pride and turns His active attention to the humble. Because pride is never passive, defeating it demands an intentional attack. The blessing that follows is God s abundant favor.  This is the one to whom I will look: he who is humble and contrite in spirit.   Isaiah 66:2, ESV God clearly states that He is drawn to the humble. He s also clear that He opposes the proud. These two, humility and pride, cannot coexist. Where one is fostered, the other is defeated. Which will you pursue? When you acknowledge the deception of pride and intentionally humble yourself, you become free to savor abundant mercies and unlikely graces. You will find a new life is yours a life God richly favors.

Herlock Sholmes: A Classic Tale of the World's Greatest Thief and the World's Greatest Detective!","description":"Created by Maurice LeBlanc during the early twentieth century, \\"Arsene Lupin Vs. Herlock Sholmes\\" is a witty confidence man and burglar, the Sherlock Holmes of crime. The poor and innocent have nothing to fear from him; often they profit from his spontaneous generosity. The rich and powerful, and the detective who tries to spoil his fun, however, must beware. They are the target of Ars ne Lupin's mischief and tomfoolery. A masterful thief, his plans frequently evolve into elaborate capers, a precursor to such cinematic creations as \\"Ocean's Eleven\\" and \\"The Sting\\" or books such as \\"The Scarlet Pimpernel.\\" Sparkling with amusing banter, \\"Arsene Lupin Vs. Herlock Sholmes\\" -the best of the Lupin series-are outrageous, melodramatic, and literate. Ars ne Lupin is definitely more dashing than Sherlock Holmes, and the Maurice LeBlanc stories are more psychologically or \\"humanly\\" involved. Arsene Lupin is everything you would expect from a French aristocrat -- witty, charming, brilliant, sly . . . and possibly the greatest thief in the world. In this classic tale, Lupin comes up against the only man who may be able to stop him . . . no less than the great British gentleman-detective Herlock Sholmes (a semi-parody on Sherlock Holmes, of course)! \\"Arsene Lupin Vs. Herlock Sholmes\\" is one of France's most famous fictional stories, with Lupin as sort of an anti-hero who uses his brains and charm to escape from any situation the police may put him in. \\"Arsene Lupin Vs.

Williams and his concept of congruence provide an alternative to the often chaotic, unbalanced ways in which change is currently understood and its accomplishment attempted. He challenges the organizational model of compartmentalized structures, offers a persuasive refutation of the fashionable paradigm of organizational transformation (one based on dominance and control), and argues a provocative notion that innovation is actually the successful result of reworking what has not worked before. A new look at the processes that create organizational movement, Williams' latest book is a guide for leaders, managers, consultants, and corporate practitioners, and a new way for students, teachers, and researchers to rethink the entire change process. Williams has found through his own experience that people focus too closely on the action behaviors of organizations and too little on the thinking behind them. The result is that gaps open up and create pitfalls in our efforts to achieve excellence in human and organizational performance. Williams suggests that organizations innovate themselves into failure. To counter this, he provides a true systemic approach to enhancing organizational performance, a system of what he visualizes as congruence, a way to fit thoughts to actions. It is as much a way of thinking, says Williams, as it is a method toward goals--goals that are clear and essential to the survival of any organization. Drawing liberally upon his own expertise as a teacher, consultant, and therapist, he helps others to appreciate the successes that can be realized when balance and the alignment of thought and action are achieved, and when the search for change becomes a planned, focused, and systemic endeavor.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fQSnI80-ploC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Pushkin Handbook (Wisconsin Center for Pushkin Studies)","description":"The Pushkin Handbook, a collection of studies by leading Pushkin scholars from the former Soviet Union, North America, and elsewhere, unites in one volume a multiplicity of voices engaged in a genuinely post-Soviet dialogue.

Abd al-Rahman Azzam (1893-1976) is generally considered as the father of the Arab League. He served as the League's first Secretary-General between 1945-52 as well as distinguishing himself in a long career as an ambassador and parliamentarian. As Vincent Sheean points out in his introduction, 'In Damascus as well as in Djakarta, Istanbul and Baghdad, this man is known for valour of spirit and elevation of mind...He combines in the best Islamic mode, the aspects of thought and action, like the Muslim warriors of another time who are typified for us Westerners by the figure of Saladin.' Malcolm X's reading of The Eternal Message of Muhammad and his meeting with Azzam Pasha are vividly recounted in his Autobiography.

To an extent that would have made Hanna blush, a series of developments capped by the Supreme Court s 2010 Citizens United decision effectively crowned a bunch of billionaires and their operatives the new kings of politics. Big Money is a rollicking tour of a new political world dramatically reordered by ever-larger flows of cash. Ken Vogel has breezed into secret gatherings of big-spending Republicans and Democrats alike from California poolsides to DC hotel bars to brilliantly expose the way the mega-money men (and rather fewer women) are dominating the new political landscape. Great wealth seems to attach itself to outsize characters. From the casino magnate Sheldon Adelson to the bubbling nouveau cowboy Foster Friess; from the Texas trial lawyer couple, Amber and Steve Mostyn, to the micromanaging Hollywood executive Jeffrey Katzenberg the multimillionaires and billionaires are swaggering up to the tables for the hottest new game in politics.

A feared and loathsome enemy. A devastating storm. And the surprising message of a merciful God to his people. The story of Jonah is one of the most well-known parables in the Bible. It is also the most misunderstood. Many people, even those who are nonreligious, are familiar with Jonah: A rebellious prophet who defies God and is swallowed by a whale. But there's much more to Jonah's story than most of us realize. In The Prodigal Prophet, pastor and New York Times bestselling author Timothy Keller reveals the hidden depths within the book of Jonah. Keller makes the case that Jonah was one of the worst prophets in the entire Bible. And yet there are unmistakably clear connections between Jonah, the prodigal son, and Jesus. Jesus in fact saw himself in Jonah. How could one of the most defiant and disobedient prophets in the Bible be compared to Jesus? Jonah's journey also doesn't end when he is freed from the belly of the fish. There is an entire second half to his story--but it is left unresolved within the text of the Bible. Why does the book of Jonah end on what is essentially a cliffhanger? In these pages, Timothy Keller provides an answer to the extraordinary conclusion of this biblical parable--and shares the powerful Christian message at the heart of Jonah's story.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hPhsDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Prophet+Jonah&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Fox and the Faith","description":"When British naval officer Patrick Dalton is falsely accused of murder due to his Irish heritage, he overtakes a lightly armed schooner carrying the ship's beautiful owner and desperately fights for his freedom and his life, in a tumultuous epic of adventure on the high seas set in the year 1773.

They are central to an understanding of Shakespeare's work as a poet and poetic dramatist, and while their autobiographical relevance is uncertain, no account of Shakespeare's life can afford to ignore them. So many myths and superstitions have arisen around these poems, relating for example to their possible addressees, to their coherence as a sequence, to their dates of composition, to their relation to other poetry of the period and to Shakespeare's plays, that even the most naive reader will find it difficult to read them with an innocent mind. Shakespeare's Sonnets dispels the myths and focuses on the poems. Considering different possible ways of reading the Sonnets, Wells and Edmondson place them in a variety of literary and dramatic contexts--in relation to other poetry of the period, to Shakespeare's plays, as poems for performance, and in relation to their reception and reputation. Selected sonnets are discussed in depth, but the book avoids the jargon of theoretical criticism. Shakespeare's Sonnets is an exciting contribution to the Oxford Shakespeare Topics, ideal for students and the general reader interested in these intriguing poems.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=O4v8crS-RCQC&dq=Shakespeare%27s+Sonnets+(Oxford+Shakespeare+Topics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"My Mother's Secret Life","description":"\\"A novel based on a true story [in which] a mother and daughter risk their lives to provide shelter to two families and a German soldier--all unbeknownst to each other--in a tiny two-room house in Sokal, Poland, during the Nazi invasion\\"--Amazon.com.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=djTgDwAAQBAJ&dq=My+Mother%27s+Secret+Life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Zebra Hunter","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tnvqwAEACAAJ&dq=The+Zebra+Hunter&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Programming Web Services With SOAP","description":"The web services architecture provides a new way to think about and implement application-to-application integration and interoperability that makes the development platform irrelevant.

Unfortunately, since the early decades of this century, biological and cultural anthropology have grown distinct, and a holistic vision of anthropology has suffered. This book brings culture and biology back together in new and refreshing ways. Directly addressing earlier criticisms of biological anthropology, Building a New Biocultural Synthesis concerns how culture and political economy affect human biology--e.g., people's nutritional status, the spread of disease, exposure to pollution--and how biological consequences might then have further effects on cultural, social, and economic systems. Contributors to the volume offer case studies on health, nutrition, and violence among prehistoric and historical peoples in the Americas; theoretical chapters on nonracial approaches to human variation and the development of critical, humanistic and political ecological approaches in biocultural anthropology; and explorations of biological conditions in contemporary societies in relationship to global changes. Building a New Biocultural Synthesis will sharpen and enrich the relevance of anthropology for understanding a wide variety of struggles to cope with and combat persistent human suffering. It should appeal to all anthropologists and be of interest to sister disciplines such as nutrition and sociology. Alan H. Goodman is Professor of Anthropology, Hampshire College. Thomas L.

But of all hoofed mammals in North America, wild sheep present the greatest management problems to biologists. This book is a major reference on the natural history, ecology, and management of wild sheep in North America. Written by wildlife biologists who have devoted years of study to the animals, it covers Dall's and Stone's sheep and Rocky Mountain, California, and desert bighorn and examines a variety of factors pertinent to their life histories: habitat, diet, activity, social organization, reproduction, and population dynamics. Additional chapters consider distribution and abundance, adaptive strategies, and management guidelines. Discussions on diseases of wild sheep present a wealth of information that will be of particular use to wildlife biologists, including detailed clinical descriptions of conditions that threaten sheep populations, from pasteurellosis to capture myopathy. An appendix reviews the cytogenetics and genetics of wild sheep. North American wild sheep may face extinction in many areas unless critical questions concerning their management are answered soon. Prior to the publication of this book, there was no single reference available in which one could find such a synthesis of information.

When developing countries began experiencing debt problems in the late 1960s, the Paris Club took shape as \\"ad hoc machinery\\" to restructure debt from export credit agencies. A decade later the London Club process emerged to handle workouts of commercial bank debt. Restructuring debt in the form of bonds became an issue in the late 1990s in Argentina and several other nations, and the IMF recently proposed a permanent mechanism to deal with that challenge. Restructuring Sovereign Debt explains why ad hoc machinery would function more effectively in the Bretton Woods system. By describing in detail the origins and operations of the London Club and Paris Club, Lex Rieffel highlights the pragmatism and flexibility associated with ad hoc approaches. He also recalls earlier proposals for creating permanent debt restructuring machinery and the reasons why they were not adopted. Recognizing that the issue of sovereign debt workout is complex, Rieffel has provided a comprehensive and detailed exposition of this important policy issue. Rieffel's book is an important tool for policymakers and the public, particularly as the global community seeks to resolve the debt problems of countries as diverse as Argentina, Iraq, and C?te d'Ivoire.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MxIytAEACAAJ&dq=Restructuring+Sovereign+Debt:+The+Case+for+Ad+Hoc+Machinery&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Batman: Under the Hood, Vol. 1","description":"Batman confronts various foes while the Red Hood tears apart Gotham's underworld and plans revenge on the man who killed him.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gBWmcQAACAAJ&dq=Batman:+Under+the+Hood,+Vol.+1&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kundun Pb","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Trap for Cinderella (An Inner sanctum mystery)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=v_kewQEACAAJ&dq=Trap+for+Cinderella+(An+Inner+sanctum+mystery)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"If This Be Glory","description":"During World War II along the Eastern front, Private Quast, a young German soldier and a fervent Nazi, becomes disillusioned and horrified by the corruption of fascism and the evil of Adolf Hitler","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=o6MlAAAAMAAJ&dq=If+This+Be+Glory&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Oliphaunt (Beastly Verse)","description":"A poem in which an elephant describes himself and his way of life.

Author Monique M. Ingalls argues that participatory worship music performances have brought into being new religious social constellations, or \\"modes of congregating\\". Through exploration of five of these modes--concert, conference, church, public, and networked congregations--Singing the Congregation reinvigorates the analytic categories of \\"congregation\\" and \\"congregational music.\\" Drawing from theoretical models in ethnomusicology and congregational studies, Singing the Congregation reconceives the congregation as a fluid, contingent social constellation that is actively performed into being through communal practice--in this case, the musically-structured participatory activity known as \\"worship.\\" \\"Congregational music-making\\" is thereby recast as a practice capable of weaving together a religious community both inside and outside local institutional churches. Congregational music-making is not only a means of expressing local concerns and constituting the local religious community; it is also a powerful way to identify with far-flung individuals, institutions, and networks that comprise this global religious community. The interactions among the congregations reveal widespread conflicts over religious authority, carrying far-ranging implications for how evangelicals position themselves relative to other groups in North America and beyond.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lpRqDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Way+I+Was+Made:+Words+and+Music+for+an+Unusual+Life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Selected satires of Lucian (An Aldine library edition)","description":"A collection of writings by the 2nd century satirist who ridiculed tyrants, philosophers, and even the gods, in his mock dialogues and prose narratives.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6O9dvQEACAAJ&dq=Selected+satires+of+Lucian+(An+Aldine+library+edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Object Constraint Language: Precise Modeling with UML (Addison-Wesley Object Technology Series)","description":"bull; Learn to better leverage the siginificant power of UML 2.0 and the Model-Driven Architecture standard bull; The OCL helps developers produce better software by adding vital definition to their designs bull; Updated to reflect the latest version of the standard - OCL 2.0","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gu_6L_hVIfEC&dq=The+Object+Constraint+Language:+Precise+Modeling+with+UML+(Addison-Wesley+Object+Technology+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rock and Roll Doctor-Lowell George: Guitarist, Songwriter, and Founder of Little Feat","description":"ROCK & ROLL DOCTOR - THE MUSIC OF LOWELL GEORGE AND LITTLE FEAT SOF","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HNGGDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Chalk Train & Others Tales: the Harper Chronicles, Volume One","description":"Harper, crime reporter for a small-city newspaper in the post-Reconstruction South, uncovers startling schemes, secrets and mysteries behind mysteries.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=c6Df8qRiQRMC&dq=The+Chalk+Train&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Week in the Life of NASCAR: A View From Within","description":"The backstage NASCAR race-week action is one of the most secretive and fascinating aspects of the racing world, and for the first time ever, fans have full access to every aspect of race week at Talladega and Darlington, even the top-secret post-race inspections, with this exciting book.

'Roughly translated: bloody well stop messing about and get on with it.' Annie naturally embraces the baby boomer's credo that old age, far from being a biological inevitability, is a mere lifestyle choice. If not downright carelessness.

Given its history of colonization, coping with biculturalism is central to New Zealand life. Much of this  bicultural drama  plays out in the media and is molded by an anxiety surrounding the ongoing struggle over citizenship rights that is seated within the politics of recognition. The Fourth Eye brings together Indigenous and non-Indigenous scholars to provide a critical and comprehensive account of the intricate and complex relationship between the media and M ori culture. Examining the Indigenous mediascape, The Fourth Eye shows how M ori filmmakers, actors, and media producers have depicted conflicts over citizenship rights and negotiated the representation of Indigenous people. From nineteenth-century M ori-language newspapers to contemporary M ori film and television, the contributors explore a variety of media forms including magazine cover stories, print advertisements, commercial images, and current M ori-language newspapers to illustrate the construction, expression, and production of indigeneity through media. Focusing on New Zealand as a case study, the authors address the broader question: what is Indigenous media? While engaging with distinct themes such as the misrepresentation of M ori people in the media, access of Indigenous communities to media technologies, and the use of media for activism, the essays in this much-needed new collection articulate an Indigenous media landscape that converses with issues that reach far beyond New Zealand.

He guides the reader through the whole text passage by passage, showing how every part of it makes sense in the light of what has gone before, as well as indicating problems in Aristotle's argument. No knowledge of Greek is required. When the argument does depend on the precise wording of the Greek text, translations and explanatory notes are provided, and there is a glossary of Greek terms.

This book is a victory on both sides of the page.  Gloria Steinem  Are you one of us?  a patient once asked Marsha Linehan, the world-renowned psychologist who developed Dialectical Behavior Therapy.  Because if you were, it would give all of us so much hope.  Over the years, DBT had saved the lives of countless people fighting depression and suicidal thoughts, but Linehan had never revealed that her pioneering work was inspired by her own desperate struggles as a young woman. Only when she received this question did she finally decide to tell her story. In this remarkable and inspiring memoir, Linehan describes how, when she was eighteen years old, she began an abrupt downward spiral from popular teenager to suicidal young woman. After several miserable years in a psychiatric institute, Linehan made a vow that if she could get out of emotional hell, she would try to find a way to help others get out of hell too, and to build a life worth living. She went on to put herself through night school and college, living at a YWCA and often scraping together spare change to buy food. She went on to get her PhD in psychology, specializing in behavior therapy. In the 1980s, she achieved a breakthrough when she developed Dialectical Behavioral Therapy, a therapeutic approach that combines acceptance of the self and ways to change. Linehan included mindfulness as a key component in therapy treatment, along with original and specific life-skill techniques. She says, \\"You can't think yourself into new ways of acting; you can only act yourself into new ways of thinking.\\" Throughout her extraordinary scientific career, Marsha Linehan remained a woman of deep spirituality. Her powerful and moving story is one of faith and perseverance. Linehan shows, in Building a Life Worth Living, how the principles of DBT really work and how, using her life skills and techniques, people can build lives worth living.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=R-8kEAAAQBAJ&dq=A+Life+Worth+Living&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"All Ground Is Holy: A Guide to the Christian Retreat","description":"Written for people who are interested in participating in retreats but who want to know more about them, this straightforward guide explores the elements of retreats, recommending what to bring, describing the types of worship, easing minds about prayer, and other pertinent information.

It is World War Two and James has just been inducted into the RAF. We see him at training camp and we go back to Yorkshire-- on real trips as he breaks away to see Helen who is about to have a baby, and on trips of reverie as he recalls the Dales, the animals, and the Yorkshire people who have so enriched his life. We meet old friends again-- his partner Siegfried, the zany Tristan, the bon vivant Granville Bennett-- and scores of new folk, each with a story to tell.

Here is a collection of his short stories, some of which have never before been published in English. He has written over twenty-eight novels, innumerable short stories, poetry collections, treatises, and countless commentaries from literature to art and science not to mention culture and humanity and published in all of the available paper media of his time in Korea. His writing style revolutionized Korean literature and the written language itself. These stories abound with Buddhist-themed meditations on matters of the human spirit and soul, as well as his thoughts on overcoming karmic condemnations. His consistency and the sincerity in his writing are such that one cannot help but believe that he practiced what he preached. He was a moralist, and his writing very didactic. It s not surprising that he asserts that without religion, one cannot improve one s character. The last two short stories in this collection were written during the period from shortly before the end of the WWII to Korean Independence in 1948. The chaotic and uncertain situation of Korea, along with harsh criticism, forced him to remove himself to the countryside and to live on a farm like an ordinary farmer, even maintaining an ox. Around that time he also stayed in a temple by the grace of his cousin, Yi Hak-Su. It was a time of meditation and refuge for him. There he worked on his spiritual journey, although he never wore a monk s robe. He accumulated as many experiences as he could, and then he decided to pursue further education. Chang-Wuk Kang, M.D. translates these works beautifully, richly capturing the essence of Yi Kwang-Su s style and the culture of Korea. He begins the compilation with a biographical summary of Yi Kwang-Su s life as well as his political influences and literary impact on Korea.

In that brutal summer, Vincent's beauty and precocity captivate two men: Marcel, thirty years his senior, a writer and celebrated socialite; and Arthur, the twenty-one year old son of one of the servants, who is now a soldier at the front. As both relationships develop Vincent intuitively tries to keep his passions separate, but over the weeks of indolent Parisian summer and far-off war, confidences are made, absences endured, secrets revealed.

Moving back and forth across three sections, between today's Delhi and the 1970s, '80s, and '90s in turn, the novel tells the story of a family held at the mercy of the times. A masterful interrogation of the relationships between past and present and among individual lives, events, and culture, Aatish Taseer's The Way Things Were takes its title from the Sanskrit word for history, itihasa, whose literal translation is \\"the way things indeed were.\\" Told in prose that is at once intimate and panoramic, and threaded through with Sanskrit as central metaphor and chorus, this is a hugely ambitious and important book, alive to all the commotion of the last forty years but never losing its brilliant grasp on the current moment.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vmXhBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Girl with Glasses: My Optic History","description":"Being a Girl with Glasses isn't just a style choice; it's a way of life.

Marissa Walsh has worn glasses since third grade. Now -- ten pairs of glasses, one pair of prescription sunglasses, and endless pairs of contacts later -- she has fully embraced her four-eyed fate. As she recounts her optic history through the lenses of each pair of glasses -- from the Sergio Valentes and the Sally Jessy Raphaels to the pseudo John Lennons and the dreaded health plan specs -- at last she found them . . . the perfect pair. Marissa's comic look at a life behind glass is at once a poignant personal journey and a wry, canny exploration of just what it means to be a glasses-wearing kind of girl.

As aide-de-camp to Brigadier General George Crook, he had an insider's view of the early Apache campaigns, the Great Sioux War, the Cheyenne Outbreak, and the Geronimo War. Bourke's writings reveal much about military life on the western frontier, but he also was a noted ethnologist, writing extensive descriptions of American Indian civilization and illustrating his diaries with sketches and photographs. Previously, researchers could consult only a small part of Bourke s diary material in various publications, or else take a research trip to the archive and microfilm housed at West Point. Now, for the first time, the 124 manuscript volumes of the Bourke diaries are being compiled, edited, and annotated by Charles M. Robinson III in an easily accessible form to the modern researcher. This fifth volume opens at Fort Wingate as Bourke prepares to visit the Navajos. Next, at the Pine River Agency, he is witness to the Sun Dance, where despite his discomfort at what he saw, he noted that during the Sun Dance piles of food and clothing were contributed by the Indians themselves, to relieve the poor among their people. Bourke continued his travels among the Zunis, the Rio Grande pueblos, and finally, with the Hopis to attend the Hopi Snake dance. The volume concludes at Fort Apache, Arizona, which is stirring with excitement over the activities of the Apache medicine man, Nakai -dokli ni, which Bourke spelled Na Kay do Klinni. This would erupt into bloodshed less than a week later. Volume Five is especially important because it is the first in this series to deal almost exclusively with Bourke s ethnological research. Aside from a brief trip to the East Coast, most of the text involves his observations either during the Great Oglala Sun Dance of 1881, or among the pueblos of New Mexico and Arizona. Bourke s account of the Sun Dance is particularly significant because it was the last one held by the Oglalas. The Hopi material in this volume served as the basis of The Snake Dance of the Moquis of Arizona, published three years later in 1884, and perhaps his best-known work after On the Border with Crook. Extensively annotated and with a biographical appendix on Indians, civilians, and military personnel named in the diaries, this book will appeal to western and military historians, students of American Indian life and culture, and to anyone interested in the development of the American West.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uTxaAQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Exploring New York State","description":"Nathan Sawaya is renowned for his incredible, sometimes surreal, sculptures and portraits all made from LEGO bricks.

Racial imagery and racial representation are central to the organisation of the contemporary world but, while there are many studies of images of black and Asian people, whiteness is an invisible racial position. At the level of racial representation, whites are not of a certain race. They are just the human race, a 'colour' against which other ethnicities are always examined. In White, Richard Dyer looks beyond the apparent unremarkability of whiteness and argues for the importance of analysing images of white people. Dyer traces the representation of whiteness by whites in Western visual culture, focusing on the mass media of photography, advertising, fine art, cinema and television. Dyer examines the representation of whiteness and the white body in the contexts of Christianity, 'race' and colonialism. In a series of absorbing case studies, he discusses the representations of whiteness in muscle-man action cinema, from Italian 'peplum' movies to the Tarzan and Rambo series; shows the construction of whiteness in photography and cinema in the lighting of white and black faces, and analyses the representation of white women in end-of-empire fictions such as The Jewel in the Crown, and traces the disturbing association of whiteness with death, in vampire narratives and dystopian films such as Blade Runner and the Aliens trilogy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4XiMAQAAQBAJ&dq=White:+Essays+on+Race+and+Culture&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rhythms","description":"From USA Today & Wall Street Journal Bestselling Author!

Since its first appearance in 1956 there have been eight editions as well as translations from the original Russian into Ukrainian, Estonian, Lettish, and Lithuanian. Almost a million copies of the Russian version alone have been sold. Part of the reason for the book's success is its marvelously varied assortment of brainteasers ranging from simple \\"catch\\" riddles to difficult problems (none, however, requiring advanced mathematics). Many of the puzzles will be new to Western readers, while some familiar problems have been clothed in new forms. Often the puzzles are presented in the form of charming stories that provide non-Russian readers with valuable insights into contemporary Russian life and customs. In addition, Martin Gardner, former editor of the Mathematical Games Department, Scientific American, has clarified and simplified the book to make it as easy as possible for an English-reading public to understand and enjoy. He has been careful, moreover, to retain nearly all the freshness, warmth, and humor of the original. Lavishly illustrated with over 400 clear diagrams and amusing sketches, this inexpensive edition of the first English translation will offer weeks or even months of stimulating entertainment. It belongs in the library of every puzzlist or lover of recreational mathematics.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7fipBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Seven Ages","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gngLAAAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Month-By-Month Gardening in the Mid-Atlantic","description":"The only guide with month-by-month advice about caring for your Mid-Atlantic garden.

Attendance is down, and it is increasingly difficult to distinguish so-called \\"believers\\" from their non-Christian neighbors-all because the gospel of grace has been neglected. In this work, now in paperback, the late James Montgomery Boice identifies what's happened within evangelicalism and suggests how the confessional statements of the Reformation-Scripture alone, Christ alone, grace alone, faith alone, and glory to God alone-can ignite full-scale revival. \\"A church without these convictions has ceased to be a true church, whatever else it may be,\\" he wrote, but \\"if we hold to these doctrines, our churches and those we influence will grow strong.\\"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eMxtZMIqHVoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Art of Watching Films","description":"With an emphasis on the narrative film, The Art of Watching Films challenges students to take their film experience further by sharpening their powers of observation, developing the skills and habits of perceptive watching, and discovering complex aspects of film art that they might otherwise overlook.

Madison and Judicial Review","description":"We take for granted today the tremendous power of the Supreme Court to interpret our laws and overrule any found in conflict with the Constitution. Yet our nation was a quarter-century old before that power of \\"judicial review\\" was fully articulated by the Court itself in Marbury v. Madison (1803). William Nelson's concise study of that landmark case provides an insightful and readable guide for students and general readers alike. On the surface, the case itself seems a minor one at best. William Marbury, a last-minute judicial appointee of outgoing Federalist president John Adams, demanded redress from the Supreme Court when his commission was not delivered. But Chief Justice John Marshall could clearly see the danger his demand posed for a weak court filled with Federalist judges. Wary of the Court's standing with the new Republican administration of Thomas Jefferson, Marshall hit upon a solution that was both principled and pragmatic. He determined that while Marbury was justified in his suit, the law on which his claim was based was in conflict with the Constitution. It was the first time that the Court struck down an act of Congress as unconstitutional, thus establishing the doctrine of judicial review, which designates the Court as chief interpreter of the Constitution. Nelson relates the story behind Marbury and explains why it is a foundational case for understanding the Supreme Court. He reveals how Marshall deftly avoided a dangerous political confrontation between the executive and judicial branches by upholding the rule of law. He also shows how Marshall managed to shore up the Court's prestige and power rather than have it serve partisan political agendas. Nelson clarifies how the Marshall court sought to preserve what was best in eighteenth-century constitutionalism while accommodating nineteenth-century political realities and also traces the gradual transformation of Marbury-style judicial review since Marshall's time. Although the Supreme Court did not assert its power of judicial review for another fifty-four years after Marbury, it has since then invalidated numerous acts of Congress. From Marshall's modest bid for consensus to what some consider the modern Court's \\"activist\\" excesses, judicial review has been a cornerstone in the edifice of the federal judiciary. Nelson's analysis helps us better understand how this fundamental principle emerged and why it still matters.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6baQAAAAMAAJ&dq=Marbury+V.+Madison+and+Judicial+Review&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The last nine days of the Bismarck.","description":"A fictional account of the German battleship Bismarck's destruction by the Royal Navy after it breaks into the Atlantic as a major threat to the convoys that sustained Britain in the early days of World War II.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WKIizQEACAAJ&dq=The+last+nine+days+of+the+Bismarck.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Prologue to Analog","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=p9M2AAAAIAAJ&dq=Prologue+to+Analog&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"AMG Concise Bible Doctrines (AMG Concise Series)","description":"\\"Concise Bible Doctrines\\" is written for the average Christian--the contemporary Bible student--not the theologian.

Harkey served as a New Mexico peace officer from 1893 until 1911. Among the many cattle rustlers, train robbers, and other outlaws he confronted were Jim Miller, whom Harkey fingers as Pat Garrett s real killer, and the Dalton Gang. Harkey observes that, in 1948,  cattle stealing has gone out of fashion. We ve gotten civilized.

Who wants to go to college? I'd just end up gettin' a shitty job anyway.  So said Freddie Piniella, an eleven-year-old boy from Clarendon Heights low-income housing project, to Jay MacLeod, his counselor in a youth program. MacLeod was struck by the seeming self-defeatism of Freddie and his friends. How is it that in America, a nation of dreams and opportunities, a boy of eleven can feel trapped in a position of inherited poverty?The author immersed himself in the teenage underworld of Clarendon Heights. The Hallway Hangers, one of the neighborhood cliques, appear as cynical self-destructive hoodlums. The other group, the Brothers, take the American Dream to heart and aspire to middle-class respectability. The twist is that the Hallway Hangers are mostly white; the Brothers are almost all black. Comparing the two groups, MacLeod provides a provocative account of how poverty is perpetuated from one generation to the next.Part One tells the story of the boys' teenage aspirations. Part Two follows the Hallway Hangers and the Brothers into adulthood. Eight years later the author returns to Clarendon Heights to find the members of both gangs struggling in the labor market or on the streets. Caught in the web of urban industrial decline, the Hallway Hangers undereducated, unemployed, or imprisoned have turned to the underground economy. But  cocaine capitalism  only fuels their desperation, and the Hallway Hangers seek solace in sexism and racism. The ambitious Brothers have fared little better. Their teenage dreams in tatters, the Brothers demonstrate that racism takes its toll on optimistic aspirations.This edition retains the vivid accounts of friendships, families, school, and work that made the first edition so popular. The ethnography resonates with feeling and vivid dialogue. But the book also addresses one of the most important issues in modern social theory and policy: how social inequality is reproduced from one generation to the next. MacLeod links individual lives with social theory to forge a powerful argument about how inequality is created, sustained, and accepted in the United States.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-m47swEACAAJ&dq=Ain%27t+No+Makin%27+It:+Aspirations+And+Attainment+In+A+Low-income+Neighborhood,+Expanded+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Arthurian legends: An illustrated anthology","description":"No descriptive material is available for this title.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JDnYAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Arthurian+legends:+An+illustrated+anthology&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"South Riding","description":" South Riding  is a 1936 novel by Winifred Holtby, published posthumously.

Difficulty of subject matter and unfamiliarity with the literary forms, however, deter many students. 'Back Toward the Future' removes these obstacles and invites exploration of this exciting subject. The author, a respected expert in the field, presents an introductory guide to the issues and methods of interpreting prophetic literature. The principles he formulates, coupled with his mature insights, will help students avoid many exegetical pitfalls. Part I helps the reader to discern conditional and unconditional prophecies, comprehend apocalyptic symbols, and understand future events in expressions of the past. Part 2 provides specific steps for interpreting prophetic passages. And Part 3 discourages Bible students from finding double meanings in prophetic statements and encourages them to embrace the author's single-truth intention. A Scripture index concludes 'Back Toward the Future'.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=312vCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"State of the Union: A Novel","description":"From the New York Times bestselling author of Leaving the World comes the compelling story of a woman whose one choice, made decades ago, comes back to haunt her. America in the 1960s was an era of radical upheavalof civil rights protests and anti-war marches; of sexual liberation and hallucinogenic drugs. More tellingly, it was a time when you weren t supposed to trust anyone over the age of thirty; when, if you were young, you rebelled against your parents and their conservative values. But not Hannah Buchan. Hannah is a great disappointment to her famous radical father and painter mother. Instead of mounting the barricades and embracing this age of profound social change, she wants nothing more than to marry her doctor boyfriend and raise a family in a small town. Hannah gets her wish. But once installed as the doctor s wife in a nowhere corner of Maine, boredom sets in... until an unforeseen moment of personal rebellion changes everything. Especially as Hannah is forced into breaking the law. For decades, this one transgression in an otherwise faultless life remains buried. But then, in the charged atmosphere of America after 9/11, her secret comes out and her life goes into freefall.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UA5Y09p9zcgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Writing Workbook for the New SAT (Barron's SAT Writing Workbook)","description":"This thoroughly revised edition of Barron s Writing Workbook for the New SAT prepares students for the writing sections of the newly redesigned SAT: The SAT Writing and Language Test and The SAT Essay.

Fear of the void, terror of heights: everyone knows what acrophobia is, and many suffer from it. Before Freud, the so-called  sciences of the mind  reserved a place of honor for vertigo in the domain of mental pathologies. The fear of falling which is also the fear of giving in to the temptation to let oneself fall has long been understood as a destabilizing yet intoxicating element without which consciousness itself was inconceivable. Some went so far as to induce it in patients through frightening rotational therapies. In a less cruel but no less radical way, vertigo also staked its claim in philosophy. If Montaigne and Pascal could still consider it a perturbation of reason and a trick of the imagination which had to be subdued, subsequent thinkers stopped considering it an occasional imaginative instability to be overcome. It came, rather, to be seen as intrinsic to reason, such that identity manifests itself as tottering, kinetic, opaque and, indeed, vertiginous. Andrea Cavalletti s stunning book sets this critique of stable consciousness beside one of Hitchcock s most famous thrillers, a drama of identity and its abysses. Hitchcock s brilliant combination of a dolly and a zoom to recreate the effect of falling describes that double movement of  pushing away and bringing closer  which is the habitual condition of the subject and of intersubjectivity. To reach myself, I must see myself from the bottom of the abyss, with the eyes of another. Only then does my  here  flee down there and, from there, attract me. From classical medicine and from the role of imagination in our biopolitical world to the very heart of philosophy, from Hollywood to Heidegger s  being-toward-death,  Cavalletti brings out the vertiginous nature of identity.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SG5WEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"One Stop Short of Barking","description":"From bizarre drivers' announcements, the new relaxed rules for buskers and timetables that exist only in the imagination, this book unearths the secrets, the eccentricities, the history and the survival tips of the London Underground.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FUBGAAAAYAAJ&dq=One+Stop+Short+of+Barking&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","description":"Financial journalist Rebecca Bloomwood seeks solace from the boredom and pressures in life with her shopping, a solution that brings her close to financial disaster, until she encounters a story that will change her life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Pw_p7-exjX0C&dq=Shopaholic&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"World Press Photo 1998","description":"For more than 50 years, an international jury has met under the auspices of the World Press Photo Foundation to choose the world's finest photographs.

Tracy K. Smith, Pulitzer Prize winner and U.S. Poet Laureate The winner of the NBCC Award for Poetry offers up a spirited collection of short lyric essays, written daily over a tumultuous year, reminding us of the purpose and pleasure of praising, extolling, and celebrating ordinary wonders. Ross Gay s The Book of Delights is a genre-defying book of essays some as short as a paragraph; some as long as five pages that record the small joys that occurred in one year, from birthday to birthday, and that we often overlook in our busy lives. His is a meditation on delight that takes a clear-eyed view of the complexities, even the terrors, in his life, including living in America as a black man; the ecological and psychic violence of our consumer culture; the loss of those he loves. Among Gay s funny, poetic, philosophical delights: the way Botan Rice Candy wrappers melt in your mouth, the volunteer crossing guard with a pronounced tremor whom he imagines as a kind of boat-woman escorting pedestrians across the River Styx, a friend s unabashed use of air quotes, pickup basketball games, the silent nod of acknowledgment between black people. And more than any other subject, Gay celebrates the beauty of the natural world his garden, the flowers in the sidewalk, the birds, the bees, the mushrooms, the trees. This is not a book of how-to or inspiration, though it could be read that way. Fans of Roxane Gay, Maggie Nelson, and Kiese Laymon will revel in Gay s voice, and his insights. The Book of Delights is about our connection to the world, to each other, and the rewards that come from a life closely observed. Gay s pieces serve as a powerful and necessary reminder that we can, and should, stake out a space in our lives for delight.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=p_x1DwAAQBAJ&dq=M.D.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The first part of King Henry the Fourth (The Laurel Shakespeare)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gyPPAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+first+part+of+King+Henry+the+Fourth+(The+Laurel+Shakespeare)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dante Philomythes and Philosopher: Man in the Cosmos","description":"This book is devoted to a full and lucid exposition of Boyde's ideas. In the first two parts, the author presents a systematic account of the universe as Dante accepted it, and explains the processes of 'creation' and 'generation' as they operate in the non-human parts of the cosmos. Dr Boyde then shows how the two processes combine in Dante's theory of human embryology, and how this combination affects the issues of love, choice and freedom. The third and last part of the book consolidates these expository sections with a generous selection of quotations from Dante's authorities and from his own works in prose. At the same time, the book offers far more than a clear account of Dante's cosmology and anthropology. Dr Boyde is interested in Dante's ideas in so far as they inspired and gave shape to the Divine Comedy. Furthermore, in every chapter he demonstrates how the relevant concepts and habits of thought were transmuted into imagery, symbolism, and dramatic scenes, or simply transformed by the energy and concision of Dante's poetic style.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=p2LjElkUqE8C&dq=Dante+Philomythes+and+Philosopher:+Man+in+the+Cosmos&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Select Bibliography of Music in Africa","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4nBkmgEACAAJ&dq=A+Select+Bibliography+of+Music+in+Africa&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Job and The Mystery of Suffering","description":"Richard Rohr, internationally known retreat leader, speaker and writer, plumbs the depths of the Job's story and its relevance for us today.

In this, her third volume, Snow continues to mine the language to its most mysterious depths and to explore the possibilities its meanings and mechanics hold for definition, transformation, and emotional truth. These poems place us before, and in, language--as we stand before, and in, the world. The Seventy Prepositions comprises three suites of poems. The first, \\"Vocabulary Sentences,\\" reflects on words and reality by taking as a formal motif the sort of sentences used to test vocabulary skills in elementary school. The poems of the second suite, \\"Vantage,\\" gather loosely around questions of perspective and perception. The closing suite finds its inspiration in the Japanese dry-landscape gardens known as karesansui, such as the famous rock garden at Ryoan-ji Temple in Kyoto.

Something has happened to Peach. Staggering around the town streets in the aftermath of an assault, Peach feels a trickle of blood down her legs, a lingering smell of her anonymous attacker on her skin. It hurts to walk, but she manages to make her way to her home, where she stumbles into another oddly nightmarish reality: Her parents can't seem to comprehend that anything has happened to their daughter. The next morning, Peach tries to return to the routines of her ordinary life, going to classes, spending time with her boyfriend, Green, trying to find comfort in the thought of her upcoming departure for college. And yet, as Peach struggles through the next few days, she is stalked by the memories of her unacknowledged trauma. Sleeping is hard when she is haunted by the glimpses of that stranger's gaping mouth. Working is hard when her assailant's rancid smell still fills her nostrils. Eating is impossible when her stomach is swollen tight as a drum. Though she tries to close her eyes to what has happened, Peach at last begins to understand the drastic, gruesome action she must take. In this astonishing debut, Emma Glass articulates the unspeakable with breathtaking verve. Intensely physical, with rhythmic, visceral prose, Peach marks the arrival of a visionary new voice.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iYY9DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Hungry Ghosts","description":"From bestselling author Gabor Mat , the essential resource for understanding the roots and behaviors of addiction--now with an added introduction by the author. Based on Gabor Mat  s two decades of experience as a medical doctor and his groundbreaking work with the severely addicted on Vancouver s skid row, In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts radically reenvisions this much misunderstood field by taking a holistic approach. Dr. Mat  presents addiction not as a discrete phenomenon confined to an unfortunate or weak-willed few, but as a continuum that runs throughout (and perhaps underpins) our society; not a medical \\"condition\\" distinct from the lives it affects, rather the result of a complex interplay among personal history, emotional, and neurological development, brain chemistry, and the drugs (and behaviors) of addiction. Simplifying a wide array of brain and addiction research findings from around the globe, the book avoids glib self-help remedies, instead promoting a thorough and compassionate self-understanding as the first key to healing and wellness. In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts argues persuasively against contemporary health, social, and criminal justice policies toward addiction and those impacted by it. The mix of personal stories including the author s candid discussion of his own \\"high-status\\" addictive tendencies and science with positive solutions makes the book equally useful for lay readers and professionals.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Oew75Hp8XP4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"HIST MODERN TASTE (The English landscape garden)","description":"Walpole captured the attention of his 18th-century audience with his memorable turns of phrase and, more importantly, for his claim that England had invented a modern and \\"natural\\" style of laying out gardens - a style that was, indeed, the culmination of garden design.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DXVRAAAAMAAJ&dq=HIST+MODERN+TASTE+(The+English+landscape+garden)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"NULATO AN INDIAN LIFE ON THE YUKON [Hardcover] (Author Signed)","description":" I owe Alaska. It gave me everything I have.  Says Sidney Huntington, son of an Athapaskan mother and white trader/trapper father. Growing up on the Koyukuk River in Alaska s harsh Interior, that  everything  spans 78 years of tragedies and adventures. When his mother died suddenly, 5-year-old Huntington protected and cared for his younger brother and sister during two weeks of isolation. Later, as a teenager, he plied the wilderness traplines with his father, nearly freezing to death several times. One spring, he watched an ice-filled breakup flood sweep his family s cabin and belongings away. These and many other episodes are the compelling background for the story of a man who learned the lessons of a land and culture, lessons that enabled him to prosper as trapper, boat builder, and fisherman. This is more than one man's incredible tale of hardship and success in Alaska. It is also a tribute to the Athapaskan traditions and spiritual beliefs that enabled him and his ancestors to survive. His story, simply told, is a testament to the durability of Alaska's wild lands and to the strength of the people who inhabit them.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Ny7tBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Anne Of Avonlea","description":"One can't get over the habit of being a little girl all at once.

From a single-wide trailer in the mountains of rural West Virginia to the halls of Yale Law School, Mary Marantz's story is one of remembering our roots while turning our faces to the sky. From growing up in that trailer, where it rained just as hard inside as out and the smell of mildew hung thick in the air, Mary has known what it is to feel broken and disqualified because of the muddy scars leaving smudged fingerprints across our lives. Generations of her family lived and logged in those hauntingly treacherous woods, risking life and limb just to barely scrape by. And yet that very struggle became the redemption song God used to write a life she never dreamed of. Mixed with warmth, wit, and the bittersweet, sometimes achingly heartbreaking places we go when we dig in instead of give up, Dirt is a story of healing. With gut-wrenching honesty and hard-won wisdom, Mary shares her story for anyone who has ever walked into the world and felt like their scars were still on display, showing that you are braver, better, and more empathetic for what you have survived. Because God does his best work in the muddy, messy, and broken--if we'll only learn to dig in.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=g-vfDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pro Apache Log4j","description":"* Illustrates each concept with code samples in Java language; provides guidelines for different application-specific needs. * Describes the techniques to distribute the logging activity critical to implement in an enterprise-wide logging framework. * The only Java Logging book on the market, and includes Best Practices guidelines.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HdGjzQEACAAJ&dq=Pro+Apache+Log4j&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Good Carbs, Bad Carbs: An Indispensable Guide to Eating the Right Carbs for Losing Weight and Optimum Health","description":"An accessible guide to carbohydrates distinquishes between healthy and unhealthy carbs, listing the health benefits of each and offering advice on how to avoid the worst offenders.

The book ended with the hope that new forms of social connection might be invented in order to revive our communities. In Better Together, Putnam and longtime civic activist Lewis Feldstein describe some of the diverse locations and most compelling ways in which civic renewal is taking place today. In response to civic crises and local problems, they say, hardworking, committed people are reweaving the social fabric all across America, often in innovative ways that may turn out to be appropriate for the twenty-first century. Better Together is a book of stories about people who are building communities to solve specific problems. The examples Putnam and Feldstein describe span the country from big cities such as Philadelphia, San Francisco, and Chicago to the Los Angeles suburbs, small Mississippi and Wisconsin towns, and quiet rural areas. The projects range from the strictly local to that of the men and women of UPS, who cover the nation. Bowling Alone looked at America from a broad and general perspective. Better Together takes us into Catherine Flannery's Roxbury, Massachusetts, living room, a UPS loading dock in Greensboro, North Carolina, a Philadelphia classroom, the Portsmouth, New Hampshire, naval shipyard, and a Bay Area Web site. We meet activists driven by their visions, each of whom has chosen to succeed by building community: Mexican Americans in the Rio Grande Valley who want paved roads, running water, and decent schools; Harvard University clerical workers searching for respect and improved working conditions; Waupun, Wisconsin, schoolchildren organizing to improve safety at a local railroad crossing; and merchants in Tupelo, Mississippi, joining with farmers to improve their economic status. As the stories in Better Together demonstrate, bringing people together by building on personal relationships remains one of the most effective strategies to enhance America's social health.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qledfXzFImcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"La mitologia/ Mythology (Spanish Edition)","description":"Myths are the timeless expression of the imagination born out of the need to make sense of the universe.

Together, they have produced a cinema whose expressions of queer desire have challenged the region s conservative religious and family values, while intervening in vital debates about politics, history, and nation. Iberian Queer Cinema is a unique collection that offers in-depth analyses of fifteen different films, each by a different director, produced in the region over the past fifty years, from Narciso Ib ?ez Serrador s La residencia (The House That Screamed, 1970) to Jo?o Pedro Rodrigues  O ornit logo (The Ornithologist, 2016). Together, they show how queer Iberian cinema has responded to historical traumas ranging from the AIDS crisis to the repressive and homophobic Franco regime. Yet they also explore how these films gesture towards a more fluid understanding of sexuality, gender, and national identity. This book will thus give readers a new appreciation for both the cultural diversity of Iberia and the richness of its moving and thought-provoking queer cinema.

How can you help your company solve a problem in just a few days that's been plaguing managers for three months? How can you bring a room of executives to a consensus on a critical decision that the CEO and his committee have been wrestling with for years? Of course, this is easier said than done. Indeed, not a week goes by without a major business media story about a company that has fallen on hard times and an executive that has resigned for \\"personal reasons.\\" The root of the failure is usually ineffective decision-making processes, and ultimately, bad decisions. In The Thinking Manager's Toolbox, veteran consultant and renowned business thinker William J. Altier cogently presents the underpinnings of successful thinking processes and their applications, drawing on practical, real-world experiences. The first section explores the fundamentals of thinking, change, and the critical role that sound thinking processes play in effective problem solving. The second section, your basic toolbox, develops five, in-depth fundamental thinking processes.

If the writer is Nora Ephron, the answer is a resounding yes.

Seven months into her pregnancy, Rachel Samstat discovers that her husband, Mark, is in love with another woman. The fact that the other woman has \\"a neck as long as an arm and a nose as long as a thumb and you should see her legs\\" is no consolation.

Charlotte Vale a timeless and very sophisticated Cinderella.   Patricia Gaffney, New York Times bestselling author  Don t let s ask for the moon! We have the stars!  The film Now, Voyager concludes with these famous words, which reaffirmed Bette Davis s own stardom and changed the way Americans smoked cigarettes. But few fans of this rich story know its source. Olive Higgins Prouty s 1941 novel provides a rich, complex portrait of the inner life of its protagonist and the society she inhabits. Over half a century later, it still offers fresh and quietly radical takes on psychiatric treatment, traditional family life, female desire, and women s agency. Boston blueblood Charlotte Vale has led an unhappy, sheltered life. Dowdy, repressed, and pushing forty, Charlotte finds salvation in the unlikely form of a nervous breakdown, placing her at a sanitarium, where she undergoes treatment to rebuild her ravaged self-esteem and uncover her true intelligence and charm. Femmes Fatales restores to print the best of women s writing in the classic pulp genres of the mid-20th century. From mystery to hard-boiled noir to taboo lesbian romance, these rediscovered queens of pulp offer subversive perspectives on a turbulent era.  Like the film it inspired, Olive Higgins Prouty s Now, Voyager is as striking for the conventions it bucks as for the ones it embraces: a vivid reminder of a time when people crossed the ocean in liners and wore hats, and a hymn to an American ideal of social, moral, and emotional independence.

It is generally unknown, even amongst theologians, that there was a long history of Christianity in Persia, India, Central Asia and China before the appearance on the scene of the first missionaries from the West. A systematic history of the Christian Church in Asia before 1500 is needed. Drawing on material hitherto unknown in the English speaking world, this is a timely and important book because there is a heightened interest today in the early forms of Asian Christianity. The Church in Asia today seeks to find forms of religious expression that are in harmony with Asian culture as was the case in the earlier period. The book covers the period up to 1500 CE. The geographical areas dealt with are Palestine, Syria, Mesopotamia, Persia, India, Central and South East Asia, China and Japan. The book takes into account the outward development of the Church in these areas as well as the inner, theological issues.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UGpr2KsbS94C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Encyclopedic dictionary of mathematics","description":"V.1.

It provides a complete map of the entire process beginning with how to get ideas about research, how to refine your research question and the actual design of the experiment, leading on to statistical procedure and assistance with writing up of results. While many books look at the fundamentals of doing successful experiments and include good coverage of statistical techniques, this book very importantly considers the process in chronological order with specific attention given to effective design in the context of likely methods needed and expected results. Without full assessment of these aspects, the experience and results may not end up being as positive as one might have hoped. Ample coverage is then also provided of statistical data analysis, a hazardous journey in itself, and the reporting of findings, with numerous examples and helpful tips of common downfalls throughout. Combining light humour, empathy with solid practical guidance to ensure a positive experience overall, Designing and Reporting Experiments will be essential reading for students in psychology and those in cognate disciplines with an experimental focus or content in research methods courses.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LN6QAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"On Our Own Terms: Race, Class, and Gender in the Lives of African-American Women","description":"This volume utilizes the cross-cultural, historical and ethnographic perspective of anthropology to illuminate the intrinsic connections of race, class and gender.

Katie, the narrator, has relocated to Missouri with her distant, occasionally abusive father, and she feels very much alone: her much-loved mother is dead; her new school is unaccepting of her; and her only friends fall far short of being ideal companions. When she accidentally falls through the ice while skating, she meets Jimmy. He is handsome, far older than she, and married, but she is entranced. As their relationship unfolds, so too does Katie's awareness of the pain and intensity first love can bring. Beautifully written in Berg's irresistible voice, Joy School portrays the soaring happiness of real love, the deep despair one can feel when it goes unrequited, and the stubbornness of hope that will not let us let go. Here also is recognition that love can come in many forms and offer many different things. Joy School illuminates, too, how the things that hurt the most can sometimes teach us the lessons that really matter. About Durable Goods, Elizabeth Berg's first novel, Andre Dubus said, \\"Elizabeth Berg writes with humor and a big heart about resilience, loneliness, love and hope. And the transcendence that redeems.\\" The same will be said of Joy School, Elizabeth Berg's most luminous novel to date.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=oG3DyKo4S6sC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ill Take Manhattan","description":"In the high-stakes world of magazine publishing, Judith Krantz weaves a dazzling tale of love and betrayal, and creates her most joyous character sensational Maxi, an uninhibited woman who unexpectedly discovers that her talent for life is matched by a hunger to succeed.

And yet as president he presided over a massive expansion of the slaveholding plantation system, particularly with the Louisiana Purchase, squeezing the yeomanry to the fringes and to less desirable farmland. Now Roger G. Kennedy conducts an eye-opening examination of the gap between Jefferson's stated aspirations and what actually happened. Kennedy reveals how the Louisiana Purchase had a major impact on land use and the growth of slavery. He examines the great financial interests (such as the powerful land companies that speculated in new territories and the British textile interests) that beat down slavery's many opponents in the South itself (Native Americans, African Americans, Appalachian farmers, and conscientious opponents of slavery). He describes how slaveholders' cash crops--first tobacco, then cotton--sickened the soil and how the planters moved from one desolated tract to the next. Soon the dominant culture of the entire region--from Maryland to Florida, from Carolina to Texas--was that of owners and slaves producing staple crops for international markets. The earth itself was impoverished, in many places beyond redemption. None of this, Kennedy argues, was inevitable. He focuses on the character, ideas, and ambitions of Thomas Jefferson to show how he and other Southerners struggled with the moral dilemmas presented by the presence of Indian farmers on land they coveted, by the enslavement of their workforce, by the betrayal of their stated hopes, and by the manifest damage being done to the earth itself. Jefferson emerges as a tragic figure in a tragic period. Mr. Jefferson's Lost Cause was a CHOICE Outstanding Academic Title for 2003.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mHw8DwAAQBAJ&dq=Mr.+Jefferson%27s+Lost+Cause:+Land,+Farmers,+Slavery,+and+the+Louisiana+Purchase&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Asimov's Chronology of the World","description":"From the world's greatest science writer, a history of the world from the Big Bang to 1945, told in irresistible short takes and highlighted by a timeline.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=trSMQgAACAAJ&dq=Asimov%27s+Chronology+of+the+World&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Picture Book of Thomas Alva Edison (Picture Book Biography)","description":"His inventions included the phonograph, light bulb, and movie camera.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=udZ5wluB4IkC&dq=A+Picture+Book+of+Thomas+Alva+Edison+(Picture+Book+Biography)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Dream Planner: Inspired by the Dream Giver","description":"Your Big Dream is surging within your heart, ready to carry you to heights you never dreamed possible.

Lewis S A Preface To Paradise Lost Has Remained And Continues To Remain An Indispensable Introductory Book For The Study Of Paradise Lost. Very Briefly, But With Remarkable Clarity And Precision, Lewis Touches On All The Important Aspects Of Paradise Lost: Form And Technique, Structure And Texture, Theological Disputes And Characterization Etc. Lewis Believes That A Poem Is A Public Activity Through Which The Poet Intends To Move His Readers. It Is, Therefore, Extremely Important To Know The Intention Of The Poet, To Know What The Poem Is, What It Was Intended To Do And How It Is Meant To Be Used. Accordingly, Lewis Tries To Identify The Originally Intended Meaning Of The Poem In Order To Help The Reader To Have An Access To Milton S Intentions. In The Process, The Elizabethan World Order, The Contemporary Theological Issues, The Differences Between De Doctrina And Paradise Lost, Critical Opinions On Milton S Style, Diction And Characterizations Particularly Satan, Eve, The Angels And Satan S Followers , Are All Brought To Bear On His Discussions In The Preface.

This book helps professionals master public speaking in a technical or scientific environment, whether it be through traditional presentations with whiteboards and flipcharts or presentations with computer software such as PowerPoint. Unlike most general speech texts, which include examples from various disciplines, Oral Presentations uses specific examples from the fields of science and technology and shows how skilled technical communicators make complex information accessible to non-technical audiences. The first three parts of the book focus on basic skills and concepts, including four basic types of presentations relevant to technical communication. The last two parts introduce more advanced topics, such as legal, privacy, and censorship issues, and the changing nature of presentations in the digital age. Oral Presentations thus brings together the best, most current instruction from three fields: technical communication/rhetoric, speech communication, and computer and information technology. For professionals in public speaking, oral presentations, and technical communication.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gWJRAAAAMAAJ&dq=Oral+Presentations+for+Technical+Communication:+(Part+of+the+Allyn&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beneath the Wheel","description":"Hans Giebernath lives among the dull and respectable townsfolk of a sleepy Black Forest village.

Booklist Stories of passion, courage, and commitment, following individuals as they pursue the work they were born to do, from StoryCorps founder Dave Isay In Callings, StoryCorps founder Dave Isay presents unforgettable stories from people doing what they love. Some found their paths at a very young age, others later in life; some overcame great odds or upturned their lives in order to pursue what matters to them. Many of their stories have never been broadcast or published by StoryCorps until now. We meet a man from the barrios of Texas whose harrowing experiences in a family of migrant farmers inspired him to become a public defender. We meet a longtime waitress who takes pride in making regulars and newcomers alike feel at home in her Nashville diner. We meet a young man on the South Side of Chicago who became a teacher in order to help at-risk teenagers like the ones who killed his father get on the right track. We meet a woman from Little Rock who helps former inmates gain the skills and confidence they need to rejoin the workforce. Together they demonstrate how work can be about much more than just making a living, that chasing dreams and finding inspiration in unexpected places can transform a vocation into a calling. Their shared sense of passion, honor, and commitment brings deeper meaning and satisfaction to every aspect of their lives. An essential contribution to the beloved StoryCorps collection, Callings is an inspiring tribute to rewarding work and the American pursuit of happiness.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SPplDgAAQBAJ&dq=The+Callings&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Choosing to Cheat: Who Wins When Family and Work Collide?","description":"Citing the challenges faced by modern families to balance the demands of a busy schedule, a guide by the author of The Seven Checkpoints offers advice on where to compromise and urges readers to place their families first.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yxRGPQAACAAJ&dq=Choosing+to+Cheat:+Who+Wins+When+Family+and+Work+Collide%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pax Draconis RPG","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QKGX7Em4R9kC&dq=Pax+Draconis+RPG&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Toolbox for Humanity: More than 9000 Years of Thought","description":"Compiled and arranged by Lloyd Albert Johnson, A Toolbox for Humanity is a review of human thoughts and ideas.

He then began an extraordinary rise from farmboy outsider to the hallowed rank of captain of the Royal Navy, leading three historic journeys that would forever link his name with fearless exploration (and inspire pop-culture heroes like Captain Hook and Captain James T. Kirk). In Farther Than Any Man, noted modern-day adventurer Martin Dugard strips away the myth of Cook and instead portrays a complex, conflicted man of tremendous ambition (at times to a fault), intellect (though Cook was routinely underestimated) and sheer hardheadedness. When Great Britain announced a major circumnavigation in 1768 -- a mission cloaked in science, but aimed at the pursuit of world power -- it came as a political surprise that James Cook was given command. Cook's surveying skills had contributed to the British victory over France in the Seven Years' War in 1763, but no commoner had ever commanded a Royal Navy vessel. Endeavor's stunning three-year journey changed the face of modern exploration, charting the vast Pacific waters, the eastern coasts of New Zealand and Australia, and making landfall in Tahiti, Tierra del Fuego, and Rio de Janeiro. After returning home a hero, Cook yearned to get back to sea. He soon took control of the Resolution and returned to his beloved Pacific, in search of the elusive Southern Continent. It was on this trip that Cook's taste for power became an obsession, and his legendary kindness to island natives became an expectation of worship -- traits that would lead him first to greatness, then to catastrophe. Full of action, lush description, and fascinating historical characters like King George III and Master William Bligh, Dugard's gripping account of the life and gruesome demise of Capt. James Cook is a thrilling story of a discoverer hell-bent on traveling farther than any man.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=K_dfysxsSPIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I Spy Little Christmas","description":"Rhyming text invites young readers to find hidden objects in photographs of various Christmas items.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZEvWHAAACAAJ&dq=I+Spy+Little+Christmas&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The vegetable encyclopedia and the gardener's guide,","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=y9CBoAEACAAJ&dq=The+vegetable+encyclopedia+and+the+gardener%27s+guide,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Folded Leaf","description":"The Folded Leaf, first published in 1945, is a classic American coming-of-age novel.

The achievement is the revolutionary transplantation of a timeless spiritual culture from ancient India to twentieth-century America. This first of two volumes begins with the story of the events leading up to Srila Prabhupada's meeting his guru, an encounter that ignited in Srila Prabhupada a slowburning flame of desire to take Krishna consciousness to the Western world. His early life was a period of patient and transcendent determination as he prepared for a mission that would later be crowned with astounding success. In August and September of 1965 Srila Prabhupada traveled alone aboard a steamship from India to New York City, with no more than the equivalent of eight dollars in his pocket and no institutional backing, but with unshakable faith in Lord Krishna and the instructions of his spiritual master. It is the 1960s, an era in which the children of those who fought World War II were leading a sweeping revolt against a society losing its soul to godless mass consumerism. Into this milieu Srila Prabhupada brought a vision for a new kind of society, a society born of a radical transformation of human consciousness from materialism to the loftiest spiritual and ethical idealism. By 1967 he had arrived in San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury district, America's counter-culture capital, where he continued his work of calling America's youth to live up to their higher spiritual ideals and distributing the holy name of Krishna indiscriminately. By the end of the volume, we have seen Srila Prabhupada in England (meeting the Beatles), Holland, Japan, Africa, and finally back in India, where he triumphantly returned with his \\"dancing white elephants\\"  a group of his mostly Caucasian Western followers. The research team assembled by the author traveled throughout the world to gather thousands of hours of interviews with hundreds of people who knew Srila Prabhupada; diaries and memoirs from his students; and more than seven thousand of Srila Prabhupada's letters. Then the author and his team distilled this voluminous firsthand source material into a rich composite view of Srila Prabhupada, a dazzling and colorful picture of one of the most remarkable lives of our times.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=g_lhBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Everything Negotiating Book: Savvy Techniques For Getting What You Want --at Work And At Home (Everything (Business & Personal Finance))","description":"What's the one thing you can do to improve both your business and personal life?

It was never meant to be a book full of tormenting fear that would cause us to want to leave this world, but through the mind of Christ, we have access to our heavenly inheritance to live in our Christ identity today. The Bible is a book written by God and the formation of His family. When we believe and understand the revelation of Christ already in us, we are shaped into His image so that when others see us, they see their Heavenly Father. When Jesus said  It is finished,  was he just making a way for personal salvation with God, or was there a bigger picture? Have death and the judgment seat been appeased, or is there something more that we are required to do? John 14:12 says,  Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father.  For over two thousand years, the body of Christ has been like kings and lords hiding in a cave, waiting for a someday when they get to heaven to receive their inheritance as a son of God. When Jesus died, he gave us the ram's horn to declare that our jubilee is here now for us to receive. This book continues with the Holy Spirit s instructions for our spiritual process that must take place individually and then corporately in each child of God to walk in the authority and power as His son. What He created in spirit must come forth in the flesh with His image and likeness.

Nixon, the 37th President of the United States. This book was published in 1962. It recounts Nixon's recollections of six major political situations that required crisis management on his part. Why did Nixon write this book? Nixon was motivated to write this book in order to enhance his faltering public image which sorely needed enhancement. In 1962 Nixon was at a low point in his life, yet he was planning a political comeback. His efforts were successful because of the intensity of his will and his dogged determination. In just six years he became President of the United States and leader of the free world. Tragically in another six years his character flaws caused him to lose everything. His career started in 1946 when he was elected to the U.S. Congress and to the Senate four years later. President Eisenhower selected him to be Vice President in 1952. In 1960 he was doing well. Then in 1960, he lost the presidential election to John F. Kennedy. This blow seemed to end his public life. The next January, after his Vice Presidential term ended, he returned home to California. He intended to retire from politics and practice law.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MEH2jgEACAAJ&dq=Six+crises&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sequence (Reading tutorial series)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Home Hints And Tips","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LZ-P8pvlJqIC&dq=Home+Hints+And+Tips&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"On the Twelfth Day of Christmas (Zebra Regency Romance)","description":"Amidst the merry revelries of Twelfth Night, a former rake is reunited with a spirited beauty who once rejected his hand in marriage and tempts him to propose once more.

He anticipates the likely state and nationwide impact of the Hawaii Supreme Court's decision. Mark Strasser examines the issue of same-sex marriage in light of contemporary constitutional and domestic relations law, showing why the usual arguments against recognizing such unions are either weak or irrelevant. The Supreme Court has articulated numerous interests promoted by marriage, all of which apply to same-sex as well as opposite-sex couples. According to Strasser, the argument made most frequently to deny recognition to same-sex unions that marriage exists to provide a setting for the production and raising of children is in fact a reason to acknowledge such unions. The claim that marriage is for children biologically related to both parents is refuted in the case law, which treats biological and adopted children as legally indistinguishable. Strasser explains Baehr v. Lewin, the precedent setting case in Hawaii, and addresses the implications of state-by-state decisions to ban or recognize same-sex unions. He analyzes what it would mean to say that a policy violates the Equal Protection or Due Process Clauses of the Constitution, and compares biased polices that target gays and lesbians with those that victimize racial minorities. Strasser argues that the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) is both unconstitutional and a public policy disaster. It does not give states additional rights with respect to which marriages they need not recognize, Strasser explains, but only with respect which divorces they need not recognize. For example, DOMA seems to allow an individual to avoid a court-imposed duty to support an ex-spouse of the same sex simply by changing his or her domicile. Moreover, Strasser argues, DOMA is an open invitation for states to demand exceptions that will wreak havoc in domestic relations law. In a recent response to conservative arguments about marriage, Legally Wed explicates established and involving legal principles, and shows how invidiously these have been applied to the issues of gay rights in general and same-sex unions in particular.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TrdcDwAAQBAJ&dq=Legally+Wed:+Same-Sex+Marriage+and+the+Constitution&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Surprise on Wheels and Wings Over the Woodshed","description":"Wings over the woodshed: Patsy, Peter and Little Bill build an airplane and fly it over the woodshed and into a neighbor's tree to rescue a stranded cat.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=973pGwAACAAJ&dq=Surprise+on+Wheels+and+Wings+Over+the+Woodshed&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mots d'Heures: Gousses, Rames","description":"Nursery rhymes are rewritten in homophonic nonsense German and accompanied by satirical commentary","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=z8dkAAAAMAAJ&dq=Mots+d%27Heures:+Gousses,+Rames&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bears of Alaska","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Squadron","description":"Just fifteen years from now, the world is polarised along ethnic and religious lines.

She refused to speak the Arabic her mother and grandmother spoke at home. She rejected the peculiar food they ate in favor of hamburgers and beer. But when Benjamin had her own child a few years ago, she realized that she was losing her link to the past. In Last Days in Babylon, Benjamin delves into the story of her family's life among the Jews of Iraq in the first half of the twentieth century. When Iraq gained independence in 1932, Jews were the largest and most prosperous ethnic group in Baghdad. They dominated trade and finance, hobnobbed with Iraqi dignitaries, and lived in grandiose villas on the banks of the Tigris. Just twenty years later the community had been utterly ravaged, its members effectively expelled from the country by a hostile Iraqi government. Benjamin's grandmother Regina Sehayek lived through it all. Born in 1905, when Baghdad was still under Ottoman control, her childhood was a virtual idyll. This privileged existence was barely touched when the British marched into Iraq. But with the rise of Arab nationalism and the first stirrings of anti-Zionism, Regina, then a young mother, began to have dark premonitions of what was to come. By the time Iraq was galvanized by war, revolution, and regicide, Regina was already gone, her hair-raising escape a tragic exodus from a land she loved -- and a permanent departure from the husband whose gentle guiding hand had made her the woman she was. Benjamin's keen ear and fluid writing bring to life Regina's Baghdad, both good and bad. More than a stirring story of survival, Last Days in Babylon is a bittersweet portrait of Old World Baghdad and its colorful Jewish community, whose roots predate the birth of Islam by a thousand years and whose culture did much to make Iraq the peaceful desert paradise that has since become a distant memory. In 2004 Benjamin visited Baghdad for the first time, searching for the remains of its once vital Jewish community. What she discovered will haunt anyone who seeks to understand a country that continues to command the world's attention, just as it did when Regina Sehayek proudly walked through Baghdad's streets. By turns moving and funny, Last Days in Babylon is an adventure story, a riveting history, and a timely reminder that behind today's headlines are real people whose lives are caught -- too often tragically -- in the crossfire of misunderstanding, age-old prejudice, and geopolitical ambition.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=I75mOFyMdBUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"SLEEPING FIRES","description":"Set in the high-society of 1860s San Francisco,  Sleeping Fires  by famous feminist author Gertrude Atherton is a tale of love and resentment and an exploration of the moral and social standards of the time.

Bragg's work has been compared to that of Hardy and D.H. Lawrence, not without some justice. His smalltown people are closely and warmly observed, but without a shred of sentimentality, and although this story is familiar a man home from a dehumanizing war finds it hard to readjust it has seldom been imbued with such rueful humanity. For Sam, England after WWII, and after the sufferings he and his men endured in the frightful jungle campaigns, is stuffy and limiting; soon he starts dreaming of wider horizons. His adored wife, Ellen, however, is happily rooted in the little northern town where she grew up; their small son, Joe, who has hardly known his father, is bewitched but also terrified of him. How the family works out its fate in the shabby postwar years is Braggs story, and he makes of it something at once endearing and heroic. So many scenes, the regimental reunion, Joe's efforts to win friends among the tough town kids, a final scene at a railway station as heartrending as the movie Brief Encounter, linger in the mind. The book is a small classic, deeply touching and true.

Is it the thrill in the physical accomplishment, in managing to defy the odds, or both -- and why do they continue to do what they do in the face of such great danger? In On the Ridge Between Life and Death, David Roberts confronts these questions head-on as he recounts the exhilarating highs and desperate lows of his climbing career. By the time he was twenty-two, Roberts had already been involved in three fatal mountain climbing accidents and had escaped death himself by the sheerest of luck. And yet, as he acknowledges, few things have brought him more joy than climbing. In a famous essay on the subject written more than twenty years ago, Roberts judged climbing to be \\"worth the risk.\\" He continues to climb to this day, and several of his challenging routes in Alaska have never been climbed since. But in reassessing the emotional costs to himself and to loved ones, he reaches a different conclusion, one that is sure to cause controversy not only in climbing circles, but among adventurers of all kinds. Candid and unflinching, On the Ridge Between Life and Death is a compelling examination of the risks we take in order to feel more alive.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sDrmqv3aMSwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Rat","description":"A graphic description of the life of a rat journeying through a world controlled by modern human civilization and its struggles for survival becomes a metaphor about society and its laws, myths, and truths","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aUapyTwTa6QC&dq=The+Rat&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gilgamesh: A verse narrative","description":"Presents a verse narrative of the ancient Babylonian epic about love, death, loss, heroes, and friendship, including an historical essay on the original poem.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RB2mjl8wmnwC&dq=Gilgamesh:+A+verse+narrative&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Daughters and Mothers","description":"A rich and luminous novel about three generations of women in one family: the love they share, the dreams they refuse to surrender, and the secrets they hold Samantha is lost in the joys of new motherhood the softness of her eight-month-old daughter's skin, the lovely weight of her child in her arms but in trading her artistic dreams to care for her child, Sam worries she's lost something of herself.

Is an erotic novel by English novelist John Cleland first published in London in 1748. Written while the author was in debtors' prison in LondonBritish novel adapted into film. It is one of the most prosecuted erotic fiction novel and banned books in history. Frances \\"Fanny\\" Hill is a rich Englishwoman in her middle age, who leads a life of contentment with her loving husband Charles and their children. The novel consists of two long letters (which appear as volumes I and II of the original edition) addressed by Fanny to an unnamed acquaintance, who is only identified as 'Madam.' Fanny has been prevailed upon by the 'Madam' to recount the 'scandalous stages' of her earlier life, which she proceeds to do with 'stark naked truth' as her governing principle.Fanny's account begins with the loss of her parents at the age of 14 followed by a journey to London and ends with her union with Charles about five years later. The intermediate narrative is filled with many sexual experiences, which are described with vividness, whimsy, wit and humour. Metaphors and similes are used to describe sexual organs and activities. The plot was described as 'operatic' by John Hollander, who said that \\"the book's language and its protagonist's character are its greatest virtues.\\" The first letter begins with a short account of Fanny's impoverished childhood in a village in Lancashire. She loses her parents to smallpox, arrives in London to look for domestic work, and gets lured into a brothel.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=k3hfyQEACAAJ&dq=Fanny+Hill:+Memoirs+of+a+Woman+of+Pleasure+(Victorian+erotic+classics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Government in America: People, Politics and Policy with LP.com access card (10th Edition)","description":"The Basics of American Government is a collaborative effort among eight current and one former faculty members in the Departments of Political Science and Criminal Justice at University of North Georgia. The purpose of this book is to offer a no-frills, low-cost, yet comprehensive overview of the American political system for students taking introductory courses in American national government. Furthermore, the work combines the best aspects of both a traditional textbook and a reader in that most chapters offer a piece of original scholarship as a case study to bolster or reinforce the material presented in the chapter. In addition, many chapters present a civic engagement-type exercise and discussion questions intended to challenge, engage, and foster student participation in the political system. The authors undertook this project for several reasons, most notably the high costs of textbooks for students and the lack of college-level scholarship found in most American Government texts. This 375-page, peer-reviewed, edited book that combines traditional material with original scholarship will cost students $27.99, well below market standards.

This is the first volume of North Atlantic Books  updated paperback edition of Dale Pendell s Pharmako trilogy, an encyclopedic study of the history and uses of psychoactive plants and related synthetics first published between 1995 and 2005. The books form an interrelated suite of works that provide the reader with a unique, reliable, and often personal immersion in this medically, culturally, and spiritually fascinating subject. All three books are beautifully designed and illustrated, and are written with unparalleled authority, erudition, playfulness, and range. Pharmako/Poeia: Plant Powers, Poisons, and Herbcraft includes a new introduction by the author and as in previous editions focuses on familiar psychoactive plant-derived substances and related synthetics, ranging from the licit (tobacco, alcohol) to the illicit (cannabis, opium) and the exotic (absinthe, salvia divinorum, nitrous oxide). Each substance is explored in detail, not only with information on its history, pharmacology, preparation, and cultural and esoteric correspondences, but also the subtleties of each plant s effect on consciousness in a way that only poets can do. The whole concoction is sprinkled with abundant quotations from famous writers, creating a literary brew as intoxicating as its subject. The Pharmako series is continued in Pharmako/Dynamis (focusing on stimulants and empathogens) and Pharmako/Gnosis (which addresses psychedelics and shamanic plants).","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bRVOEAAAQBAJ&dq=Pharmako/Poeia:+Plant+Powers,+Poisons,+and+Herbcraft+(Pharmako+Vol+I)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Cambridge Eclipse Photography Guide: How and Where to Observe and Photograph Solar and Lunar Eclipses","description":"An invaluable handbook for observing and photographing the forthcoming solar and lunar eclipses due in the 1990s.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1ZXiEmec9LQC&dq=The+Cambridge+Eclipse+Photography+Guide:+How+and+Where+to+Observe+and+Photograph+Solar+and+Lunar+Eclipses&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Henry George and the reconstruction of capitalism","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KFNrtgEACAAJ&dq=Henry+George+and+the+reconstruction+of+capitalism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Scene of the Crime: A Little Piece of Goodnight","description":"Sardonic, sentimental detective Jack Herriman has moved in with his Uncle Knut, and award-winning crime-scene photographer, in an attempt to rebuild his shattered life and career, putting his checkered past behind him.

She also calls into question those feminist perspectives that have either demonized the modern as inherently patriarchal, or else assumed a simple opposition between men's and women's experiences of the modern world. Combining cultural history with cultural theory, and focusing on the fin de siecle, Felski examines the gendered meanings of such notions as nostalgia, consumption, feminine writing, the popular sublime, evolution, revolution, and perversion. Her approach is comparative and interdisciplinary, covering a wide variety of texts from the English, French, and German traditions: sociological theory, realist and naturalist novels, decadent literature, political essays and speeches, sexological discourse, and sentimental popular fiction. Male and female writers from Simmel, Zola, Sacher-Masoch, and Rachilde to Marie Corelli, Wilde, and Olive Schreiner come under Felski's scrutiny as she exposes the varied and often contradictory connections between femininity and modernity. Seen through the lens of Felski's discerning eye, the last fin de siecle provides illuminating parallels with our own. And Felski's keen analysis of the matrix of modernism offers needed insight into the sense of cultural crisis brought on by postmodernism.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=oknplyJG_V0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Woman's Voice: Sarah Foner, Hebrew Author of the Haskalah","description":"Sarah Foner was the first woman to publish a Hebrew novel.

Drawing on previously unpublished papers, this stunning portrait is a story of love and heartbreak, of devotion and grief, of strength and resilience. NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY THE NEW YORK TIMES ? ESQUIRE ? THE CHICAGO PUBLIC LIBRARY  Victoria the Queen, Julia Baird s exquisitely wrought and meticulously researched biography, brushes the dusty myth off this extraordinary monarch.  The New York Times Book Review (Editor s Choice) When Victoria was born, in 1819, the world was a very different place. Revolution would threaten many of Europe s monarchies in the coming decades. In Britain, a generation of royals had indulged their whims at the public s expense, and republican sentiment was growing. The Industrial Revolution was transforming the landscape, and the British Empire was commanding ever larger tracts of the globe. In a world where women were often powerless, during a century roiling with change, Victoria went on to rule the most powerful country on earth with a decisive hand. Fifth in line to the throne at the time of her birth, Victoria was an ordinary woman thrust into an extraordinary role. As a girl, she defied her mother s meddling and an adviser s bullying, forging an iron will of her own. As a teenage queen, she eagerly grasped the crown and relished the freedom it brought her. At twenty, she fell passionately in love with Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, eventually giving birth to nine children. She loved sex and delighted in power. She was outspoken with her ministers, overstepping conventional boundaries and asserting her opinions. After the death of her adored Albert, she began a controversial, intimate relationship with her servant John Brown. She survived eight assassination attempts over the course of her lifetime. And as science, technology, and democracy were dramatically reshaping the world, Victoria was a symbol of steadfastness and security queen of a quarter of the world s population at the height of the British Empire s reach. Drawing on sources that include fresh revelations about Victoria s relationship with John Brown, Julia Baird brings vividly to life the fascinating story of a woman who struggled with so many of the things we do today: balancing work and family, raising children, navigating marital strife, losing parents, combating anxiety and self-doubt, finding an identity, searching for meaning.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=idgzDwAAQBAJ&dq=Victoria:+An+Intimate+Biography&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Go On Girl!: Works Worth Reading, Chats With Our Favorite Authors, Tips For Starting and Sustaining a Literary Circle, Questions and Topics to Get You Talking...and More!","description":"The founders of the famous Go On Girl! 15 photos.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=d796PQAACAAJ&dq=Go+On+Girl!:+Works+Worth+Reading,+Chats+With+Our+Favorite+Authors,+Tips+For+Starting+and+Sustaining+a+Literary+Circle,+Questions+and+Topics+to+Get+You+Talking...and+More!&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Christmas,1940-1959: A Collector's Guide to Decorations and Customs (Schiffer Book for Collectors)","description":"This in-depth review of Christmas history and traditions in the United States covers a period that many Americans remember well.

In addition, the book is lavishly illustrated with over 400 photos of these popular-culture icons in action, interesting articles and sidebars about themes, trends, weapons, style, and trivia, as well as a complete filmography of more than 150 titles.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AlKW5X7vccgC&dq=The+Modern+Amazons+:+Warrior+Women+on+Screen&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dr. Chase's recipes, or, Information for everybody: An invaluable collection of about eight hundred practical recipes, for merchants, grocers, ... general female debility and irregularities","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ebZBAQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lenya: A Life","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oQ3eNwAACAAJ&dq=Lenya:+A+Life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I'm So Sorry Little Man, I Thought You Were a Hand-Puppet: 250 Cartoons by A.

Do great works of the imagination originate in words or in images? Is there a rational explanation for the sudden appearance of geniuses like Mozart or Einstein? Such questions have fascinated people for centuries; only in recent years, however, has cognitive psychology been able to provide some clues to the mysterious process of creativity. In this revised edition of Notebooks of the Mind, Vera John-Steiner combines imaginative insight with scientific precision to produce a startling account of the human mind working at its highest potential. To approach her subject John-Steiner goes directly to the source, assembling the thoughts of \\"experienced thinkers\\"--artists, philosophers, writers, and scientists able to reflect on their own imaginative patterns. More than fifty interviews (with figures ranging from Jessica Mitford to Aaron Copland), along with excerpts from the diaries, letters, and autobiographies of such gifted giants as Leo Tolstoy, Marie Curie, and Diego Rivera, among others, provide illuminating insights into creative activity. We read, for example, of Darwin's preoccupation with the image of nature as a branched tree while working on his concept of evolution. Mozart testifies to the vital influence on his mature art of the wondrous \\"bag of memories\\" he retained from childhood. Anais Nin describes her sense of words as oppressive, explaining how imagistic free association freed her as a writer. Adding these personal accounts to laboratory studies of thought process, John-Steiner takes a refreshingly holistic approach to the question of creativity. What emerges is an intriguing demonstration of how specific sociocultural circumstances interact with certain personality traits to encourage the creative mind. Among the topics examined here are the importance of childhood mentor figures; the lengthy apprenticeship of the talented person; and the development of self- expression through highly individualistic languages, whether in images, movement or inner speech. Now, with a new introduction, this award-winning book provides an uniquely broad-based study of the origins, development and fruits of human inspiration.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uj1RDAAAQBAJ&dq=Notebooks+of+the+mind:+Explorations+of+thinking&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Liberation Biology: The Scientific and Moral Case for the Biotech Revolution","description":"A positive, optimistic, and convincing case that the biotechnology revolution will improve our lives and the future of our children, while preserving and enhancing the natural environment.The 21st century will undoubtedly witness unprecedented advances in understanding the mechanisms of the human body and in developing biotechnology. With the mapping of the human genome, the pace of discovery is now on the fast track. By the middle of the century, we can expect that the rapid progress in biology and biotechnology will utterly transform human life. What was once the stuff of science fiction may now be within reach in the not-too-distant future: 20-to-40-year leaps in average life spans, enhanced human bodies, drugs and therapies to boost memory and speed up mental processing, and a genetic science that allows parents to ensure that their children will have stronger immune systems, more athletic bodies, and cleverer brains. Even the prospect of human immortality beckons.Such scenarios excite many people and frighten or appall many others. Already biotechnology opponents are organizing political movements aimed at restricting scientific research, banning the development and commercialization of various products and technologies, and limiting citizens' access to the fruits of the biotech revolution.In this forward-looking book Ronald Bailey, science writer for Reason magazine, argues that the coming biotechnology revolution, far from endangering human dignity, will liberate human beings to achieve their full potentials by enabling more of us to live flourishing lives free of disease, disability, and the threat of early death. Bailey covers the full range of the coming biotechnology breakthroughs, from stem-cell research to third-world farming, from brain-enhancing neuropharmaceuticals to designer babies. Against critics of these trends, who forecast the nightmare society of Huxley's Brave New World, Bailey persuasively shows in lucid and well-argued prose that the health, safety, and ethical concerns raised by worried citizens and policymakers are misplaced.Liberation Biology makes a positive, optimistic, and convincing case that the biotechnology revolution will improve our lives and the future of our children, while preserving and enhancing the natural environment.Ronald Bailey (Charlottesville, VA) is the science correspondent for Reason magazine, a former television producer, and the author of Global Warming and Other Eco-Myths and Eco-Scam: The False Prophets of the Apocalypse.

The Warrens are known as the original ghost hunters. Together they've been investigating paranormal activity for over fifty-five years throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico, Scotland, and Europe, to name only a few places. This book is not entirely about exorcism and many of these stories do not conclude with happy endings. Lorraine describes the existence of supernatural forces and how these supernatural events follow a certain pattern. Ed says it s best described as a book that teaches you about the reality of paranormal or supernatural forces rather than citing an easy route to deliverance. The title of the book is a phrase taken from the Lord's Prayer Lead us not into temptation, but Deliver Us from Evil. The case studies chronicled in this book are a kind of universality of evil spirits, how they operate and what they do. The cases in this book are the first published cases taken from the files of Ed Warren, a demonologist, now deceased, and his wife, Lorraine Warren, an active clairvoyant and medium. These paranormal investigations are filled with tragic possessions, ghostly infestations and demonic obsessions. Ed, who is also an exorcist, does not ignore the potential potency of curses, spells, voodoo dolls, cult ceremonies, demon possession or other invading entities, especially for those who have opened themselves up to supernatural infestation. Although rare, some satanic rituals have led to murder or death. From a psychic researcher s point of view, Lorraine points out how spirits move from infestation, the first stage and signs of ghost and/or spirit haunting (knocking, magic whispering and creeping sounds), the mildest state (shadow ghosts and teleportation of objects), to the more dangerous obsession and finally, the last and worse stage, possession. The only difference between obsession and the last stage, possession, is one of degree. Ed describes these experiences in an entirely no-holds-barred way. If you study these stories and these phenomena carefully, you find that one opens the door to infestation, obsession and possession by careless fixation on the occult, playing with the Ouija board and toying with Satanism or black magic. The most dangerous game and archetypical connection is the Ouija board. According to Ed, \\"This object, often regarded as a harmless toy, is the way that ordinary people are often lured into making a dangerous connection to the other world.\\" Of the fourteen cases discussed, five are initiated by contact with an Ouija board. The Warrens have tenaciously pursued their careers as ghost hunters for so many years and witnessed people that have been tragically affected by apparitions, ghost whisperings, brutal and unexplained explosions, strange footsteps in the night, uninvited incursions into the privacy of their bedrooms, including various physical attacks. All cases in this book are prior to 1973. Since the first publication, the Warrens have become known worldwide because of supernatural investigations such as West Point Military Academy, the Amityville Horror murder, the Haunting in Connecticut, the Brookfield Demon Murder, Jack and Janet Smurl, Dudley town, Bill Ramsey the Werewolf, and the Enfield Poltergeist, to name a few. Lorraine appears on A&E's Paranormal State TV series.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rtuZZwEACAAJ&dq=Deliver+Us+from+Evil:+True+Cases+of+Haunted+Houses+and+Demonic+Attacks+(Taken+from+the+Files+of+Ed+and+Lorraine+Warren,+Demonologist+and+Medium)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"National Geographic Traveler China","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=n8_lzQEACAAJ&dq=National+Geographic+Traveler+China&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Monongahela; (Rivers of America)","description":"For centuries, the land at the forks of the Ohio River was known to the Native Americans of western Pennsylvania, but it was not until 1753 that a British officer named George Washington surveyed the area for Gov.

Organized by what we hear teens say--things like I'm bored, You just don't understand, Why are you freaking out?, I hate my life!, or Hold on . . . I just have to send this--this book helps parents develop compassion for their teens and discernment in parenting them as their brains are progressively remodeled. Rather than seeing the teen years as a time to simply hold on for dear life, Dr. Jeramy and Jerusha Clark show that they can be an amazing season of cultivating creativity, self-awareness, and passion for the things that really matter.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=94TLsgEACAAJ&dq=Understanding+Your+Teenager&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tip of the Iceberg","description":"**The National Bestseller** From the acclaimed, bestselling author of Turn Right at Machu Picchu, a fascinating, wild, and wonder-filled journey into Alaska, America's last frontier In 1899, railroad magnate Edward H. Harriman organized a most unusual summer voyage to the wilds of Alaska: He converted a steamship into a luxury \\"floating university,\\" populated by some of America's best and brightest scientists and writers, including the anti-capitalist eco-prophet John Muir. Those aboard encountered a land of immeasurable beauty and impending environmental calamity. More than a hundred years later, Alaska is still America's most sublime wilderness, both the lure that draws one million tourists annually on Inside Passage cruises and as a natural resources larder waiting to be raided. As ever, it remains a magnet for weirdos and dreamers. Armed with Dramamine and an industrial-strength mosquito net, Mark Adams sets out to retrace the 1899 expedition. Traveling town to town by water, Adams ventures three thousand miles north through Wrangell, Juneau, and Glacier Bay, then continues west into the colder and stranger regions of the Aleutians and the Arctic Circle. Along the way, he encounters dozens of unusual characters (and a couple of very hungry bears) and investigates how lessons learned in 1899 might relate to Alaska's current struggles in adapting to the pressures of a changing climate and world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NA83DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"*OP Litany of the Tribes 4 (Werewolf: The Apocalypse)","description":"Werewolf: The Apocalypse is about anger over the loss of what the shapeshifting Garou hold dearest: Gaia, the Earth itself.

Reed, who has witnessed sixty-four of the seventy-seven All-American races, begins by chronicling world events in 1936 as a formal rule book for the Soap Box Derby was introduced, tickets and programs were printed, and the Derby found its home in a new racing facility in Akron, Ohio.

Included is a follow-up history of the winners as well as a chronicling of events of 1937 as a new race began and over one hundred boys anxiously awaited their chance at fame.

Evidence from the best-known Western writers and artists of the post-Civil War period - Owen Wister, Mark Twain, Frederic Remington, George Catlin - as well as now-forgotten writers, illustrators, and photographers, suggest that in the period before the word 'homosexual' and its synonyms were invented, same-sex intimacy and erotic admiration were key aspects of a masculine code. These males-only clubs of journalists, cowboys, miners, Indian vaqueros defined themselves by excluding femininity and the cloying ills of domesticity, while embracing what Roosevelt called 'strenuous living' with other bachelors in the relative 'purity' of wilderness conditions. Queer Cowboys recovers this forgotten culture of exclusively masculine, sometimes erotic, and often intimate camaraderie in fiction, photographs, illustrations, song lyrics, historical ephemera, and theatrical performances.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WuQYDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"StormFront: The Good News of God (Gospel and Our Culture)","description":"Foreword by George R. Hunsberger How does one authentically hear and live out the gospel in North America? This new book attempts to answer this question in a way that reveals much about the nature of Christian faith today and its relation to contemporary culture. In keeping with the aims of the acclaimed Gospel and Our Culture series, StormFront investigates how the gospel intersects American culture and seeks to reorient the church to its full and proper missional vocation. Four authors noted for their understanding of modern church life offer a sober yet hopeful critique of American culture that focuses on consumerism and the privatization of religion, and they challenge the Christian church to embrace its corporate task to be salt and light to the world. Amid the many books on the subject, this one is distinctive in its concern for application. By constrasting contemporary life with a thoroughgoing reading of the biblical narrative, the authors help American Christians discern how our cultural location makes it difficult to live out the transformative message of the gospel. Few readers will fail to be engaged by the lessons offered here.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4h20BgUAAP8C&dq=StormFront:+The+Good+News+of+God+(Gospel+and+Our+Culture)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rhythm And The Blues: A Life in American Music","description":"Atlantic Records partner and producer, Wexler presided over the evolution of the modern music business and made prodigious contributions through to our cultural history.

This study contributes substantially to Victorian studies because it both investigates a largely unrecognized, but culturally significant, tradition of now-obscure women writers like Charlotte Elizabeth Tonna and Frances Trollope, and interrogates the gender politics of literary production and reception by looking at how this sentimentalist tradition affected the work and reception of canonical male and female writers.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZjRaAAAAMAAJ&dq=Preaching+Pity+(Studies+in+Nineteenth-Century+British+Literature)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pulp Fictioneers","description":"This collection is the result of combing through hundreds of issues of writing journals from the pulp era, mostly Writer's Digest and Author & Journalist, but also a variety of lesser-known magazines: The Writer, The Editor, Writer's Review, and two magazines issued by correspondence schools, Writers' Markets and Methods and Writer's Monthly.

Although much has been written on this subject, major questions remain. Most of the available literature describes either the electrochemical behavior of neurons or the psychological behavior of the mind. Much is known at both extremes, but how are they connected? How do neurons actually represent, manipulate, and store data? How does electrochemical behavior become psychological behavior? In this book, the author develops a practical computing paradigm that is based on a new information systems theory of the brain. The pulse rates from a group of N neurons form a time-varying point in a unit N-cube. Such points, or correlithm objects, tend strongly to be about the same distance apart, making them useful as robust data tokens. Mappings among these tokens lead to general-purpose computational resources. Behaviors emerge from systems built with these principles that are much more like those found in living creatures than conventional computers. The book is written for a wide audience. The non-technical reader will find enlightening overviews, yet there is enough detail in the chapters to actually build working systems. Correlithm object technology has vast implications. We believe this is, in fact, how the brain works. Systems built with this technology will certainly excel at any task where living creatures-including humans-do better than today's computers. Almost every aspect of our world must now be re-examined in light of correlithm object technology, because it redefines what machines can and cannot do well, and it promises a flood of new ideas, new inventions, new applications, new commercial opportunities, and new directions. Correlithm object technology isthe most \\"disruptive technology\\" of our time, and is destined to cause revolutionary and far-reaching changes.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KUK5AAAACAAJ&dq=Correlithm+Object+Technology&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Elvenbane","description":"Born in the desert to an exiled concubine and raised by dragons, Shana becomes a wizard of extraordinary power and leads a rebellion against the cruel elven empire ruled by her father.

It has also been undermined by accusations of paternalism and past failures to engage with the very people it is intended to help. This unique book is the first to critique the past, present and future welfare state from a participatory perspective. Peter Beresford, champion of user involvement, draws on pioneering theories and practice of welfare service user movements to offer a blueprint for a new participatory social policy. He controversially challenges orthodox social policy and the limitations of both Fabian and Neo-liberal perspectives in engaging people to improve their own welfare, drawing on service users   own ideas and experience, including fascinating vignettes from his own family s experience, to demonstrate the value of  user knowledge . Filling a much-needed gap in the literature, this accessible text will provide a great introduction for students and a road-map for practitioners of an alternative vision for a future participatory and sustainable social policy.

Based on remarkably candid interviews with nearly one hundred German Jews, Lynn Rapaport's book reveals a rare understanding of how the memory of the Holocaust shapes Jews' everyday lives. As their views of non-Jewish Germans and of themselves, their political integration into German society, and their friendships and relationships with Germans are subtly uncovered, the obstacles to readjustment when sociocultural memory is still present are better understood. This is also a book about Jewish identity in the midst of modernity. It shows how the boundaries of ethnicity are not marked by how religious Jews are, or their absorption of traditional culture, but by the moral distinctions rooted in Holocaust memory that Jews draw between themselves and other Germans.

Or at least that s what he s supposed to be doing. Ever the storyteller, Casanova instead dedicates himself to his own writing, for which the young servant Laura Brock serves as an endlessly fascinated audience. He recounts to her his greatest escapades from romances in a Venetian convent to the seduction of an entire harem to the triumphant amassing (and subsequent loss) of a fortune in Paris. Enlivened by the French Revolution and the liberating ideas of the Enlightenment, Casanova s latest exploits prove he still possesses an intellectual vigor and insatiable curiosity. Even old age can t keep this legendary libertine who corresponded with Voltaire, discussed flight with Benjamin Franklin, and whose life and writings inspired artists as diverse as Mozart, Flaubert, Stendhal, and Hesse from causing trouble. Rich with eighteenth-century European social, political, and religious history, Casanova in Bohemia is an energetic and erotic portrait of Western literature s most beloved lothario, whose hedonism was matched by his creativity and wit.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bLDBCQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ants: Their Structure, Development and Behavior","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Zx6Ydd8SQKEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hellish Nell","description":"On March 23, 1944, as the allied forces prepared for D-Day, Britain's most famous psychic, Helen Duncan- Nell  to her family-stood in the dock of Britain's highest criminal court accused of...witchcraft.

Rather, he maintains, both the Saints and their enemies affirmed republican principles, but in radically different ways. Winn identifies the 1830 founding of the Mormon church as a religious protest against the pervasive disorder plaguing antebellum America, attracting people who saw the libertarianism, religious pluralism, and market capitalism of Jacksonian America as threats to the Republic. While non-Mormons shared the perception that the Union was in danger, many saw the Mormons as one of the chief threats. General fear of Joseph Smith and his followers led to verbal and physical attacks on the Saints, which reinforced the Mormons' conviction that America had descended into anarchy. By 1846, violent opposition had driven Mormons to the uninhabited Great Salt Lake Basin.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dkTqCQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Upheaval from the Abyss: Ocean Floor Mapping and the Earth Science Revolution","description":"Not some eldrich Lovecrafted monster or high-tech Hollywood virtual creation, nor even de-hibernating earth itself has made the most impact when it rose from the ocean depths, says Lawrence, a freelance journalist with a background in biology and geology.
